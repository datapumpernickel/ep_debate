<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Baltas (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, as you know, on 21 February 2003 Croatia filed an application to accede to the European Union with all the formalities and responsibility required for such action. The Commission will express its opinion on this application by the end of April. The European Parliament, via my report, prepared a proposal for a recommendation to the Council on the application by Croatia for accession in accordance with Rule 49, paragraph 1 of the Rules of Procedure, which was endorsed by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. This report required particular attention in order to be balanced and adequately substantiated, so that the initiative of the European Parliament for a recommendation to the Council would be duly considered by it and would represent the views and demands of all sides in an exemplary manner. I thank my honourable friends for their help in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">In brief, the main points of this report, to which Croatia must give due attention, are the following: first, the International Criminal Court for the Former Yugoslavia. Note is taken of the progress made towards cooperation with this international court, as well as of the remaining matters outstanding, especially now that General Gotovina has been handed over to the Court.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the return of refugees and displaced persons. Parliament attaches great importance to the honouring of this promise, which it considers to be one of the basic criteria for the accession of Croatia to the European Union. It notes with satisfaction the election of minority representatives to parliament, but expects more to be done to safeguard all the preconditions for the return of refugees and displaced persons, such as legal protection, housing, reconciliation and their smooth integration into Croatian society, without discrimination or fear.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, good neighbourly relations and regional cooperation. Good neighbourly relations and regional cooperation are on the right path and the report emphasises that this is a key precondition for the development of democracy in Croatia itself, as well as an example for the safeguarding of peace, stability and economic development in the area as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the judicial system and administrative infrastructure. Note is made of the reforms and adjustments to the judicial system in accordance with that which prevails in the European Union, but exemplary application and incontestable social acceptance are expected in the interpretation of the laws, as well as in raising the authority of judges. Similarly, a modern administrative infrastructure is one <span class="italic">sine qua non </span>for the correct management of Community resources, while particular attention is expected in combating any cases of corruption and in quickly serving citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, the tripartite dialogue between Croatia, Italy and Slovenia must continue in the good spirit which surrounds it today so that all the differences and outstanding issues can be settled.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly, freedom of expression and independence of the mass media. Freedom of expression and the independence of the mass media are the basic precondition to the operation of democracy and no interference in the freedom of expression in the form of state intervention is justified.</p>
<p class="contents">Seventhly, free market economy. The progress made by Croatia with the operation of the free market is recognised and note is made of the achievements of Croatia, both in the year on year increase in gross national product over recent years and in the reduction in the level of inflation, which is close to the European Union average.</p>
<p class="contents">Eighthly, new government and European orientation. The determination of the new government to continue the efforts of the previous government in following a European orientation is considered positive and the willingness of the new government to promote all the necessary reforms so that Croatia can advance quickly towards the objective of integration into the European Union, which it too wants, is particularly appreciated.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on this House to vote in favour of this report and the amendment proposed by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, which I endorse.</p>

We have analysed it with great attention and interest, and I am glad of the opportunity here to make a few initial comments.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Baltas makes an assessment of important political and economic issues such as minority rights, refugee returns, cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, reform of the judiciary, freedom of the media, regional cooperation, economic and structural reforms – issues that are at the top of the our agenda at every meeting with the Croatian authorities. Although the report is destined for the Council, the Commission has taken a particular interest in it and would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Baltas and the European Parliament for this interesting assessment of Croatia.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage the Commission is still preparing its 'Opinion on Croatia’s membership application', which we hope to adopt in the coming weeks. The Opinion on Croatia’s application is based on more than 10 000 pages of information provided by the Croatian Government. We are using exactly the same criteria to evaluate this application as we did with all previous applicants. As in all other cases, political criteria will play a key role in this context, and Croatia must meet them before negotiations can start.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, today the Commission is not in a position to comment in detail on all the subjects mentioned in the Baltas report. Parliament will receive a copy of the Commission’s Opinion when it has been adopted, it will contain our analysis of whether Croatia meets the Copenhagen Criteria and our recommendation to the Council on whether or not membership negotiations should be opened.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is a community based on a set of shared values. A country must show that it adheres to them before it can start membership negotiations. Therefore, the assessment in the Commission’s Opinion will focus on whether Croatia respects these values of democracy, respect for the rule of law, human rights and the rights of minorities, which make up the political criteria for EU membership.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission fully acknowledges the progress made by Croatia in the last few years. The political situation is stable, and democratic achievements have been consolidated. Regional cooperation has been strengthened. The economic situation is improving; growth prospects are good and, more generally, the economic outlook remains positive. Croatia has already started to work intensively in order to align its legislation with European law.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, a number of important questions remain to be carefully assessed and are currently very closely monitored by the Commission: questions such as cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, refugee returns, respect for minority rights, judicial reform and regional cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Croatia’s prospects for membership are clear, as they are for all the countries of south-eastern Europe. However, it needs to meet the Copenhagen criteria. Provided it does that clearly and unequivocally, it can expect to progress further towards eventual membership of the European family. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should remember that Croatia could have been joining with Slovenia on 1 May were it not for the terrible years of war that it, and its neighbour Bosnia-Herzegovina endured, and the four years of Serbian occupation of one third of its territory, which resulted in the independent young democracy taking many wrong turns. In the last five years, Croatia has made a clear decision for Europe and created the conditions for joining. I can tell the Commissioner that it has good relations with its neighbours and regional cooperation is working. The modernisation of its economy is under way and the economic data give cause for optimism. I agree with you that judicial reform is lagging behind. Administrative capacities could also be improved. Everything cannot be done in a day, however. Croatia is on the right road and is determined to pursue that road single-mindedly. The new government’s objectives include the return of refugees and/or the return of property. This year has already seen these ambitious objectives embodied in an agreement between the government and the Serb minority.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be nice if the European Union could at last prevail upon the Republika Srpska in Bosnia-Herzegovina to take back Croatian refugees from Croatia. That would make housing available for the Serbs who want to return. The lack of employment opportunities, especially in the parts of Croatia where the Serbs used to live, is a major obstacle to their return and I hope that the CARDS programme will be able to assist here, too.</p>
<p class="contents">Croatia is cooperating well with The Hague, to which, last year, the Croatian Government even opened its archives. Last year, too, three Croats accused of war crimes were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment in Croatia itself. Three weeks ago, two re-indicted generals went to The Hague voluntarily. Europe should not judge Croatia’s cooperation with the International Court only by the case of Ante Gotovina, who is a member of the French foreign legion, is said to have a French passport, and may be lying in the sun in Cannes or Corsica, or may well be anywhere. He is not in Croatia, otherwise he would already have been captured. To hold Croatia hostage to the Gotovina case is unjust and fails to do justice to the progress it has undeniably made.</p>
<p class="contents">The Baltas report also mentions the problems concerning the border between Croatia and Slovenia. I believe these problems are close to being resolved. I would just like to make one comment about the unilateral announcement of the fisheries protection zone in the Adriatic. That was foolish. It was perfectly legal, but I think the new government is right in now seeking to put it on a sounder footing in regional cooperation with Slovenia and Italy. The Commission’s treatment and assessment of Croatia’s progress will send a signal to the entire region. Every politician I have met in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Serbia is keenly awaiting the outcome. They will then be able to see whether the tremendous efforts we are demanding of them for their nations will be really worthwhile. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Both the country from which I come and this group to which I belong are very well disposed towards Croatia, but that does not mean that we turn a blind eye, or even two blind eyes, when it comes to assessing whether it is ready for Europe. I only wish the Commission would see how important it is for Croatia that we should give a positive opinion; I agree with the previous speaker totally in that respect. It would also send a signal to all its neighbours that the way to Europe is open to them as well as and when – and provided that – they take the necessary steps towards Europe. Sadly, no country in the Balkans has done so much.</p>
<p class="contents">Are the problems already resolved? No, they are not. Although Croatia has basically good relations with its neighbours, I believe there are still a few problems to be resolved with Slovenia. I am very pleased that there are not only good relations with neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina, but that both the previous government and the present one have demonstrated that Croatia is now interested in a common Bosnia-Herzegovina and not only in the well-being of the Croatian-speaking population there.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the situation with the war criminals is concerned, I believe that Croatia has done a lot in the last few years and months to make progress here. I believe we must be fair and objective about this, too. I sometimes feel that many countries that have themselves taken longer to come to terms with their own past and their own crimes and to face up to them are making greater demands on Croatia. Croatia needs to know that this is a crucial issue, however, and it must therefore show every willingness to cooperate.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the return of refugees, this has always been a very important point for us in talks with Croatian representatives and here in the European Parliament. I think Croatia needs to intensify its efforts to bring back all refugees, and this of course includes exchanges with neighbouring countries. With these things in mind, Mr President, I believe we should give a favourable reception to the Baltas report. Also with this in mind, I ask the Commission to be very positive in its approach to Croatia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will also point the way to accession for other countries in the western Balkan region. Macedonia has already submitted its application. The ELDR Group supports Croatia in its efforts to prepare for accession to the EU and to succeed in the accession negotiations. At the same time we would state that we require better levels of cooperation from Croatia with the Hague Court than hitherto.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group is asking for a separate vote on paragraph 1(q), which urges Member States to ratify the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the EU and Croatia. Some Member States have postponed ratification precisely because they have been dissatisfied with Croatia’s levels of cooperation with the Hague Court. Our group thinks they should be able to consider when the agreement should be ratified themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Croatia’s accession will once again be a new step in the enlargement of the European Union. When Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey and the five countries in the western Balkan region join the Union, the number of Member States will rise to 33. Moldova and Ukraine have also taken their first step towards accession, and they have been invited to the European conference. Enlargement works on the principle that all European countries that fulfil the conditions for accession can join the Union. As enlargement progresses the EU’s Wider Europe Policy and Neighbourhood Policy will become ever more important. The European Parliament must also get more involved in these than it has up till now. On the other hand, a rapidly enlarging Union must differentiate internally, employing a process of closer cooperation. Internal differentiation and the Wider Europe Policy will gradually allow us to create a Europe of concentric circles. Finally, I would like to thank my colleague Alexandros Baltas for his excellent work in drafting this report.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Belder (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL) </span>Mr President, Mr Baltas has made a very balanced recommendation to the Council with regard to Croatia's application for accession to the EU. It names quite categorically the main areas of persistent concern from the point of view of the EU, which are good neighbourliness, the refugee issue and cooperation with the International Yugoslavia Tribunal. In addition, the rapporteur has not lost sight of Zagreb's major difficulties with these objectives and its efforts towards achieving them. He quite rightly mentions the indispensable contribution of Croatia's neighbouring countries to a climate of mutual trust and security in the region, something that Mrs Pack also pointed out. In summary, Mr Baltas' report is, in my view, 'terribly' good, and I use the word 'terribly' for a reason that you will understand.</p>
<p class="contents">All the more interesting were for me the rather critical reactions to the draft recommendation by a number of Croatian academic participants. Across the board, their comment was that 'the European Union is on each occasion asking a great deal from us, but what exactly does the average Croatian citizen stand to gain?' There is no shortage of daily concerns for them – I would mention employment, education, health care and housing – but these are not addressed in Mr Baltas’ report, thorough though it otherwise is. Not for nothing does he ask the Council, in paragraph 1, point(s), for greater assistance for Croatia in its persisting difficulties on the road to Europe. This request is given an added twist by a surprising result of a poll in Croatia this week. No less than 82% of the interviewees are opposed to Croatia’s eventual accession to the European Union. Let us hope that this is only a snapshot in time, and one that will soon fade away.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, Prime Minister Sanader's pro-European course is under pressure, so what he needs is actual back-up from Brussels. On the other hand, Zagreb is clearly keen on integration into the Euro-Atlantic community. It is therefore up to the European institutions to offer Croatia a close transatlantic relationship. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can only agree with what Mrs Pack has said and confirm the great efforts Croatia is making to come closer to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I have followed developments in Croatia since 1995, first as a delegation chairman and then as chairman of the EU-Slovenia Joint Parliamentary Committee, and have found that steadily increasing efforts have been made in the right direction. Of course, things moved very hesitantly and with great difficulty in the early stages, but eventually they gained momentum. The new government under Ivo Sanader has really advanced by leaps and bounds, especially in policy towards minorities and the coexistence of ethnic groups. I say that as a representative of a minority. The approach taken by the new government, and by the prime minister in particular, calls for our utmost admiration. It could be considered an example for other countries wishing to join the EU and be held up as exemplary in terms of a new intake and new opening between majority populations and minorities of any kind.</p>
<p class="contents">Positive considerations have also prevailed as a result of international arbitration in the border disputes or differences of opinion over the border in the Piran Bay. I believe that is the right way when both states have legitimate interests and this question need not therefore be a stumbling block any longer. I would therefore like to thank Mr Baltas for this good report and I hope that the Commission will do what it can to get negotiations started. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation has calmed down considerably in recent times, which is very important in that region. On his visit to Belgrade, President Mesic apologised to those who had suffered pain or damage at the hands of Croatian citizens. The Serbian President apologised in turn for the evil deeds committed by Serbian citizens against Croatians.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be easier to achieve reconciliation now that these gestures have been made, even though only a few years have passed since their very bitter, hard-fought war. The Prime Minister, Dr Sanader, visited the Serbian minority during their Christmas holiday and then addressed the Italian minority in Italian: none of this would have been possible a few years ago. Even that characteristic bitterness towards Slovenia no longer exists. This is the context that will help to resolve the controversy surrounding arrest warrants and the return of refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">If this, then, is the context, there is also a chance of reasoning with Croatia about its unilateral decision to declare part of its coastline an ecological and biological zone. In his report, Mr Baltas states that this unilateral decision by Croatia runs counter to the practice of dialogue and consultation, which is at the heart of efforts to manage problems which have a regional impact.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, of course, there are Zagreb’s difficulties in implementing its economic and political reforms. We should recall that inflation between 2000 and 2002 fell from 7.4% to 2.3%, and we know what that means. Nevertheless, a scale published by the <span class="italic">Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</span>, measuring the results achieved by the candidate countries joining this year and in coming years, shows that the first candidate countries joining the European Union in May get an overall score of 80%, whereas Croatia is only at 50%. It still has a long way to go.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe there is a danger, which was mentioned a little while ago, of seeing people get disappointed. They may be disappointed because Croatia is not joining the Union straight away, but Mr Baltas reminds us that Croatia will need much perseverance and time before it can acquire the means necessary to consolidate the rule of law and democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
