<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bill Newton Dunn (ALDE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span><span class="bold">. –</span> Madam President, I am sorry to tell you this is going to be a tale of woe, of unhappiness and of problems for Europe, because organised crime is growing in every field, it is hidden and we do not have a full picture. It is based in states outside the EU, mostly, where government is weak and therefore there is very little action to stop the gangs and the criminals who are working in an organised way.</p>
<p class="contents">I am referring to drugs like heroin and cocaine, which are brought in from different parts of the world; to ecstasy, which is exported from Europe to different parts of the world; to illegal immigrants, who are brought in from Asia and Africa without proper controls; to counterfeit goods of every imaginable kind, some just simple toys or music CDs but also some things like medicines, which are deeply serious and life-threatening; and to crime on the internet – the theft of money and identity. In every area, crime is growing and in every area we each have, maybe, some small experience.</p>
<p class="contents">Every industry is aware of the problems in its own sector, but it keeps the statistics hidden because it does not want to damage public confidence. If a bag manufacturer says, ‘Be careful about buying my beautiful leather bag because it may be a fake from the Far East or elsewhere,’ they damage their prospects. So, nobody tells the public what is really going on.</p>
<p class="contents">Some organised gangs are ethnic families working very well in a tightly-knit way; some are now organised like very efficient, very big multinational corporations – this week I was even given an organisational chart for an organised criminal gang! They cross the borders inside our Union with total ease and without any difficulty at all. Here is the problem: our police cannot cross any borders. So, the criminals are going wherever they like, doing whatever they do, but our police are restricted to their own regions or their own Member States and therefore are deeply handicapped and cannot fight the criminals on equal terms. What do individual police officers do if there is a problem across the border? Do they go to a central point and get contact details from the telephone directory? There is no directory. There is no facility for a police officer in any one country to find a telephone number or an e-mail address for an appropriate contact in another Member State. It is unbelievable – a total lack of cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason for this is the lack of mutual trust and understanding, meaning that, traditionally, we do not want to give foreigners our information or reveal the source of our information, because that would give away too many secrets. We do not trust each other inside Europe. The gangs trust each other beautifully and so they are winning hands down.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not all woe. The Americans, with their open borders between states, found exactly the same problem in the 1930s. You probably saw the film <span class="italic">Bonnie and Clyde</span>. They robbed banks, took the money across a state border and the police could not follow them. The Americans invented the FBI with powers to cross borders, and I suspect that is the stage we have now reached in Europe. We need a law enforcement agency that can pursue criminals across frontiers. The public will be very sceptical; the national leaders say nothing about it, but I think we have reached that point and we have to do something about it.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, however, on this side of the Atlantic, in the European Union, there are no statistics to tell the public the scale of the problem. Each of the 27 Member States collects statistics in its own different way. There are no comparative EU statistics, so we hope that the Commission is working in that direction to start that happening in a few years’ time. We have no idea, no clear picture, no information for the public, no democratic control, because this comes under the third pillar and is therefore controlled by the national governments, who do very little because they do not feel any pressure from the public to take any action.</p>
<p class="contents">The only way that we will get a change, I fear, is if there is a dramatic shock, something like 9/11 in Europe. Something so bad that the public says, ‘How was this allowed to happen? How did the criminal gangs get away with this for so long when there was so much inactivity in 27 national capitals?’ But, if the criminals are smart – and they are very smart – they will never come up above the horizon. They will never commit a 9/11 and they will just go on eating into our society, feeding off us, weakening us, taking away jobs and, basically, weakening the whole Union. We really need action, and I hope Parliament will support this report and push the ministers into taking some decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that it is clear to everyone how important it is to develop all means at our disposal to combat organised crime, and nobody, I believe, can have any doubts on the matter. I will restrict myself to giving some brief information on some recent progress made by the European Union in this field and some initiatives that the European Commission will launch very soon.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, on the subject of improving knowledge of the phenomenon of organised crime, I am in especial agreement with the rapporteur. We do not have a precise framework of knowledge on the dimensions of this criminal phenomenon and the movements of organised crime. In this sphere, the development of Europol’s activities is particularly valuable. As you know, starting this year, 2007, Europol will publish and has proposed to supplement its traditional informative report on the state of crime in Europe with an annual threat assessment. The Europol report will thus be a proactive report, not just an informative one; that is, it will indicate, year by year, the sectors in which the threat of organised crime has grown and, as we hope, also those in which the threat has diminished. Unfortunately, we are seeing a growing increase in all the main spheres of organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important result, which the rapporteur referred to just now, is European activity in the field of crime statistics. Up until now we have not had a statistical framework. You will remember that in a communication adopted last year I proposed a Europe-wide system of crime statistics. We have already put together a group of experts, and I can say with satisfaction that Eurostat has already brought out the first publication of statistical data on offences across Europe. We are beginning to produce concrete results.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of prevention, which is extremely important, we have decided to concentrate, for example, on the fight against corruption, which is often linked to organised crime networks. We have decided to set up a European network of national experts permanently linked together, precisely with a view to preventing corruption. I have decided to include in next year’s programme <span class="bold"> </span>the 2008 programme <span class="bold"></span> an initiative that will explore the links between corruption, money-laundering and thus organised crime networks. This is a sector on which Europe must work harder.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, there is a major action with regard to trafficking in human beings; there is an action plan, which has already been adopted and which is in the process of being developed and implemented in practice. Besides, as you probably know, one of the measures we have promoted is an annual European day against trafficking in human beings, which will be a concrete signal of development, a realisation on a European scale that until now was inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also decided to concentrate on witness protection, which is a vital element when it comes to combating organised crime. I will make available to this Parliament a working document with some concrete proposals by the end of July this year, that is, within the next two months. This working document will be the outcome of an analysis that we carried out with the police and the legal authorities of the Member States on how witnesses should be protected in the fight against organised crime, because, if witnesses are not protected, a fundamental element for combating organised crime fails.</p>
<p class="contents">On police cooperation and judicial cooperation, coordination should be stepped up, above all between Europol and Eurojust. Admittedly, a multidisciplinary approach is vital, and we have done a lot for Europol. I have proposed new rules of procedure for Europol so as to increase its powers, extend its mandate and give it more flexibility; organised crime is unfortunately very adaptable, and thus Europol must also be much more flexible. I hope that, in the case of Europol, the Council will accept our proposal for Community funding. This would have an immediate advantage, that of the European Parliament’s having democratic control of the use of Europol’s budget, which will thus be subject in what I would call a more transparent manner to a democratic parliamentary control authority.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Council still has some reservations about accepting this proposal of mine. On the operational front, Europol is getting stronger. Where is the weak point? The weak point is that the Member States are not forwarding to Europol the necessary amount of operational information that Europol needs in order to coordinate its activities. You probably know that 70% of the data in Europol’s central computer system comes from only five Member States, and the remaining 30% from all the others. This demonstrates what Europol’s potential could be if all the Member States contributed better. This is something that they will now have to do because all three Europol protocols have entered into force and thus cooperation will be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">For Eurojust too, we need to do more. I will certainly put forward a proposal on Eurojust this autumn, I believe in October or November, and this will be a proposal to strengthen Eurojust’s powers of initiative. The point that will be at the heart of my initiative will be the involvement of Eurojust – I would say involvement on a normal and systematic basis – with joint investigation teams. These joint investigation teams are a basic tool for combating crime, and Eurojust is being called on to participate in the joint investigation teams in a way that is insufficient, non-systematic and sometimes incidental. This is no good. Eurojust must be a regular participant in the joint investigation teams, in order to increase their capabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, all this activity that we are carrying out must always achieve a balance between security requirements, which are, as I am personally convinced, a fundamental right of citizens. Citizens have a right to security, but alongside security there are other rights, which are also fundamental rights, and therefore I believe that the issue of data protection in the field of police cooperation – an issue which has not yet received a positive response from the Council, despite my proposal of a year and a half ago – should finally receive a systematic response, namely a European legislative initiative on data protection in the so-called third pillar. This will also act to give citizens a tangible sign that, alongside taking strong action against organised crime, we strongly respect other fundamental rights such as the right to handling of personal data.</p>
<p class="contents">In all these spheres, I hope that the Council will decide in June to incorporate the provisions of the Prüm Treaty into European legislation, that is, I hope that instead of being, as it is today, mere enhanced cooperation between a few Member States, it will become a provision that is an integral part of Community legislation. If the Council, as I hope it will, lets this proposal pass, we will have taken a step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to point out two issues. Firstly, the implementation in practice of the new Agency for Fundamental Rights, which was set up in March. The Agency will be an important tool in ensuring that fundamental rights are respected, including at the request of Parliament or the Commission, with regard to cooperation and investigative police activities.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the major issue of combating organised cybercrime. As you know, yesterday I presented a communication on cyber crime, which deals with various sectors of organised computer crime, from paedophilia to computerised attacks on banking systems. I believe that computer crime is one of the new frontiers on which this Parliament will clearly be able to work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This report is certainly an important sign of the political will to energetically combat the phenomenon of organised crime, which is unfortunately increasingly widespread. This form of crime has been able, despite our efforts, to develop a criminal network across national borders. Currently we have not been successful in providing police services equipped with the necessary tools to combat it.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore give a strong, authoritative and credible response, by strengthening all the cooperation instruments, as the Commissioner was saying, from awareness of the criminal phenomenon to the collection of statistical data, from the improvement and simplification of information exchange to the honing of investigation methods and the increased coordination of investigative and punitive operations.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally believe that the creation of more rigorous, Europe-wide collaboration and contact instruments, such as Europol will be able to be, is the key to enhancing trust between the Member States, creating the necessary synergies between national police authorities and launching a true European policy in this field. In recent years, associations of a criminal type have increasingly assumed the actual form of companies, and they find on the economic and financial markets a perfect place for laundering illicit proceeds; the damage that ensues for national economies and the Community economy can be easily imagined. We must also combat organised crime on the economic front and systematically attack financial resources, fixed and movable assets that have been legitimately acquired. For one thing, depriving crime of its resources means damaging the relations and links between them and terrorist organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">I also hope <span class="bold">– </span>and I note the Commissioner’s communication <span class="bold">–</span> that the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and the two protocols on trafficking in persons and immigrant trafficking will be ratified swiftly and, above all, applied.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that, on the basis of this information, concrete proposals will soon arrive from the Commission, and I take note of this with great pleasure this evening. I wish Mr Frattini the best in his work; he has shown that he is not only aware of these issues but that he has implemented in practice some initiatives that he has outlined this evening. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a co-rapporteur, I too consider it extremely important for the Union to be able to contribute to improving the day-to-day security of its citizens, and that it strengthen its efforts to prevent corruption in politics and public administration. </p>
<p class="contents">We, the socialist members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs are urging progress and implementation primarily by raising a few issues in connection with the report. We need to strengthen the cooperation between the police and judicial bodies of the Member States, in particular because in a Europe with no internal borders, crime, especially organised crime, can only grow in the absence of effective cooperation among these bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we need step by step to strengthen the independence and scope of EUROPOL and EUROJUST, in order to provide a European-level law enforcement and judicial body that can deal with crime with a comprehensive approach above the Member States, thereby providing incentives to domestic bodies to perform careful and corruption-free work. Member States must be urged to support and finance the competent authorities as well as training and cooperative programmes for the sake of better and more effective cooperation on cases involving organised crime. </p>
<p class="contents">We think that the witness protection programme can only be developed further at the European level, since the majority of countries in themselves are not able to hide citizens testifying against organised crime within their own territory, and must ensure that they receive the protection due them. One of the most important tasks is for us suitably to inform concerned European citizens of the steps being taken at the European level, and of the successes of our cooperation, and in this way to emphasise the usefulness of European cooperation in the area of communications as well.</p>
<p class="contents">And now for a few thorns that remain in my flesh. In my proposals for amendment submitted to the committee, I tried to draw attention to the fact that Member States have extremely diverse histories, and their citizens have experienced very different types of socialisation. In some Member States, certain concepts in criminal law have an entirely different significance than in others. For it can happen that in one Member State something falls under serious moral condemnation, while in another it is a matter of civil virtue. A Hungarian political scientist has said that a country is corrupt where it does not even occur to a citizen to purchase a train ticket when he gets on a train. And we do not ask ourselves where they purchase train tickets.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also my conviction that there will be certain policies in the geopolitical and economic area which will become the targets of organised crime, and if we do not pay careful attention and do not take steps on behalf of national security, we will find ourselves in danger.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that our disagreement was not based on principles, but only on linguistic misunderstandings, and that support for this report will be based on an agreement on the principles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to make this report and the level of debate associated with it even more practically useful and perhaps more controversial, I would like to take the opportunity, to address one issue which, although dealt with in the report and referred to by the Commissioner, in my view needs to be further elaborated upon.</p>
<p class="contents">I refer to the issue of money laundering. Money laundering constitutes the oxygen supply to organised crime. Legitimising crime profits is essential for crime barons to survive and expand their illegal activities. I question whether the EU, despite its frequent criticism of money laundering, is in fact doing very much to combat it.</p>
<p class="contents">My thesis is demonstrated by the following example. A vast amount of money laundering is taking place through institutions based and functioning in areas such as the Channel Islands, in particular Guernsey and Jersey. These islands have a rather peculiar status as regards their relation to the EU. The British Government, although fully aware of the money laundering problem associated with these islands, conveniently turns a blind eye to such activities under the pretext that these areas enjoy a certain degree of autonomy from British sovereignty. The same applies to institutions based on other British overseas territories or British Crown dependencies. Such territories are the Isle of Man and the British Virgin Islands. I note that in 2000 KPMG reported that the British Virgin Islands had 41% of the world’s tax-haven-seeking offshore companies.</p>
<p class="contents">I call upon the Commission to make a statement in relation to the aforementioned money laundering activities in British-related territories and to declare before us what action it intends to take, in particular with regard to the British Government, in order to halt the money laundering legitimacy cover-up currently afforded to the areas I have mentioned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It was on this very day, 15 years ago, that an extremely serious event took place in the history of Italy, and the history of Europe: Giovanni Falcone, the high-level judge, was assassinated by the mafia in a horrific manner, when they blew up the section of the motorway between the airport and the city of Palermo. His wife and three other agents in the escort died together with him. That year, 1992, was a terrible year, because after Falcone, another judge – Paolo Borsellino – was assassinated by organised crime, specifically the mafia.</p>
<p class="contents">Both of them had realised how important it was to conduct legal and police cooperation at international level and thus they had gathered how necessary it was to combat criminal organisations at a higher level – at an international level – focusing above all on intercepting the capital of criminal and mafia organisations. Falcone and Borsellino were the umpteenth victims in a series of slaughters in the Italian Republic that began with the massacre at Portella della Ginestra on 1 May 1947.</p>
<p class="contents">So many things have changed over the years; criminal organisations have become transnational, and this change had already occurred by the end of the 1980s, when the liberalist dogma was confirmed in the policy of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The globalisation of the economy and of finance has occurred through the deregulation of the financial and trade markets, the privatisation of services and the reinforcement of tax havens.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen confirmation of what an authoritative research body, the Transnational Institute of Amsterdam, has called ‘the Global Fix’, that is, a global compromise between the theoretically legal economy and the criminal economy. This is international trafficking in arms and drugs and money-laundering. In certain ways there has been confirmation of the tendency of liberalist globalisation to encourage crime.</p>
<p class="contents">If we analyse the studies by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, we can see that, since the 1980s, the underground economy has quadrupled. In 2001 black-market transactions ranged between USD 6 500 and 9 000 billion a year, that is, between 20% and 25% of the world’s gross domestic product. We are talking about a horrifying figure that could help to overcome poverty on a worldwide scale.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context some important phenomena have arisen. Most important of all is the fall of the Soviet Union, which resulted in the transfer of many State assets into cash and directly to cartels and criminal organisations. It is no coincidence that, today, the Russian mafia is very strong, in both economic and political terms. Much of this money transited via numerous accounts in Switzerland, the Cayman Isles, the islands to which Mr Matsakis referred, and Gibraltar.</p>
<p class="contents">The other major trend that was confirmed in the 1990s was the push by the US and the UK to deregulate the financial and international markets. The globalisation of the financial markets itself contains the seeds of the reorganisation of criminal forces.</p>
<p class="contents">The other great event that increased the income of organised crime was the return of war. The war and the way in which it is intertwined with liberalist globalisation has led to a frightening increase in revenue for international mafia groups, including in particular an increase in profits from drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Andes region in Colombia, the ‘War on Drugs’ philosophy has given rise to an exponential growth in the production of coca and the processing of coca plants into cocaine. The war in the Balkans has turned that region into an off-limits area where money is laundered and heroin is refined for the European market. Think about what happened in Afghanistan! In 2001, before the military occupation, opium production was 74 tonnes per year. In 2006 – and my source is the US Department of State – opium production had risen above 6 000 tonnes, and this growth is closely linked to the military occupation. Today Afghanistan produces 93% of the total world output of opium.</p>
<p class="contents">How much is drug production worth today on the global market? The UN, which is unfortunately not very credible on this subject, says that 1% of the world’s GDP is derived from drug trafficking; the US Department of State says that it is 2.5%, and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs says that between 2% and 5% of the world’s GDP is based on international trafficking in narcotics. This is just one piece of information, because to this should be added trafficking in human beings, arms, waste, counterfeiting of products, and all these profits are immediately laundered and injected into the legal market.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to take action on capital, assets and financial transactions, and that is why we believe that the confiscation of the assets of the mafia and of transnational organised crime is a key factor in the war that we must wage on the mafia. Pio La Torre understood this, and proposed a law to the Italian Parliament stating that there was an overriding need to take action on capital. For this reason I endorse the report by Mr Newton Dunn, because it tackles this point by stating that there is a need to intervene by chipping away at the funds of criminal and mafia organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">A section of my group will not support this report, perhaps for reasons that can be understood, because it considers that it does not offer enough guarantees, particularly with regard to the handling of personal data. This section is led by Mr Adamou, the shadow rapporteur for our group, who will abstain and will not endorse this report. I, on the other hand, think that combating organised crime is a priority, but it is not only a matter for the police.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to take action in the cultural sphere, we need to build a real social structure against the mafia, one that will take on the great burdens of social unrest and unemployment, and we also need to take action in the political sphere. In recent years the mafia and transnational criminal organisations have infiltrated the public administration and politics. This is no coincidence, and I would like to conclude by mentioning the fact that, for example, the president of my region is under investigation for relations with organised crime and the mafia.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by endorsing the paragraph in the Newton Dunn report that calls for monitoring of the activities of those administrations that have been infiltrated by organised crime and the mafia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Pornind de la această stare de fapt, în prezent lupta împotriva criminalităţii organizate nu mai poate fi continuată utilizând instrumente clasice, fiind necesară, aşa cum se remarca şi în motivaţia raportului, citez, „o schimbare radicală de perspectivă, care să permită soluţionarea constrângerilor interne din ce în ce mai complexe şi, în acelaşi timp, rezolvarea dificultăţilor aferente constrângerilor externe aflate în creştere exponenţială.” La aceste obiective consider, însă, că trebuie adăugat şi faptul că numai o schimbare de optică sau de program, oricât de judicios ar fi elaborată, nu va da rezultate dacă nu se asigură un mediu de stabilitate care să confere voinţa politică necesară realizării practice a acestora. Aceasta, voinţa, ar trebui canalizată în primul rând spre asigurarea funcţionalităţii independente şi eficiente a structurilor statului, desemnate să realizeze controlul modului de derulare a activităţilor susceptibile de a face obiectul operaţiunilor care intră sub incidenţa legilor criminalităţii organizate. În sfârşit, consider că un capitol separat din conceptul strategic ar trebui să fie consacrat acelor state, membre mai noi sau mai vechi ale Uniunii Europene, în care stabilitatea politică este deseori perturbată de acţiuni mai mult sau mai puţin democratice, stare de care structurile crimei organizate nu ezită să profite din plin.

Considering the antecedents of some of those recently admitted into the new government in my country, Northern Ireland, the irony of the welcome call in this report for the Council of Ministers to monitor the governmental activities of institutions at regional level whose members include political figures with links to criminal organisations is not lost upon me, especially in a week in which the Deputy First Minister in my country, Martin McGuinness, protested at the use of the European arrest warrant to seek the extradition to Germany of a person wanted in connection with an IRA bombing charge, and during a week in which his policing spokesman condemned arrests in Northern Ireland in an organised crime investigation in which a leading Irish Republican figure has now been charged.</p>
<p class="contents">If you genuinely support the rule of law, then you do not attack and protest against the means of securing international justice and you do not protest against operations attacking organised crime. But if shamefully, as in Northern Ireland, you are a Sinn Féin minister, then your first loyalty is still not to the rule of law, but to protecting the interests of the republican movement.

I am not as sharply critical of the situation as he is. I feel that there have been some positive contributions in the last 30 years in the area of police and judicial cooperation in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I do agree with him, though, when he highlights the significant difference between the mobility of criminal networks, which are taking advantage of border-free Europe, and the level of intervention of the law enforcement authorities, which fall under the jurisdiction of the Member State in question.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a contradiction that cannot be resolved. There are some who, wrongly, advocate restricting freedom and movement and who seek to reinstate national borders. This conundrum, however, can only be resolved with more and better collaboration, and more and better cooperation on the basis of shared procedures and basic harmonisation of legal standards.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need, as Mr Frattini correctly said, is to increase knowledge of the phenomenon of organised crime, which is becoming more and more sophisticated. We need to strengthen the policy of prevention in order to reduce the level of threat to our societies from organised crime. We need to derive benefit from existing legislation and to make better use of joint investigation teams, of special investigation techniques, of systematically targeting illegally acquired economic and financial resources and of the effective use of the European Arrest Warrant and the European Evidence Warrant. We must make better use of the various instruments already at our disposal, such as Europol and Eurojust, as Mr Frattini mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I should like to finish by adding my voice to those calling on the Member States that have yet to ratify the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime, and attached protocols on the fight against the trafficking in human beings and the trafficking of immigrants, to do so at the earliest opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we are often reminded that criminals and terrorists do not recognise borders. They take advantage of the lack of borders and are fully in command of the new means of travel and communications.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, our law enforcement agencies still have to face enormous administrative burdens that hinder their efficiency. It is now our responsibility to take all the necessary steps to adapt means and methods to the new realities. We must overcome the lack of mutual trust among law enforcement agencies, increase cross-border cooperation, intensify joint training and work together.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, however, that the Union must pay greater attention to its external borders and its neighbourhood policy. Since the recent enlargements, enforcing strong external borders has become a wider challenge. Some of the new EU border countries do not have the appropriate resources to tackle the phenomenon of organised crime. Corruption must be tackled with as much energy as we bring to the fight against organised crime and terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must recognise the situation and provide additional human resources and financial means, as well as sharing its know-how. We must adopt a comprehensive and specific approach built on transparency and anti-corruption measures. Our citizens need a safer world and more security, but this should not be at the expense of our civil liberties. We need more safeguards to ensure the balance of rights in our democracies, which means more parliamentary oversight of security activities and a high level of protection of privacy. This is why, once again, I urge the Council to adopt the framework decision on data protection under the third pillar as soon as possible. We have all waited too long. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, the criminal world is no less dynamic, complex or adaptable than any other sector of the market economy. Resources go where their productivity is greatest. There is an international competition for markets, in which foreign gangs have in some cases displaced local gangs.</p>
<p class="contents">The newest technologies, the growth in the transport and finance sectors and the elimination of internal borders are being used against us. Our own sluggishness is also being used against the lawful order.</p>
<p class="contents">Less and less crime remains solely within the boundaries of one country, yet the European Union’s internal security cooperation is still limited to the framework set by the third pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">Freedom of movement within Europe is a genuine gift to criminals. Physical boundaries have disappeared, but administrative barriers remain.</p>
<p class="contents">Europol and Eurojust need autonomy and respectable budgets. These things should not be bargained over any longer, and the same applies to Parliament’s right of supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">I concur with the rapporteur and Europol concerning the need considerably to strengthen research and analytical activity and to refocus. In addition to traditional surveillance, we need more analysis ‘from above’ which would make it possible to discover illegal activities in such vulnerable sectors as finance, taxation and government business.</p>
<p class="contents">Our greatest unused resource, however, is cooperation among citizens. Only indifference makes forced prostitution and the drug trade possible. Only democratic fatigue permits corrupt politicians to return to power.</p>
<p class="contents">Citizens’ faith in the effectiveness of police and the fairness of the courts can only be based on real achievements, which are only amplified by communication. I would like to thank the rapporteur and call for us to move from words to deeds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is a worrying phenomenon where criminals profit from the free movement of persons and economic and financial movements within the European Union in order to expand their own illegal activities more and more, including in countries outside the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">These activities include arms and waste smuggling (including radioactive waste), drugs trafficking, the sexual exploitation of women and children, trafficking in human tissues (the cases discovered and reported a few days ago in Ukraine are tragic examples of what is currently taking place) and illicit operations involving animals and artworks.</p>
<p class="contents">The Newton Dunn report points out, among many other things, the role played to date by Europol and Eurojust – the only available Community instruments – in the fight against organised crime, underlining some results that have been achieved but deploring their lack of genuine autonomy.</p>
