<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicolaï,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, the first summit between the EU and India took place in Lisbon in 2000. Since then, our relationship has undergone a fast and dynamic development. Our cooperation covers a wide range of subjects, from economic to cultural, and we address local, regional and global issues. The framework of our strategic partnership, set up in 2000, now really has flesh on the bones. The Netherlands presidency is very much looking forward to hosting the forthcoming summit in The Hague on 8 November. This will give a further boost to our relations. What do we want to get out of this summit?</p>
<p class="contents">The first thing we should do is to set a deadline for the completion of a comprehensive EU-India Action Plan for a Strategic Partnership. This action plan should be approved at the next Summit in 2005. This will reflect the ambition to further develop EU-India relations in several key areas, such as cooperation in the UN and other multilateral fora; conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction; cooperation on non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery; the fight against terrorism and organised crime; dialogue on democracy and human rights and EU support for India’s achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. The Commission’s communication, which was published last June, and the Indian reaction to it form the basis for this Action Plan.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of global challenges that we should address at the summit. Both the EU and India are committed to strengthening the role of the UN. We should therefore emphasise that an effective multilateral system based on the principles of international law, with a strong United Nations at its centre, is essential for achieving peace and international stability. In addition to 'old' challenges, we also have to address new ones, such as the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, HIV/AIDS and the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">On the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, we should increase our cooperation, particularly with a view to reinforcing the consistency and effectiveness of export control measures for dual-use goods. The EU wants to strengthen the political dialogue with India in this field and on issues relating to weapons of mass destruction. We hope India will react positively.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is very concerned about the threat posed by the spread of HIV/AIDS in India. The International Conference on Population and Development formulated a clear agenda on the fight against AIDS, and in 2001 the UN General Assembly adopted a Declaration of Commitment on AIDS. We want to reiterate the importance of implementing the agenda and declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">On terrorism, we now have a clear resolution from the UN Security Council. The EU will confirm to the Indians our commitment to the fight against terrorism. We will also inform them of the concrete EU action to combat terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">At the summit, we will also be discussing international and regional developments. I will focus on the latter. The EU has an interest in a stable, peaceful and prosperous South Asia. Looking to this region, we are encouraged by the developments in SAARC and the ongoing and genuine efforts to take forward the composite dialogue between India and Pakistan. At various meetings at both political and official level the EU has expressed its full support and its satisfaction with the steps taken by both countries.</p>
<p class="contents">At the summit, the EU will encourage India to continue to make progress in agreeing on substantive confidence-building measures, <span class="italic">inter alia</span> through improvements in transport, trade and economic links and more personal contact across the Line of Control. But we cannot expect rapid progress: a cautious, gradual approach is needed. We are encouraged by what we see as shifting parameters in India-Pakistan relations during the last months. The EU hopes that both sides will continue to engage fully in this process, for instance through consolidation of the Line of Control ceasefire.</p>
<p class="contents">We also welcome the agreement of both sides to explore possible options for a peaceful, negotiated settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir issue as part of the wider process of the composite dialogue between both countries. This is critical to the future of the process. Of course, Pakistan must continue to make every effort to curb terrorist infiltration across the Line of Control and cross-border terrorism. But at the same time India needs to take further action to reduce human rights violations. Improved social and economic quality of life in Jammu and Kashmir is important in sustaining peace. India should continue to take into account the views of local leaders, representing a broad spectrum of Kashmiri stakeholders.</p>
<p class="contents">Indian involvement is also needed when it comes to the situation in Afghanistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Burma, issues that we will also discuss at the summit. The EU is ready to express its commitment to the reconstruction and stabilisation of Afghanistan in partnership with the Afghan Government and is counting on India to do the same. Peace and stability is also needed in Nepal and Sri Lanka. We will encourage the Indians to use their influence to contribute to this goal.</p>
<p class="contents">Economics form an important part of EU-India relations. Therefore, we also want to give some signals in this field. We want to intensify bilateral cooperation in order to facilitate and expand trade and investment flows. The European Union is India’s first partner in terms of trade and actual investment inflows and is in the front rank of its partners in the field of economic cooperation. We want to maintain that. The summit will also provide an opportunity to express our commitment to the multilateral trading system and the desire to make progress in the Doha Development Round. We also want India to participate in Galileo, our global satellite navigation system, and we want to discuss the negotiations on a maritime agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the first summit took place only four years ago, the European and Indian cultures go back thousands of years. They first came into contact at the time of Alexander the Great. It is therefore only natural to stress the cultural dimension of our relationship by the signing of a common declaration on cultural relations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by saying that EU-India relations are improving all the time. The relationship covers many areas and it is bound to succeed. The Summit on 8 November will prove this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

India is a partner that deserves special attention, and this Commission has made a point of bringing the relationship with India to new heights during its mandate. Our objective has been a more comprehensive and forward-looking European policy towards India, and this is taking shape.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at the state of our relations today, it is clear that they have come a long way since our first summit in Lisbon in June 2000. In particular, we have deepened and strengthened our dialogue in all areas. At last year's EU-India summit it was agreed that we should seize the opportunity to develop our friendship into a strategic partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">As global actors with strong democracies and common values and with many years of growing trade and political links, there is much to build on. India has a formidable economic potential, as it looks set to emulate China’s economic growth. It plays an increasingly assertive role on the international stage. It is engaged in a process of conciliation with Pakistan. For these and many more reasons, the European Union simply cannot afford to miss out on opportunities for cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has set out proposals for doing just that. The Communication on an EU-India Strategic Partnership identifies the challenges, opportunities and expectations for strengthening our international, economic and development cooperation with India.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it is important to recognise that our relationship is no longer just about trade. We are both more active on issues such as promoting peace, security and democracy in the world, where we hold common views. The European Union and India could work more effectively together to support multilateralism and the role of the United Nations. We could strengthen our cooperation in conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction, and in addressing global concerns such as non-proliferation and terrorism. Certainly, the European Union and India should enhance their dialogue on human rights and democracy, bilaterally and internationally.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and India could also work more closely on promoting regional peace, prosperity and stability. In areas where the European Union is involved in the peace process and reconstruction, such as Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, dialogue and cooperation with India could be stepped up.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of the European Parliament is crucial. We encourage contacts with the Indian Lower House and suggest, in particular, regular meetings between delegations from both sides. The planned visit of Members of the European Parliament to India early next month is excellent news.</p>
<p class="contents">India could become a major economic partner, and much remains to be done to tap the full potential of the European Union and India’s trade and investment relationship. India has been one of the world’s fastest growing economies for over a decade. Its growing prosperity is attracting increased attention from European business. India should assure its climb to economic prosperity by continued economic reforms, including greater market access and better regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">We should therefore initiate a policy dialogue in important areas of economic management, such as industrial policy, the environment or competition. We intend to promote strategic dialogues – ranging from regulatory dialogue to cooperation in research – in sectors such as information technology, transport, energy, biotechnology or space science.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to foster progress on trade and investment. This includes strengthening the multilateral trading system from which we have both benefited. The recent agreement on a South Asia Free Trade Agreement takes explicit inspiration from the EU process. We stand ready to offer assistance based on our experience.</p>
<p class="contents">Mutual understanding is an area that has been neglected for too long. Educational exchanges will receive a boost through a scholarship programme in the framework of Erasmus Mundus. When we hold the next summit in The Hague in early November, we will adopt a declaration on cultural cooperation, hoping to make this area a priority for our future cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has produced conclusions endorsing the main thrust of the communication, and India has responded with a very positive strategy paper. Together with the excellent recommendations of Parliament, all elements are in place for the fifth summit to take the necessary decision to open a new era in our relations and to upgrade the relationship with India to a strategic partnership. Political leaders are expected to task officials to prepare a detailed action plan and a new political statement for the sixth summit in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Implementation can only work with sustained and committed support from all actors, including the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If we want terrorism to be eradicated one day, we must not just use force, but also intelligence, and if we use our intelligence we will realise that very often the scourge we are facing is led by educated people who find a perfect breeding ground amongst the wretched of the Earth. The combination of extreme ideology and hunger is undoubtedly explosive. So I believe it is essential for us, while not dropping our guard, to deal with the different causes of terrorism simultaneously.</p>
<p class="contents">International relations are in turmoil and the Union, which is seeking to consolidate itself institutionally through the approval of the European Constitution, can play a significant and beneficial role in the quest for peace, stability and justice, including ecological justice, on our tormented planet, if we acquire the political will to do so. I say this at a time when we are about to find out whether, on 2 November, the American superpower will opt for the path of constructive cooperation and respect for the opinions of others, including the international institutions, or whether it will choose the opposite direction.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, we should bear in mind that, despite the enormous hegemony of the great American power, which can be either benevolent or hostile, as well as the European Union, other States are increasing in importance in terms of international relations, such as, to differing degrees and by way of example, China, India, Japan, Brazil and South Africa, to name but a few. Close, respectful and mutually beneficial cooperation between the Union and some of these countries may contribute to stabilising a prosperous, just and peaceful southern Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe there is any need to extol the virtues of India taking a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, something it aspires to, as we all know. Nevertheless, the very fact that that possibility is on the table clearly demonstrates not just the need to carry out a reform of the United Nations, but also the essential need to consider the structural injustice that distorts relations between the human beings and peoples of the planet. The fact that in the twenty-first century it is still necessary to create an alliance against hunger, as several countries have done recently in the headquarters of the United Nations, demonstrates what a disaster the international social organisation we are immersed in is.</p>
<p class="contents">Our relations with India go back to the sixties. In fact, India was one of the first States to establish diplomatic relations with what was then the European Economic Community. It is no <span class="italic">cliché</span> to say that that great country is the largest democracy in the world – although it may have shortcomings and defects, it is nevertheless the case.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union is India’s most important trade partner and investor, but India is fourteenth on the list of the European Union’s trade partners – just behind China, Brazil and South Africa in fact.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, we must take a positive view of the Commission’s communication, proposing the establishment of strategic cooperation as well as positive conclusions from the Council of 11 October. I believe we can all take heart from the fact that this is an issue the three Institutions agree on, which will provide us with suggestions and details to make the journey towards this strategic cooperation easier and richer. I believe, therefore, that, in accordance with our respective competences, but always in a coordinated fashion, we three Institutions can and must promote sustainable development and appropriate management of globalisation, encouraging New Delhi to wage a decisive war against poverty, in which I am sure it can count on the cooperation of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that India is a significant country in terms of certain important technologies, while at the same time 300 million of its inhabitants are living in poverty, is something that is quite frankly difficult to stomach. Nevertheless, I am convinced that the strategic cooperation proposed, and which will be properly laid out at the bilateral Summit of 8 November, will contribute to finding solutions and to sharing effective multilateralism in international relations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We believe that India, which is today the largest multicultural democracy in the world, should be a strategic partner for the European Union in defining new international political alignments to ensure peace and security. We therefore fully agree with the recommendation that the Council should, at the fifth EU-India Summit on 8 November, identify India as a strategic partner for the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">A multilateral approach that also focuses on closer collaboration within the United Nations should be a central objective of the European Union’s foreign policy, with which we are today coming face to face with the approval of the new Constitution. That is why, if India is a strategic partner, we must ensure that the conditions are right for India and Pakistan to resolve the Kashmir dispute in a peaceful and civilised manner. I am not suggesting any useless external interference but something much simpler, giving as much helpful and welcome support as the European Union can provide based on its own experience in matters of foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope, therefore, that cooperation can go much further. The European Union is in fact India’s largest trading partner, but India only ranks fourteenth for the countries of Europe. There is thus a need for greater investment in economic cooperation among our enterprises, in research and in sustainable development. We think that the proposals put forward for the establishment of a Centre for Indian Studies through collaboration between the European Union and India, the possibility of holding cultural weeks to coincide with India-EU summits and designing a strategy to make the European Union better known to the Indian people should be fundamental.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we hope that the Indian Parliament will come and visit the European Parliament as soon as possible. It has been too many years since that happened, and we should instead develop much closer interparliamentary cooperation between our countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, speaking as Chair of the Parliament's South Asia delegation, I would like to go further.</p>
<p class="contents">I am extremely keen that we develop a meaningful, strategic partnership. My hope for the fifth EU-India Summit on 8 November is that it is a landmark one; one that propels the relationship between the world's largest democracy and ourselves – the second-largest – into the twenty-first century. This can only happen if both sides have a strong will to turn dialogue and statements into a tangible reality. Therefore, I ask the Council to reflect on why, despite many proposals and summits in the past, very little progress has been made on this issue. Could it be that we have not had a clear vision of where we want our relations to be in five or ten years' time?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Nicolaï and Commissioner Verheugen outlined a long list of areas where we need cooperation. But I believe we need to prioritise, because having this vast range of areas means we cannot focus on what we want to achieve. The list is also missing some crucial priorities: one of our main priorities, for example, is realising the Lisbon goals, which also happens to be one of India's top priorities. Their objective, like ours, is to create a knowledge-based society. We have the same goals and we can learn from each other, but we need to have the means to translate the wish-list into actual achievements if we are to ensure that happens. We also need to ensure that there are adequate resources in place.</p>
<p class="contents">I am keen to see the Commission communication creating a tangible difference on the ground and a partnership that allows the benefits of the enlarged Union to be reflected in the new neighbourhood policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am leading a Parliamentary delegation to New Delhi next week and I will be urging our Indian counterparts to take action in the same areas – to prioritise, to produce a document – with a view to improving EU-India relations.</p>

It has taken us too long to comprehend India’s significance. For a long time, we have treated India differently from other countries in the region, China for example, and so we are glad that, to judge by the journeys undertaken recently, both the European Union and many national governments are giving greater attention to relations with it.</p>
<p class="contents">As many previous speakers have pointed out, India is the world’s largest democracy, with a diversity of religions, cultures and ethnicities, whilst being at the same time a rising economic power. We would therefore be well advised, to our mutual benefit, to attach the necessary importance to that country. I do believe, though, that honesty, honest friendship and honest relationships involve neither party sweeping problems under the carpet, but rather addressing them frankly. Indians see one of these problems as being the issue of the import restrictions that we in the European Union still impose on India, some of which are rigid. India is right to address this issue, and we should consider whether fair trade might not be of more help to India than development aid has been to date. I believe that critical scrutiny is needed here.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to add that we very definitely see human rights as being another of these issues. While we welcome the indications that relations between India and Pakistan are bearing fruit in the shape of a potential resolution of the conflict in Kashmir, which gives cause for rejoicing, we also demand and expressly seek the acceleration, as a matter of urgency, of nuclear disarmament across the region, for the sake of the safety of the people who live there. As I have already indicated, one issue that must not be allowed to drop off the agenda in discussions with India is that of human rights; from the role of women to the caste system, these issues have a place in this context. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This does not seem to have transmitted itself to this particular committee, which recommends upgrading EU-India relations by outsourcing and insourcing. I am sorry the rapporteur did not have the time to tell us how much insourcing there has been, but there has been a great deal of outsourcing. In Britain alone, most of the banks, the insurance companies and even the National Health Service have outsourced.</p>
<p class="contents">My point concerns 3SE, which was set up by the EU and the Indian Government. On its website it goes a little further. According to the website, the value of outsourcing is in increased working days. It invites employers to harness the time difference of three-and-a-half to five-and-a-half hours to pack in <span class="italic">more</span> hours. So there are no Commission hang-ups then about the working-time directive, as long it is the poor exploited workers of India who are involved! The rapporteur tells us that we must help Delhi fight against poverty, but would he just tell his own organisation what it is doing to help?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, as I said at the outset, says that he wants to boost employment in the EU. This report does just the opposite. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The geo-strategic and geo-economic importance of India are self-evident. As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade, I should like to focus on the following: it has already been said and it is a fact that, for the European Union, India is only the fourteenth most important trading partner. On the other hand, the European Union is India's main trading partner and the greatest source of foreign investment. Consequently, these are important trade links, although there is still room for greater improvement, given that the volume of trade and investment has not reached its full potential.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the huge population in India creates the preconditions for a broad range and large number of potential consumers of European products. Nonetheless, the precondition on India's side is that it needs to open up the market further and introduce economic reforms. Indeed, it is in the common interests of the European Union and India to work to promote trade and investment, at both multilateral and bilateral level. At multilateral level, the European Union and India need to highlight common objectives and common ground in order to bring negotiations on the Doha development programme to a successful conclusion. For example, both sides have a common interest in protecting indications of origin. There is also room to further increase and intensify work at bilateral level. Customs cooperation between the European Union and India forms a good basis, as does holding a dialogue on matters such as investments and intellectual property rights.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like to mention India's development policy, to which the European Union could contribute by giving priority both to the attainment of the development objectives of this country in general and to improving governance, the quality of the environment, social and economic cohesion, the social insurance system and the adoption of international working standards, as provided for by the International Labour Organisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a good thing that we in the European Union are striving towards a strategic alliance with India in order to promote peace, security, human rights and democracy. Our trade relations with India are also of importance. That country is very successfully developing into an economic growth area of some stature. In that respect, it is necessary for us to consider the implications of outsourcing European jobs to India, something that the present report rather overlooks. Another aspect that deserves more attention is the difficult relationship between India and Pakistan. I am not only referring to the Kashmir issue. Pakistan’s stance towards international Muslim terrorism is – to put it mildly – ambiguous, and this must emphatically be denounced by the European Union. The terrorists that are given shelter in Pakistan are a threat, not only to India, but also to the rest of the world, and thus also to the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Lisbon strategy, commits us to achieving an economy racing along at the crazy speed of the US economy within a space of time that I regard as unrealistic. If this strategy is to be implemented, the European Union will need the help of a partner and friend over the next few years. Could Russia or China act as such a partner for the next 20 or 50 years? This appears highly improbable. Anyone who has lived and worked in those countries and become acquainted with their policies and development plans would agree with me.</p>
<p class="contents">For many years, we have been receiving clear declarations from India it would like to build closer links, and that these could involve more than the economy and investment. A willingness to forge closer political and global relations has also been expressed. Now is an excellent time for the newly-enlarged and 450-million-strong European Union, which has been reinvigorated by an influx of new countries, to build links with the Indian economy of over a billion people. This would create a new alliance of the kind we need. It would bring together a quarter of the world’s population. It is in our interests to forge links with a country where 50% of the population is under 20 years of age, and where GDP has risen by an average of 7% for the past few years. India is a world leader in many fields of science and industry, such as biotechnology, bioinformatics, electronics, the space industry and defence.</p>
<p class="contents">There remains a great deal for us to do. There is work to be done with regard to the economy, investment, technological exchange and the building of civil society, and also with regard to the joint reconstruction of old international organisations such as the UN that do not always function as well as they should.

<p class="contents">The further development of relations between the European Union and India will be of crucial importance to world peace, stability, security and development.</p>
<p class="contents">India is a huge democratic country in the region with a history and cultural past. At the same time, however, it is a country of the future, which is building consistent and stable bases for its economic, social, scientific and technological development.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and the Member States have every interest in developing a new strategic alliance, a new strategic partnership with India, and this relationship will contribute to the democratisation of the international system, to the necessary global and regional balances, to the creation of a multipolar world, to the defence of peace, democracy and human rights, to the reform of the UN system and to the strengthening of its role in legitimising the peaceful resolution of conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">India has a long tradition of independent and non-aligned foreign policy and of participation in UN international peacekeeping missions, such as in Cyprus, for example. The European Union must take full advantage of this tradition.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish by agreeing with what Commissioner Verheugen said; that we must, and that it is a major priority for the European Union to develop relations with India in particular in the areas of research, technology and the information society, where India has truly made tremendous progress, as confirmed by the thousands of Indians working in software and IT companies in Europe. That is why the European Union must promote educational exchange and research institute programmes and immediately implement the scholarship programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite democracy and law in the world’s largest democracy, practice is proving somewhat different. Even though Indian law prohibits caste discrimination, it is still a fact of life. I would call for this problem to be explicitly put on the agenda in our bilateral and multilateral trade talks and in context of the broad EU-India partnership that we have, which has been rightly championed.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, positive support could help give the partnership a boost to such an extent that social isolation, child labour, exploitation and unfair trading are all addressed in one fell swoop. In this respect, a positive agenda is being drafted, where the problems of the Dalits are being addressed and as a result of which their situation can be actively improved. That is the platform where it should happen, but it is precisely this kind of international trade problem, linked to a real international legal problem of 260 million people, that calls for a common approach, not only in India but also in other countries. I hope we have the courage to interpret this broader partnership in that way where this is concerned too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The presidency can agree with most of the remarks and recommendations in this interesting and good report. I also fully agree with everyone who said that it is very important to give priority to good relations with this very important country, one which is becoming more important economically, technically and politically.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Menéndez del Valle also mentioned the importance of UN reforms. As everyone knows, the Council does not have a common position on the enlargement of the UN Security Council, so it is clear that the Union will not be able explicitly to state whether it will support the Indian request to become a permanent member of the Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I emphasise that the UN reforms cover much more than just the Security Council. Possible disagreements on those reforms should not prevent us from implementing other necessary reforms in the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Members of Parliament – Mr Özdemir and Mr van den Berg – mentioned the important issue of human rights. As you know, discussing human rights within the United Nations is a sensitive issue; I am sure the European Parliament delegation which visited Kashmir last June noted that too. Nevertheless, we will discuss the human rights issue, the situation of women and children, and other subjects, at the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been consistent in our position that in the fight against terrorism, or any other kind of militant extremism, human rights should also be respected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
