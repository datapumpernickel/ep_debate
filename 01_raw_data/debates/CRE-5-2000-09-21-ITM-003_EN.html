<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pirker (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, this debate is about fighting crime – organised crime to be precise – which is now responsible for at least one in four of all crimes, and which makes huge profits from drug crimes, trafficking in human beings, insurance and credit card fraud, and from other activities. These ill-gotten gains are laundered and go into circulation in the legal economy. In so doing, they undermine our national economies, and in view of corruption, also erode our social systems and states.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to muster all our resources and bring all our strategies into play, so that we are appropriately equipped in our fight against organised crime. So we need these measures, and this proposed plan of action has special significance, because it sends out a signal to the people of Europe that Europe is not just an economic and currency union, but in the interests of its people and the Member States, it must also be built up into a union of security.</p>
<p class="contents">An action plan of this kind will undoubtedly help to achieve this objective. But we must take the necessary European rules of the game into account when putting plans of this kind into practice. That is what happened with this action plan, and so I submitted a parliamentary question back in the spring, at the time of the Portuguese Presidency, which has applied itself very diligently to this issue, but has failed to play by the rules. Indeed the Presidency promised that Parliament would deal with the action plan, the opinion would be awaited and then incorporated into the action plan, and only then would the action plan be put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The erstwhile Portuguese Presidency failed to keep its promise and this led to the question being asked that we are dealing with today. The criticism is justified, for more reason than one. Firstly, because the failure to involve Parliament has taken us a step backwards, not just to the days before the Treaty of Amsterdam, but long before the Treaty of Maastricht, because according to Chapter 6, Parliament must be involved in every case. But even the Treaty of Amsterdam demands openness and transparency and so, as a body representing the interests of the citizens, Parliament should have played a full part in the proceedings, as per the undertaking it received here from the Presidency at the beginning. Another broken promise.</p>
<p class="contents">The question I would like to ask the French Presidency is how it intends to handle this, i.e. whether it will involve Parliament in the framing of long-term strategies, as provided for by the Treaty, await our opinion and then develop strategies that are in keeping with Parliament’s proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the action plan content has also been subject to criticism, which has to do with the fact that recommendations have been drafted and numbered from 1 to 5 in order of priority. Yet these lists of priorities have not been drawn up solely on the basis of urgency and absolute necessity, but very often, I regret to say, on the basis of feasibility, and I will give you an example. The freezing, or confiscation, of the ill-gotten gains of organised crime was only given a priority rating of 3, even though we all know that money is the driving force behind organised crime, and so the freezing, or confiscation, of these assets should have been given a priority rating of 1. There are other examples I could mention. I therefore call upon the French Council Presidency to rethink this list of priorities and to reorganise it in terms of real priorities, rather than ranking the objectives according to how difficult they will be to accomplish.</p>
<p class="contents">We also feel that we need to develop preventive measures, and we have submitted concrete proposals to this end. They range from reviewing legislation in terms of the impact it has on preventing organised crime, to preventive measures aimed at deploying technical instruments too, with a view to nipping organised crime in the bud. For example, these include higher security standards for credit cards or electronic immobilisers for cars.</p>
<p class="contents">So what we are talking about is a whole host of concrete proposals, and as a Parliament we are aiming firstly, to be fully involved in the process, and, secondly, for our proposals to be incorporated into the action plans, i.e. the long-term strategies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Presidency has also committed itself to involving Parliament to a greater extent in the work undertaken in the field of justice and home affairs, in particular by means of regular participation in the meetings of your parliamentary Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is bound, nonetheless, to comply with the terms of the Treaty. The legal framework does not, in fact, allow it to consult Parliament on strategy papers currently being studied within the offices of the Council. On the other hand, as you know, on 21 December 1999, the Council sent Parliament the strategy document on organised crime drawn up under the Finnish Presidency, expressly specifying that it wished to keep Parliament informed right from the start of discussions on this document. What is more, at the meetings of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, the Portuguese Presidency informed Parliament of the work being carried out and of the reasons why the Council deemed it urgent to continue with the procedure for the adoption of the strategy document. In particular, the Presidency explained that the previous action programme, for 1997, had already expired and that the European Council had requested that it be followed up.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the Council is not unaware that, in response to the strategy document, Parliament is currently working on a new document on organised crime. We are pleased to see the work carried out by Parliament. As in the case, moreover, of Parliament’s response to the 1997 action programme on organised crime, the Council fully intends to study your reports carefully during the implementation of its own strategy and to take the views expressed by Parliament into account. In this respect, the Council suggests that Parliament give its opinion on the level of priority to be given to the various recommendations made in its document.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the commitments made during the Portuguese Presidency, the Council will keep Parliament informed on a regular basis of the debates currently taking place in the field of justice and home affairs. It was indeed the Portuguese Presidency which demonstrated a clear intention, through its initiatives, to pay special attention within the European Union to the prevention of organised crime. In this respect, the Council confirms that it will strictly apply the Treaty when consulting the European Parliament on any action resulting from an initiative of the Member States or the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, there is in fact one thing that the people of Europe are unable to comprehend, and that is why criminals in Europe enjoy all the advantages of the freedom of movement, whereas those who legitimately fight crime are hindered by the issue of borders. This issue is also of concern to Parliament, as the representative of our citizens, which is why, ever since the start of this debate, Parliament has been acutely aware of the need to make progress in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the Treaty of Amsterdam marked the beginning of the so-called ‘communitisation’ of many policies, but not those relating to criminal matters in both procedural and substantive terms. The reasons behind this are not always immediately obvious to the people of Europe: they are rooted in our legal cultures and in the differences between our legal cultures. However, Mr President, over and above these deep-rooted differences lie the most deeply-rooted common principles which ultimately boil down to something as simple as the need for trust between Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The construction of Europe is based on the mutual trust that exists between Member States and the mutual recognition of similar levels of protection regarding fundamental rights, legislation and basic principles. This is why – and here I recall the ever enlightening and splendid words of Commissioner Vitorino who called for common definitions to be established in the field of organised crime and similar rules to be laid down regarding the sentences imposed and the time served – this is an issue that must be studied in the long term, as the idea of “vérité en deçà des Pyrénées, erreur au delà” [all that is truth this side of the Pyrenees, all that is falsehood beyond], cannot hold true. We cannot afford such luxuries in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, Mr President, we are making progress in the area of trust and mutual recognition and the Council has submitted a proposal that is supported by the various Member States. As we are in the process of reaching this last stage of development, we must firmly ensure that an order or resolution pronounced by a judge in a Member State is automatically recognised and implemented by another Member State. In other words, an arrest warrant for a terrorist should take effect immediately without the need to go through the highly complex extradition process – which is still complicated between European States – so that the terrorist or criminal can be taken immediately to the State that wants them and where they have committed their crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">This, Mr President, is what we urge you to do and what we hope will soon become a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our priority in criminal matters is combating crime, particularly money laundering. France’s request for a joint Council of Ministers for Justice, Home Affairs, Economic Affairs and Finance devoted to combating money laundering, was therefore extremely interesting. Let me also draw your attention, at this point, to the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters to combat organised crime, tabled by the French Presidency in order to remove the obstructions affecting the work of judges.</p>
<p class="contents">Studies indeed show that impressive amounts of criminal proceeds are amassed by organised crime and reinvested in the world economy. In this way, criminal organisations infiltrate the economic fabric of states and can, if they so wish, destabilise our economies by taking control of commercial companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Legal and police cooperation is absolutely vital in the fight against organised crime, particularly the trafficking of human beings, the sexual exploitation of children, and money laundering. The Member States must define common penalties and adopt a consistent overall policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot, however, discuss penalties without discussing crime prevention, and clearly we must implement programmes for educational and information purposes, directed, in particular, at the citizens of our own States but also at the populations of third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Criminal organisations can find themselves in a position of strength thanks to the financial operations they carry out in order to launder criminal proceeds. The fight against organised crime is an important undertaking, where we must not fail. The victims expect a great deal of us and this is a challenge we must accept. The Europe we want to build is a Europe of rights. One of these rights is the right to security for all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can perhaps interpret the Minister’s response as a promise that this kind of procedure, whereby the Council of Ministers decides upon a policy document without involving this Parliament beforehand, will not occur in future. I understand why it is happening. The presidency’s term is only six months and every presidency is keen to flex its political muscles. This is how it goes. However, this Parliament cannot accept this as an excuse for being kept in the dark.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to European crime prevention. The Liberal Group believes that, in addition to all kinds of practical measures which are included in the document, it is, in particular, high time that criminal prosecution was improved by means of European cooperation. This does not appear to be happening. I would like to take this opportunity to argue once again in favour of setting up a European public prosecution office. Although this is required as a matter of urgency, it has not been provided for in this plan, nor has it been mentioned at Tampere or on the scoreboard. This is a missed opportunity. In fact, the scoreboard, in the field of crime prevention, refers far too often to documents which Commissioner Vitorino is to issue, studies which are being carried out, guidance documents and such like.</p>

Therefore, all the Member States must immediately harmonise the concept of international organised crime and introduce penalties against it. Organised crime is more than terrorism, trafficking of dangerous drugs, abduction, arms trafficking, money laundering etc: now, more than ever, it includes the trafficking of human beings, who are sold and exploited like slaves, and the sexual exploitation of children. In our quest to develop legislation which is common to all the Member States, and lays down penalties for international organised crime, there is a particularly urgent need to find a way of regulating the Internet, in order to prevent an information tool, created to bring men and cultures closer together, becoming increasingly used by organised crime as a means of communication and expansion.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of the thousands of Internet sites with turnovers of millions of euros, which sell children and exploit them sexually, Parliament, the Commission and Council must think carefully. For genuine freedom to exist, it must be regulated, for otherwise it becomes an abuse of power, and, in this sense, the organised crime of the underworld is much more powerful than governments or our speeches, which flow forth in abundance in defence of the weaker members of society but which have hitherto proved completely incapable of containing evil.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we reiterate the need for the Member States to acknowledge the reality of international organised crime and to harmonise their penal codes in this specific field immediately. This matter must also be included on the Nice agenda, for it is a subject which closely affects the citizen and is also urgent, both because the situation in the Member States has reached dramatic proportions – witness even this morning’s events and the extent of the bloodshed on European territory in recent weeks – and because, with enlargement on the horizon, there is an urgent need for a solution to be found to the problem of organised crime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to congratulate the French Presidency on their statement to us.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that most of us recognise the need for greater coordination and closer cooperation between Member States on the issue of fighting the world of crime. This action is a common responsibility, given its international dimension, as such criminal organisations generally operate across national borders because of the high degree of mobility they have and even take advantage of restrictions on jurisdiction, loopholes in the law, and of the differences between national administrative and criminal justice systems, exploiting the anomalies of the various systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Organised crime in the European Union has seen significant developments over the last decade, requiring action essentially in the areas of computer crime, crime involving trafficking in human beings, drugs and arms, terrorism, child pornography and money-laundering as well as corruption and fraud. It is crucial for the European Union to adopt a harmonised definition of organised crime that covers all of these areas. The fight against this type of crime therefore requires urgent action. This is a fight which must engage us all and which must be able, specifically, to count on the participation of the European Parliament in defining the strategies to adopt and the priorities to set. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European citizens, who, every day, live through the drama of all forms of petty and serious crime – from international drug trafficking to the sexual exploitation of children, from the trafficking and exploitation of human beings to illegal immigration – who live in towns which are unsafe or even dangerous, would like to be able to express their opinions and to lay claim, democratically, through their representatives at the European Parliament, to their rights and priorities of security and the fight against crime. Most importantly, Parliament should be able to give a voice to the defenceless, and I am referring to the many children who are victims of violence or sexual abuse and the many adolescents who are ensnared by drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the fight against the sexual exploitation of children and that against drugs – to quote but two examples – are genuinely extremely difficult tasks, but they are priority issues, and it is certainly not acceptable, as the Council advocates, for priority to be dictated by feasibility rather than urgency, </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
