The Commission's communication is entitled, 'Europe's response to World Ageing – promoting economic and social progress in an ageing world'.</p>
<p class="contents">This communication addresses the phenomenon of ageing in Europe against the background of worldwide ageing. First of all, Europe's population is one of the oldest in the world, and European countries will continue to be prominent in the league of ageing nations for several more decades yet.</p>
<p class="contents">Ageing is, however, no longer essentially a problem peculiar to developing countries. Today it is also – and increasingly – becoming a concern of developing countries. In a number of these countries, ageing will be a much more rapid process and will take place against a background of a level of development which is markedly lower than in Western Europe. Ageing is therefore a problem which, in the Twenty-First century, will require not a European response but a global response.</p>
<p class="contents">The approach adopted by the Commission is based on three points:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the population is ageing rapidly. Enlargement will not affect this situation at all, and neither will immigration, although it may have a slight influence on this process. Nevertheless, demography is not a destiny. The political responses to ageing will determine the impact that it has on European societies.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, ageing is the result of a combination of several social processes and should be considered as a trend which interacts with other phenomena. The response must therefore constitute an integral part of the global strategy, which is made up of mutually supportive policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, although the living conditions and possibilities open to the elderly are an important concern at any time, if we are to adapt successfully to ageing, people of all ages will be affected. A life-long approach can therefore make it easier to put in place adequate political measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The main part of the communication describes the way in which we need to act at European level. The Commission has identified ageing as one of the six common challenges of sustainable development, and the Member States have taken decisive measures to step up cooperation on ageing problems. The Member States have committed themselves to coordinating their work and we are starting to see a similar tendency for health care.</p>
<p class="contents">We have identified the main challenges together. They are: anticipating an increase in expenditure while guaranteeing sound public finances; adjusting to an ageing and shrinking workforce; guaranteeing adequate, sustainable and adaptable pensions and guaranteeing ageing Europeans access to high-quality health care for long periods of time. Over and above the experience which the European Union has acquired in considering its response to ageing, the communication also takes account of the problems faced by candidate countries and developing countries at a global level. Taken as a whole, the communication is a contribution by the Commission to the debate on the new International Plan of Action on Ageing, which is to be adopted. It is therefore intended to support Member States' efforts to establish a uniform Union position on this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">On Monday, my colleague, Anna Diamantopoulou, gave a presentation to the World Assembly in Madrid on recent developments in the European Union's position on the problem of ageing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This subject, which I strongly urged should be included in today’s debate, must lead us all and, in general, the European Union, which I feel needs to show more determination and sensitivity in its approach, to greater reflection. In the future, our institutions are going to be called upon increasingly to respond quickly and effectively to the new challenges posed by the increase in the average life expectancy, and to provide the elderly throughout the world with an increasingly high standard of living.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, the phenomenon of the ageing of society affects all countries, both the more advanced and the developing countries, although in markedly different ways, and due consideration of these differences in impact reveals the need for different approaches and initiatives. I therefore feel that the European Parliament, the institution which is the voice of the citizens of Europe, must adopt an official position at the Second United Nations World Assembly, due to close tomorrow in Madrid, and we shall do this by voting on the joint motion for a resolution today.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, the protection of and respect for the dignity of this section of the population needs to be fully guaranteed, and a debate must be opened on the future of the third and fourth ages. This distinction is not based on biological age but rather on the degree of self-sufficiency of an elderly person. Indeed, it is necessary to distinguish between the elderly of the third age, who are still fully active and have the right not to be excluded from social, cultural, political and economic life, citizens who are a resource for our society rather than just a problem, and those who belong to the fourth age and, although no longer self-sufficient, still have the right to live a dignified life and enjoy full respect for their dignity. That is why, Mr President, I call upon the House to give its full support to the resolution we are to vote on today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In actual fact, this is not perhaps the best time for this discussion. It would have been better either to have adopted a resolution before the assembly on ageing that is taking place right now under the auspices of the UN and so have been able to influence it, or else perhaps to have adopted a resolution subsequently once we had been able to assess the assembly’s conclusions. However, it is encouraging that the European Parliament is so unified in its view of ageing.</p>
<p class="contents">All too often, we see ageing as a problem. I, for my part, cannot see it as a problem that people live longer and are more and more healthy at ever more advanced ages. Rather, it is very encouraging and an asset to our societies. However, we in the Member States of the EU are very bad at making use of the skills possessed by the older portion of the population, particularly in the world of work.</p>
<p class="contents">In the majority of the Member States, the formal pensionable age is approximately 65 while the actual pensionable age is very much lower. People are thrown out of work for a variety of reasons. It is the result of discrimination against older people, something which does in actual fact occur and must be got to grips with, as to some extent it has been. It is also the result of poor working environments that cause people to become exhausted before their time. Last but not least, it has to do with the fact that, in our knowledge-based society where it is increasingly important to develop one’s skills and engage in lifelong learning, older people are not given the opportunity to do just that. If they were to be given that opportunity, there would also be a very much greater opportunity to make use of their skills.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we retain the European social model, that is to say a social security system with high-quality, developed health care and medical services. This is crucial, especially for the most elderly people of all who have a great need for health care and medical treatment. In the future, the need will become greater because women, who have previously assumed responsibility for providing a large part of that care, have now entered the labour market and will continue to do so to an ever-greater degree. This demands even more of society in terms of developing resources so that the elderly receive dignified care when they become really old and have greatest need of it.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also adopt a global perspective, as the Commission has done. It is important that we monitor developments beyond our borders and try to form a global strategy covering the status of the elderly throughout the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In our view that is going to need more than codes of conduct, which do not seem to be working particularly fast.</p>
<p class="contents">As others have said, it is important, too, that we recognise the contribution of older people who are already keeping society and our economy going, by acting as carers offering childcare, for example, so that their children can go out to work, or by acting as volunteers. Indeed, in a number of countries the local government system, let alone the parliamentary system, would probably collapse without their input.</p>
<p class="contents">The key thing as others have said, is for us to stop perpetuating the image of people, like many of us in this Chamber, as a burden on society and its services, and to see us as much more of an asset. Indeed, in future we will need to be even more fully involved in our societies.</p>
<p class="contents">We look to our societies and to our governments to act internationally to create a sustainable future so that we can change the situation of poverty in which many people live. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, therefore, crucial that the European Union and its Member States give this commitment, incorporating issues of ageing into Community policies and including the elderly in their social, economic and development programmes, paying particular attention to elderly people at risk of isolation and by developing the principle of active ageing, promoting opportunities for the elderly to participate in social and cultural life. There are various ways in which this can be done, as Mrs Lambert has already mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the issue of ageing is generally associated with long-term concerns, it already presents a major challenge for society and for governments because of its profound implications for policies of social security, employment, education, health, immigration and the family. This means that the necessary measures must be adopted to ensure that the income and resources available to elderly and retired people remain in line with average living standards in society.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unacceptable that concerns about public spending and pressures for compliance with the Stability Pact should have a negative effect on the living standards of the elderly, as suggested in the recent decision of the Barcelona European Council to increase the age of retirement by five years by 2010, which we find unacceptable, and in the statements by the current President-in-Office of the Council, Prime Minister Aznar, at the opening of the Second UN Assembly on ageing, when he called for changes to the pensions system, to working hours and to the age of retirement, all of which involve the same issues.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial that we move ahead with integrated social policies, that we promote intergenerational solidarity, that we pay particular attention to issues of universal access to healthcare and of the quality of services provided and that we attach greater importance to the use of the free time of the elderly. We hope that the Commission will propose an action programme that is specific to the elderly and which takes account of all these aspects in an integrated vision, having listened to organisations representing pensioners and the elderly. The European Union must also demonstrate greater commitment to providing international aid to developing countries in order to enable them to develop policies in the field of ageing, specifically for women and in order to combat Aids. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I feel that we should all genuinely see elderly people as our human heritage: their wisdom, their knowledge and the history of which they are the living exponents are not fully valued or exploited. There have been many sincere efforts in recent years in our countries, in Europe too, to provide systems of guarantees and dignity for all elderly people – and rightly so. Of course, more has been done in some areas than in others, and I therefore feel that Europe needs to develop policies ensuring a minimum level of guarantees and focus on the world of the elderly, a level which is the same in all the countries of the Union and must be proposed as a goal for the candidate countries too.</p>
<p class="contents">Without a doubt, European society took as its starting point the awareness that being in economic difficulties – being poor – is always difficult, being poor and ill is both difficult and complicated, but being poor, ill and old too is absolutely awful.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that less has been done, on the other hand, to attempt to give the elderly a political and institutional position too, to attempt to keep all elderly people in the active world for as long as possible, to make their departure from the world of work more gradual. There you are. I feel that this is the major challenge facing us all, and that the solution lies precisely in a more flexible vision of the world of work itself, in more intelligent use of the professional skills of the people concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are real risks if we simply address this question from an economic point of view, regarding and valuing citizens simply for the contribution they can make to the economy or the workforce. Society, as this House knows, is a much wider concept than the economy, and that must be our starting-point.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of income for older people depends on the extent to which we retain the European social model of a contribution from people who are in work to those who, at various points in their lives, either through illness or old age, will no longer be able to take part in the workforce. It is, therefore, essential to secure an efficient and effective taxation system and efficient and effective social insurance system. Most of all, we need to have a pensions reserve fund, so that there can be inter-generational solidarity between this generation and not just the next generation but also the generation after that. It is important that all Member States take this on board.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to draw attention to what I consider to be a mistaken view by Mrs Diamantopoulou, who seems to think that the solution to the ageing of our population is for us all to become more fertile: to have more babies. That is a cop-out. This simply will not happen – certainly not in the wealthier parts of Europe. We have to therefore grapple seriously with the whole issue of immigration. It is not enough to talk about the need to ensure that developing countries have sufficient resources to feed and to provide for their own people. Of course, we need to do that, but no matter how often or how well we do that, there will still be a need for people to move into the wealthier parts of Europe. I contend that we must stop this idea that we can build a fortress Europe and keep out these millions upon millions of people who want to come to Europe. They want to make a contribution to Europe, and we would all be the better for it, both economically and culturally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I hope that, when the economic, social and health consequences of the increase in average life expectancy and the ageing population are discussed and analysed, the emphasis will not just be on the role that elderly people must be able to play in modern society today but also on the right, for example, of each elderly person who loses their independence to continue to enjoy a guaranteed quality of life. We need all the States of the European Union to focus once again, more intently, on promoting the active involvement of elderly people in social and cultural life. Indeed, it would be very valuable for our society to aim at adopting that approach, for it must treat the elderly person not just as a potential user of services but as a person who is still useful to society as a whole too.</p>
<p class="contents">I warmly welcome the new Community programme that the Commission is preparing to launch in the second half of the year – not least because the Commission has not done a great deal on this matter thus far – in an attempt to remedy a situation which the Commission itself has described as disturbing in terms of the preservation of the quality of life of elderly people.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, there needs to be an effective, coordinated action at European level if we are to address the issue of ageing, which is both a challenge and, at the same time, an emergency, a burden on the future of all the European States, particularly my country, Italy, where Genoa holds the record for the city with the greatest proportion of elderly people in the entire Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At this meeting, it was revealed that ageing is a phenomenon affecting both the North and the South, despite the growing divide and inequality between societies in the developed world and those of countries that are fighting to overcome underdevelopment. Perhaps the most interesting aspect was understanding that, regardless of location, there are three specific priorities for the elderly.</p>
<p class="contents">The first concerns healthcare at an age when people’s health requires care that is more and more costly; the second is the guarantee of economic security in order that the elderly can continue to live independently when, because of their age, they have to stop working; and the third is the social consideration, respect and appreciation that society adopts towards the elderly, not only in recognition of the services they have provided – which should also be the case – but also with regard to the role and function these elderly people should fulfil within our social framework.</p>
<p class="contents">A satisfactory response to these three priorities will increasingly enable the elderly to live in dignity longer, which is to be welcomed. In general terms, the EU Member States have managed to respond in a way that basically satisfies the two first priorities: health care and economic security, although benefits are often frankly inadequate and need to be increased, and we must remain alert to any potential threats to such benefits. On the other hand, little or no progress has been made on the third priority, that of consideration and respect for the role of the elderly in our societies.</p>
<p class="contents">The picture in the developing world is even worse. In these countries, none of the three stated priorities have been satisfactorily met and, if there is any sign at all, this is to be found in the third area, that of respect for the elderly and of assuming shared responsibility for them, in which some positive signs have been reported.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the demographic factors that alter migratory flows on a daily basis, these are other challenges we must confront. This was achieved by the Second United Nations World Assembly on Ageing in Madrid, which set out a whole new<span class="bold"> </span>strategy that the European Union must resolutely support, as we are doing in Parliament by approving today the excellent proposal put forward by Mr Podestà. We should do this for our own future as well as for the future of a world which needs to demonstrate increasing solidarity, and consequently, treat the elderly with greater fairness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Commissioner Anna Diamantopoulou said in Madrid on Monday, with people living longer and enjoying better health, we have room for a new life model, a new society which pro-actively reflects technological and scientific achievement.</p>
<p class="contents">However, that is not the case today. On the contrary, every day Cassandras everywhere are peddling doom and gloom, with prophesies of a planet drowning under the weight of 6 billion people, of wealth-creating resources being exhausted, of the natural environment being destroyed, of poor nations increasing and multiplying while we in the developed world grow old and die out and our insurance systems crumble.</p>
<p class="contents">The solution offered by Malthusianists is to reduce the birth rate in third world countries and increase our own birth rates. Such are the ethics of the developed world. My own view is that there is a direct correlation between the uneven distribution of people on the planet and the demographic problem on the one hand and the development and distribution of the planet's resources and the question of social justice, education, equality of the sexes, human rights and development standards, on the other. The future of the planet is clearly not under threat from the starving children of the Third World or the ageing population; it is under threat from consumer standards and the way of life of the third of the earth's population who live in the developed world. That is where we need to intervene and that is where we need a new demographic policy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, until such time as we have the integrated policy of sustainable development which the Commissioner referred to, we should follow the sound advice of those who propose that we abandon our restrictive immigration policy and give immigrants full social and political rights. The population and workforce in Sweden and Germany would have been seriously depleted without their policy of integrating immigrants and fully recognising the right of women to work. Strengthening these two policies could resolve the problems in the short term. However, they will only be resolved in the long term under a fair – and very different – system of economic and social development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
