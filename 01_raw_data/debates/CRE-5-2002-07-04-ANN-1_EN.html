<p>The Council follows closely the situation in Ecuador and is aware of the events referred to by the Honourable Member. The Council took note with regret of the violence that took place in the Los Álamos plantation on May 16 in the framework of the strike declared by the banana workers since May 6. The Council was deeply grieved by the shooting of ten striking workers by a large number of hooded, armed men. The Council was also appalled at the insults, looting, and other violent actions perpetrated by the assailants of the Los Álamos plantation group, where workers living on the plantations were sleeping.</p>
<p>The EU in its conversations with Ecuador on all occasions and, in particular in the framework of its political dialogue with the Andean Community calls for the respect and promotion of all human rights and fundamental freedoms. On the occasion of the EU - Andean Community summit that took place last 18 May in Madrid, the Heads of State and Government analysed the achievements made in the strengthening of democracy in the Andean region through the development and application of the Inter-American Democratic Charter. In this context they agreed on the necessity of preserving full institutional and democratic normality and the rule of law. They also stressed the importance of good governance and policies directed towards promoting fundamental rights and freedoms and eradicating poverty.</p>
<p>In this framework, the Council considers that the local judicial institutions and the national authorities should solve all violations of human rights and fundamental freedom issues according to the existing mechanisms.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0429"></a>

<p>Illegal immigration has assumed huge proportions in many countries of the European Union (the Prime Minister of Greece referred to 260 000 in 2001) and serious concerns are emerging as a result of the increase in illegal immigration, which often has dramatic consequences both for the illegal immigrants themselves and for political and economic stability in the partner countries, their societies and the European Union itself.</p>
<p>In view of the above, does the Council intend, on the basis of the provisions of Article 29 of the EU Treaty and of Article 63 of the EC Treaty, to take an integrated approach to this issue by seeking to enhance cooperation in the fields of foreign policy, economic development and the management of refugee flows, concluding repatriation agreements with all the partner countries and especially with those with a particularly high level of refugee flows?

<p>The European Union is currently giving the issue of combating illegal immigration and the most suitable measures for preventing and overcoming this very alarming phenomenon higher priority than ever before. The matter was recently discussed in great detail in the bodies of the Council, and subsequently the Union drew up and adopted a great many instruments in this area. It was on the agenda of the Seville European Council.</p>
<p>In November, the Commission presented a communication regarding a common policy to combat illegal immigration. Based on this, an overall plan was drawn up for combating illegal immigration and human trafficking. The plan was adopted by the Council at the meeting on justice and home affairs on 28 February 2002. The overall plan deals with a number of actions in various areas, which are to be discussed in the Council, as well as with a timetable for adopting and implementing the actions. It concerns areas such as visa policy, exchange and analysis of information, ‘pre-border’ measures, measures in respect of border controls in the broad sense of the term and readmission and repatriation policy, as well as Europol and sanctions.</p>
<p>In addition, reference may be made to two conclusions adopted by, respectively, the General Affairs Council on 15-16 April 2002 and by the Council on Justice and Home Affairs on 25-26 April 2002. The first conclusion concerns illegal immigration and the second illegal immigration by sea. The purpose of the conclusions is first and foremost to draw attention to the fact that a number of concrete and operational measures must be passed as quickly as possible so that illegal immigration – in particular illegal immigration by sea – can be combated effectively. Among other things, this is to be done by strengthening border controls. However, these conclusions also have a broader aim: namely that they are to contribute to immigration being one of the elements permanently included in the basis of the EU’s foreign policy – and, in particular, in the EU’s contacts with the countries from which the illegal immigrants come or through which they travel.</p>
<p>The main idea behind this integrated strategy is that the combating of illegal immigration must be seen in a broader context than that of the special instruments in the area of justice and home affairs. Taking this approach, we should not restrict ourselves simply to considering the adoption of measures for the prevention and combating of the phenomenon. We must also tackle the issue of the common development of, and economic assistance to, the home countries and transit countries that are affected by the major migration flows. This new strategy will also mean that the support that the third countries in question receive will be highly dependent on whether they are willing to cooperate effectively with the European Union on the prevention and control of illegal immigration.</p>
<p>This integrated strategy is an extension of the policy laid down in conjunction with the conclusions of the European Council in Tampere in October 1999. The wish in Tampere was to lay the foundations for a coherent and balanced strategy for immigration into the EU which, among other things, was to promote development in the third countries from which the immigrants originate and to strengthen the prevention and control of illegal immigration. It must also be expected that this strategy will be developed further in connection with the new instruments that are being devised at present, for example in the area of integrated management of external borders. This issue was dealt with by the Council at the meeting on justice and home affairs on 13-14 June 2002 as part of the preparations for the European Council in Seville on 21-22 June 2002, at which illegal immigration was one of the priority issues.</p>
<p>With regard to the practical measures to be agreed, the EU has always regarded entering into repatriation agreements with the illegal immigrants’ home countries and transit countries as one of the most appropriate and effective instruments for combating illegal immigration. The importance of such an instrument is recognised both in the aforementioned overall plan and in the two conclusions, and it is stressed that it will be appropriate to enter into new repatriation agreements.</p>
<p>The Commission has received mandates from the Council to negotiate six draft repatriation agreements between the European Community and Morocco, Sri Lanka, Russia, Pakistan, Hong Kong and Macau. These negotiations are currently in progress. In addition, the Council has just given the Commission a new mandate to negotiate a repatriation agreement with Ukraine.</p>
<p>The repatriation agreement with Hong Kong, which has already been initialled, is expected to be entered into officially in the next few months. The negotiations with Macau and Sri Lanka are very far advanced, and a final agreement is expected be entered into with these countries very soon.</p>
<p>Finally, reference is made to the conclusions agreed by the Council at the meeting on justice and home affairs on 25-26 April concerning the criteria to be established when a decision is to be made on the third countries with which new repatriation agreements are to be negotiated. In these conclusions, the Council calls upon the Commission to submit draft negotiation mandates with a view to entering into repatriation agreements with China, Turkey, Algeria and Albania. It is possible that other third countries will be selected later on the basis of these criteria.</p>
<p>The European Council in Seville on 21-22 June 2002 called upon the Council and the Commission to give the measures in the overall plan for combating illegal immigration the very highest priority within the frameworks of their respective powers. In particular, the European Council stressed that more rapid progress should be made on entering into the repatriation agreements that are in the process of being negotiated and that new mandates should be approved with a view to negotiating repatriation agreements with the countries already selected by the Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0437"></a>

<p>The Council has repeatedly reported on the EU’s position on Colombia here in Parliament. It will therefore be known that the Council attaches enormous importance to the situation in the country and is following developments closely.</p>
<p>The Council has always taken a constant, clear and firm attitude to Colombia. We have done this in the conviction that there is no future for Colombia without a negotiated solution. The Council has supported President Pastrana and his untiring and resolute work to achieve peace in Colombia, work which it has been possible to observe over the years. Unfortunately, it has not been possible to observe the same desire for peace among the guerrilla groups. In addition, some of the Member States have followed the negotiation process between FARC and ELN as members of the ‘group of friendly nations’ and the ‘group of facilitator countries’ respectively.</p>
<p>The Council understood and showed its respect for the decision that President Pastrana felt forced to take on 20 February 2002, partly in order to bring an end to the process that was commenced in 1998 of dialogue, negotiation and the signing of agreements with the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces – People’s Army (FARC-EP), and secondly in order to abolish the demilitarised zone.</p>
<p>Following the presidential elections on 26 May 2002 the Council noted with satisfaction the developments in the electoral process in Colombia, which showed an entire people’s desire to live in peace and freedom. However, the Council regretted that part of the civil population was not able to exercise its democratic right to vote freely due to poor security conditions which were the result of repeated terrorist attacks on the country’s democratic institutions, their representatives and the population as a whole.</p>
<p>The Council wished Colombia’s elected president, Alvaro Uribe, good luck and expressed its conviction that he would be fully able to fulfil the wishes for peace and prosperity for the whole population on the firm basis of a state governed by law and observing fully both human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Council repeated that it is working wholeheartedly to find a negotiated solution in Colombia and that it will follow the Colombian people and its government both in their efforts for justice, social progress and reconciliation for all Colombians and in their fight against terrorism, the avoidance of justice and infringements of human rights and international humanitarian law.</p>
<p>The Council has also expressed on various occasions the fact that it appreciates the work that the UN and the group of facilitator countries has carried out and which has made it possible to recreate the necessary confidence in the attempt to find a negotiated solution to the conflict. The EU has also expressed the conviction that the international community has played a very constructive and useful role in the negotiations. In addition, the EU has confirmed its desire to continue to support the international’s community’s participation in future negotiations.</p>
<p>The Council has also repeated that it rejects and condemns kidnapping, extortion and other crimes committed by the armed groups in Colombia and it has several times urgently appealed for the observance of international humanitarian law and protection of the civil population.</p>
<p>This is the background to the fact that, as part of the fight against terrorism, the Council has placed the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC) and the paramilitary forces in Colombia (UAC) on the EU’s list of terrorist organisations. The Council had decided previously not to reissue or renew visas for members of the armed groups and to withdraw their residence permits.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0440"></a>

<p>The Council does not have the competence to decide whether the National Hydrological Plan is compatible with specific Community legislation.</p>
<p>As far as the Community is concerned, Article 6 of the EC Treaty states that environmental protection requirements must be integrated into the definition and implementation of the Community policies and activities. The National Hydrological Plan is a plan for national water resources submitted to the Commission by the Spanish Government. It is therefore the Commission which, as guardian of the treaties, must investigate whether the National Hydrological Plan gives cause for questions in connection with specific Community legislation, and it is the Commission which, in that case, must take the necessary measures.</p>
<p>The EU attaches huge importance to a positive result’s being achieved at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, which is a follow-up to the WTO’s fourth ministerial conference in Doha and the Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey. These two conferences must be regarded as essential milestones in the pursuit of internationally agreed objectives and as further commitments in this respect. The EU wishes to build on the positive results of these two conferences and intends fully to play its part so that far-reaching, practical and meaningful results are achieved in the negotiations in Johannesburg, in line with the EU’s internal and international obligations in respect of sustainable development.</p>
<p>So that the Honourable Member might obtain a more comprehensive overview of the preparations for the Summit in Johannesburg and of the EU’s intentions it is suggested that he look at the Council’s conclusions of 30 May 2002 and of 4 and 17 June 2002 concerning the external dimension of the EU’s strategy for sustainable development and concerning preparations for the Summit.</p>
<p>Very intense preparatory negotiations are being conducted both at international level and within the EU. The European Council in Seville supported the Council’s conclusions regarding the World Summit on Sustainable Development, namely the conclusions of 4 March, 30 May and 4 and 17 June, and also the general positions adopted by the European Union in this connection. It stressed that the European Union has undertaken to work towards a successful World Summit on Sustainable Development and remains committed to playing an important role in the preparations for the Summit so that a global agreement can be achieved based on the positive results in Monterrey and Doha.</p>
<p>The European Council emphasised the European Union’s desire for clear and practical political commitments to be entered into in Johannesburg with a precise timetable, the implementation of which is to be based on real partnership.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0460"></a>

<p>The Council agrees that the recent deterioration in Indo-Pakistani relations is extremely worrying, and that it is urgent to find a solution to the disputes between the two countries, including on Kashmir.</p>
<p>Over the past weeks, the EU has stepped up its diplomatic efforts to defuse the crisis. Visits to the region, including by Commissioner Patten, UK Foreign Minister Straw, [and, most recently by HR Solana,] as well as regular telephone contacts by other leading EU politicians with the key actors are taking place. The EU is also seeking close coordination with other international players, including the US, Russia, and Japan in order to reinforce the concerted efforts of the international community. The EU has repeatedly urged India and Pakistan in public statements to de-escalate the present level of tensions, to resume their dialogue and to solve peacefully, on the basis of the Simla agreement and of the Lahore declaration, the various issues of contention between them, including Kashmir.</p>
<p>The Council does not, however, believe that the EU could act as a facilitator as long as India continues to reject outright the principle of third party involvement, be it by the EU, the US, the UN or others. Any facilitator can only play a role if he is accepted by both sides. But the EU will continue to encourage and to support any negotiated solution between the two countries, and will convey privately the message that it stands ready to facilitate talks if both sides so wish.</p>
<p>The European Council, meeting in Seville on 21 and 22 June 2002, discussed the tensions between India and Pakistan, and subsequently adopted an EU Declaration. In this Declaration the European Council, inter alia, welcomed the recent de-escalatory steps taken by Pakistan, called on Pakistan to take further concrete action in accordance with its international obligations and encouraged India to respond with further de-escalatory steps. The EC noted the importance of free, fair and inclusive elections this autumn in Jammu and Kashmir. The European Council called on India and Pakistan to establish an effective monitoring system, in a form acceptable to both, to stop infiltration. Lastly, the European Council called on both parties to adhere to the NPT and to sign and ratify the CTBT.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0464"></a>

<p>Recently, the gradual reduction in CAP agricultural subsidies has been confirmed by accounting data from the preparation of the Community Budget (see Early Warning System No 3/2002 and 4/2002) showing reduced amounts in subcategory 1a and 1b, which are mainly restricted to agricultural products from Mediterranean regions, such as wine, oil, tobacco, mutton and lamb etc.</p>
<p>In the Council’s view, what are the justifications for reductions in these subsidies?</p>
<p>Has the Council considered the possibility that these reductions will not apply to the EU's total agricultural production, but will continue to focus on categories of agricultural products from the southern agricultural areas of the European Union, thus affecting mainly and exclusively the agricultural production of Mediterranean products?</p>

<p>1. The budgetary authority is preparing the agricultural budget based on the agricultural guideline and the financial estimates prepared for each financial year in accordance with the rules of the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p>When the Commission prepares its estimates of grant usage it also draws up an expenditure profile for each individual agricultural financial year. The estimates of monthly payments from the EAGGF’s Guarantee Section are shown by this profile, which is generally based on the Member States’ grant usage in the three preceding years.</p>
<p>According to Early Warning System 4/2002, the Member States’ agricultural expenditure in a number of sectors – including agricultural products from the Mediterranean region – in the period up to 28 February 2002 were below budget. However, the Commission estimates that the differences both in the sectors that have had underusage and in the chapter on rural development will be evened out by the end of the financial year. However, this does not apply to the differences for sheepmeat and beef and veal, which will be below the grants budgeted.<a href="#defann_8_1" name="refann_8_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p>Account is also to be taken of the fact that, according to the expenditure profile, the expected level of usage up to February is just 36% in the sector of fruit and vegetables and in the wine sector, and just 18% in the chapter on rural development. The departures mentioned in Early Warning System 4/2002 are thus very insignificant at this point in the financial year.</p>
<p>2. The gradual reduction of the direct subsidy to certain sectors forms part of the measures that the Council approved in July 1999 in connection with the reform of the common agricultural policy in Agenda 2000.</p>
<p>As far as the future legal provisions for the sectors mentioned by the Honourable Member are concerned, the Council is awaiting a report on the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy which the Commission promised to submit when the reform was approved. The Council will then look at the legislative proposal presented by the Commission with a view to adapting the provisions in respect of a number of sectors.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The EU is fully behind the harmonious and gradual integration of the developing countries into the world economy. With a view to this, the European Council again confirmed in Seville that it intends that the ministerial declaration from Doha and the Monterrey consensus document will be implemented fully within the specified time scales.</p>
<p>This consensus document, which contains a section on international trade as a driving force for development, nonetheless recognises that there is also a need for multilateral aid in order to alleviate the consequences of falling export revenues in the countries that are still highly dependent on raw materials exports. In this connection the Council agreed on 4 July in its common viewpoints in respect of the World Summit on Sustainable Development that where the countries have experienced effects from outside – e.g. sharp price falls for their export goods – there is a need for supplementing at the completion point in order to ensure a lasting way out of an unsustainable debt situation.</p>
<p>The Community strongly supports the international cooperation on raw materials, including in the area of coffee. It therefore participated actively in the negotiations on the new international agreements on coffee, jute and cocoa in the past two years and subsequently entered into the agreement on coffee and the agreement on jute. As a party to the international coffee agreement of 2001, the Community is working for the development of a sustainable economy in the area of coffee and to find methods of achieving a reasonable balance between supply and demand at global level on a basis that both secures sufficient supplies of coffee to consumers at reasonable prices and markets for coffee at prices that provide the producers with a reasonable income. Within the International Coffee Council, therefore, the Community has expressed its satisfaction with, and participated actively in, the development of the quality coffee initiative and will work closely together with and provide full support to the International Coffee Organisation in connection with implementation of the initiative. This initiative will be fully operational from 1 October this year.</p>

<p>The Council is not in the habit of commenting on politicians’ public statements. In this case, the Council would remind the Honourable Member that the Council is not competent to amend the treaties. Only the Intergovernmental Conference has such competence.</p>
<p>In order to secure the broadest and most transparent preparations possible for the next Intergovernmental Conference, the European Council decided, at the meeting in Laeken, to convene a convention which will bring together the major parties in the debate on the future of the EU and which will investigate the essential issues connected with the future development of the EU and find the various possible solutions to these issues. The convention started its work on 28 February 2002 and is continuing to work within the frameworks of the mandate given.</p>
<p>Where the Council’s organisation and method of functioning are concerned, the Spanish Presidency has already had the opportunity to present its plans to the European Parliament and to give an account of the changes that it intended to submit to the European Council meeting in Seville without amending the existing treaty and with the aim of achieving the progress and improvements that are already possible within the existing frameworks.</p>
<p>At its meeting in Seville on 21-22 June 2002, the European Council passed a number of measures in respect of the structure and working processes of the Council. These measures form part of the reform process that was started in Helsinki in December 1999, when the European Council passed a number of recommendations, and since then in Gothenburg and Barcelona, where it noted the reports by the Secretary-General/High Representative which concern four main points, one of them being the presidency of the Council.</p>
<p>In addition, the European Council familiarised itself with a report from the presidency on the discussions in progress concerning the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. It observed that, generally, there is a desire to take this issue further, but in such a way that any adjustment to the current system of rotating six-monthly presidencies should in all circumstances continue to maintain the principle of equality between the Member States. The European Council therefore called upon the forthcoming Danish Presidency to take suitable measures with a view to continuing the deliberations so that an initial report can be presented at the European Council meeting in December 2002.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0481"></a>

<p>In so far as the issue of asylum is concerned, the Council has fulfilled a significant portion of the mandate in Article 63 of the EC Treaty, even though agreement has still not been reached concerning the more sensitive part.</p>
<p>Within the last two years, the Council has adopted a decision on the setting up of the European Refugee Fund, as well as a Directive on temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons.</p>
<p>The Council has also arrived at a general approach to a Directive on reception conditions for asylum seekers. A large number of the amendments tabled by the European Parliament have been included in the text which it will be possible to adopt formally before long.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Council has adopted a regulation on the setting up of Eurodac, with a view to comparing asylum seekers’ fingerprints, and another regulation on the establishment of certain conditions of implementation.</p>
<p>There are three proposals which are to be adopted by the Council before 1 May 2004, and the Seville European Council requested that they be adopted even sooner than that.</p>
<p>Firstly, there is the proposal for a Regulation establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national. The European Parliament issued its opinion on 9 April 2002, and the Council will take due note of this.</p>
<p>At the meeting on 13 June 2002, the Council debated in detail the political issues isolated by the Presidency in connection with this proposal, and it called upon its various bodies to continue with the work so that the Council might reach political agreement within the very near future. The Seville European Council urgently recommended that agreement be reached by December 2002. It is therefore one of the Danish Presidency’s priorities to reach such an agreement.</p>
<p>Then there is the proposal for a Directive on the recognition of third-country nationals and stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection. The Seville European Council earnestly recommended that the proposal be adopted in June 2003. The negotiations concerning this proposal will also be given high priority by the Danish Presidency.</p>
<p>Finally, on 20 June 2002, the Commission submitted an amended proposal for a Directive on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status. The Commission presented its first proposal in October 2000. The European Parliament issued its opinion on 20 September 2001. At the meeting of the RIA Council on 27 September 2001, the Member States referred to the need to introduce simple, rapid, effective and fair asylum procedures. On 6 December 2001, the Council adopted conclusions concerning this issue and laid down a list of guidelines for the future directive. It then called upon the Commission to submit an amended proposal on procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status. This request was repeated at the European Council meeting in Laeken. The Seville European Council urgently recommended that this proposal be adopted at the end of 2003.</p>
<p>At its Seville Summit, the European Council emphasised that the short- and medium-term arrangements for a common way of dealing with migration flows had to maintain a reasonable balance between, on the one hand, the resolute combating of illegal immigration and human trafficking and, on the other hand, an integration policy for those immigrants who had taken up residence legally and an asylum policy upholding the international conventions including, above all, the Geneva Convention of 1951.</p>
<p>The EU’s efforts in this area must be based upon certain principles, for example the principle that legitimate aspirations to a better life must be compatible with the EU’s and the Member States’ capacity for receiving refugees and the principle that immigration must be dealt with in accordance with the legal procedures introduced for this purpose.</p>
<p>The Danish Presidency will continue with the negotiations concerning proposals already tabled by the Commission in connection with the future common asylum and refugee policy and also concerning proposals by the Commission in connection with immigration policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0484"></a>

<p>I should like to give a joint answer to the two questions concerning the events in Venezuela on 11 April and the EU’s declaration of 12 April concerning these. The Council has already provided Parliament with both an oral and a written report on the matter, but I am happy to repeat the most important aspects of these.</p>
<p>On Friday 12 April, it was reported from Venezuela that President Chavez had resigned. Spain, which held the Presidency of the European Union, issued a declaration expressing concern about the situation in Venezuela. This initiative was taken in accordance with Article 18 of the Treaty on European Union which lays down, for example, that “The Presidency shall represent the Union in matters coming within the common foreign and security policy” (Article 18[1]) and that “The Presidency shall be responsible for the implementation of decisions taken under this Title” (Article 18[2]). As is customary with the Presidency’s declarations, all the European partners were duly informed of this initiative.</p>
<p>The Presidency declared that, together with its European partners, it was following the course of events in Venezuela. The Presidency vigorously condemned the loss of human life and expressed sympathy with the families of the victims. The Presidency also expressed its full support for, and solidarity with, the population of Venezuela and earnestly called for all acts of violence to be brought to an end.</p>
<p>Finally, an appeal was made to the transitional government to respect democratic values and institutions in such a way as to overcome the crisis within the framework of national agreement and on the basis of full respect for fundamental rights and freedoms. That is no declaration of confidence in the transitional government. In diplomatic language, it is a disguised warning that the crisis must be resolved within the framework of the democratic institutions.</p>
<p>Since then, the Council has used the opportunities offered by its links with Venezuela to express its satisfaction with the restoration of the democratic institutions and with President Chavez's guarantees that the opportunity for necessary dialogue would be created so that the population of Venezuela might develop a fully-fledged democracy.</p>
<p>The Council has repeatedly emphasised that it attaches importance to the development of the principle of the rule of law and full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, specifically including freedom of expression and freedom of the press.</p>
<p>The Council has also expressed the hope that all of Venezuela’s political and social players, together with the media, might be in a position freely and responsibly to carry out their work with a view to creating the necessary climate, characterised by tolerance.</p>
<p>Finally, the Council has expressed its full support for the Inter-American Democratic Charter, as well as for the efforts of the Organisation of American States in connection with the situation in Venezuela.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0507"></a>

<p>The Council is well aware of the repressive measures mentioned by the Honourable Member of the European Parliament.</p>
<p>At its meeting of 17 June, the Council reached a political agreement on negotiating directives for a Trade and Cooperation Agreement with Iran. It established a close link and parallelism between the Agreement and separate instruments on political dialogue and the fight against terrorism. At the same time, the Council in a statement reiterated i.a. its expectation that the deepening of economic and commercial relations between the EU and Iran should be matched by similar progress in all other aspects of EU–Iran relations. Among the areas of concern, the Council mentioned specifically the need for Iran to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms including through reform of its judicial system.</p>
<p>The need to reinforce democratic principles and institutions and respect for human rights is also explicitly mentioned as an aim of the political dialogue.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms must, as in all other Agreements which the EU concludes with third countries, be one of the “essential elements” of an Agreement with Iran. A breach by any of the two parties can result in the suspension of the Agreement.</p>
<p>The Council is confident that the Trade and Cooperation Agreement and the other instruments linked to it will enhance the EU's possibilities to exert influence and to support reforms in Iran. As a matter of fact, the Council, when agreeing on the opening of negotiations with Iran, agreed that the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, political dialogue and counter-terrorism should be considered as an indissociable whole, with parallel entry into force, application and denunciation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0509"></a>

<p>The Member States that have currently ratified the EU-South Africa Trade and Development Cooperation Agreement (TDCA) are (date in brackets): Germany (06/03/2002), Denmark (08/06/2001), Ireland (29/04/2002), Netherlands (10/04/2001), Sweden (13/07/2000) and Finland (31/05/2002). The other Member States are in the process of ratifying.</p>
<p>The TDCA that was signed on 11 October 1999 has already entered into force on a provisional basis. Therefore, the delay in ratification does not hinder the implementation of its provisions. Moreover, South Africa is a qualified member of the Cotonou Agreement, so discussions could also be held under this framework if the Parties so desired.</p>
<p>In fact, on 7 June 2002, the second Cooperation Council was successfully held in Brussels. The two Parties discussed development cooperation, the follow-up to the second Trade Co-operation Committee meeting that took place the preceding day, the implementation of the Wines and Spirits Agreement, a report on the implementation of the Science and Technology Agreement and the potential impact of EU enlargement on the TDCA and on EU-SA relations.

<p>The Danish Presidency regards the question of providing access to all citizens to education and training in a lifelong context a priority to be addressed at European level.</p>
<p>This objective is not just reflected in the Council resolution on lifelong learning adopted on 30 May in the Council (Education) but also in the Objective Report adopted at the Council (Education) on 12 February 2001 - endorsed by the European Council in Stockholm March 2001.</p>
<p>It is recalled that the Resolution in its last paragraph invites the Member States and the Commission within the framework of their responsibilities to suggest concrete actions to implement its content, by promoting cooperation between all key actors and within the scope of the Treaty.</p>
<p>In this context the Presidency will take any appropriate steps to facilitate the task of the Member States and the Commission.</p>
<p>The Council and the Commission are jointly discussing how to implement the various objectives in the area of education and training at European level in a coherent manner in order to be able to report of progress to the European Council of spring 2004.</p>
<p>The results of this discussing will hopefully lead to:</p>
<p>Identification of indicators and benchmarks on the various objectives where appropriate and relevant,</p>
<p>Initiation of concrete activities in Member States targeting the various objectives according to nationally determined needs, including the needs of more disadvantaged groups,</p>
<p>Launching of a new initiative by the Commission directed towards creating a European Knowledge Area and the use of existing instruments at European level, for instance the education and training programmes, the Social Fund and the European Investment Bank.</p>
<p>Concerning the latter the Presidency will recall that it is up to the Member States to identify projects suitable for using the resources of the European Investment Bank.</p>
<p>Furthermore the Presidency points to initiatives already launched by Member States. In spring 2001 a joint report on basic skills elaborated by Portugal, UK, Ireland and Denmark was forwarded to the Swedish Presidency prior to the spring meeting of the European Council in Stockholm. This work, extended by participation of The Netherlands and Spain, is now in its second phase.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0511"></a>

<p>According to Amnesty International, the promise of human rights reform has not been realised in Indonesia and human rights violations continue to be carried out in the provinces of Papua and Aceh. It is claimed that the new government has demonstrated a reluctance to hold perpetrators of human rights violations to account, including those suspected of committing crimes against humanity and other serious crimes in East Timor in 1999.

<p>The Council has taken note of the reports of Amnesty International. The EU has offered firm support for the process of democratisation in Indonesia and has established a wide-ranging and frank dialogue with the Indonesian Government. It has welcomed the Government's efforts to bring to justice those accused of violating human rights and international humanitarian law, including through the recent establishment of a tribunal to put on trial those accused of such violations in East Timor. It is clearly important that this tribunal meet international standards of justice and equity. The Union was glad to see that a consensus statement on this subject emerged out of the UN Commission on Human Rights. The Council will continue to monitor progress on this and other issues concerning democracy and good governance in Indonesia and looks forward to maintaining its dialogue on these issues with the Indonesian Government.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0512"></a>

<p>The Commission press release referred to by the Honourable Member was issued at the time of the Final Round Table on Agriculture and Food organised jointly by the Commissioner in charge of Health and Consumer Protection and by the Commissioner in charge of Agriculture and Fisheries. The round table in question was the concluding event of a year-long strategic dialogue on agriculture and food policy in Europe, involving a wide range of stakeholders. The key over-arching messages put forward by participants during this wide debate were the need to develop an integrated approach to food quality, at all stages within the food chain from the farm to the fork, and also to develop a consumer focus on quality. These are concerns the Commission fully shares.</p>
<p>As the press notice indicates, in his concluding remarks to the final Round Table, the Commissioner in charge of Agriculture and Fisheries stated that it would be a challenge to envisage schemes which give incentives to quality production as part of Community rural development policy under the second pillar of the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP). The idea is of interest. (The more detailed quote the Honourable Member cites in his question is in fact a suggestion which was put forward by several participants in these Round Tables and is not directly attributed to the Commission.)</p>
<p>The results of this strategic dialogue have been an important contribution to reflections on a number of upcoming European policy initiatives including, for agriculture, the forthcoming mid term review of the CAP where proposals will shortly be presented to the Commission for adoption (in principle on 10 July). The mid-term review will take the form of a Commission Communication which will, of course, be forwarded to the Parliament and to other Union institutions as soon as the Commission adopts it.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0470"></a>

<p>Monitoring of pesticide residues in food in the Community is done in two ways: a Community-wide harmonised monitoring programme is complemented by more extensive national monitoring programmes.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that the national programmes should take into account the very different country-specific characteristics. Differences mainly exist in eating habits of consumers, production of crops, the market share of domestic and imported products and the authorisation situation of plant protection products. The Member States are in a far better position to set their national priorities based on these factors. For this reason the Commission does not propose to harmonise national monitoring programmes.</p>
<p>While the Commission agrees that all pesticides should be considered when planning monitoring programmes and in setting priorities, it does not agree that all pesticides ought necessarily to be monitored as a general rule. Each country should have a clear system of prioritisation to select the relevant compounds.

<p>In 1999, Greece only recorded expenditure for Anticipated old-age pensions (986452911 GRD) and Early retirement benefit for labour market reasons (6108053 GRD). The total pensions expenditure was 4 842 659 185 GRD, in 1999.</p>

<p>Far from “gagging” officials, the Commission has always followed the regime, introduced by the European Institutions in 1999, which obliges officials to report concerns about suspected wrongdoing<a href="#defann_37_1" name="refann_37_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> – as a matter of duty – either within their Institution or direct to OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office. This regime also gives specific assurances to staff that they will face no adverse consequences for making such reports. No officials who have fulfilled their duty within these provisions have been “punished”.</p>
<p>The Commission has recently adopted a decision in the context of its administrative reform which proposes inclusion of these arrangements in the Staff Regulations and also makes provision for staff, subject to certain reasonable conditions, to go outside their own Institutions and raise concerns with the Presidents of the Court of Auditors, or the Council, or the Parliament, or the Commission, or the Ombudsman<a href="#defann_37_2" name="refann_37_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The case to which the Honourable Member appears to be referring does not relate to an “auditor”. If the Honourable Member is referring to a woman official who was the accounting officer, however, the Commission would point out that whistleblowing rules relate specifically to concerns about wrongdoing (fraud, corruption, other illegal activity and serious professional failures). Neither in their design nor detail do these rules relate to internal differences of opinions. The Commission underlines the fact that its officials can and should raise any such differences within the Institution, in keeping with the necessary and relevant provisions of the Staff Regulations, which the Commission seeks to apply reasonably.</p>
<p>Like other public bodies in democracies, the Commission does not regard generalised allegations to be prima facie “whistleblowing on undesirable situations”. Whilst reported concerns about alleged wrongdoing are treated with complete serious and appropriate action, it would not be justifiable, sensible or in the public interest to regard generalised allegations against any public body to automatically be valid. Just as the Commission always acts on the basis of the presumption of innocence of individuals, the Institution – like others – has the right to require the observance of reasonable rules of conduct and of appropriate procedures for argument and for reporting concern. Democracy and openness are essential principles which the Commission values and seeks to put into practice. However, those principles are not necessarily fulfilled by allegations and denunciations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On 16 October 2001, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the European Year of Education through Sport 2004.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Article 251 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Parliament and the Council were forwarded this proposal from the Commission, which is currently being discussed in the various institutions. The proposal has been warmly welcomed. The decision is due to be formally adopted in the second half of 2002.</p>
<p>The general objective of the European Year of Education through Sport is to encourage a strong partnership between academic institutions and sports organisations in order to improve the use of sport as an educational tool.</p>
<p>As long as the projects put forward contain educational values that are in line with the objectives of the decision, they will be retained, whatever the project’s sporting discipline. Therefore, disciplines that receive the least media coverage are likely to provide a major contribution to the objectives of the European Year of Education through Sport. The deciding factor will not be that of the sporting discipline, but that of the quality of projects.</p>
<p>There is also likely to be a wide variety of organisations taking part in the European Year of Education through Sport. Sports organisations, clubs, national or international federations will primarily be involved. However, other players, such as schools, youth clubs, education and training bodies or national authorities will also have a major role to play. Pursuant to Article 4 of the draft decision, each Member State may appoint one or more relevant bodies to be responsible for participation in the European Year of Education through Sport and for coordinating actions at national level. In the name of the subsidiarity principle, the Commission hopes to closely involve national or regional authorities, as well as sports and educational organisations, in implementing the European Year of Education through Sport 2004.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0501"></a>

<p>The Commission is aware of the event referred to by the Honourable Member. Commission’s services were informed immediately, on a voluntary basis, by the British authorities of the essential facts concerning the event:</p>
<p>The collision between a heavy goods vehicle and the locomotive of a train carrying an empty nuclear fuel flask took place at a level crossing close to Dungeness nuclear power station. The collision was slow speed and there was no damage to the fuel flask, no leakage of radioactive materials and no risk to the public. Nevertheless, as a precautionary measure, the emergency arrangements were activated.</p>
<p>The event is rated at level 0 according to the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES) which means that the event is considered without safety significance from a radiological point of view and is rated below scale as ‘deviation’ on a scale ranging from level 1 to level 7.</p>
<p>Transport of irradiated nuclear fuel has been carried out for the last 35 years, by rail, road and sea by several countries that use nuclear power. As far as the Commission is aware, in that period there has never been an accident which has caused death or serious injury to persons, nor significant harm to the environment from radiological cause when the transport has taken place in accordance with the regulations established by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</p>
<p>The Department for Transport is responsible in the United Kingdom for certifying that flask designs and associated transport arrangements comply with the requirements of the statutory regulations which are based on the IAEA regulations. This requires a detailed evaluation of the safety case which organisations who consign irradiated fuel for transport are required to submit as evidence that their flask designs and proposed safety arrangements meet the standards.</p>
<p>The flasks used for the transport of irradiated nuclear fuel are designed to withstand severe accidents without releasing their contents. For example, they are designed to withstand a major train accident at high speed.</p>
<p>Applicable Community legislation to such events is as follows:</p>
<p>under Title IX of Directive 96/29/Euratom of 13 May 1996<a href="#defann_40_1" name="refann_40_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, emergency plans must be drawn up and regularly exercised by the companies involved in nuclear fuel flask transport;</p>
<p>under Directive 89/618/Euratom of 27 November 1989,<a href="#defann_40_2" name="refann_40_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> the implementation of emergency exercises requires that the population likely to be affected be involved in order to be prepared would such a radiological accident occur;</p>
<p>should the consequences of an accident necessitate large-scale actions to protect the general public, the Member State concerned must urgently notify the Commission according to Council Decision 87/600/Euratom<a href="#defann_40_3" name="refann_40_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission has no official information on an intention to build a terminal for oil, ammonia and methanol at Vysotsk, north of Primorsk, in the Gulf of Vyborg.</p>
<p>It has discussed the issue of safety and emergency response measures for the newly built oil port of Primorsk on several occasions with Russia. After expressing its strong initial concern, we later welcomed the cooperation on this issue between Russia, Finland and Estonia that has been confirmed from all sides involved.</p>
<p>The Commission regularly discusses progress on the application of international environmental conventions in Russia, including the Espoo Convention, for example in the recent meetings of the Environment Sub-Committee under the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.</p>
<p>If the media reports are confirmed that a new terminal is to be constructed without proper consultation with the neighbours concerned, the Commission will raise this issue and express its concerns in the framework of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.</p>
<p>In the framework of a study on Baltic pipeline systems funded by TACIS (Project ERUS 9511), the environmental impact of possible shipping accidents and oil spills on the environment has been analysed in great detail.</p>

Nowadays it is frequently the case that travellers are abroad for longer than 30 days.

<p>Article 75 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement provides that persons may carry the narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances that are necessary for their medical treatment provided that they can produce a certificate issued by a competent authority.</p>
<p>This Article only refers to medicines that contain substances mentioned in international conventions on drugs and are hence governed by national legislation on drugs.</p>
<p>However, Article 75 of the Convention does not apply to other categories of medicines which make up the vast majority of medicines on the market.</p>
<p>The Agreement stipulates that a doctor may prescribe narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances for travelling purposes for a maximum period of 30 days.</p>
<p>Some journeys may, of course, last longer than 30 days, but this provision must be seen as a measure to protect the traveller who is in possession of the substances regarded as drugs. It is the doctor’s certificate that proves the substances are carried for medical reasons.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this restriction does not rule out the fact that, whilst away, the traveller can visit another doctor who could, if necessary, prescribe medicines containing narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances thus enabling the person to stay more than 30 days. In this case, the certificate will prove the need for these substances.</p>

<p>The Commission shares the concerns expressed about the use of child labour in the production of sport equipment. It condemns all forms of child exploitation as well as the worst forms of child labour. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union recognises, in Article 24, the rights of the child and therefore the need to promote the well-being of children. The Commission is strongly supporting the promotion of Core Labour Standards, including combating child labour. The Commission has adopted on 18 July 2001 a Communication on promoting Core Labour Standards and social governance in the context of globalisation. In this Communication the Commission is proposing an integrated strategy covering the strengthening of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), more technical cooperation with the ILO, including Core Labour Standards in agreements with third countries and voluntary initiatives (Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)).</p>
<p>In that context the Commission has renewed its cooperation with the ILO by an exchange of letters signed on 14 May 2001. The Commission is willing to co-fund ILO Programmes on promoting Core Labour Standards, including combating child labour. In the recent past the Commission has supported the ILO International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour but difficulties on the ILO side related to differences in technical and financial regulations have prevented the full implementation of the Community contribution. The Commission hopes that these difficulties will be solved in the near future. There are intensive contacts with the ILO in order to overcome these problems.</p>
<p>However, the Commission has no powers to ensure that ILO Conventions number 138 and number 182 are complied with by European based sports companies, nor to ensure that all children are given the opportunity to receive education, health care and food in developing countries. It will send informal recommendations to the FIFA and enter into political dialogue on this issue with developing countries which have committed themselves to apply the ILO Core Labour Standards in the bilateral and multilateral agreements concluded between the Community and these countries.</p>
<p>The Commission has no specific powers to ensure the monitoring of the Code of Practice. It will ask FIFA how it intends to comply with the prohibiting of child labour . The Commission is intensifying its efforts to promote CSR. The link between CSR and ILO core labour standards is a key issue for the Commission.</p>
<p>The Commission will adopt soon a Communication on CSR and will intensify its dialogue with stakeholders including social partners, civil society and others.</p>
<p>The FIFA code of labour practises concerning child labour is indeed a CSR initiative.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0517"></a>

<p>The recent statistics presented at the UN world food summit are horrifying. Across the world, 800 million people are starving and over 24 000 of them are dying every day of starvation. These figures represent the officially recorded victims of hunger, while the average American consumes annually as much food as 300 people in Africa. However, the facade of the 'prosperous society' conceals starving people and beggars searching through rubbish in order to appease their hunger in the metropolises of developed countries. This is the barbaric world created by the 'new order' and globalisation.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the situation in the EU itself is no better, what measures does the Commission intend to take to combat global hunger and to rid the metropolises of its Member States of the sight of wretched people begging or sifting through rubbish?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is fully aware of the problem of poverty, starvation, and food insecurity at the global level, particularly in developing countries.</p>
<p>The Union has put the reduction – and the eradication – of poverty as its overarching objective for aid to these countries. It has also identified rural development and food security as one of the six priority areas for the implementation of its assistance. This implies that all the Union’s aid instruments and policies are geared towards reducing food insecurity and combating poverty in all developing countries.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that the best way to bring about food security is to pursue a broad based policy for sustainable development and poverty reduction at the national level. Promoting broad based growth and poverty reduction will in fact address the root causes of the food security problem by bringing the issues of food availability, access to food, responses to food shortages and nutritional problems to the centre of poverty reduction strategies. In addition, the political dimensions of food insecurity need to be tackled head on by giving greater attention to promoting good governance, preventing conflict and building peace.</p>
<p>Within the Union, it has also to be recalled that following the inclusion under Article 137 of the EC Treaty of the fight against exclusion among the social policy provisions, the Lisbon European Council agreed on the need to take steps to make a decisive impact on the eradication of poverty by 2010. To this end, it was also agreed that Member States’ policies for combating social exclusion should be based on an open method of co-ordination combining common objectives, National Action Plans and a programme presented by the Commission to encourage co-operation in this field.</p>
<p>All Member States subsequently committed themselves at the Nice Summit to developing their policy priorities in fighting poverty and social exclusion on the basis of four commonly agreed objectives: to facilitate participation in employment and access by all to resources, rights, goods and services; to prevent the risks of exclusion; to help the most vulnerable; and to mobilise all relevant bodies.</p>
<p>All Member States submitted in June 2001 National Action Plans for Social Inclusion covering the period mid-2001 to mid-2003 on the basis of which the Joint Council/Commission Inclusion Report was prepared and endorsed by the Laeken European Council. The process is an ongoing one and new National Action Plans will be prepared during 2003. Tackling aspects of poverty such as homelessness and begging cited in the question from the Honourable Member should form part of the National Action Plans prepared by the Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0522"></a>

One precondition for operators on the market to risk investment in the infrastructure which an extension of UMTS/3G requires is that there should be a common strategy at EU level for the implementation of the regulations currently in force, e.g. the Access Directive. The EU currently lacks such a strategy, which means that the Member States are moving at a very different rate and operators hesitate to make any further progress. A report of the current situation has been requested, but that is not enough.

<p>When preparing in the past for the roll-out of third generation mobile communications, action by the Commission was aimed at ensuring that all Member States put into place licensing modalities which would allow for interested market players to apply for licences sufficiently early to be able to start commercial services as of 2002, if wishing to do so. This effort has resulted in 61 3G licences issued in all Member States as of today.</p>
<p>All issued 3G licences contain conditions on specific coverage and roll-out obligations which were decided by national regulators.</p>
<p>Within the constraints of the licence conditions the Commission believes it is now up to the market players - and not for administrations - to decide when they intend to roll-out physical networks and when they want to offer commercial services.</p>
<p>The Commission adopted on 12 June 2002 a Communication<a href="#defann_48_1" name="refann_48_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> to the European Parliament, Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of Regions “Towards the full roll-out of third generation mobile communications” a copy of which is being sent to the Honourable Member.</p>
<p>In this Communication, the Commission analyses the current state of play of the roll-out of 3G and notes that the deployment of physical networks is presently high on the agenda of those operators who opt for an early start of commercial 3G services. The Communication notes that operators are actually already engaged in implementing the physical networks.</p>
<p>The Communication identifies as an issue of concern difficulties encountered by market players in finding base station sites and in getting base stations authorised: the Communication contains a detailed analysis and proposes actions to facilitate the roll-out of physical networks. Other measures outlined in the Communication regard notably the promotion of the development of applications and content for 3G. Efforts in this sense are, in the view of the Commission, key if 3G is to become a success.</p>
<p>Heads of States and Government have, at the Seville European Council (21-22 June 2002), recognised the importance of this issue and the Commission is committed to follow development in this area according to its conclusions.</p>
<p>Concerning the Access Directive mentioned in the question by the Honourable Member, Member States are starting the transposition process which has to be finalised by July 2003. The new framework foresees obligations of co-ordination before measures are taken at national level. These mechanisms have been proposed and adopted within the new regulatory package precisely to ensure a harmonised approach across the Union. The Commission intends to use these mechanisms even before July 2003 where needed, including if necessary for mobile communications such as 3G.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
