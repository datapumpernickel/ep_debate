<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ulla-Maj Wideroos, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. <span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(FI) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Presidency of the Council, I have the honour to present to you the draft general budget of the European Communities for the financial year 2007, which the Council adopted on 17 July 2006. This is the first budgetary procedure under the new financial framework. The transition to the new financial year should be smooth and at the same time continuity and consistency must be ensured. In this respect I believe that cooperation between both arms of the budgetary authorities, the European Parliament and the Council, will continue. I am convinced that both institutions share the same objective – to agree on the 2007 budget by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I present the draft budget adopted by the Council in more detail, I would like to recall the main principles that guided the Council’s decision-making. Firstly, I would stress that the Council complied with the new interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006 in all respects. The Council thereby reconfirmed its belief that it is very important for general budgetary discipline to be observed at EU level in the way it is at national level. Special attention was paid to the fact that the annual ceilings for expenditure endorsed in the new financial framework were to be adhered to, and that sufficient leeway was to be left for maximum expenditure under the different headings for unpredictable situations. In dealing with the budget, the main principle we employed was close assessment of specified and real expenditure needs. Although there needs to be adequate and timely financing of all the European Union’s priority areas, this does not mean that appropriations should be overestimated.</p>
<p class="contents">In its efforts to exercise impeccable and disciplined financial management, the Council has made a detailed analysis of the needs in all policy areas. Having taken stock of previous budgets, and having thoroughly examined selected activity-related reports, absorption capacity and the real requirements for 2007, the Council finally decided on a controlled increase in payment appropriations in the draft budget. It is the Council’s opinion that this level of payment appropriations is adequate and not too low.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to focus attention on the fact that the Council has consistently adhered to a bottom-up approach. Thus, the final figures in our draft budget are the result of targeted action based on objective factors. The Council’s first reading is thus in no way based on cuts made across the board. The same is also true for administration.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we adopted a comprehensive approach. In fact, we examined a number of activity-related reports by the Commission, which covered all areas of policy in the budget. Thirdly, the EU’s budgetary procedure is in need of innovation. That would be best accomplished by equal and proactive scrutiny on the part of the budgetary authorities. Without innovative budgetary solutions, we cannot enhance the Union’s competitiveness or improve administrative efficiency within the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Commitment appropriations in this draft budget total EUR 125.8 billion. This is 3.7% up on the budget for 2006. Payment appropriations total EUR 114.6 billion, which is 2.3% more than in the 2006 budget. The commitment appropriations under subheading 1a have barely been cut, as the Council believes that competitiveness and responding to global challenges is very important. The Council also proposed two new pilot projects under this subheading, one of which concerns the learning triangle, and the other of which concerns the reliability of the supply of energy to the Union. The Council will also approve the statement on pilot projects and preparatory action. Under the new interinstitutional agreement, both budgetary authorities must state their intentions regarding the pilot projects or preparatory action. The Council’s draft states that there are four special areas for priority action in the European Union in which the Council believes pilot projects or preparatory action should be implemented. Hopefully, we will achieve consensus through cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to subheading 1b, the Council adopted the commitment appropriations in the preliminary draft budget. The Council cut payment appropriations by EUR 425 million in those budget lines that relate to the completion of the programmes that were begun prior to the year 2000 and the programmes for the period 2000–2006, taking account of the current rate of implementation for them. With respect to the new programming period, the Council did not make any reductions and, furthermore, issued a statement saying that it thought it was important that the Commission should quickly approve the action programmes and projects proposed by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Under heading 2, the Council effected a limited reduction of EUR 365 million for budget lines relating to interventions in respect of all agricultural markets, except for those budget lines where the same size special deduction had already been made. There was a general principle obtaining here, which took account of former implementation rates and estimates of real needs. The Council, however, stated that agricultural expenditure and expenditure relating to international fishing agreements should be re-examined in the autumn on the basis of the Commission’s revised communication.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council left room for EUR 75 million for commitment appropriations under subheading 3a. The Council nevertheless increased appropriations in the External Borders Fund, because it regards this as a major political priority.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council raised payment appropriations under heading 4 for cross-border cooperation and reconstruction in Iraq because of their political importance. In accordance with the interinstitutional agreement, the Council left room for EUR 220 million in commitment appropriations in case of unexpected circumstances. It approved the amount proposed in the preliminary draft budget for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, which also meets the stipulations in the interinstitutional agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to heading 5, administrative expenditure, the Council adopted an overall view. It very carefully examined the appropriation needs of each institution. Administrative expenditure is nevertheless 3.4% up on the figure in the 2006 budget. The increase in the Council’s administrative expenditure was limited to 0.3%, which is worthy of note. The Council believes that it is very important to recruit new staff, in consideration of enlargement in 2004 and future enlargement too. For that reason it has approved all the newly requested measures for enlargement for the year 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the Council’s main aims has been to ensure that there is a genuine increase in productivity in the administration of the EU during the period covered by the new financial framework. To this end, the Council issued a statement on a comprehensive programme of growth in productivity in administration for the period 2007–2013. You are very well aware of the different components of the administration package. I would stress that this is an objective of the Council and not of a single Member State or the Finnish Presidency alone.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with heading 5, I would also like to remind everyone of another statement by the Council, which concerns the recruitment process connected with the 2004 round of enlargement. The Council is especially concerned about the way recruitment has slowed down this year. We expect there to be significant progress made in the recruitment process in order to achieve the greatest possible geographical balance as soon as possible. I hope that Parliament will support our intentions here and thus also our statement.</p>
<p class="contents">My assumption is that these latest demands made in respect of administration must also be capable of being applied to the Union’s institutions. The EU institutions are no different from other organisations. The EU needs to do its work as efficiently as possible. In this way we can show the public that we produce a real return for their money: value added. This requires an ability on the part of the budgetary authorities to prioritise resources. At the same time, more efficient administration increases public confidence in the work of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In the months to come, we will have to deal comprehensively with the crisis in the Middle East and the necessary EU action. Nor should we ignore the fact that the European Parliament and the Council need to think about the future and examine the Union’s global challenges in the budgetary procedure in 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to say that I am confident that our main objectives will be realised, that we will finalise the budget for the financial year 2007 in good time and that it will be adequate though not excessive. We know that this is only the first phase of the budgetary procedure, and that there is still a long way to go before the 2007 budget is finally adopted. I am confident, however, that we will be able to look at the matter from all angles so as to reach a final agreement, one that is acceptable to all parties and, above all, to the public.</p>

Thank you for that invitation, Madam President-in-Office, which enabled us to establish contact as a small group, which then became a bigger one for the first reading of the draft budget in Brussels in July.</p>
<p class="contents">As the budget rapporteur for the House, I should like to make four comments on this particular occasion: one general comment and three specific comments.</p>
<p class="contents">The first, general, comment is that since this is the first year in the financial perspective we need to think of it in terms of being a strategic base, because in this particular year we will be setting in motion a number of ideas or ways of doing things that will reverberate over the next few years up to 2013. As stated in particular in Parliament’s resolution on the Annual Policy Strategy adopted earlier this year, we need in Europe as a whole to be able to adapt more quickly to the phenomenon of globalisation, which is changing the global economy and changing the orientation of our priorities to one of ‘policy for results’ – as the President of the Commission has explained. I sense this is going to change the way in which we budget and finance what we do, and we may see the first signs of this in the 2007 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Specifically, I would like to address the question of value for money, because this marks a departure from the norm, as I understand it from the Council’s first reading, with many of the decisions on cut-backs in various areas not being done across-the-board but by taking into account the results of the activity statements produced by the Commission in particular sectors. As we shape our thinking on this we will refer back to what was set out with regard to the Annual Policy Strategy, which was that there are other elements that must be taken into account when looking at the absorption capacity of particular lines or the funds available for them.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these elements is the document produced by the Commission, the budget forecast alert, which shows how expenditure is being implemented across particular budget lines for a particular year. Another of the cost-benefit analyses we have launched in the Committee on Budgets is to look at particular areas where we think expenditure could be weak in quantitative or, in particular, qualitative terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least there are the Court of Auditors’ reports, of which we have many, on the way in which expenditure is used in particular budget areas. We are beginning to sense in the Committee on Budgets that we can bring together various elements that will indicate to us those lines where expenditure will be implemented correctly, and of which we can be sure, and perhaps also other lines of which we cannot be so sure. We certainly hope that by the end of the process, Madam President-in-Office, you will be able to align the Council with the declaration we adopted in July, at the time of the draft budget, calling for value for money to be considered in the European Union budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The second specific issue is the question of priorities. We are all aware that we have less money available under the financial perspective than we had sought in the final negotiations earlier this year, and that it therefore behoves us to look at the priorities across the different sectors. When it comes to the vote at first reading I suspect that Parliament will be following the priorities set out by Mr Böge, its rapporteur on the financial perspective. These have not changed greatly and are also set out in the resolution on the Annual Policy Strategy. That is what we are expecting for areas of research and innovation, into which we understand that the Council, in the form of the Member States, would like to invest more money, but of course there is never quite that much when it comes to the final budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the implementation of pilot projects and preparatory actions. In this field too we can think of areas in which we can spur action and in which long-term programmes could be run, in the form, perhaps, of exchanges of business and scientific personnel between the EU and China, or the EU and India. However, you cannot expect us at this stage to pick up on the ideas regarding administration. We rejected those when we discussed them at first reading in the Council, and it will take a great deal more discussion before we can come to any agreement on what to do as regards staff resources for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point is that it is very strange that often in this House we can vote on a legislative programme, as we did on the one for 2006 last December, and yet no citizen in the European Union knows what the European Union will be legislating on, because you have the Commission proposal and you then have the parliamentary resolution. In the Committee on Budgets, as stated with regard to the annual policy strategy, we are looking to bring those two processes together and to have the budget decision and the legislative decision in December, followed by a clear statement from the Commission as to what the legislative programme for the Union is, so that everyone would know what it was – not just us in this House but people all over Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I would like to thank the President-in-Office for having come today to present the draft budget. There are a lot of discussions ahead of us, but we will seek a successful outcome for this budget that takes into account the European Parliament’s priorities, as well as those of the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Janusz Lewandowski (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(PL)</span> Mr President, the work on the 2007 budget confirms the old adage that, while procedures may be repeated, there is no such thing as a routine budget. In order to round off what our rapporteur, Mr Elles, has said, I would like to mention a few of the problems which we will face in 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is not the most important, as it is a technical, analytical problem. Once again, it is basically the problem of the comparability of annual budgets. This is a budget for 27 Member States. This problem of comparability became acute when the geography of the European Union changed in 2004/2005. However, it still exists and I agree with the view that if spending on Bulgaria and Romania is not separated, a full comparison between the annual budgets will not be possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue, which is the most serious, was highlighted by Mr Elles, and is as follows: to what extent should the first year of the new financial perspective encourage us to not reflect so much on the form of the budget but on the budget priorities, namely how much continuity and how much change there should be in this first year of the new financial perspective?</p>
<p class="contents">I note a certain amount of continuity on the part of the Council, including continuing horizontal cuts, this time supported more by the so-called activity statements. I note the traditionally privileged status of the Common Foreign and Security Policy<span class="italic">.</span> However, I would like to clearly highlight the fact that the European Parliament rapporteur has a very strong mandate, from both the Commission and the whole European Parliament, to examine individual budget lines and check them from the point of view of what is known as cost-benefit analysis. This is a very strong mandate and a very strong principle which will inform the first reading of the 2007 budget in the European Parliament. This round of talks will begin tomorrow, after agreement with other committees, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">2007 is a problem in terms of implementing a new generation of multi-annual programmes based on new regulations and a new set of instruments for foreign trade. The question remains: to what extent does a potential slip-up justify the careful budgeting for 2007, something that is very visible in terms of expenditure? That was likely to have been the main reason for the point of departure being so low this time around. Spending was already below 1% of GDP in the initial draft by the Commission. The Council made further cuts of the order of 1 billion 757 million euro, which creates an extraordinary gap between the 2007 budget and the limits defined in the financial perspective for that year. In our opinion, this is not enough to fund the aims of the European Union. The European Union’s ambitions as an international player, that is, on the international arena, in terms of funding research and development make this fact clear.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of next year’s budget is also a matter of quality and motivation in terms of administrative procedures, and in this respect we are very rigorously examining and analysing the Council’s approach to the issue of employment and salaries in the European Commission. We accept the European Commission’s warning that the cuts in salaries which amount to over EUR 50 million will make recruitment, particularly from the new Member States, virtually impossible. The Council has not denied this strongly enough, and therefore the problem will be raised in the first reading in Parliament, as it is not only a question of proportionality in terms of employment, but also a problem of efficiency and motivation for the administration which is facing new challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">The differences over the approach to the 2007 budget became very clear, albeit in a friendly atmosphere, during the conciliation procedure on 14 July. A sign of these differences was, for example, the fact that no common statements were made by Parliament and Council. Of course, we also have time to agree the 2007 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, and this is my final point, it was very important to receive Minister Wideroos’ assurance which, while only verbal, is based on what was jointly included in the interinstitutional agreement, that is, that she will undertake to do all that lies within her power to ensure that the new financial regime will come into force on 1 January 2007. It is clear that the efficient implementation of the budget for 2007 depends on whether there is a new financial regime to accompany it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dalia Grybauskaitė, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, on 17 May the Commission presented the draft budget. I am not going to repeat our position. Today I should like to concentrate on presenting to Parliament the Commission’s evaluation of the Council’s first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to confirm that we very much appreciate Parliament’s attitude and the way it has worked on the 2007 budget, especially the method which is to be used by the rapporteur in respect of cost-benefit analyses and impact assessments of all proposals from the Council and the Commission. We support this. That means any proposal on radical reforms in any area. We would be happy to have a consistent approach with respect to cost-benefit analyses and impact assessments on any policies, including the recruitment of administrative staff and administrative expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, today I should like to say that we are still sticking with our proposal. We think it is realistic and grounded. We have evaluated the requirements for the 2007 budget as far as realistically possible. However, to our surprise, the Council has made disproportionately large cuts in administration at all the European institutions, including the Commission. From this point of view, there are two elements and two separate problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lewandowski has mentioned that in the 2007 budget the new Member States have been given 800 posts, but the EUR 56 million for salaries has been reduced. That means that the Commission will not be able to recruit anyone at all. The Council would like to speed up recruitment at the Commission, yet recruitment at the Commission will not be speeded up at all; the Commission will not recruit at all in 2007 if this proposal is maintained. That means somebody here is not telling the truth.</p>
<p class="contents">The second element of the budget which completely surprised the Commission was that the Council intervened in the annual budget procedure by coming forward with a multiannual approach, practically politically reopening the interinstitutional agreement which all three institutions signed in May. It is a seven-year approach to administrative costs and expenditure – a period of time which will cause the Commission to lose a minimum of three directorates-general, and will upset the geographical balance which, in line with the wishes of the Council and Parliament, the institution is supposed to keep in mind. The balance in the linguistic approach will also be upset. In addition, the structures and human resources necessary for achieving the new policies that the Council and Parliament have called for, including the new financial perspective, will not be forthcoming.</p>
<p class="contents">We were therefore surprised by the Council’s attitude, which is not based on impact assessments or cost-benefit analyses: it is based solely on arithmetic. This goes against what we are trying to achieve here at the very beginning of the new financial perspective, i.e. how we are looking at the budget and how we are looking at the efficiency of the ways we use money in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out to Parliament today that we are promising to cooperate openly and fully with Parliament in preparing its opinion for first reading. In July I promised to provide you with technical information on the proposal, which I shall do this week, hopefully by Friday. You will receive two notes on the 2007 budget and on the proposal for 2007-2013. I hope that will help all of us to achieve the final results.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to call on all those involved to be prudent, to make significant progress in respect of impact assessments, and to achieve whatever is necessary for all Community programmes to be fulfilled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
