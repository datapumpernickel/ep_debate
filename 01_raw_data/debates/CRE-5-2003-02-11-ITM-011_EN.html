<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Peijs (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, together with the rapporteur, all the groups have done their best – indeed they have already come a long way – to reach a firm measure of agreement in this dossier, and my thanks to the rapporteur for his cooperation. As we said this afternoon, it might have taken a long time, Commissioner, but, when all is said and done, we have still been much quicker than the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">A general point to begin with: the White Paper outlining the policy lines for European transport policy up to 2010 has one major shortcoming, in my opinion: it lays too much emphasis on rail transport, as if that were the only real means of transport of the future. We must be realistic, however. We cannot give the railways any greater role than they deserve or can cope with in view of their current performance. It is imperative that the liberalisation of the railways on which Parliament decided recently results in increased safety for cross-border traffic, less red tape, more customer orientation and greater predictability; not, by definition, to privatisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Conversely, road transport, and, above all, water and air transport, quite unjustifiably receive scant attention in the White Paper. The large degree of flexibility, efficiency and reliability that road transport offers have led to tremendous growth in that sector. The quality of road transport is crucial, and it is this that supports the European economy. We must therefore continue to invest in improvements, for example, by making the roads more intelligent and by developing the road network. A competitive economy for Europe stands or falls on a healthy European transport sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Inland waterway transport, which, in some parts of Europe, has greater potential to relieve the pressure on road transport than the train, is given practically no attention in the White Paper. That is very disappointing. I am pleased, therefore, that Parliament, in its reaction to the White Paper, does consider the importance of inland waterway transport as an innovative, environmentally friendly and relatively cheap mode of transport that will soon connect Eastern and Western Europe with each another. The scope for growth in this sector is still very great. Combining this with short sea shipping makes inland waterway transport a mode of transport that is really to be reckoned with.</p>
<p class="contents">Funding the transport infrastructure for all modes of transport seems to be a major problem throughout Europe. The train infrastructure, in particular, will cost citizens billions in the future. All of this will have to be funded by passing on the external costs that have to be introduced at the same time for all modes of transport. Cross-subsidising, as proposed by the Commission, is only acceptable in specific areas, such as the Alps and the Pyrenees. We are not against this, therefore, Mr Swoboda. We cannot have extra-heavy duties being imposed on road transport in order to then use the proceeds to finance the railways. This goes against the principle of the free market economy, whereby all means of transport must enjoy the same conditions of competition. It is not a good idea to use pricing as a tool, therefore, but, if it is used, it must be used fairly. The consumer pays and the polluter pays, but each should pay for his own pollution and consumption rather than those of a competing mode of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, I really cannot understand Mr Bolkestein’s suggestion that we start with new excise duties for road transport: on petrol and diesel. I disagree, because in context, all modes of transport must be treated equally, at the same time. We never promised that there were politicians who were going to impose even more duties on the trains. We are resigned to that, so, then, let us not see it happening to the roads.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should now like to take up two important points: the European Road Safety Agency and the establishment of a European transport fund. The majority of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is absolutely not rejoicing at the prospect of these two initiatives. First, the agency. It goes without saying that it is very important to increase road safety in Europe: every victim of a traffic accident is one too many. The question, however, is whether an agency is an efficient means of tackling this problem for the time being, chiefly because authority in the field of traffic safety at EU level is almost non-existent. A looser form of coordination seems to us a more suitable way. Mr President, it seems to me that the transport fund is altogether too much for countries that cannot pay for their own roads and do not want to do so in other countries either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think that the White Paper gives European transport policy a great opportunity to draw the right conclusions from the ruthless analysis that it contains. This must not be to do nothing; we cannot hide our heads in the sand, as this might well make a transport policy meltdown inevitable. The analysis is harsh and cruel and, Mrs Peijs, we have to take it on board: every day there are 7 500 km of traffic jams on Europe's roads; between 1990 and 1998, CO2 emissions increased by 15%; the amount of freight transported by rail has declined in recent years from 21% to 8.5% and between 1990 and 1996 alone, ten football fields' worth of new motorways were constructed every day.</p>
<p class="contents">We simply cannot go on like this and a sea change in transport policy is the only answer. That is why I say that the analysis in the White Paper no longer has anything to do with genuine mobility, which we want, or with a more environmentally friendly transport policy. That is why we need a radical rethink, above all on freight transport, where we need a move to rail and waterways. This is therefore about a shift to environmentally friendly modes of transport and about making sustainability our basis and our yardstick. Economic growth and transport growth must not be taken as givens either, because as transport politicians we actually also need to consider whether it is also possible to cut some traffic out altogether. In my view the White Paper tends to neglect this aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Commission has drawn the right conclusions from this analysis and that it has initiated many good measures. We have made substantial progress in rail policy and we have also made progress on maritime safety, not least – unfortunately – thanks to the <span class="italic">Erika</span> and the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">One further very complicated area is still missing and that is internalising external costs. Put into plain language, this means that not all of those who travel on the roads, by rail or on water pay the same price for what they actually use. That is why I hope that a serious proposal will be forthcoming from the Commission very soon – that we will then discuss in detail – so that we can guarantee that all modes of transport bear a fair cost burden, based on true and transparent costs.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point, Commissioner, is one that you addressed in your speech earlier. Enlargement is nearly upon us and I think that we need to do all we can to avoid repeating the same mistakes or again adopting the same unfortunate transport policies that we have seen implemented in the Member States over the last 30 or 40 years. We must not repeat these mistakes with the new Member States. That is why I believe that you have a very considerable responsibility to avoid these mistakes with the new Member States and also to work with them to put in place, at an early date, a good and fair European transport policy.</p>

Procedurally, we in the European Parliament are bound by this report. I did not envy the rapporteur. He had to integrate, reflect and summarise the different views on transport that are held in this House to enable the European Commission to derive a clear view or position. A clear report on such a broad topic with its challenging title ‘for 2010’ seemed a huge task. I was glad to be involved in the preparation with the rapporteur and the other shadow rapporteurs to create the outlines of a vision that the European Commission can go on. I am satisfied with the outlines and I believe we can move forward. Sections to quicken liberal hearts are those in the area of infrastructure charging, the passing on of external costs of the different modes of transport, the relative separation of economic growth and transport growth, greater attention to multimodal transport developments and attention to inland navigation. What I want is articulated wonderfully well and I am pleased with Mr Izquierdo’s contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I get bogged down in the Commission’s details, I should like to make further mention of the Commission’s methodology and also its objective in its White Paper. The methodology of cross-taxation with a view to transferring the pressure away from road transport to the other modes of transport must not be allowed to lead to distortion of competition in the transport market. What I want to say is that each mode of transport has its own comparative benefits, and this is what we must focus on in the first instance. I can see good opportunities in the future for rail and inland navigation, but also for coastal navigation. In short, I was pleased that Mrs de Palacio was also so positive about inland navigation this afternoon and I hope that there is sufficient attention to multimodal interchanges and quality with the use of ICT. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only a small, privileged group was able to buy goods that were produced a long way away. Nowadays the economy has experienced such a colossal increase in scale that many people work somewhere other than where they live and spend their holidays even further from home. Raw materials and semifinished and finished products are moved enormous distances from places where production is cheapest to other places where many buyers willing to pay high prices are expected. The existence of the European Union has further reinforced this trend, in part through the introduction of a common currency, great freedom for tax-free aviation and the construction of cross-border motorways.</p>
<p class="contents">For a long time it was only the benefits of this increase in scale that were stressed. It was seen as a great leap forward that the transport required was becoming comparatively cheaper and cheaper. The opinion leaders would rather not admit that growing traffic flows lead to a growing pressure on space, to air pollution, to noise pollution and to road traffic accidents. More and more people are now experiencing the drawbacks. We know now that it is important to reduce unnecessary traffic and to choose modes of transport that take up little space and pollute the environment less. So it is time to choose. Which is, coincidentally, the title of the European Commission’s White Paper on transport for 2010 that we must evaluate today.</p>
<p class="contents">Are we really making a choice? The Commission has at least tried to make a distinction on the one hand between the car and the plane, which are placing an increasing load on the environment, and on the other environmentally friendly transport by rail and water. This involves a shift in existing traffic flows and a channelling of any further growth in a way in which people and environment can reasonably survive in an increasingly densely populated area. The initial reactions of both organisations of interested parties and this Parliament were unfortunately negative. No one is against the growth of transport by train or by ship, but people were seeking equal treatment for air transport and road transport, in other words scope for them to grow at least as fast. European Union policy would therefore have to be directed at the creation of overcapacity at the taxpayer’s expense. Because of this expensive overcapacity carriers of goods would from case to case have a free hand in choosing the means of transport that is the fastest or cheapest for them at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">This overcapacity could also lead to more intense competition. This would mean that workers, especially those on the railways and in the ports, would be less certain of keeping their jobs and maintaining their incomes. They would then be played off against people in other sectors who would be no more certain of a stable supply of work. All kinds of liberalisation proposals may turn out to have a negative impact on people and their living environment. Unfortunately, it looks as though the choices that are the most desperately needed will still not have been made to the extent necessary by 2010. Then we shall be seeing the replacement of railways by motorways in the new Member States, a development that Mr Piecyk rightly warned of just now.

To summarise briefly they are the social effects, environmental and health effects and safety effects and globalisation has a part to play in this. In short, I think that the problem is accurately described in the White Paper. What we are in principle seeking of course, for environmental reasons, for example, but also for a number of other reasons, is the separation of economic growth and transport and related problems.</p>
<p class="contents">What is missing for me, and here I concur with Mr Piecyk, who was talking about avoiding traffic, is what we in the Netherlands call transport prevention or transport limitation. In the Netherlands this is absolutely an existing line of policy and I should like it to be taken seriously at European level. It is a sectoral approach. Everyone can imagine what happens if you decide to produce more regionally, for example in the agriculture sector. Then you have no need to transport any meat or transport any animals.</p>
<p class="contents">A second option of course is to tackle it with new technology. All kinds of things are possible in this regard: low emission and low energy cars, etc. Where the modal shift is concerned, I heard Mrs Peijs arguing just now that rail must not receive this stimulus from the European Union. I cannot agree with that at all. I think that it is indeed necessary, but I also think that there is an absolute need for the emission problems of rail compared with the other modes to be tackled seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">Final point: pricing. If we look at the pricing discussions to date, then I find it disappointing that, after the four years that I have been in this Parliament, after a group has worked on this subject at high level, after we have drafted the Costa report, we have still not made any advances at that level. I must say that I see more in the practical approaches, in Switzerland for example, than in the theoretical considerations. Finally, moreover, I support the standpoint concerning the expansion issues and the exhortation not to slip back into the same mistakes, as previously indicated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Within it, the environment is in our view the most important aspect. We are pleased that the Kyoto objectives take centre stage in the resolution. Its implementation seems less easy. It is only with rigorous measures that we can eradicate the area of tension between growing transport flows and increasing environmental pollution. The question is whether the EU is willing and able to take such measures: measures that have an impact on the modal split. Here too we hear arguments that this is undesirable. After all, users – the market – must choose which modes they use in the end. Nobody can or will deny that this has led to major side effects. Consequently, the correction of this movement has been legitimised and we can assent to initiatives such as the pursuit of a modal shift, cost allocation, the reduction of external effects, and transport reduction and prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not lose sight of the reality and the conditions in the market with these actions. Not all the ideal conditions will prove to be attainable. That is certainly true of the accession countries, where transport policy is moving in an undesirable direction. Even though they must develop their own infrastructure policy, the EU must provide a strong incentive to give durable modes (water, rail, pipeline) a fair chance, to avoid the constrictive situation in which the EU currently finds itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, regional development and a possible EU planning policy. It surprises me that many colleagues – who support the free market – here in particular advocate a patronising policy. In our opinion, the success of given planning situations usually has an historical or geographical origin. Attempts to imitate such success with major injections of capital are expensive and will not be capable of eradicating the differences. A European planning policy does not therefore seem sensible to us. Mr President, we have a comprehensive resolution before us. With some good and some not so good points. I therefore commend our amendments to our fellow MEPs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It gives a good basis for a more critical report in the future. We must welcome the Commission's determination for responsibility-sharing in the field of transport policy, as well as its sensitivity to the principle of involving local and regional authorities, labour unions, relevant associations and transport-users in this policy-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also pay tribute to the rapporteur where, in a comprehensive view of the overall economic, social and environmental impact, he calls on the Commission to promote best practice for transport reduction through the implementation of new production processes that will diminish the need for transport. But it is contradictory to propose, at the same time, the liberalisation and opening of markets in the railway sector, totally abandoning public services.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we cannot accept your stand on maintaining in the public sector the burden of transport infrastructure costs for safety reasons - which are absolutely obvious - abandoning financial gain to private companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Transport is crucial to economic sustainability and internal balance in any community, be it the European Union as a whole or a small country like my own.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to draw your attention to the issue of the high-speed rail link connecting Paris to Madrid through the western European corridor with its junction in the Basque country. Instead of revitalising the railway network, taking into account the clear will of the Basques, priority has been given to the high-speed rail line, promoting the environmentally unfriendly attitude already apparent in motorways policy, regardless of the external costs related to the use of this mode of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">This contradictory approach makes it entirely possible to ignore the concept so dear to the Commission of sensitive regions in the very sensitive area of the Pyrenees. As Mr Bouwman said, we should take into account what is going on in Switzerland in this field of transport.</p>

This is a well-produced piece of work on the part of the Commission which allows us to look as far forward as 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">May I also thank the rapporteur, Mr Izquierdo Collado, on his report. I think all the political groups will more or less vote the same way tomorrow on a number of points which are vital to the future of transport in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">For me personally, our guiding principles for the immediate development of European transport are to complete the single market, promote competition, especially by liberalising transport wherever it has not yet been liberalised, ensure all forms of transport are safe and prioritise environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to qualify these principles by making a few comments on some of the individual issues. First of all, the debate on trans-European networks must at some point stop being a debate and must be fleshed out, by which I mean that the trans-European networks will need to be promoted in practice and this will require political will on the part of the Member States on the one hand and both national and Community funding on the other. We therefore need to increase funding under the Community budget specifically for trans-European networks.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need to open up the railway market. The Council needs to push the second railways package through as quickly as possible on the basis of Parliament’s proposals, so that the European Union has something to show for itself in the railway sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we need to strengthen short sea shipping. This is vital, especially in certain areas of the European Union, and of course helps to protect the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, our debate must include the special role which outlying regions of the European Union and island regions need to play if there is to be a balanced development of transport networks within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, road safety. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is not united on this issue. I personally am in favour of a road safety agency, given that 40 000 people are killed on the roads of Europe every year and I think that, while respecting subsidiarity, we need to do something at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, two brief comments on measures to promote safety at sea and charging for infrastructures. We need to look at this issue but we need to be very careful because it is a rather delicate issue and, although the Commission needs to act, it needs to take careful stock before it makes any proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not a radical reform, but it will have far-reaching consequences for future transport policy. I should also like to thank Mr Izquierdo Collado, a Spaniard who has worked on this White Paper with a thoroughness of which one would usually attribute only to a German, and who has invested a great deal of energy in his report.</p>
<p class="contents">As always with such compromises, however, there are of course a number of inconsistencies that I should like to point out. paragraph 9 states that there should be some degree of shift to rail, but that under no circumstances should this negatively affect the competitiveness of road transport. It therefore needs to be stated that what we have at present is unfair competition, which needs to be redressed, precisely because certain costs associated with road transport – and in particular environmental costs – are not taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither is it a question, as it says in paragraph 10, of forcing modal shift. In any case, the shift will only affect certain sectors. Of course we need heavy goods vehicles too. But the point is that, precisely when roads are under excessive pressure and environmental costs are not being taken into account, unutilised capacity on rail should be used better. Already today I can say that even in the case of the Brenner Pass – which is so controversial – there is unutilised capacity that could be used, and that this would make a contribution to improving the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me address the issue of cross-financing. I believe that it is right to refer in paragraph 75 to the fact that what the Commission is proposing is the right way forward. This is not about an arbitrary subsidy either, but about compensating for the existing disadvantages and about strengthening a mode of transport that has unfortunately suffered in recent decades from the fact that the priority has been to consolidate the position of road transport. This is therefore simply about redressing the balance and this should be stated here.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I hope that this report, if it is adopted now, will be of genuine help to the Commission in implementing the proposals in the White Paper. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur has introduced notable improvements to the Commission proposal. The major objectives are the relief of congestion, the creation of hubs, improved safety and the promotion of sustainable transport. These are targeted primarily at the Union’s central regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind everyone of the transport needs in outlying and remote districts and regions, and geographically problematic areas. Good and viable transport links are vital for these areas, which have thin traffic flows. These needs are virtually ignored in the Commission White Paper. Account has to be taken of the special needs of sparsely populated island and mountain areas in any development of a common transport policy. Good transport links will ensure that the whole of the area of the Union remains within the scope of a functional single market and that all Union resources are spent.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention one final detail. A harsh winter has exposed a new type of safety risk in sea transportation. Consignments of oil in the Baltic Sea from Russia’s new oil port have increased in number. At the same time the risk of oil disasters in exceptionally icy conditions in winter has grown. The EU, like the International Maritime Organisation, has no agreement regarding how fit a ship carrying oil is to travel through ice. This breach in safety arrangements should be swiftly put right. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It defines priorities with a view to this shift: moving towards fair charging arrangements and acting to combat bottlenecks and environmental degradation, as well as giving a pivotal role to users. Like all the directives issued in this field, however, it is always the pursuit of liberalisation in all transport sectors that is emphasised, as if this were the only viable solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Izquierdo Collado’s report provides a series of amendments that should be supported with a view to respecting the environment. He also makes proposals for the harmonisation of fuel taxation and transport charges. With regard to road safety, I think it is good that he calls for the creation of a Road Safety Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">Since I constantly tried to draw attention to the crucial issue of funding when the directive on rail interoperability was being drawn up, I fully agree with another of Mr Collado’s proposals, that seeking to create a European Transport Fund in order to ensure that the policies proposed are financially viable and credible. As you will have understood, however, I cannot support his backing for the liberalisation processes underway.</p>
<p class="contents">We are examining directives on rail, air transport, and on nautical and technical services next week, all aiming to liberalise these sectors. We should, of course, support the call for the Commission to assess the consequences of liberalisation, as Mr Collado does. I believe, however, that we should also strengthen public services by modernising them. I believe that public services or services of general interest must be at the heart of the Union’s transport policy and must, as such, be incorporated into future Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we genuinely need to shift the balance in transport towards rail, but we still need to make far more progress on the matter of distortion of competition, which remains significant, and, in particular, we should be far more resolute in demanding a reduction in driving time for lorry drivers, which is also a condition for increased safety.</p>
<p class="contents">My group also considers that the report should be more concerned with social issues. A series of amendments has been tabled by my group, moreover, relating to the key issue of harmonisation of social standards from the top for all modes of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Transport naturally also includes maritime transport and, at a time when the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster is still at the forefront of our minds, I would like to draw your attention to the amendment tabled by my group inviting the Commission to present a legislative proposal forcing polluters – oil companies, classification companies, ship owners and charterers – to pay for all damage caused by disasters in which they are involved. I would also like to point out that the European Parliament has requested a ban on flags of convenience and I would like the Commission to take swift measures in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, you will understand that my group will wait in order to be able to take account of any progress due to the adoption of amendments before taking up a final position on this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, I would like to apologise to the Commissioner, because this is the first time in this legislature that this Member will refer expressly to his region, Andalusia.</p>
<p class="contents">Andalusia – as you know – is one of the most extensive territories of the European Union, with almost 8 million inhabitants and in 2002 it received 21 million visitors who generated EUR 13 200 million. As you know, it is one of the Union’s Objective 1 regions, with one of the lowest levels of income, but it survives thanks to agriculture and tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">The report itself talks of the substantial impact of transport on European tourism and the need to create north-south corridors in order to facilitate the free trade area between Europe and the Mediterranean, as well as the development of the outermost regions. Well, what do you make, ladies and gentlemen, of the fact that Algeciras, which is the European Union’s largest Mediterranean container port, has just one connection, by rail, with the interior, which follows a route which is more than a century old and which allows an average of no greater than 17 km/h? Did you know that the only Mediterranean coastal area in the whole of the European Union which does not have a motorway is between the provinces of Malaga and Almeria? Well, between them is located the province of Granada, which has the lowest income in Spain and in Europe. If infrastructures do not get there, how are we going to develop? These are examples of the infrastructure deficit of the peripheral regions of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">While the different Community policies allow these bottlenecks, there is little or nothing we can do to create cohesive transport and intermodality from social and environmental points of view.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that this report has not forgotten users of two-wheeled vehicles, who are extremely important in terms of individual transport and its sustainability in cities, which, thanks to them, are more human places to be. We must continue to work to increase safety standards in transport and its infrastructures, pinpointing black spots and protecting them. Ladies and gentlemen, if only for money, let us work, let us invest more in safety. One death costs us EUR 1 million and we have 40 000 deaths a year on the roads.</p>

I believe that the approach to European transport policy that is advocated in the White Paper is a good one, namely of working on the supply side to restore the balance between the transport modes by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I would ask you also to do all you can now to encourage the Greek Presidency to put the second railway package on the Council's agenda and to reach a common position, because railway policy is one of the core components of your White Paper and if we do not make progress here we can forget the whole idea, that you have stated in the paper, of getting more freight and passengers back onto rail. This is a genuine fear if the large States get together and simply say: we do not want to open up the markets; we do not want to modernise the railway structures.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that you will tell us how likely you think it is that we will still be able to conclude the second railway package in this legislative period. Because if we do not manage to do so in this parliament then the question is whether we will manage to do so in 2005, 2006 or 2007; if we do not then it will undermine the entire objective of your White Paper, namely to restore the balance between transport modes by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to our excellent rapporteur to say that my friends and I will in any case have to reject two points, the first being paragraph 66 on setting up a road safety agency. Mr Izquierdo Collado, Commissioner de Palacio has rightly stated in her White Paper that we do not want to have any legislation on road safety in the next five years. We want to take best practice and see how we can reduce the number of deaths on the roads and achieve higher levels of road safety on this basis. If there is no European legislation, what do we need a new road safety agency for? I would suggest that we should ensure that the maritime agency, the air safety agency and the railway agency do their jobs properly. But let us not have yet another agency!</p>
<p class="contents">I must say to the rapporteur that I cannot support paragraph 79, which advocates the setting up of another new transport fund, either. I say to previous speakers: it is your region and your Member State that will have to improve local public transport in your cities. We cannot spend European funds on tasks that are the responsibility of the Member States. We need the resources that we have for the trans-European networks. As it is we have too few resources here. If you take a look at what we have achieved with the Essen projects, which we agreed together in 1996, you will see that not even all 14 projects have been implemented, and we do not have enough money for them.</p>
<p class="contents">We already have the Cohesion Fund, the regional fund and the ISPA fund. Ladies and gentlemen, let us not have yet another European transport fund! We need to support the trans-European networks and leave the rest to the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our thanks go to the rapporteur for his successful consensus-building, which is always an arduous task.</p>
<p class="contents">The White Paper itself certainly deserves the epithet strategic, because it keeps in view the idea of optimising European transport as a whole and because it underpins its objective of achieving a balanced distribution of transport needs across transport modes with around 60 specific individual measures. The exact same number – exactly 60 – of specific legislative proposals are still gathering dust in the Council. That is the reality of transport policy and I think it is a scandal. Purely arithmetically speaking we are therefore practically back in 1992, at the beginning of the process of implementing the last White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to stress two points today. Firstly, we urgently need a compromise on matters concerning Galileo. There is a danger that the deadlock will call into question one of our flagship projects in transport and industrial policy. It is surely absurd that first no Member State wanted to pay and now they are arguing about whether more should be paid.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of development, we were three years ahead of the American GPS3 system. We frittered away one year, the Americans are catching up another year by pumping in huge investment, and if we do not get our skates on we will forfeit the success of the project that we are so eagerly awaiting.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is a lot of movement in the European skies and this is now reflected in our legislation. Now that the single sky project has been kicked into the right orbit, we would encourage the Commission to complete its open skies strategy, even if this runs counter to national interests, because we need a single European sky.</p>
<p class="contents">One more point to finish with: we actually ought not to have debates on transport policy every ten years, but on a continuous basis, including here in the plenary and, as we are doing today, at a reasonable hour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a hugely ambitious goal and 2010 seems a long way away but, considering the time frames for the various changes to structure and infrastructure, we can say that we are already extremely behind. From this point of view, the delay to the progress of the strategic dossier – and other dossiers too – imposed by the Transport Council is cause for concern, while we can only welcome with great enthusiasm the impetus being given by the Commission to all these issues. It is in this direction, with this aim that I feel it is worth continuing to explore what appear to be as yet theoretical, unrefined concepts, such as decoupling or the endeavour to reduce the impact of transport on development, which certainly nobody wants to limit, for in that way we will be exploring collateral policies in the field of land-use planning and in the area of optimising infrastructure through the use of new technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">It is equally important that we help to balance the choice of mode of transport by internationalising external costs and exploiting the differences in internal charges and costs for coordination of more compatible modes of transport too.</p>
<p class="contents">These are pressing, problematic matters and we are in danger of getting bogged down in them, but they are crucial and decisive for the issues we are addressing. I hope that, as has been said, the Commission communication on the methodology for charging for external costs which will allow us to establish a system of apportioning transport costs which is fairer than at present, replacing the generic charges we are currently paying with appropriate, specific charges, will not be long in coming. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All because a market logic, founded in 1992 in a White Paper behind directives on competitiveness and liberalisation, has led to our neglecting safety, the environment, social aspects and land use planning.</p>
<p class="contents">The senseless belief that liberalisation is effective, not to say perfect, has created short-sightedness with regard to the future, devalued public action and public services, condemned those who believe in the need for long-term public investment and divided funding, excluding general interest and the positive or negative effects of decisions taken in the short term. The rapporteur himself criticised this very firmly and I would thank him for that. I also support him, of course, when he says that transport is a strategic sector for land use planning and for economic and social cohesion, and when he speaks of the serious consequences for the environment. He tells us that sustainable development must comprise the basis for a European transport policy, and I agree. He calls for global transport management, and I agree. I also agree, of course, with his concern for safety and social requirements. I therefore support many of his requests, but I am very afraid that at the time of voting, the necessary electric shock will not be sufficient to cause deep-seated policy changes in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Our rapporteur speaks of the need for greater balance between modes of transport, which is good, but this is not sufficient, far from it. As I requested during the debate on the sixth FRDP, we need further research in the field. In particular, we should quickly redirect public investment by means of public borrowing, significant public borrowing. The year 2010 is in seven years and that is very close. If Europe does not want to limit itself to a list of good intentions, it must now, as of 2003, redirect all its investments and all its choices in this area by providing itself with new legislative instruments and financial resources equal to what is at stake. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is however already 2003 and tomorrow we are finally approving the report of our colleague Izquierdo Collado on the transport policy White Paper. Better late than never. The White Paper makes plans for 2010. The time for elaborating the whole package of measures is now compressed into seven years. I therefore wish the Commission good luck with its implementation of all of this. The key to very many of the objectives that the Commission is setting itself is the fair price of modes of transport and infrastructures. It is therefore high time for the Commission finally to come forward with the Pricing Directive<span class="italic">.</span> The Commission has been talking about it for a long time and there is a loud clamour for this document, not only in this Chamber, from the people who are sympathetic towards the environment and traffic safety, but also in the Member States, who are keen for the real polluter to pay.</p>
<p class="contents">A discussion that ties in closely with this is the demand for a kerosene tax. The Commission must move in this area. We cannot on the one hand have trans-European railways subsidised and on the other open the door for flights from Brussels to London for the price of a loaf of bread. The White Paper makes it possible to make a powerful response to questions of this kind. It is now up to the Commission to work faster on the proposals that must follow this White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">I want finally to repeat what I said in my maiden speech some months ago: the most environmentally friendly kilometre is the kilometre not travelled and this White Paper offers no solution for avoiding transport. This is a missed opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Frankly, I am not really convinced that our Parliamentary work benefits from the House being tied for over a year and a half to working on a document, even a document as authoritative as the White Paper – with over 400 amendments and who knows what other complications – not least in that the result is this, of necessity very brief, concise debate, in which it is difficult to address a subject of this kind. It may be better to find a new methodology for dealing with the major chapters of the White Paper and to proceed section by section. I am proposing this for the very reason that it is extremely difficult to know what to say in two minutes on such a huge subject. I will therefore focus not on what I endorse – which is a great deal, most of the White Paper – but on what I feel is still a grey area, in other words, Commissioner, the matter of Trans-European Networks.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Jarzembowski has rightly said, if we want to concentrate the Union’s efforts, including its economic resources, then let us look in that direction, in the direction of projects which are of genuine European importance. In any case, we cannot fail to notice that they are not given enough consideration in the White Paper, that the way they are dealt with is inadequate. We have updated a list of projects which are already in difficulties, falling behind schedule, which cannot proceed, but, instead of discovering why they are at a standstill and finding ways and means of speeding up their implementation, we have decided to add to this list and to do so, what is more, with projects which will require a great deal of hard work and commitment. Your idea of indicating the European interest of some of these projects was brilliant, but it has not been carried through.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end, Commissioner, by saying that there is a general need to focus more on the basic goals, concentrating particularly on matters of European Union infrastructure, urging the Member States to work to this end but directing the work and resources of our committee towards this area too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore wish to thank the Commission and the rapporteur for the work that has been done on the White Paper. We are now emphasising even more clearly what we want to achieve in terms of the environment and safety. I appreciate our now being able to make a start on this work.</p>
<p class="contents">I also appreciate, and completely support, the proposals to transfer freight from roads to railways and the sea. That is important. We must, however, remember that roads are of very great importance in certain parts of the EU, for example in the sparsely populated and peripheral regions. The various forms of transport must therefore complement one another. It is a great challenge to create a transport system in the EU because Europe does not constitute a homogeneous geographical area. We must therefore take account of different conditions, and trans-European networks are very important. It is important to create TEN corridors. If we invest in east-west TEN corridors, we can relieve the pressure on the central regions with their very high traffic density. There are advantages to backing trans-European networks.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has very clearly succeeded in emphasising the importance of the peripheral regions and the regions characterised by long distances. The report sees increased account being taken of these aspects. I nonetheless have a number of points to make. I agree that we have great investment needs and that we must use trans-European networks. When it comes to item 79, I am able to accept the proposal that the Commission conduct a study concerning the development of new methods of funding major infrastructure projects.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the proposal for a road safety authority, I take it that such an authority would have the task of encouraging constructive schemes, have a bottom-up perspective and promote cooperation at different levels. We must improve road safety in the EU. We are now awaiting the Commission’s third road safety programme and have been doing so for a long time. I hope that it will be in place soon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, when thinking about and outlining a transport policy it must be realised that this is a sector of strategic importance and a service of public interest that must serve basic objectives. No less importantly, account must be taken of people’s right to mobility that is safe, affordable and of high quality. Giving priority to modes of transport that are compatible with the environment also warrants our agreement although we must immediately highlight the contradiction between this statement of principle and the way in which the report favours roads.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I also wish to state that on some fundamental aspects, we are moving far away from the Commission White Paper and also from the report by Mr Izquierdo Collado because the report does not distance itself sufficiently from the White Paper on these aspects. In particular, we do not agree with and even reject the leap forwards represented by the constant support for liberalisation, for opening up the markets in the transport sector, as if this were a panacea that could resolve all the difficult situations that have been building up over the years and which have led to the subordination of public transport to private transport and to the degradation of that service.</p>
<p class="contents">To date no study has been produced and no one has been able to prove that opening up transport to competition can resolve the sector’s problems. On the contrary, where liberalisation has taken place, the results prove that exactly the opposite is true. This is why we have these railway and aviation accidents, which are basically caused by the lack of investment in equipment and in safety, or because of redundancies and the deterioration of employees’ social conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the idea that guaranteeing the existence of various operators of these lines or routes leads to an initial situation of apparent openness systematically ends up creating real monopolies. The current discussion with regard to the air transport sector is enlightening on this matter. Finally, I do not think it is acceptable, in the aim of ensuring high-quality and safe transport, for States only to have infra-structures in which they have to invest heavily and that the same States still subsidise – using money from the public purse – companies that will provide services and that these ultimately collect the profits from operating these services. This is certainly a profitable business for these companies. The same is not true, however, for public operators. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite that, unfortunately, our view has not changed. The report was billed as proposals and an action programme for transport until 2010, but I believe strongly that it contains little more than ill-researched, half-baked ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">It should not surprise anyone that the majority of the ideas proposed could not be considered seriously, as the original Commission proposal was so backward-looking. Not only is the paper almost totally focused on rail to the detriment of all other modes of transport, but it completely fails to alleviate the precarious situation in which the aviation industry has unfortunately found itself, particularly since 11 September.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet again, the age-old favourite of kerosene tax has popped up, another way of sneaking it in through the back door. Competition also appears to have fallen by the wayside in this proposal. Either it was ignored deliberately or it was simply forgotten in the excitement of the rail enthusiasts in the Commission. The consumer has a right to choose his method of transport, so perhaps improving all modes, rather than just concentrating on rail, would have allowed the transport industry to compete fairly.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, some of the most contentious issues in this paper concern the aspect of subsidiarity. It is clear that a European Road Safety Agency would be a total waste of taxpayers' money and another pointless layer of bureaucracy. In addition, we also oppose the introduction of a European Transport Fund, as this reeks of vested interest. One other point on taxation and infrastructure charging will be covered by my colleague Mr Bradbourn.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may finally say, this proposal was a complete waste of an opportunity by the Commission to come up with far-reaching, innovative ideas which many of us may have been able to support. In a nutshell, it is a retrograde, ill-thought-out proposal, which we shall be voting against. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That is why the Union needs resources. It needs money. The idea of a European fund is therefore not a bad idea.

It sounds rather old-fashioned, but economics is not a science. Sometimes old ideas return, and just because Mr Keynes has returned to an old way of thinking, that does not mean the idea is bad. Beyond this financial aspect, I would like to draw your attention to three other aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, Europe is enlarging eastwards, and our territory is therefore becoming unbalanced. I believe the Commission should keep an eye on all the outermost areas of Europe, whose geographic makeup is complex, composed of islands, mountains and peninsulas, and that we need to ensure that enlargement does not displace Europe too far towards the East. I am putting the case here for the Atlantic coast in the West of Europe, although I am sure you are sensitive to its needs.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect is that Europe has many ports, many shores and many coasts. We must therefore spare no expense with regard to maritime navigation. We could probably do more. That would mean, with regard to maritime safety, that we should continue in the direction you have taken, which I believe to be the right one.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the third aspect: our regions. We need to make progress with our regions on the transport dossier. Regional policy might comprise tripartite contracts in future and, from that point of view, transport is a good subject associating States, regions and Europe as a whole. I believe that this White Paper and this task provide a good opportunity for the Commission to build all these links. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, it is appropriate at this stage to pay tribute to the work done by the current Commissioner for transport. In a short time she has got things moving. We can confidently expect them to keep moving smoothly and quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">In an earlier intervention, the rapporteur said that the European Union's transport policy was still lacking in one respect: he thought that we had lost the battle for sustainability. I should like to consider this issue by referring to one specific aspect of transport policy. Charges and funding instruments are, quite rightly, addressed specifically in paragraph 75 and those following it in Mr Izquierdo Collado's report. Where transport is concerned, the key question is always what the transport service costs. That is why the true costs and the cost advantages of the individual modes of transport need to be compared properly and in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">This afternoon we have been debating the Austrian transit system. I must repeat and underline now what we already heard earlier: for as long as it is cheaper to travel through the Alps and other sensitive areas by lorry, however good the alternative infrastructures on offer are, it will be to no avail. Even a tunnel under Austria would not help if it were cheaper to travel through the country above ground.</p>
<p class="contents">My request to you is therefore for some serious proposals on transport in particularly sensitive areas, and as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Secondly, and turning more specifically to the report, I would like to make a series of comments. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work and Karla Peijs, our shadow rapporteur, since she has made enormous contributions to this document.</p>
<p class="contents">I will move on to the issues in the report. Firstly, there is concern amongst a series of delegations, a series of groups, because we believe the report does not reflect, or reflects very little, the situation of certain countries whose infrastructures have not yet been established, as opposed to other countries in which infrastructures, investments in infrastructures, essentially roads, are completely finished and which only need to be improved. That is one of our group’s concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to express our support for the creation of a road safety agency. The number of fatal accidents currently occurring on European Roads requires not just a message but an effective and active European policy, and we believe that the road safety agency can be a good instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we also support the creation of the transport fund, with objectives and considerations other than the trans-European networks and the Structural Funds in the field of transport. We will support these two ideas which we consider to be positive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, transport policy must help to improve the economic and social situation in Europe greatly, and, in particular, must take into consideration the specific nature of the outermost regions and islands, calling for measures to be taken to improve the disadvantaged situation of these regions and islands as far as is possible and to ensure territorial continuity.</p>
<p class="contents">During the Essen and Dublin European Councils, 14 priority projects were identified and, without waiting for these objectives to be achieved, the White Paper has added others, clearly dissipating resources. In this connection, I feel I must stress the fact that none of these projects relates to the south of Italy, where the situation is critical, which will be in even more danger of being marginalised by Europe after enlargement. By critical situation, I am referring to the situation of land transport, Trans-European Networks, sea transport, air transport and transport safety in general. In other words, I would like to make it clear that these are regions which have severe structural difficulties and deficiencies caused by inappropriate decisions and policies. I represent in this House the citizens of two major islands – Sicily and Sardinia – which have approximately 7 million inhabitants. I call for the undertakings given by European ministers in the Treaty of Amsterdam with regard to the outermost regions and islands not to be forgotten. I hope that the increasing liberalisation of transport will be accompanied by development guarantees for the disadvantaged regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the outset, I should like to say how much I agree with the comments my colleague, Mrs Foster, made earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I find the whole anti-road sentiment of this report baffling in the extreme. Roads are, and always will be, the cornerstone of our transport industry, allowing us to reach every corner of our respective countries and the whole of our continent. It is, therefore, highly unrealistic to believe that there is a future for industry as a whole while we neglect its link to its customers: the road network. Yet this paper steadfastly ignores the road sector and is thus completely unbalanced.</p>
<p class="contents">Combining roads with other modes of transport is essential. I have no doubt that better public transport has a vital part to play in this transport strategy. However, road transport, quite rightly, remains the main choice for the majority, due to its ease and flexibility. Penalising people for using roads is an extremely dangerous step, yet this is exactly what the report advocates. One such example is the idea of infrastructure charging. This is primarily an issue of subsidiarity and should not even be considered at a European level, quite apart from whether such charging is right in principle, given the vast amounts which the motorist already pays in taxation. Only a small proportion of that tax revenue is spent on improving transport. This is certainly the case in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">British Conservatives strongly opposed infrastructure charging in our country and we oppose it just as vehemently here in Europe. Yet this report goes deeper than just imposing direct charges on the public. By attempting to cut the link between transport and economic growth, we are ignoring clear evidence dating back centuries. Put simply, increased trade boosts a nation's economy, raising its GDP. Even basic trade, however, would not be possible without an efficient transport system which is available to all.</p>
<p class="contents">I acknowledge that this report was always going to be difficult and sympathise with the rapporteur, who is in a lose-lose situation. However, my Conservative colleagues and I have serious doubts as to where this paper would lead us, with its severe implications for the entire transport industry. I therefore urge this House to reject the report in its entirety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Doyle (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, there is no doubt that liberalisation of the transport market has delivered positive benefits for the mobility of goods and people, but this is in the context of a continuing predominance of road traffic, growing congestion and harmful effects on the environment and public health.</p>
<p class="contents">The White Paper proposes to tackle this situation by gradually breaking the link between transport growth and economic growth or an increase in GDP, while recognising that economic growth will generate greater needs for mobility. Conversely, we cannot ignore the importance of transport in contributing to economic growth and development. The Irish situation is an excellent case study in point. Road traffic in Dublin has grown exponentially in the last decade, as we have experienced record growth levels in our economy. But the resulting congestion now acts as a serious brake on further growth. Here, we are talking about balance and the need to get it right. We also have the environmental impact on our air quality.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, enlargement will also generate additional road transport. Infrastructure upgrading in candidate countries will require massive investment. As they grow their GDP and their per capita income - which we all hope they do - so traffic and congestion will increase pro rata. The action proposed by the White Paper involves rebalancing the different modes of transport; developing high quality rail services; promoting short sea crossings; inland waterways and combined transport; and promoting fair competition between the sectors. New TENs projects are needed to address existing and future bottlenecks, along with a sufficient infrastructure charging policy. In aviation, I fully support the SKY initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not feel that harmonisation of fuel taxes has an essential part to play. Road transport will continue to be the dominant mode of transport for Member States for which alternative modes are not possible and not realistic. Even where they are, what will it take to get us out of our cars?</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, while road safety is a major issue and death and injury on our roads are at frightening levels – 40 000 per annum in the EU – like many colleagues I balk at yet another European agency and feel that national authorities should be able to plan strategies suitable to their particular set of circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fully support modal rebalancing, which should be achieved by means of a series of measures combining a review of the charging system with the revitalisation of alternatives to road transport and targeted investment in the trans-European network.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, however, at all costs not lose sight of the fact that, pursuant to the Maastricht Treaty, transport policies must be designed to serve cohesion and that, in this regard, the trans-European transport network must be an instrument of economic, social and territorial cohesion within the Union. Extremely specific analyses must be carried out on service provision to the peripheral regions, in particular the island regions and outermost regions with, in particular, the establishment of a public service obligation relating to the need to guarantee the principle of territorial continuity and to ensure the best possible operating conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a genuine lack of decision when the role of transport in the regional development of the peripheral and, <span class="italic">a fortiori</span>, the outermost regions is raised, even though the Treaties recognise in this case the need for treatment that can derogate from common transport market rules. The particularly worrying situation of the provision of air services to the French overseas departments following the dismantling of Air Lib, an airline partly specialising in these flights, is a perfect example of the current gaps that I have just mentioned. It also illustrates the urgency of a joint vision of the future of development in the outermost regions, within which the transport regulation policy would meet the regional development policy. I am not sure that the White Paper, which, in particular, addresses this matter from the point of view of introducing more flexibility into the Community framework on aid for regional purposes in the field of transport services, in particular where links with the peripheral regions and the small islands are concerned, has fully appreciated the importance of this crucial matter for the European peoples concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Reducing deaths on the road by 50% is in particular an aim that deserves all our support. There is no good reason why anyone at all should die on the roads. Congestion in Central Europe is also a big problem, while in the peripheral regions the worry is safeguarding links with the European markets.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as the many good proposals, the White Paper unfortunately contains seriously mistaken evaluations. The Commission wants to break the link between economic growth and transport growth. That will not be possible, although we can certainly bring economic growth to a halt. By easing transport problems we can, without anxiety, allow traffic to increase. New vehicles will produce up to 90% fewer emissions than those manufactured before 1970. This is not realised if you only take a blinkered view of the matter. By abolishing all car registration taxes in Europe and lowering car tax for clean cars we will be able to improve the state of the environment radically.</p>
<p class="contents">Another odd proposal is that of freezing the share of the market enjoyed by the different transport modes at 1998 levels. This is something we might expect from the old Soviet Union’s Politburo, but it weakens the Commission’s authority very much indeed. It would be nonsensical to set out to forcibly steer the market share balance in the direction of targets that have been decided in an ivory tower. We should instead create an equitable situation for competition for all modes of transport. Let the market itself then decide the natural balance for transport modes.</p>
<p class="contents">The third error relates to the harmonisation of labour and social legislation. Only when it is a question of transport safety is the harmonisation of maximum transportation times appropriate, and then it will be on the condition that the costs and benefits have been closely looked at. If we make these three mistakes we will be further than ever away from a dynamic Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The disintegration of the Soviet Union was the result of its own impossible situation, but our splendid European project deserves better. Our rigid economy is in need of care, and our self-inflicted sickness is actually not just an imaginary one. Unfortunately, the Commissioner’s medicine seems as if, dare I say so, it had been bought in a bazaar. Would it not be about time we stopped talking about the European model and sought recipes for success among those who are getting along best? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Behind each of the speeches there is what I believe to be a fundamental concept. This fundamental concept is the single European transport area, a European area of transport which is not only compatible with European asymmetry but which must actually incorporate it. Europe is not equal – as Mr Sudre has just said – Europe has certain areas of infrastructure, certain peripheral regions, certain areas of cohesion, certain nuclei – more now, with enlargement – which require extremely considerable promotion, but this is not incompatible with the single European transport area.</p>
<p class="contents">A few months ago, Commissioner, this House and the Council approved the sixth framework research programme. This programme established the single European area of research.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner said to European researchers: we have passed the stage of you meeting to tell each other what you are doing and even to cooperate on friendly terms. It is necessary to create a single European area of research so that all research capacity and effort is focussed on the same projects, has the same objectives and the same territory so that we are not therefore inventing the wheel fifteen times. Therefore, the European research area is the key to understanding all the speeches which this afternoon may have sounded like a rainbow of views which would be difficult to unite. But I can assure you that the vote tomorrow will not produce a blurred picture, as may be assumed on the basis of tonight’s debate, but a clearly defined one. You are fortunate, Commissioner, since this Parliament is saying: go ahead, you have the support of Parliament to formulate into directives the issues you have presented to us in the report on the White Paper, and you have certain additional contributions from the European Parliament which may be useful. Many doors are therefore being opened, and the Council cannot turn a deaf ear to the fundamental demands and the appeal represented by the Transport White Paper that the time has come to take decisions, to create a genuinely European policy, because, in view of this European policy, the effect will be a synergy which will respond to the reticence of those who say that the European Safety Agency will cost money, that the European Transport Fund will not be well used, of those who do not believe that intermodality in one port will benefit the whole of Europe, that investments and corridors, in any area, will benefit around 400 million Europeans once the Union has been enlarged.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Commissioner, although there is apparently a rainbow of diversity in this House, I can guarantee that we are very close together.</p>

I would also like to thank all the Members who have spoken, including those who were highly critical, because I believe they provide colour and variety and above all they communicate feelings and opinions which must be taken into account when we talk about offering solutions in an area which, as Mr Izquierdo said, is so large and diverse and at times so asymmetric as the European area.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that I agree with the honourable Members, and this is clearly spelt out in Mr Izquierdo’s report – which I consider to be very balanced – that we are talking about sustainable transport and this requires, to begin with, a competitive transport system. If we do not create a competitive transport system in Europe, the whole of our industrial fabric, the whole of our productive sector, will suffer. We must therefore create competitive transport, but at the same time we must take account of society’s demands, which are linked to quality of life and respect for the environment. And this is the not always an easy task we must respond to through our proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I have taken good note of the clear support offered by Mr Izquierdo and Parliament’s proposed report. You have taken your time, but, ladies and gentlemen, the Council is not moving any more quickly – let me make this very clear – in expressing its support for modal change, for the opening up of the railways, for the creation of the single sky, for the launch of the Galileo programme, on which it is really urgent that decisions and actions are taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Like us, your priorities include safety and the need to respond to the investment needs of the trans-European networks, in particular through charging, where necessary, for the use of infrastructures.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also glad that the report insists on the aspects relating to connection with outermost regions, on the economic importance of roads, on the need to reduce traffic – when I talk about the outermost regions I am talking about islands situated several thousand kilometres from continental Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that all these points are very interesting and worthy of our attention and they deserve to be highlighted in this report. However, I would like to make a few comments with regard to the important points which have been raised here and in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the road safety agency. I fully understand this idea, because it stems from the need to create means of promoting responsibility at all levels to react against the lack of safety on the roads while respecting the principle of subsidiarity and the Commission’s right of initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we should consider the steps to be taken in order to achieve this objective. I hope to be able to provide more detail in the communication on road safety which I will present to you in the near future, but there is little difference between an observatory and an agency. At the end of the day, they are the same idea.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like – in relation the text we are discussing – to make a few comments on competitiveness, respect for the environment and the incorporation of quality of services, safety and quality of life.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 9 states that the transfer of goods transport by road to other modes of transport should be promoted by improving the quality of service of these other modes of transport which are more respectful and under no circumstances having a negative impact on the competitiveness of road transport. I believe that this sentence is fundamental.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe cannot afford to make road transport less competitive, since it forms the basis of its economic development, its growth and its international competitiveness. It is a question of making, for example, the railways as competitive as road transport. To those who entirely reject the liberalisation of the railways – who are a minority in this Parliament – or the introduction of competition – we are talking more of introducing competition than liberalisation, since this is a highly regulated form of liberalisation – I would say that we know what maintaining the current situation would lead to: to our having railways in museums but not in reality.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we should try to take other routes which have provided good results in other sectors of transport, but I would like to stress this phrase: it is not a question of penalising but of improving the quality of other systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Members also propose the creation of great axes (east-west, north-south) of roads and railways, as laid out in paragraph 36 and others. I would like to point out that it is a question of incorporating enlargement in terms of the trans-European networks and of exchanges and of this European area in which it is transport that guarantees the reality of a market and the capacity for goods and people to move around throughout this European area.</p>
<p class="contents">We must insist on strengthening the railways. This is a fundamental point and we cannot ignore it. Paragraph 36 and others refer to this aspect. I am aware that it also involves promoting inland waterways, the maritime sector, but in some cases we cannot avoid building new roads because there are areas which still lack road infrastructures. We must therefore not be dogmatic, but we must have a practical appreciation of the reality of European transport needs.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the great Fund for financing transport, of course I fully agree with Mr Izquierdo Collado that we need greater European funds in order to provide the support and promotion for the creation of infrastructures, in particular rail infrastructures, and for curing bottle necks in order to improve the use of European infrastructures.</p>
<p class="contents">Can it be approached in the way Mr Izquierdo Collado proposes? I believe, rather, that what we have to do is, within the context of the new financial perspectives whose principle elements will be discussed shortly, raise the need to channel more funds to the trans-European networks. I believe it is there that we must seek these greater funds, these greater resources, because what is clear is that we need to speed up the process of creating infrastructures. The funds currently allocated to the trans-European networks are insufficient and we must make progress in this field, because these networks are of benefit and interest to Europe as a whole, regardless of the specific countries they link or cross. They are of interest at European level because they promote – I would insist – the creation of the internal markets and the integration of the European area itself.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue of the EIB: other formulae to bring us closer, of course, and we must also promote public-private participation in funding. I will shortly present all these issues in that infrastructures package, including charging. Mr Costa has mentioned this, but I would like to say that charging is discussed in paragraphs 75 and 76 which speak of the simultaneous introduction of a system for setting prices in all modes of transport, both for infrastructures and for the related external costs, and which say that under no circumstances must anybody be penalised but that we must promote a balance and allow cross funding.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I fully agree with this approach, with one exception, and that is that cross funding must be restricted to exceptional cases in alternative routes and under no circumstances must cross funding or tolls or charging become a form of generating income from the geographical situation of a country within the European area. Otherwise we would be returning to medieval times, when, for example, controlling a bridge over a river provided sufficient income to live in luxury and become a member of the gentry. That is what we must do, establish charging which covers costs, which is destined for infrastructures, the improvement of infrastructures, improvements in road safety, the improvement of the locations where they are collected, and that in certain cases cross funding may be allowed, since it is clearly a good instrument and has led to good results, as for example in the case of the Swiss system.</p>
<p class="contents">Before 2004, the Commission will draw up a communication on the transport situation in the candidate countries. We do not believe that a specific communication is necessary in 2003 because we are going to produce two reports. Firstly, a complete follow-up report, six months prior to the date of accession, that is, more or less in November 2003, which will examine the degree of preparedness of the candidate countries in all sectors, including transport, and a communication in 2003 on cooperation with the candidate countries and neighbouring countries in the field of trans-European transport networks. All of this in addition to the report by the van Miert group, which draws up the networks within the context of twenty-seven countries: the pan-European network.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the mid-term assessment report in 2005, laid down in the White Paper, will be the perfect opportunity to deal with these concerns and integrate all this information.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I will end this long and extremely important debate by once again thanking Mr Izquierdo Collado for this work, which has been serious, balanced and difficult, since it is not easy to unite positions. In the end, I hope that tomorrow, following what I have heard throughout today’s debates, it is clearly established that the key guidelines for transport policy in the European Union for the next ten years is fully reflected in the vote in Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
