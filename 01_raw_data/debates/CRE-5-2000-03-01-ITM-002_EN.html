He was a member of the Basque regional parliament, spokesman for the Socialist Party in that parliament and also a former vice-president of the Basque regional government.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, the best tribute that my Group and this House can pay to Fernando Buesa is to take on board his vision, as a European, of the Basque Country, Spain and Europe. The following is a translated extract from his autobiography. ‘We are in Europe. Anyone of my age – I am 54 – can remember their grandparents’ era and their parents’ era and, of course, is living in the current era. We can also see into the era in which our children will live. In my grandparents’ time, it took several days to travel from Vitoria to Seville. Now you can go from Vitoria to Copenhagen in 2 or 3 hours by plane. Today, at the end of the 20th century, a single market is operating in Europe in which we will soon be using a single currency. We can now travel much more easily than our grandparents could within Spain or even within the Basque Country.</p>
<p class="contents">We are building a vast European area which will firstly be linked economically and then politically. This process may take a long time but it is unstoppable and, what is more, desirable. The public still regard this as being a long way off but it is very real and should serve to make us question certain aspects of our current situation.</p>
<p class="contents">In a debate within the Socialist Party on the Irish process, someone said: “In the end, the key to the Irish solution was that everyone involved had the following thought: does it really matter whether we are Irish or British? Everyone can be what they want to be because, if Ireland and Britain are both in the European Union, there is no point in killing each other for being Irish or British. What difference does it make if the national level is no longer going to function?”</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Basque Country could ask ourselves the same question. Does it really matter if we are Basque or Spanish or European? We have talked a lot about what it is to be Basque, but a Basque today dresses like a Dane and reads the same things as a British person. If life is going to be lived on a much more global basis, as is already happening, and our children will therefore be living in the Europe which we are creating, why are we killing each other for being Basque or Spanish?’</p>
<p class="contents">Fernando Buesa also said the following, which everyone in Ireland has probably thought. ‘If we are killing each other for no reason – and this was happening in Ireland because there were paramilitary groups on all sides – we should be resolutely asking ourselves this question in the Basque Country too. What difference does it make to be Basque? Surely it is all the same thing. You can be what you want to be. If, in the future, economics and politics and vital decisions for each country are dealt with in the European arena, there is no point killing or dying for being Basque or Spanish’.</p>
<p class="contents">May he rest in peace.</p>

<p class="contents">In recent times, in this House, we have sadly had to discuss the various faces of extremism in Europe. It does not matter what banner these come under because, in the end, they are all different expressions of the same thing. Faced with these, we democrats cannot resign ourselves to the peace of the dead. On the contrary, we must take strength from knowing that the only social division which exists in the Basque Country is the abyss which separates those who kill, and those who support and express understanding for the latter, from the vast majority of the Basque people who simply want to live in peace and freedom.</p>

We send our condolences to the families of the victims and emphatically condemn these acts which have been going on for so long and which must stop.</p>
<p class="contents">The terrorist organisation ETA has, in its time, killed police officers and soldiers. It has placed a bomb in a supermarket and killed men, women and children. In the streets of Madrid it has killed a general, Quintana Lacaci, who defended democracy at the time of the attempted coup of 1981. It has assassinated the spokesman of the Popular Party in the town council of San Sebastián, Gregorio Ordóñez. It has been to the lecture room of the university professor in Constitutional Law, Francisco Tomás y Valiente, and killed him in cold blood. Now, just a few days ago, in the same odious way in which it assassinated Admiral Blanco, it has killed the socialist MP and spokesman in the Vitoria parliament, Fernando Buesa, and his bodyguard, Jorge Díez, of the Basque police force.</p>
<p class="contents">ETA must be condemned. However, those who support and express understanding for these attacks must also be condemned. There is no point continuing to ask these people and organisations to go down the democratic road. We must appeal to the whole of society and particularly to the democratic parties, whether they are national or nationalist, and no matter how pro- or anti-European they are. It is regrettable that there are organisations and people who are saying nothing or simply regretting the deaths as if they were the result of a road traffic accident.</p>
<p class="contents">All European democrats in this House must join together to send a message to the Basque Country that it is time to put an end to the division and killing. It is time to share the Basque Country, Spain and Europe. This, Madam President, is the only way forward which we therefore fully support.</p>

For the friends and relatives of the victims this is a human tragedy and for their political families it is a political tragedy, but I feel that we are also witnessing a cultural tragedy, in that the culture of death and of violence is constantly gaining ground against the culture of respect for others, democracy and democratic life. So, Madam President, maybe we should consider taking some action if we want our sorrow and our rejection of terrorism to have any actual significance. Why does Parliament not meet in all the countries of the European Union and show that it rejects terrorism? Let us make ourselves heard! We are not just confined to Brussels or Strasbourg. Let us all go back to our respective nations and shout from the rooftops that our belief in democracy and our indignation are not just words, but a demonstration of our actual political commitment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Secondly, we send our deepest condolences to their families, their socialist colleagues, the Basque parliament and the Basque police force. We also want to express our solidarity and heartfelt sympathy.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we denounce the extreme nature of an attack which, by being perpetrated against an elected representative of the people, not only violated human dignity and human rights but also showed absolute contempt for the will of these people.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we express our repulsion at the fact that this dual assassination was intended to directly destroy the political process aimed at achieving peace in the Basque Country.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, we again call on the Spanish and French leaders and politicians to show the same tolerance as in the United Kingdom and Ireland in order to resolve the current Basque conflict with something more than police measures which, on their own, cannot bring about the peace which we all desire.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly and finally, we reaffirm that ETA’s terrorism and violence must end. ETA must stop hijacking the will of the Basque people who must be allowed to decide on their future freely and without violent coercion.</p>

In Northern Ireland in the last thirty years too many people have been killed and injured – too many families shattered. So far, unfortunately, in Spain and France, just the opposite has been happening as regards the on-going conflict in the Basque country. We, Euskal Herritarrok, are convinced that a definitive solution to the present struggle can only be found through an open process of dialogue and negotiation with no limited agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Before 20 January last, during nineteen months, the only killing we witnessed in the Kingdom of Spain was that of José Luis Geresta, member of ETA, in March 1999. In spite of that and the arrests made by the Spanish and French police, including arrests of ETA negotiators with the Spanish government’s agreement, ETA honoured its unilateral ceasefire. Then, last November, before the ceasefire was over, the Spanish Government spokesman, Mr Piqué, declared that his government had done and would in the future do everything possible to hinder present moves towards a political solution in the Basque country. We, Euskal Herritarrok, have regretted many times the loss of human lives. We share with all the Basque citizens the sufferings of our people. We are committed to dialogue and ready to work together with all those eager to find a democratic settlement for the Basque country.</p>
<p class="contents">Twenty years have passed since the Northern Ireland question was first raised in this Parliament. May I ask: <span class="italic">Quousque tandem</span> – <span class="italic">Noiz arte</span>?</p>

I must say that it is very hard for me to follow on from the last intervention. When Mr Puerta mentioned some of ETA’s victims, he made no reference to someone who was killed by ETA 16 years ago. I believe he did this out of respect for me. The person I am talking about was a socialist senator who was also a member of the Basque regional parliament. His name was Enrique Casas.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Loud applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, Senator Casas was my husband. I was left a widow with four children, the youngest of whom was only eight months old. My husband was an Andalusian by birth and a senator for the Basque Country. He had been sent by the Basque Government to defend the Basque Country in Madrid. His only crime was that he was a socialist and a democrat and nothing more.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I have never spoken of this here apart from on the day that ETA declared the cease-fire which I welcomed as a ray of hope for all Basque people and for the whole of Spain and Europe. This was the only time I had spoken of my husband’s death but I must do so again today and I do it willingly.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I was born in Germany, educated in Sweden and married to a Spaniard. I know what democracy is because I had the good fortune to grow up in a country like Sweden which has a long democratic tradition. I arrived in the Basque Country keen to integrate and, despite what has happened to me, I am convinced that some day the Basque Country will achieve the peace it desires. To those who believe that there is conflict in the Basque Country, I would say that the only conflict in the Basque Country goes by the name of ETA and must be eliminated. As for the other problems, we can talk about these.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Loud and sustained applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We democrats can solve the other problems by allowing everyone to put forward their ideas, because freedom of expression, free elections and freedom in general do exist in the Basque Country. The only restriction on this freedom is ETA which must therefore be eliminated. Then we democrats can talk.</p>
