<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Coelho (PPE-DE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (PT) </span>Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating the Commission, in the person of Commissioner António Vitorino, on the excellent initiative that it has presented. We often criticise the Commission – and rightly so – but today it is only fair to congratulate it on the initiative that it has presented and which provides a positive response to the recommendations made by the European Parliament when it approved the Kessler report to bring together the five programmes covered by Title VI in a single framework programme.</p>
<p class="contents">As we all know, under the terms of Article 29 of the EU Treaty, the Union is obliged to pursue the objective of providing its citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice by initiating actions in conjunction with the Member States in the field of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters too. This was the rationale underlying the creation of the five biannual financing programmes under Title VI that are due to end in December 2002 and that were – and still are – Grotius II, designed for legal practitioners, OISIN II, for Member State law enforcement authorities, STOP II, for those responsible for combating trade in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children, Hippocrates, in the field of crime prevention in general, and Falcone, for those responsible for action to combat organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal we are debating here today establishes a single framework programme that is intended to bring together and provide a harmonised legislative and operational framework for all the actions that fall under Title VI of the EU Treaty, reflecting developments in Community programmes in general and the experiences of five years’ work on the ground. Consequently, we have, in our opinion, managed to ensure that the actions we have supported are more consistent and have an even greater impact, to make possible a more effective use of financial resources, to prevent potential overlaps between the various programmes and to fill in existing gaps.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I consider the approach that the Commission is following to be fundamentally correct, I felt it would be appropriate and sensible to table some amendments with the following objectives:</p>
<p class="contents">- firstly, to make the programme’s line of action clearer, and to make the wording more precise, not least because projects submitted are to be evaluated for conformity with the programme’s objectives. In these circumstances vague, meaningless terms have to be rejected;</p>
<p class="contents">- secondly, to give our endorsement to the inclusion in the programme of cross-border projects in the field of assistance to victims of crime, in addition to the promotion of police and judicial cooperation. We will, in this way, be promoting the effective protection, in the Member States, of the interests of victims in criminal proceedings, specifically through the creation of a network of contact points. It might also, for example, prove appropriate to provide for an independent evaluation to be undertaken on the implementation of the framework decision, accompanied by proposals for improvement for every country;</p>
<p class="contents">- thirdly, to acknowledge that it is important and appropriate to involve the applicant countries, but also that it must be made clear that they must participate in both drawing up and implementing the project. Merely taking part in the project as what amounts to a ‘consumer’, cannot be considered to be sufficient;</p>
<p class="contents">- fourthly, to state that the power of initiative to draft proposals cannot be confined only to the public sector of the Member States and of the applicant countries; it must be extended to NGOs, universities and other interested parties;</p>
<p class="contents">- fifthly, with regard to financing, a maximum co-financing of up to 70% has been provided for although, in some cases, it could reach 100%. These are specific projects and complementary measures. A hundred per cent financing from the Community budget could be justified only in the case of projects which were in the very best interests of the European Union and which could not be carried out with a lower rate of funding. However, it should be emphasised, and I am sure that this is also the approach of Commissioner António Vitorino, that the underlying idea is to attempt to finance the greatest number of projects possible with the resources available;</p>
<p class="contents">- my last but one point is that the Commission’s proposal is consistent with this Parliament’s desire to provide greater support for projects promoting the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice, but it is rather difficult to accept a proposal that exceeds the existing financial perspective. Hence the proposal that this framework programme should operate in the period 2003 to 2006, following which it must be renewed in accordance with the new financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I find it regrettable that the position of the European Parliament does not demonstrate the appropriate degree of prudence. I have therefore proposed that Parliament should be given the option of being involved, which will surely give it the opportunity to exercise its responsibility as budgetary authority in the best possible way. The construction of an area of freedom, security and justice is one of the fundamental objectives of this Parliament, and therefore, its involvement is of the greatest importance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proposal tabled by the Commission does in fact combine five existing programmes – Grotius II, Oisin II, Stop II, Hippocrates and Falcone – in one, and I think that the proposal is broadly in line with Parliament’s wish to secure more aid for projects that can give people in the European Union an EU with greater security. Internal security is of course one of the priorities also emphasised by Parliament in the guidelines for the budgetary procedure for 2003 – next year – which were of course adopted at the last sitting here in Strasbourg. Part of the thinking behind the way in which the programme has been put together is that, in future, there should be a closer link between police cooperation and judicial cooperation. For the Committee on Budgets, this is, moreover, an aim with the not insignificant effect of making for a better use of financial resources. It is gratifying that the candidate countries too are to be given the opportunity to participate in those projects that are financed under the programme, but it must be clear that, as a budgetary authority, Parliament cannot accept a situation in which the financial estimates are exceeded. The programme ought, then, to be limited to the period 2003-2006 in its initial phase, and in that way shortened by a year. That means, of course, a corresponding reduction in the framework appropriation, and the programme can subsequently be extended. Finally, I think that it is important for the budgetary authority to be listened to if it should nonetheless become necessary to increase the appropriations to the programme, for the consequence of increasing the appropriations to this programme must not be reduced appropriations to other programmes also financed under category 3 of the financial estimates. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council proposal is an important step in this direction. Admittedly, it does nothing more than combine five already-existing programmes, but this combination creates homogeneity and clarity, which is particularly necessary in the difficult area of judicial cooperation in criminal matters.</p>
<p class="contents">The combination of the programmes can now serve to prevent overlapping and close loopholes. The creation of a single framework programme will also further improve the uptake of financial resources. Only cross-border criminal prosecution and enforcement can combat contemporary criminality, for those who commit crimes are taking extensive advantage of the freedoms of the European Union. The EU's citizens will also feel their sense of security reinforced. They know that there are no no-go areas for the law in its pursuit of criminals. They will be pursued right across the EU, and in like manner.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this context that the amendment on the publication on the Internet of the results of the investigations and studies cofinanced under this programme is particularly to be welcomed. This is a further step towards the greater transparency that we need in order once again to bring the advantages of European cooperation to our citizens' attention.</p>
<p class="contents">Greater protection for victims is especially to be highlighted and much to be welcomed. It is the victims who have most to endure, but who are far from receiving the best protection and care. It must therefore be ensured that effective protection of victims' interests in criminal proceedings can be guaranteed. It is particularly to be welcomed, in view of EU enlargement, that the Council proposal can take into account the candidate countries and involve them in projects.</p>
<p class="contents">What cannot, however, be accepted is the way in which the Council proposal disregards Parliament; in particular, Parliament's sovereignty in budget matters makes it necessary for it at least to be informed concerning the progress of the programme and not to get a report only as late as 2005. The rapporteur should therefore be supported in his efforts to bring about an amendment on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, in conclusion, to congratulate Mr Coelho on his report, in particular on his success in achieving, as was necessary, more precise use of language. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From a financial point of view, we are concerned here with less than one per mille of the EU’s annual budget, and the direct political consequences are cause neither for approval nor contradiction. What is at issue here is a programme on the basis of Title VI of the Treaty on European Union. As a lawyer and democrat, I have to say that cooperation and development are always to be welcomed and that they can be useful and increase our awareness, but it is very difficult to take the rhetoric seriously. The report’s explanatory statement includes the following words: “If the European citizen is to be offered an area of freedom, security and justice, we have to ensure that criminal investigations, prosecution and the execution of penalties can take place efficiently across borders”. It is as if freedom, security and justice had not been invented until these decisions were made, but the fact is of course that by far the greater part of judicial criminal investigation and police work is done nationally and locally. What we have here is a rhetorical device that is part of, or to be seen as a stage in, the process towards unified decisions in the fields of policing, the law and criminal investigation. Where the funding is concerned, it may be pointed out that EUR 65 million is not to be sneezed at, and it is one more item in the long list of programmes interfering with the EU’s administrative procedure. I must not dwell any further upon this matter but just point out in conclusion what is so curious about the Commission’s statement that these programmes have been assessed. In that case, they were assessed in 2000, irrespective of the fact that the majority of the programmes were not adopted until 2001. That really is an impressive act of clairvoyance which bodes well for the projects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking Carlos Coelho and by congratulating him on his excellent report. I must emphasise that the aim of this proposal for a framework programme is to rationalise and simplify the implementation of the programmes of police and judicial cooperation between Member States in criminal matters, thereby complying with the specific request made by the European Parliament in the Kessler report.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the content of this framework programme, this covers all five of the previous programmes and also the implementation of actions linked to the plan to combat drugs, for which the European Parliament had created a specific budget heading, due to end in the course of this year. The programme covers all the fields that are and that must be subject to European action, which demonstrates the commitment of the public authorities and of the beneficiaries of the projects, with whom we are in close contact, and also reflects the results of the external evaluation carried out two years ago on, of course, the development of the programmes that preceded the evaluation. The Commission is sometimes accused of being a schizophrenic institution, but we have not yet reached the point of assessing things that have not yet been done …</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, the basic legal provision was voluntarily confined to laying down the broad guidelines, because the Commission felt that the task of defining priorities more precisely must be left up to the annual programmes, year by year, in line with developments in the political situation and the actual requirements of the situation as regards crime. From this point of view, the amendments tabled to Article 2, emphasising one specific issue or another, are, I believe, hard to accept. The Commission takes the view that in the framework programme, objectives must be defined in general terms, leaving it up to each annual programme to define its priorities. Nevertheless, all matters and issues to which amendments have been tabled are, as I understand it, fully covered by the general wording of the Commission proposal and can be included in every annual programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The framework programme also highlights the concept of partnership. This element is crucial, because projects must be developed not only through broad European participation, but also – and from their very inception – in the context of close cooperation between the main players involved in the various countries. The amendment tabled by the rapporteur that defines this concept of partnership more clearly is, therefore, totally acceptable to the Commission. As Mr Coelho stated, the countries that are candidates for accession can already participate in projects. The Commission would like to go further and, in line with European agreements, has developed a system of financial protocols that will enable organisations established in the candidate countries to be equally eligible to submit projects on the same basis and according to the same rules as Member State organisations. I therefore welcome the amendment also tabled by the rapporteur on this point, which proposes a wording that I consider to be fortuitous, because it further clarifies the concept of the eligibility of the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the remaining amendments, the Commission can accept those that have an effect on the recitals and which enrich the text, or certain explanations, such as, for example, the more explicit reference to the inclusion of universities, NGOs and police academies as eligible organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the request to bring forward the interim report to June 2004, the Commission would propose that the date of June 2005 be maintained. Instead, we propose that the presentation of the annual report be brought forward to June 2004 so that the European Parliament can be informed as quickly as possible on the first results of the implementation of the programme to have already produced effects that are likely to be assessed. Finally, on the duration of the programme, I must admit that, in relation to other existing programmes in the European Union, the argument of ‘a legal base providing for its implementation beyond 2006’, in other words, beyond the lifespan of the financial perspective, has not been used. Bearing in mind, of course, that the financial envelope for the period after 2006 will always be dependent on the financial perspective adopted following 2006, we would, therefore, ask Parliament to ensure that the limitation on the legal base does not stop at 2006 and could cover actions programmed up to the year 2007, with the proviso, naturally, that a given financial appropriation will always be dependent on the new financial perspective. Lastly, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, and the European Parliament for the support, the boost and the encouragement that they have given to this important task of rationalising programmes in a particularly sensitive area: the area of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters at European level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
