I think they are in the House and will arrive in time. Unfortunately, the fact of the matter is that we are fighting numerous problems on the railways which are a legacy from the past. For example, in 1970, the railways’ share of the freight traffic market was 21%, compared with just 8.5% now. The railways have lost out massively in freight traffic and their share of the passenger traffic market has fallen from 10 to 6%. The winner has been road freight traffic, which is increasing constantly and winning market shares: 16% per annum on the eastern borders of Austria, for example. It is now 2.4 times higher than in 1990. If you take lorries and buses from eastern Europe on the A1 motorway, which is the most important east-west route, traffic increased sixfold between 1995 and the year 2000. In other words, freight traffic, especially transit freight traffic, is growing massively. According to forecasts, it will rise by more than 100% between 1995 and 2015.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is important and urgent that we concern ourselves with the European rail network. It totals 156 000 kilometres in length, of which 78 000 km are accounted for by the TEN network. 12 600 km of new lines for speeds of over 250 km/h should be constructed by 2010, with at least 16 300 km of lines due to be upgraded for speeds of over 200 km/h. The total costs – and they are huge – are estimated at EUR 186 billion between now and 2010. So it is obvious how important this investment is for the European Union and that is why we are being called on here to set the priorities quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that it is high time we adapted the railways to the market economy, so as to ensure that the railways invest more money more often in customer requirements and that we can jointly set the priorities and draw up a tight, efficient timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">The main requirements are, of course, to harmonise the gauge throughout Europe, especially where more than two countries cooperate. At the moment, we still have five different gauges. We need uniform electrification, especially in relation to voltage and frequency. In other words, the technical properties of the electricity must be brought into line so that extra electricity can be bought from the national grids and fed into the national grids without any significant losses.</p>
<p class="contents">The third, and I think the most important point is the safety of trains. We really do need external inspection and certification agencies. We cannot have a situation in which the agency operating the railway is also responsible for inspecting it. No-one questions the fact that cars and lorries are inspected by external certification agencies. I think there is an urgent need, given the recent train crashes, for external inspection agencies to look after the safety of passengers in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What is the subject matter? The first report analyses the application of the 1996 Directive on the interoperability of the high-speed rail system, drawing the lessons of this for the future. Next, and this is the substance of the second report, we must discuss and vote on a proposed directive on the interoperability of the trans-European conventional rail system.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we must appreciate the full importance of this subject. There is today an unacceptable contradiction between what is said in speeches and the reality of European transport systems. As might have been expected, the creation of the internal market has, logically, considerably developed the trade in goods and the mobility of persons within the Union, which have shown an increase of 21% and 15% respectively between 1990 and 1997. The bulk of the traffic from this explosive growth in internal mobility, which is expected to be consolidated in the next few decades, has been acquired by road systems and, secondarily, maritime cabotage via the North Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when we have right here, in most of the countries of the Union, a rail network and technology unparalleled in the world, with a recent study evaluating the external costs of road transport in terms of public health, infrastructure and pollution at some EUR 480 billion, even though the objective of sustainable mobility and respect for quality of life are now shared by all Europeans, it can be noted that rail has only an 8.6% market share for freight, and 5.8% for passenger transport. There is more than one explanation for this paradox: rail’s reduced level of competitiveness due to a social differential in relation to the road sector, but also the distortions of competition engendered by the considerable external costs of road transport, the priority which most major railway companies in recent years have given exclusively to prestigious high-speed passenger transport, but also excessive national characteristics in terms of railway traditions, techniques and protocols, thereby compromising the flow of continental rail traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the situation of the European transport network situation is simple to the point of caricature: there is only one common area in transport and that is the road network. There is no longer any single airspace or European maritime area, nor especially a continuous railway area within the countries of the Union. The issue at stake in railway interoperability is, of course, doing away with the technical frontiers that have been inherited from the national railway structures set in place gradually since the nineteenth century. Today, the Europe of the Fifteen has no less than sixteen electric signalling systems, six electrical voltages, five track gauges and several equipment and therefore infrastructure gauges. Of course, the new high-speed train infrastructures offer a prime area for the introduction of interoperability, since they are new or recent networks devoted to very similar technology. </p>
<p class="contents">Directive 96/48 was adopted for this purpose. The report on its application, four years on, referred to Parliament to express an opinion, delivers contrasting results, but results that are in the end more positive than they may seem. In the first place, significant delay is observed in the transposition of laws and regulations since, to date, only two countries have transposed it and the first technical specifications for interoperability are on the point of being completed and published. The conclusion is therefore that the time limits for transposition and publication must be more stringent in future. </p>
<p class="contents">This delay in transposing into law has not, however, hindered the development of interoperable cross-border lines, although Thalys is the only example of true interoperability, more so than even Eurostar, despite its attempts to solve the gauge problem. These two international lines have established a precedent which can serve as a model for future developments. More than that, however, in anticipation of tangible results in future, the directive on the interoperability of high-speed routes has primarily made it possible to define and iron out working methods.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time, the railway industry, rail companies and infrastructure managers have started up a joint project to define the technical specifications for interoperability. They have worked on the basis of the most general studies by the International Union of Railways. Within the European Association for Railway Interoperability (EARI) they have set up a working group which now has methods and experience available for transposition to conventional systems. Finally, the Committee established by Article 21, bringing together representatives of the Member States and the Commission, enables political and technical monitoring of interoperability projects and intervention at the discretion of states to direct such projects. In other words, while the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism felt bound to remind the Member States of their obligations in terms of time limits and transposition, it must be admitted that the high-speed systems have provided a first-rate testing ground for the vast worksite of interoperability.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, we have to bear in mind that the network and the conventional stock present problems for harmonisation that are formidable in other ways, due to the national and historical characteristics of networks, the great diversity of the stock, and the considerable extent of the networks. It must be made quite clear at this point that there is no question of insisting that rail companies and infrastructure managers immediately proceed to replace their equipment comprehensively. This is totally out of reach, economically. In the first place, if the goal is to achieve interoperability, this must entail using the fastest and least costly means to achieve decisive progress. In this respect, interoperability may be achieved by methods other than the harmonisation of equipment, since it is possible to adapt equipment to operate in different configurations, following the example of the quadruple-system locomotives. This is a proposal for a pragmatic and realistic approach which would not detract from railways’ competitiveness in relation to other modes of transport by imposing additional costs.</p>
<p class="contents">The key principles of this proposed directive are as follows: restriction of the geographical area covered by conventional system interoperability to the trans-European network as defined by the 1996 European Parliament and Council Decision; a policy of gradual convergence rather than systematic renewal, taking the form of phasing in priorities and interoperability, establishing a hierarchy for subsystems to enable the fastest and cheapest access, with priority only to new investment for creating, extending, renewing, maintaining and operating systems; establishing a hierarchy of objectives, distinguishing across-the-board objectives to be included in all standards: safety, reliability, health, environmental protection and technical compatibility; the objectives inherent in each technical subsystem: infrastructure, energy, rolling stock, etc.; the separation of the technical task of framing the TSIs assigned to a joint representative body, from the standardisation work entrusted to the European standards institutes, and the inspection and certification entrusted to notified bodies; a policy of user consultation, as suggested by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism which cannot be envisaged, ladies and gentlemen, without concomitant consultation of staff representatives, the subject of an amendment that we shall be discussing tomorrow; finally, ongoing monitoring of these projects by the Member States and the Commission through the Committee established under Article 21, implemented by the high-speed directive, enabling states to request exemptions, to include special cases in the technical specifications for purely historic or regional networks, as well as certain types of equipment originating from third countries, and also instruments for authorising commissioning operations notified by Member States to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, there are safety valves for countries with a high level of special characteristics, and, within the institutions stipulated by the directive, they still have the opportunity to argue the case for these special characteristics and to have them included in the studies and in the TSI publications. Finally, during the transition period, it is important to prevent the networks from growing further apart. To this end, new investments, between now and the publication of the TSIs, shall have to comply with authorised technical references. A Union rolling-stock register will be set up, making it possible to identify the rolling stock, its renewal and ageing, in the same way that this is still carried out, albeit imperfectly, for the maritime fleet. Furthermore, we have to look to the future and, therefore, both the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy have proposed involving candidate country representatives in the projects at this early stage, so that they can anticipate this future <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. Similarly, and this is a recommendation that we make, we should already be planning conditions of interoperability between the various modes of transport, in accordance with our general objective of developing intermodal interoperability.</p>
<p class="contents">It would, of course, be presumptuous to expect everything to be achieved by this directive and the long-term upgrading work it requires from railway operators. Quite clearly Europe is proposing to undertake a long-term and very large-scale project throughout its vast railway network. It cannot single-handedly solve the problem of distortions of competition or of network access or charges which would represent crucial progress towards a new golden age of rail in Europe. All the same, the technical interoperability of our old national networks is indeed an essential condition for the recovery of rail, which this balanced, reasonable and flexible text should make possible to achieve in gradual phases under acceptable economic and social conditions.</p>

The number of proposed amendments tabled, including here in plenary, shows how important this issue is for Europe, which is why I can also praise the Commission for addressing the subject of the interoperability of conventional trains as well as of high-speed trains. I think it is a pity that few Member States have transposed the interoperability directive with regard to high-speed trains and I call on the Commission to exert pressure to prevent the loss of valuable time which is costing the railways in terms of market shares and competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive is even more important where conventional trains are concerned. The aim of the directive – as with high-speed trains – is to harmonise technical provisions in order to ensure that conventional rail traffic within the Union runs as smoothly as possible and to give candidate countries really exact specifications so that through traffic is also guaranteed after enlargement. Interoperability will also have many advantages for both passengers and freight transport. Better services, greater comfort, less travelling time, increased safety and possibly also lower prices. The harmonisation of technical standards is also needed for the long overdue liberalisation of the railways. Both together, interoperability and liberalisation, are most important if the railways are to survive in the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that we have succeeded with the rapporteur and numerous other members in finding a good, common line on most aspects of this very demanding subject and would like to thank them for that. This applies above all to the initially highly disputed derogations from the TSIs, but also to the social dimension of this directive, where we were finally able to achieve a compromise. Nonetheless, – and we in the group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats continue to believe that we are right here – generally-worded social aspects do not belong in this purely technical directive, even if the Commission and the Council may think otherwise. We are likewise opposed to involving passengers in working out TSIs. Including these aspects will only result in the directive being difficult or impossible to manage.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a few other proposed amendments have been tabled, which we consider are quite simply too bureaucratic and have no positive aspects to boot. In short, our group is against any elements which are counterproductive when it comes to achieving the important objective of an efficient European railway, as outlined above. Allow me in closing to highlight the excellent cooperation once again; I am optimistic that together we shall achieve the objective of creating as smooth a railway system as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is crucial for the consolidation of the internal market and for more sustainable development, and is an essential factor in improving economic and social cohesion. I would also like to congratulate him because this is a very complex issue that he has addressed with great clarity and depth and also for the open-mindedness and negotiating skills that he has demonstrated in including many of the amendments that were tabled.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">For a long time, the European Parliament has been advocating a transport policy that promotes rail transport, as it is the form of transport that causes the least pollution, and in many situations it is the most comfortable for passengers and adapts most easily to long distance goods transport. What we have seen, however, is exactly the opposite: the volume of rail transport of passengers and goods has been steadily decreasing, as has the number of people working in companies in those areas which nevertheless, still stands at around one million.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two fundamental reasons for this situation. Firstly, there are still borders between the fifteen Member States as far as rail transport is concerned, as well as the applicable national legislation in each country. Secondly, rail transport is considered to be a great deal more expensive than road transport. As to this second aspect, some measures have already been adopted, with the construction and management of transport infrastructures themselves being separated in most countries of the European Union. If the manufacturers and owners of cars and lorries were directly responsible for paying for infrastructures and their maintenance – as is the case in the rail sector – we would certainly not have made as rapid progress in this area as we have. The amendments that have now been tabled to establish rules for cross-border interoperability in the European Union clearly show the direction we should take in this matter. The interest demonstrated by the Portuguese Presidency in taking these dossiers forward as quickly as possible gives us hope that, with the contribution of the European Parliament, this situation will finally change, to the benefit of rail transport.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the high-speed rail system, I shall just highlight two aspects, which I think are crucial: the interconnection and interoperability of high-speed infrastructures with rolling stock and additional services are crucial for facilitating the mobility of persons and goods and for promoting a high-speed trans-European rail system that is efficient and able to respond to the needs of the public. The other aspect that I would like to highlight concerns the need to standardise the professional qualifications, training programmes and working conditions of those working in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I must emphasise that we Socialists feel that economic and social cohesion is one of the European Union’s fundamental aims, and that, in the rail transport sector, support must be provided for Europe’s northern and southern peripheral regions and for specific and historical cases where costs of adaptation are very high but are absolutely essential, because their different track gauges have to be changed. This is the case in Spain and Portugal, where the aim of providing a high-speed rail service, particularly on an Atlantic line, is a legitimate ambition of the governments and citizens of those countries </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pohjamo (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FI</span>) Mr President, I would first like to congratulate Mr Savary on his drafting of such excellent reports. This is an important topic, but also an extremely complicated one. Mr Savary has taken good account of the views of others. My group supports improvement of the competitiveness of railways and liberalisation of competition. The first stage is to create the conditions for uninterrupted movement of trains over the entire region of the European Union. Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSIs) and common standards are a <span class="italic">sine qua non </span>for the development of railway interoperability.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has quite rightly adopted a gradual approach. Technical solutions can vary a great deal. The competitiveness of railways should not be undermined by the imposition of additional economic burdens, even though common standards will lower costs in the longer term. Existing differences between national railway systems will make necessary some exceptions in the harmonisation of railway systems, so that no Member State shall have to face inordinate difficulties and so that current railway transport will not be jeopardised. This report outlines a course of action by which these exceptions can be accepted without jeopardising the principal objective. </p>
<p class="contents">There is one further matter which would require fine tuning; this was outlined in Amendment No 35 by my Group. It applies to Finland in particular, but some of the applicant countries will be faced with the same problem in connection with enlargement of the Union. The matter referred to concerns Russian freight wagons, where technical solutions are applied which differ from those of the Member States, <span class="italic">inter alia</span> in the area of couplings and brakes. They are not necessarily inferior, but different. Russia is hardly about to change its standards in order to comply with the requirements of the Union. For Finland, this is an exceptionally major issue. Due to historical reasons, the track gauge in Finland and Russia is the same, but it is different from that in Europe in general. Russian wagons account for approximately 40 % – almost a half – of Finnish freight transport. The reason for this high percentage is that we do not want to take the risk of sending Finnish wagons to Russia, since experience shows that they are so very rarely returned. Russia, of course, is a country which leans heavily on rail transport, with a rolling stock which must equal that of the entire region of the EU put together</p>
<p class="contents">In the review concerning point 5 of Article 5, Mr Savary proposes that when considering special cases, particular attention should be paid to the rolling stock of third countries. This proposal is very good, but the solution remains half-finished, as far as Finland is concerned. It will lead to unnecessary and laborious inspections of Russian wagons and to massive bureaucracy. There is no certainty either that Russian wagons in all instances would be regarded as special cases. This is why we have tabled an amendment of Article 7, which simply aims at making it possible to use third country freight wagons for traffic, as long as they do not cross the border between two Member States. This is the addition referred to as point f in the Committee’s amendment. Implementation of this proposal would give assurance that rail traffic in Finland could continue without becoming drastically reduced.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are evidently debating a highly technical subject matter, namely the interoperability of both high-speed and conventional rail systems. This gives me the opportunity to make a few comments on the environmental dimension to this proposal. Today, we are essentially witnessing one of many historic moments which those who work in the sector, as well as those who are in favour of trains, have waited for for a long time, because at the end of the day, all this is, of course, meant to culminate in technological harmonisation, which entails the harmonisation of international rail, labour organisations, train drivers who have to make international rail journeys, etc. This also means that employers’ organisations and trade unions will have an entirely different role and outlook with respect to this work. </p>
<p class="contents">In short, the proposal has a knock-on effect on many other areas and it will be some time before it is a reality. Certainly if I look at the high-speed link and its technical specifications, I share Mr Savary’s view – who has drawn up an excellent report – that it is scandalous that three, nearly four years after the previous directive on interoperability of the high-speed link, we are still waiting for technical specifications for interoperability. This does not bode well at all for the future. </p>
<p class="contents">What we are aiming for in the long run with this rail proposal is to attempt to cut down on traffic jams but also, more importantly, to benefit the environment, safety and a number of other aspects. It has to be said, and I have already mentioned this several times within other fora, that the rail system is gradually losing its environmental edge, not so much because it does not take any initiatives itself, but more so because we ourselves prescribe few, if any, specifications for example, regarding the use of diesel-electric locomotives, the type of electricity used, etc. </p>
<p class="contents">What we would like, and this is why we welcome with open arms the dual speed for technical specification requirements, is for this technical specification to at least take account of energy consumption and air pollution, something which will require a great deal of hard work. </p>
<p class="contents">The second important point is of course the social dimension, as I touched upon a moment ago. I regret that we are confining ourselves to the bare minimum, i.e. working conditions. We refer to a social dialogue but we should really take it one step further, because this affects the entire labour organisation of railways. I would urge you to look into the positive experiences which certain countries have had in changing the labour organisation of the rail system, in order to bring about a more efficient rail system and to set up exchange programmes, so that we can learn from experiences in countries which have struggled in the past, and which are often still struggling where other elements of the rail dossier are concerned, such as liberalisation or fair pricing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Meijer (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, despite European integration, the rail system is disintegrating. It is increasingly hard to obtain international rail timetables and it is often the case that train tickets to remote destinations have to be bought outside the country of departure. Not so long ago, it was possible to take a direct train from Cologne to Athens, from Paris to Lisbon or from Amsterdam to Copenhagen. This is now a thing of the past. </p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, railways are, however, in the process of being re-discovered. The times when trains were seen as a burden inherited from the nineteenth century, something that can be neglected and dismantled, are fortunately over. Almost everyone admits that trains should once again play a key role in European long-haul transport for people and goods alike. This is not just necessary to meet the increasing demand for transport options, but mainly to curb the tide of cars and aeroplanes which form a threat to the environment. </p>
<p class="contents">The views on how to modernise the rail system are strongly divided. For a long time, it was fashionable to apply everything that had contributed to the emergence of cars and aeroplanes to trains. According to this line of thinking, everything should come down in price and should become flexible, so that price-based competition has a less detrimental effect on trains. Some people still advocate that everything should be privatised and liberalised, that the influence of trade unions must be restrained and that railway personnel should perform more work for lower wages. According to the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, these remedies are worse than the disease. These would reportedly lead to further decay of the railway business and deterioration in the quality of services, and would force personnel to strike more, for reasons of self-preservation. </p>
<p class="contents">The real solutions must be sought in a completely different direction. For starters, there should be better cooperation between the existing national railway companies in the management of frequent and fast cross-border routes. </p>
<p class="contents">In the case of the conventional railway system, the routes Brussels to Amsterdam, Hamburg to Copenhagen and Dublin to Belfast are good examples of this. The passengers are unaware that it is two companies who are responsible for this one joint and frequent link. This could also apply to the extensions of the French high-speed links in England, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany which are running under the names "Eurostar" and "Thalys".</p>
<p class="contents">To guarantee success, it is important not to bring in a whole ream of new commercial businesses, which would lead to bad connections and variable pricing. Furthermore, the money to finance such a high-speed network should not be found through cutting down services on short-haul routes in the individual Member States, as many people are indignant – and rightly so – about the huge amount of funding being ploughed into fast connections for the benefit of a small, privileged minority. </p>
<p class="contents">The construction of new high-speed links will continue to meet with protest if the ordinary domestic train user only ever experiences higher prices and fewer facilities and if they do not solve the environmental problems caused by cars and aeroplanes. </p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, technology should be better harmonised by means of common mains voltage, joint equipment, fewer changes for passengers at borders and uniform safety requirements. Privatisation and fragmentation according to the British model offer no guarantee whatsoever that those improvements could be better accommodated than if we were to keep the present state enterprises. </p>
<p class="contents">The position of the one million employees in the European rail system must be protected. They are people who offer useful services to each and every one of us. This is why they should not come at the bottom of the list in our railway policy, as is sometimes advocated, I regret to say, by those in favour of a commercial approach. </p>
<p class="contents">My group would like to see trade-union rights, participation, working conditions and work pressure given a more prominent role. Luckily, the rapporteur is not yielding under the pressure to consider personnel as a cost factor alone. I am pleased that Mr Savary’s proposals help strike a happy balance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given the alarming position rail finds itself in in most Member States, intervention is vital. It is of utmost importance to drastically reduce the obstacles created for international traffic by inconsistencies in the different types of equipment and networks used. </p>
<p class="contents">The harmonisation of the physical networks for the conventional rail system is a step in the right direction and certainly deserves support. Nobody can deny its importance. Despite this, I am of the opinion that a great deal of the work done by Members is superfluous. Most of their wishes have already been incorporated in some shape or form in the text of the directive. This should not be done again. Furthermore, we are dealing with a directive here, which means that it makes little sense to include too detailed and intricate specific cases. This directive is extremely technical in nature and its main objective is to facilitate the use of all kinds of trains using all kinds of networks. This is why comments concerning personnel do not really seem to fit in here. Only clear agreements on qualifications for personnel who will be deployed on cross-border routes are necessary. The curbing of the freedom of enterprise should not go further than strictly necessary. </p>
<p class="contents">In short, Mr President, I will certainly support the idea contained in the reports, even if certain proposed elements are not appropriate in this context. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is unusual, but you know that I have the highest personal regard for you and am therefore delighted to see you here this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">Interoperability is a fundamental issue and, if we take it seriously, the time has come to admit that the European Union has failed over recent years. We have made no progress whatsoever with interoperability. I think it is extremely important that we again inform the Council, where everything is diligently recorded, that 40 years after the creation of the European common market, we have made no progress in the railway sector. I hope that the draft report by Mr Savary, whom I should like once again to thank for his draft, and I should also like to thank my colleague Mrs Jeggle for her shadow report – I hope that if we manage to persuade the Commission and Council to accept the draft report, we shall be reasonably well placed for the future. I also hope that the Council will accept our proposed amendments. We have taken a great deal of trouble and Mr Savary has also tabled umpteen proposed amendments for the plenary sitting, which we support, in order to achieve a report which the Council can accept, thereby avoiding a conciliation procedure and second reading. I hope that the Council will do so and I call on it to act responsibly. Having made no progress whatsoever with interoperability for years now, the Council should accept our decision tomorrow so that we can make some progress and avoid yet another second reading and conciliation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The difficulty which must be acknowledged is, of course, that the internal market can only function if we have uniform systems in the long term and we must ensure that we really do make progress here. I also call on industry in Europe to abandon the policy it has pursued over recent years of separating off its national market by deliberately not manufacturing rolling stock which can be used in other countries. Everyone has staked out their own market, which is why we have this fragmented railway market in Europe – and this is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me one more closing comment. Mr Swoboda, who is about to speak, and I shall soon be discussing the Railway Pact here in the House. We are opening the markets but we need interoperability in order to do so. These are two aspects of the overall complex and I therefore hope that the Council really is wise and clever enough to accept the proposed amendments which we shall probably adopt by a large majority tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Jarzembowski and I hold such similar views that I should like to begin where he left off. In a few weeks’ time, we shall propose to Parliament at second reading and by a large majority – there are still a few differences of opinion here and there – what framework market conditions and operating regulations are needed in order to create a European railway system.</p>
<p class="contents">All this, as the previous speaker has already said, will not produce a European railway system unless there is also a degree of interoperability on the technical and social side. It is grotesque: every private company, even small private companies, think European nowadays. It is only on the railways that we have not managed to achieve this and we are now endeavouring to bring about a European attitude. The comment about industry is correct. We always look spellbound at America, at the United States, where industry and, of course, the free market economy are also promoted by the state. Except that, when it comes to American companies, the situation is quite different. In Europe, uniting in a common European market is proving to be an arduous task.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we expect European products to be used throughout the world, when we are cannot even agree on certain technical conditions and interoperability in Europe? In this sense I should like to offer the rapporteur, Mr Savary, my full and unequivocal support and congratulate him on his excellent report.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need is technical interoperability. That has already been said. Industry has its part to play here, but of course clients, i.e. the European construction companies, must also do what they can to force industry to cooperate. This also applies, and here I disagree with a number of previous speakers, to social comparability and alignment. Of course, that does not mean that everything will become identical, because we do not want a situation with one side more or less exploiting the other; we want a situation in which we look together to see how we can bring about a European railway system.</p>
<p class="contents">Safety is also, without doubt, an issue. The huge advantage of the railway is that it is safe and environmentally-friendly. Just as it is a pity that the transport Commissioner cannot be here, it is a good sign that the Commissioner for the environment is here, because, in the final analysis, traffic, and railway traffic in particular, is a means to an end and not an end in itself and it should help to improve our environmental situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Savary has also highlighted a very important point; namely that we must ensure during the enlargement of the European Union that the European railway system does not stop at the current borders of the European Union but covers the whole of Europe so that it can help to improve the environment and increase traffic safety throughout Europe.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that in a good number of European policies we put forward the need to transfer passenger transport, but most especially freight transport, from road to rail in order, on the one hand, to comply with our international commitments but, on the other hand, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to reduce environmental pollution in general, to relieve congestion on the roads and to reduce the social costs of road transport, which are borne indirectly by the community as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, none of them new ones, the European Union must make it possible to take up the challenge. In relation to the reports on interoperability it must be noted that the train was not considered to be the transport of the future which was going to provide the solution to a number of problems, particularly environmental problems. In transport policies within the European Union, rail was overlooked.</p>
<p class="contents">As evidence of this I would cite the considerable amounts of Structural Fund, trans-European network and Cohesion Fund aid allocated to roads and motorways, which for far too long have had more than their due. Only rarely was there a question of allocating aid to conventional rail systems in order to modernise them and so that they might compete, particularly with heavy goods vehicles on the roads. The declining figures for rail transport, particularly for freight, bear witness to the lack of investment at this level. In the race to develop infrastructures, rail has been the great forgotten area.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, there are now crucial studies which make it possible to justify the urgent need and the relevance of investing in rail. Moreover, we would point out that it is essential that the European Parliament should incorporate staff training and health and safety conditions into this directive. Indeed, many of us still remember the conditions in which the transportation of radioactive waste between Germany and France was carried out for many years. Because they did not know about radioactivity, and were not informed about it, some members of staff at the Woippy marshalling yard, in the Lorraine region, used to gather round these heat-generating carriages to keep warm in winter. The chemical containers which we would also like to see transported by rail also require specific training in order to guarantee general safety as well as to prevent exposure and handling which may prove dangerous to the health of the operators involved.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, then, we consider this report to be a well-balanced one, and we also wish to congratulate the rapporteur, but we have nonetheless tabled a number of amendments in order to improve it still more. These are to do with taking account of social dialogue, which we deem essential. I would urge you to support the amendments to this effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to focus in my speech on three aspects and I am sorry that Mrs Jeggle and Mr van Dam take the opposite view on two of these aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">First, liberalisation of the railway networks in the Member States and the establishment of a common market for railway services is addressed from the point of view of free access and transit rights for the infrastructures of the Member States in cross-border traffic, especially freight traffic. And new technical specifications for interoperability are at the forefront here. In my view, the proposed extension to the concept of interoperability, by including questions such as the professional qualifications of staff and the need for health and safety regulations at the workplace, is of paramount importance and a vote in favour of the report by my group depends on it.</p>
<p class="contents">Most national railway systems in the Member States have comprehensive rules governing the aforementioned social aspects and rather than lose them in the process of liberalisation at European level, we must harmonise them at the highest possible level. At this point I should like to support the call for more authority to be given to the merely advisory voice of the social partners in the sectoral committee and for the European social partners to be granted equal decision-making powers similar to those in many national regulations, when resolutions are passed.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in addition to agreeing to the minimum level of technical harmonisation proposed in the report, the preparation of ex ante cost-benefit analyses and the order of priorities for drawing up TSIs, my group sets particular store by including the social partners, associations and organisations, passengers and users in the work of drafting and checking technical specifications for interoperability.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we also support the proposal to allow representatives from the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe to attend committee meetings from the outset. The plan to involve them in the process of discussing and setting TSIs from the outset is important if the technical standards and specifications of future candidate countries to are to be brought into line early on with current developments in the EU. This will allow us to ensure ahead of time that the infrastructure in these countries can keep pace, thereby helping to minimise the separate costs which the European Union would otherwise incur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we consider interoperability to be essential, we support this report, and offer our congratulations to Mr Savary for the pertinence of his observations. The road-rail balance must be adjusted by means of a carefully calculated interoperability. In the long term, the increase in heavy goods transport will cause enormous problems, such as congestion, the construction of new routes, and problems of safety and pollution. It is absolutely essential, in this eventuality, to have recourse to rail transport. The problem is even greater for countries located at strategic crossroads, such as France, where the saturation of the road networks is yet another argument for the crucial need to put interoperability into practice. The models of Thalys and Eurostar must be extended and intensified with the new high-speed train routes: TGV-East to Germany, Southern Europe-Atlantic to Madrid and Lisbon, and South-Mediterranean to Barcelona.</p>
<p class="contents">As for conventional rail networks, it is time that interoperability was made compulsory, reinforced by considerable amounts of European aid which would, moreover, enable Member States to safeguard their conventional local networks. Interoperability is all the more necessary as rail transport is profitable over long distances. So border stops, changes in equipment and staff and, more importantly, transhipment operations should be limited to avoid putting a strain on reliability in terms of the time and service provided. Airfreight manages perfectly well without border stops. So let us adapt. We shall not be able to upgrade the competitiveness of rail unless we bring in stringent constraints. Interoperability must be made compulsory, particularly for the new networks that are being built, even if the TSIs have not been finalised. We cannot afford to delay any longer before actually implementing this measure which will acquire even greater significance with the enlargement of our Community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, the most important points to be borne in mind are two figures, which are really quite shocking. The first is that in 1970, the railways had a 20% share of the freight market, whereas today they have just 8.5%. The second figure concerns the average hourly speed of railways in Europe, which is 16 kilometres per hour. And all this in the year 2000! </p>
<p class="contents">Evidently, we need an immediate political response from the 15 Member States of the European Union. Before such a response can be given, we first need to understand the problem and we need the corresponding political will. In my view, and of course this is the view of all those who have spoken today, we need to take steps as regards network compatibility and interoperability, because we have different technical specifications, different standards and different management systems. And of course, we all endorse the report by Mr Savary, whom I would once again like to commend on his work. </p>
<p class="contents">However, it is not enough for us just to forge ahead with interoperability. We need to consider the entire railway liberalisation package and combine this with interoperability. In this context, I would like to say that the Helsinki Council resolutions may well be satisfactory, but they are inadequate. If we want to make headway, then we need to adopt the opinion expressed by the European Parliament at first reading, because it deals more fully with the problem which, as is already quite clear I think, is a particularly acute problem. We should all realise that a common market without a unified transport network is simply will-o’-the wisp. So if we want to examine the problem in its entirety, we need to have, and to provide, the necessary responses. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add two separate issues concerning my country, Greece, since my capacity as chairman of the Transport Committee does not, I imagine, deny me the right to raise problems of this kind. The first problem is that Greece has no main cross-border rail links, especially with other Member States. On the contrary, it has important cross-border rail links with third, non-EU countries, which are not bound by Community legislation and, consequently, employ their own national standards and systems and will no doubt continue to do so in the shorter or longer term. This is certainly an issue which merits special mention and regulation so that the European harmonisation we are working for does not prove to be detrimental to the cross-border rail networks of countries such as Greece. </p>
<p class="contents">Another issue I would like to touch upon is that special provision should be made for peculiarities and differences caused by the geographical location and topography of various Member States such as Greece, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Finland, etc., whose remote or island nature causes particular problems.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps she is stuck at Brussels airport. Perhaps she should have taken the train.</p>
<p class="contents">I begin by welcoming the Commission's proposal to integrate Europe's convention on a high-speed rail network. I thank the rapporteur for his patience, his skill and, above all, his commitment to the cause of Europe's railways. I would also like to thank the Portuguese presidency for its skilful handling of this very complex dossier – an example of Europeans working together to solve common problems. This problem, I believe, can only be solved satisfactorily at EU-level.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the problem? As we have heard already this evening, in 1970 the railways had a 21% share of the freight market, today just 8.5%. In 1970 the railways had a 10% share of the passenger market, today just 6%. If these trends continue just 4% of travellers will go by train at the end of the decade and rail freight will all but disappear. The sad fact is that the railways have lost ground even where there are well placed, for example, in long distance freight. The very future of our railways is at stake, together with the jobs of one million people employed in the industry.</p>
<p class="contents">A key reason for this decline is that, in contrast to aviation and road haulage, a single market does not exist in this sector. For 150 years, the railways have been organised along national lines. Even the opportunity of electrification further divided Europe's railways because there are now five different systems in operation. More recently the railways have adopted 16 different and incompatible electronic signalling systems. That all adds costs and it means railways cannot compete. Differences have also contributed to the fragmentation of the market for railway equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal being considered here tonight, together with other proposals from the Commission, aims to create an internal market in rail services. It will help achieve a harmonisation of technical standards for equipment and rolling stock and the integration of national networks to boost cross-border traffic. That will make the railways more efficient, reliable and more competitive. It would also boost the railway equipment industry in countries such as my own. It will contribute to the fulfilment of our aim of switching freight from the congested and polluted roads to Europe's railways and encouraging the development of more high-speed rail services to take the place of short-haul flights. The revitalisation of the railways is crucial to the future of Europe's transport system, our environment and our economy. That is why Mr Savary's report deserves our full support.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is high time that the Member States forsook their national stances in favour of a European stance because it is national stances that have prevented the rail system from being vital and from retaining its passengers and freight. Instead, we are now faced with the opposite. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Savary’s excellent report is the first in a whole series of reports which will deal with the rail system and its liberalisation, which is essential, in my view. Trains should not be confined to internal borders within a large European market. I think that is important. Liberalisation and competition should be introduced within this large European market. That, in my view, is the best solution for customers and services. If the best solution had been cooperation between national companies, then they would have done this a long time ago and we would not be faced with this long-standing problem, namely that rail transport is on the wane. </p>
<p class="contents">For a country like mine, and several other Members have spoken about their own countries, it is, of course, essential that we have one European market with technical unity or ‘interoperability’, to use a buzz word. Indeed, a small country is vulnerable in that respect, but a country which lies at major intersections is even more vulnerable to this. I think that we need to take sound steps and take them fast. </p>
<p class="contents">A difficult issue was that of personnel. Mr Savary, I welcome the compromise that we were able to reach in that respect. It is, of course, important for health and safety to be regulated and not compromised over, and this is also true, of course, of training. We should be very clear about this too, so as to ensure that these issues are brought into line. </p>
<p class="contents">I am left with one question, namely I wonder whether we are sufficiently ambitious, as indeed, we are only referring to trans-European rail systems. In my opinion, however, if we harmonise trans-European rail systems, we should also do the same for national rail systems. This is especially important for those people who manufacture trains and train equipment. We need, as a matter of urgency, to create a European single market in that respect too, and this will only be possible if we harmonise trans-European, i.e. international, as well as national traffic. </p>
<p class="contents">As such, we need to ensure as soon as we can that we create rail systems modelled on the HST, such as Thalys and Eurostar, which do not stop at borders but which carry on. This should also be possible for ordinary trains because if not, Mr President, we are heading for a traffic nightmare. Indeed, if we do not breathe new life into the railway sector, we will always have that traffic nightmare hanging over us and it is absolutely essential that we resolve this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His task has certainly been difficult, and this has been demonstrated by the conflicting interests expressed during tonight’s speeches.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Spanish MEP, I would have preferred the task to have been achieved with greater flexibility and certain technical specifications which affect structural issues within the railway system not to have been applied. I am referring specifically to the Spanish rail gauge, which, since this is a problem affecting the basic railway structure, we believe would involve a costly and slow renovation, and its particular circumstances need to be taken into account. This means that it should not be regulated by means of the so-called ‘specific cases’, subject to committee decisions, but that, on the contrary, we should consider the possibility that automatic derogations should apply depending on the incompatibility of these technical specifications with existing lines.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore hope that you will be receptive to this request because, otherwise, we should bear in mind that all the projects, all the development plans for the rail networks affected by these specifications, would be subject to difficult conditions, and this would have a negative effect, since it would create uncertainty in relation to the planned investment programmes themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It means that a fixed link is being created between Scandinavia and the continent. The bridge will make it considerably easier to convey people and goods from Sweden and Finland to the rest of Europe. However, we have a problem, at present, with different voltage systems. In fact, the power has to be taken away from a portion of the track so that the trains are able to alternate between the different voltage systems in Sweden and Denmark. </p>
<p class="contents">We have different gauges in Sweden and Finland. The only railway linking the two countries is that between Haparanda and Torneå. Gauge switches are now being tested there to make it easier to cross the border. However, there are also some extremely good examples of other systems. The ore trains which travel from northern Sweden to northern Norway have just the one driver to take the train across the border. This works well because the countries concerned have cooperated with the employers and employees. </p>
<p class="contents">Within the EU, we now have fifteen different and separate railway systems which are often incompatible with one another. This means that, within the railways sector, we have neither free movement nor a common market. If we are serious about creating an international, competitive railway, we must also create a common railways structure within Europe. Coordination of the railway systems is especially important for those countries and regions which are not situated in the centre of Europe. In order to be able to travel right through the EU, Swedish trains, for example, must be able to pass through several countries and, thus, several national railway systems. At present, this involves an obvious competitive disadvantage and means that the centrally situated countries within the EU should be urged to coordinate their various systems. For the same reason, it is also important for those countries bordering the EU to be able to be involved in the work on harmonisation so that there are no restrictions upon transport to and from third countries. </p>
<p class="contents">If compatibility is to be achieved, the specifications of a range of technical components need to be brought into line with one another. What, however, is at least as important in terms of this change is that coordination should also be achieved within the operational and administrative systems, that staff should be duly trained and that there should be agreements in place to enable drivers to take trains across the national borders. </p>
<p class="contents">Road traffic in Europe is increasing each year. It creates problems in the form of environmental damage, noise, overcrowding and accidents. In order to be able to cope with this trend, methods of transport must become cleaner, quieter, safer and more efficient. Railways are the means of transport which now best meets these requirements. Rail transport must therefore become more attractive and competitive. In order to reach that point, however, the railways must be able to compete on the same conditions as other forms of transport. The Savary report is therefore very important and <span class="italic">one</span> step along the road. It is now just a question of all the Member States turning it into a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To discuss the interoperability of the conventional trans-European railway system at the end of the 20th century, just as everyone is getting ready to leave, looks bad, even if, admittedly, interoperability has increased. But still! It has taken more than 100 years for us to pluck up the courage here and give the railways another chance. And yet the facts do not look very promising. The rapporteur has included figures in his report which are all the more significant for being so thin on the ground. Mr Hatzidakis has already told us that the railways had a 21% share of the freight traffic market in 1970 and now have a mere 8.5%; in passenger transport, their share has fallen from 10% in 1970 to 6%. The prospects for high-speed trains are somewhat more encouraging, although here too, not everything in the garden is rosy. It is true that we have at least got something on the rails in western Europe, namely Thalys and Eurostar. But where we want to network Europe in the long term, especially with the future Member States of the Union, things do not look any better. Yet it is vital to win over Eastern Europe, which still makes relatively good use of the railway network, to interoperability with Europe before everything switches to the roads. Incidentally, this must be done through dialogue with the candidate countries, as the Savary report rightly stresses.</p>
<p class="contents">On one point, there is a need for nostalgia: we want to maintain a small part of the history of Europe and keep historic railway lines in their original state. We shall leave them out of the scope of our directive and the friends of the railway will thank us. Interoperability is rightly not required where regional demands and solutions need to maintain their own legislation within the framework of subsidiarity. In this context, a word to my Austrian Minister of Transport.</p>
<p class="contents">The southern railway in Austria is an old stretch of line and is of regional importance. But, more importantly, it is the north-south link in the east of the present Union. If we do not invest in it, the east of Austria will run the risk of economic exclusion in the future. That is in nobody’s interest. Austria is excluded from the Union at present more than enough as it is. Let us end all forms of isolation and ensure that we have comprehensive interoperability in the Union.</p>

The routes of the railway structures on our continent were set a long time before Schuman made his famous speech on the <span class="italic">Quai d'Orsay</span>. In those days, military factors were given priority over the transport of people and goods. In my country, Spain, as in Russia, a different gauge to the rest of Europe was chosen in order to make a possible military invasion more difficult, which proves that European construction was not the priority for those people who took the decisions on railway routes.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore – as others have said – almost every country has constructed its network in a radial manner, around its capital, which is a serious obstacle to all those who want to create a different kind of route, such as from Spain to Germany or Italy to the UK without passing, for example, through Paris. Paris and many other capitals and almost all intra-European borders act as barriers for through rail routes. For this reason, the transport of passengers and goods by rail has been suffering for decades.</p>
<p class="contents">We have managed to harmonise the European economy, but the current rail network is not a useful instrument for the single market. Therefore, we resort to road transport, despite the fact that it creates pollution and is dangerous. We must free the citizens of Europe from the road monopoly by offering them working railways throughout the Union which are competitive in relation to other modes of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">The inclusion of a social clause seems to me to be an excellent idea. The railway workers are going to play an important role in interoperability and their interests must be addressed in the text of the directive. These workers have already paid the price for our forgetfulness. Their number has decreased by 500 000 in the last 15 years.</p>
<p class="contents">It is possible to revitalise the railway, as certain projects that have already been undertaken demonstrate. A Community which is undergoing a rapid process of integration and which is facing imminent enlargement needs to improve the efficiency and quality of the railway services it offers to customers. As Mr Savary says, this would contribute to achieving the objective of sustainable mobility and greater social and economic cohesion in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Peijs (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, one of the European Union’s key goals was the creation of the internal market, but this market has created a volume of traffic which is growing at an alarming rate. Despite this, we need to ensure that goods and people arrive at their destinations faster, more efficiently, at cheaper rates and in cleaner conditions than before. Rail transport is not really a great help in this respect, quite the reverse, in fact. Let us be honest, the train has remained stuck in the nineteenth century. In percentage terms, trains have certainly not retained their share in transport. We can only hope that they have retained it in real terms. Trains have proved the European Union right: more competition keeps you alert and on the ball. </p>
<p class="contents">Well, due to a lack of competition as a result of excessively protectionist behaviour on the part of the Member States – and I am not ashamed to admit this – the train has been condemned to a second-class position even in this century, also in terms of technology and even durability, which certain Members have emphasised. Trains are not durable and they are no longer clean, especially the diesel locomotives. We have finally reached a point in Europe where we are about to try to bring about a change in mentality. This is desperately needed, and about time too, for the sake of both the people and mobility within the European Union. We can no longer rely on road transport alone for it is fraught with problems, pollution, traffic jams, increased risk of accidents, as well as the problems which an increasing number of people are facing with the swelling flow of through traffic zooming past their doors. </p>
<p class="contents">If the rail systems can overcome the obstacles facing cross-border transport, i.e. by using each other’s rail infrastructure and if they make their equipment more durable, then this will relieve the pressure on road transport. Rail systems develop extremely slowly. In France, for example, this is because the government protects its own market and in the Netherlands, it is because we never manage to bring a procedure to a close and to start doing the groundwork. As a result of this, planes are still used in Europe for short-haul distances. Naturally, high-speed links such as those from Paris to Brussels should have superseded the plane a long time ago, but because of the vulnerability and sluggishness of the present trains, many prefer to take the plane. </p>
<p class="contents">It is not just manufacturers and governments that should be represented during the decision-making process pertaining to rail systems – in respect of which, incidentally, there is much room for improvement – but also the railway companies themselves. This is already the case in the technical field, in the form of the European Association for Railway Interoperability. This should also be the case for railway legislation, right across the board. After all, railway companies have the necessary in-house expertise and need to be involved in the entire process. The requirements for admission to the railway network and cooperation between the railway companies and the EU leaves a great deal to be desired. Take, for example, the night train from Amsterdam to Milan which will be introduced from 28 May. This route covers Germany, Geneva and Italy. Each country has its own set of rules regarding speed, safety and travelling comfort. Only if these requirements are met can access be gained to the railway network. This beggars belief, especially if the rules change and are adapted virtually by the day, as has been the case. This makes the interoperability of the European rail systems almost impossible in practice. </p>
<p class="contents">What we need are harmonisation and standardisation as soon as possible, if we want to create a true internal market for rail systems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a result, a lot of things work well within our countries. However, the deficiencies become apparent as soon as it is a question of crossing a border. In spite of the fact that there have been several attempts to solve the problems, partly within the International Railway Union, this is especially the case in the area we are discussing here this evening, namely that of Europe’s railway networks. As long as we have obstacles of this kind, there will also be clear limitations of at least two different kinds. Firstly, there will be a deterioration in the prior conditions of Europe’s being able to compete with other markets where these problems have perhaps already been solved. Secondly, there will be a deterioration in the prior conditions of the railways’ being able to compete with other types of transport. There is no doubt that the railways have been the big losers in recent decades, and remain so. </p>
<p class="contents">From a position, thirty years ago, when it had a more than twenty per cent share of the goods transport market in the EU, the railways are now down to having a share of less than ten per cent. At the same time, the market share for passenger transport has almost halved. </p>
<p class="contents">It is just not an option to force goods or passengers back onto the railways. The railways will become winners in the market if they become efficient and are given the opportunity to develop by their own efforts. Otherwise, there is an obvious risk that Europe’s railway network, at least where goods transport is concerned, will no longer exist within a few decades. For this reason, it is a step in the right direction when the Commission seeks so-called operational compatibility within the railways sector. The next step is to help extend the EU’s internal market to embrace the countries of Eastern and Central Europe, too. </p>
<p class="contents">Common operating systems and businesslike pricing should benefit Europe’s railway networks but, if the railways are to survive in the long-term, at least two additional things are required. Firstly, a diversity of operators is required. Just as there are many haulage contractors on Europe’s roads, there ought also to be many competing railway companies. Secondly, a distinction needs to be drawn between the national operator and whoever owns the track. That is the model we have in Sweden, and I believe in fact that it would be marvellous if similar systems could be introduced in all the EU’s Member States. Otherwise, the confusion between public authority and operator will continue to be an obstacle to the development of Europe’s railway networks. </p>
<p class="contents">In general, this means that an awful lot remains to be done even after the decisions which the European Parliament is making in conjunction with the present report. These nonetheless constitute extraordinarily important steps in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I cannot speak about high-speed railways in Northern Ireland, never mind the island of Ireland, because the railways do not go at any great speed in that particular part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">It is extremely important that we recognise the importance of a railway system. One thing that has concerned me recently in my region is that, in Europe, we talk about how important to regions it is that we should have the most environmentally friendly type of transport. At the same time within my area people are talking about doing away even with parts of our present minute railway system. I find that totally atrocious.</p>
<p class="contents">We have one of the main links between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland between Dublin and Belfast. This is a very important link and one that has been upgraded recently. Probably that would be up to at least half the standard of the rest of continental Europe, but it is very welcome to those of us who live in that area. Then we have the link between Belfast and Larne which links us to the rest of the United Kingdom. Parts of this have had to be closed down because there is not enough money to keep it in repair and upgraded.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also recently had Northern Ireland Railways tell us that they are going to close the link between Coleraine and Londonderry which is absolutely unbelievable and totally unacceptable. This is the one commuting area from the Northwest and it takes in part of the Republic of Ireland and the inner shore and peninsula. They need that railway system as a link for those who want to get to Belfast to reach airports and everywhere else. So we have to take a really serious look at what we are talking about here.</p>
<p class="contents">For too often within Europe we have talked about trans-European networks – be they road-rail, air or sea – but at the end of the day we are not prepared to put in the finance at either European level or national level. We have to take on board the challenges that come before us and we have to ensure that we have a very highly established rail link. I certainly want it within my region because that is important. There should be no more closures and we should make more finance available to improve the present railway system to have more goods moved by rail and not by road, which is totally unacceptable from an environmental point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">It is hurtful when I go back to my region and am told the money is not there. It is hurtful when you go back and you are told that: "No, we must improve the road system – we must not improve the rail system". The rail system has a tremendous future. It is wrong, it is totally unacceptable that it is allowed in any way to be run down.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission wishes to begin by thanking you for this interesting debate and thanking Parliament for the fact that you attach such great importance to the question of the interoperability of the conventional rail transport systems. I want to highlight the excellent contribution which has been made by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, especially by MEP Mr Savary who has prepared the report. </p>
<p class="contents">The directive must be seen, in the first place, as a technical measure, but the proposal is, of course, also of political significance in so far as it helps implement a common and open market for railway services and railway materials. As is well known, the Commission has made the railways sector into one of its priority areas for taking action. This was especially made clear in the 1996 white paper on the revitalisation of the Community’s railways. </p>
<p class="contents">As early as the end of last year, the EU took a large step towards revitalising railway transport when it introduced the so-called railway package. I am convinced that this can contribute to a renaissance for goods transport in the Community. Above and beyond these measures, further efforts are required if the strategy is to be complete. By this, I mean primarily measures which integrate the national networks and increase the quality of the public services. </p>
<p class="contents">We all know how different the various countries’ technical standards and operating regulations are. This has also emerged clearly in the course of the debate. This makes international transport both more expensive and more complicated than domestic transport. These differences affect not only interoperability but also the internal market for railway equipment. </p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has adopted an amendment to the report and, in that way, backed our own proposal. Most of the amendments to the report are acceptable. A series of amendments entail actual added value, something for which we wish to thank Parliament. As you know, the Council too has examined the proposal and, thanks to contacts between Parliament’s rapporteur, the Presidency of the Council and the Commission’s officials, it is entirely possible that the proposal may be adopted as early as at first reading. A prerequisite for its becoming a reality is the desire to pursue a genuine convergence policy even where an essentially technical document is concerned. </p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the amendments, I only wish therefore to deal with those which are unacceptable. First of all, Amendment 9, Article 1(3). The area of applicability is established in Annex I and cannot be limited in the way proposed. Those cases which are mentioned may be dealt with as special categories, as special cases or, at worst, as exceptions. </p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 28, Article 22(3). The proposed change is incompatible with the idea that the technical qualifications for interoperability are to be introduced gradually. Nor does it fall in with the need to prioritise those measures which provide the greatest benefits in terms of cost. </p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 29, Article 24(1). Where this is concerned, there are legal obstacles to acceptance. </p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 32, Annex I, together with Amendment 35 on exempting passenger carriages from third countries. The proposed wording is unacceptable because it means a fundamental change to the rolling stock referred to in the directive. The principle which the Commission upheld before the Council and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and upon which the proposal is based is that the directive must embrace all rolling stock used on the trans-European railway network. This is important for the purpose of promoting the internal market for rolling stock and also for the purpose of guaranteeing a minimum level of safety the length of the trans-European railway network. In order to achieve this minimum level of safety, all rolling stock must fulfil certain minimum specifications. </p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 39, Article 18(3) and Amendment 40, Annex VII. The proposed measures are incompatible with Article 14(2) which specifies that it is the Member States’ responsibility to make sure that the system complies with the STI, or <span class="italic">spécification technique interopérationnelle</span>, regulations. This proposal could be introduced into the framework directive concerning railway safety which the Commission will be introducing later this year. Clearly, however, exceptional instances of transportation or, for example, locomotives involved in track maintenance do not need to fulfil the same requirements as passenger trains. The proposal therefore mentions a number of special cases (cf. Article 2 K and Article 5(5)) where special, suitably adjusted regulations may be applied. </p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to leave the other amendments, because they all have our support. They help make the directive clearer, especially the special cases. Otherwise, they involve acceptable supplementary provisions, for example certain cases exempted from the technical specifications. </p>
<p class="contents">I would conclude my intervention concerning the interoperability of the conventional rail systems by thanking Parliament for its efforts. We must hope that it will be possible to adopt the directive as early as at first reading. The directive will take on a key role when it comes to revitalising railway transport. </p>
<p class="contents">I now move on to the second report, which concerns the interoperability of high-speed trains. In this case, too, Mr Savary has prepared an interesting report containing a number of constructive observations and proposals. The Commission will examine them in detail and, as far as possible, take account of them in planning its activities. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s report was more concerned with the implementation and effects of Directive 96/48 than with the actual progress made towards the interoperability of high-speed trains. This has to do with the fact that the railway network in question is still at an early stage of development. Parliament’s proposal for carrying out an assessment of how much progress really has been made on interoperability is therefore very interesting. </p>
<p class="contents">Where the conventional railway network is concerned, the Commission proposed that a common representative body should provide, and regularly update, a facility to help monitor progress. At the request of a Member State or of the Commission, this would provide a picture of the trans-European rail system for conventional trains. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has examined all the proposals in the report on the interoperability of high-speed trains, and they constitute a welcome contribution to the Commission’s ongoing deliberations in this area which continues, of course, to be given high priority. </p>
<p class="contents">It is generally known that the railway sector is of crucial importance in terms of Europe’s future transport needs and a more sustainable European transport system. Increased interoperability is a key factor in our endeavours in this area. It is very pleasing to have it confirmed through today’s discussion that the European Parliament and the Commission see the issue in much the same way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
