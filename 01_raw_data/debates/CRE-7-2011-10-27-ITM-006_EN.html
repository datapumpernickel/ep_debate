<p class="contents">All the Union’s institutions and governments have been expending significant political capital on dealing with the debt crisis. From a series of national debt crises, the situation was evolving into a systemic concern, threatening the stability of the eurozone as whole, and this threat had to be contained. This is what we have done.</p>
<p class="contents">Last night was a crucial political step which still requires, as after any such meeting, technical and legal follow-up. Sometimes I hear complaints that markets do not give democracies the time we need to get things approved. There is some truth in this. But I am deeply convinced the markets will give us the time we need when they see a clear direction and a clear determination.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore took – yesterday and on Sunday – important decisions on the five fronts where action is needed. The first front: a sustainable solution for the Greek debt. We want to put Greece on track so that, by 2020, it will have reduced its public debt to 120% of GDP. Since July, market conditions have worsened. The new programme includes an extra effort by the official sector. A new EU IMF programme of up to 100 billion will be put in place by the end of the year. It also includes a voluntary contribution by private creditors who had lent to Greece. It was agreed by them last night and amounts to a nominal discount of 50% of the Greek national debt.</p>
<p class="contents">The second front: a sufficient firewall against contagion, thanks to an agreement to multiply up to five-fold the firepower of the European Financial Stability Facility rescue fund. The leverage could be around one trillion euros, under certain assumptions about market conditions, the set-up and investors’ responsiveness in view of economic policies.</p>
<p class="contents">We have identified two approaches for the EFSF. The first one aims at giving credit enhancement to sovereign bonds issued by Member States. Under the second approach, the Fund could set up one or several special purpose vehicles to finance its operations. Each option could lead to leverage of up to four or five times. They can be used simultaneously, so as to increase the robustness of the financing strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The third front: we foster confidence in the European banking sector. We approved a coordinated scheme to recapitalise banks across Europe. The ratio of highest quality capital will be increased to 9%. This will enable the banks to withstand shocks, which is important in the current exceptional circumstances. State guarantees to improve the longer-term funding will safeguard the flow of credit to the real economy. This is essential for the prospects for growth.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth front: further fiscal consolidation by those Member States which need more sustainable public finances and more structural reforms. In this context, the Euro Summit welcomes the clear commitment of Italy to achieve these objectives and to abide by the timetable it set itself. This ambitious package – in particular the measures to increase competiveness and to liberalise the economy – now needs implementation. We also commend Italy’s commitment to achieve a balanced budget by 2013, and we take note of the plan to increase the retirement age to 67 years by 2026. The way to achieve this should be defined by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is a raft of measures taken at Union level to stimulate growth, about which I will say more later.</p>
<p class="contents">I have worked hard with all the European Council members – and in particular the President of the European Commission – to achieve this result. Together, the five elements constitute a comprehensive package and are all interrelated. For instance, the banking problems and the sovereign debt tensions were feeding each other; and we should consider the fact that achieving growth is the best way to reduce public debt. Everything is in everything and vice versa.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me take one step back. I should like to underline that the decisions taken by the four summit meetings since Sunday are part of a process which has lasted for more than a year. All along we had a double duty: dealing with the current crisis and preventing a new one from arising; taking emergency actions, like setting up rescue funds, while also putting together, step-by-step, a new economic governance to help avoid future problems.</p>
<p class="contents">You too have participated in that process, for instance through the legislation on the supervision of the financial sector and, more recently, the ‘six pack’ on economic governance. Your debates and the work of your committees have also furnished many of the ideas that have shaped this process and, in some cases, decisively improved the outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Why the acceleration over these past months? Before the summer, monetary union was also in a difficult situation. That is why I convened a Euro Summit on 21 July, which decided on a significant package to reduce the debt burden for Greece and to stop the risk of contagion, thanks to more flexible use of the EFSF rescue fund. The immediate political reaction to the July package was positive. However, during the summer, some doubts crept in about the package’s implementation. Although these proved unfounded in the end – all 17 parliaments duly approved it within three months – the harm was done. Market volatility began to grow, and this during the very days when brinkmanship in the US Congress about their potential default was adding to the flames. Market speculation can sometimes become a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p class="contents">On top of this, we have had to work since July in a different economic climate. Global economic growth is slowing dramatically, not only in Europe but also in the United States and some emerging countries. It became necessary to take further measures, both for Greece and to stop contagion, as well as to address weaknesses in the banking system.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to underline that stimulating growth is an essential part of the package. Sunday’s European Council discussed this extensively and adopted measures to stimulate growth and create jobs. Beyond the immediate crisis, we have all along kept sight of the broader picture. In the end only sustained economic growth can bring back confidence, create jobs and absorb deficits.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me come to some remarks of a general and institutional nature regarding all the economic measures. First of all, the European Union is putting in place a multi-faceted reform of economic governance. People who only focus on one or other aspect, and rush to denounce them as insufficient, miss the overall picture and the interactions between the various elements. It is the overall combination of institutional pressure, peer pressure and market pressure that will help us to avoid getting into such difficulties again.</p>
<p class="contents">All three forms of pressure have been enhanced: institutional pressure above all, thanks to the financial sector supervision and the six-pack legislation strengthening fiscal and macro-economic surveillance. I am very happy about this achievement and your improvements to it. We took a further step last night in agreeing that, for euro area Member States in an excessive deficit procedure, the Commission and the Council will be able to examine national budgets and adopt an opinion on them before their adoption by the relevant national parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Peer pressure has also become more effective, not just because of the new instruments, such as the European Semester, but also as a result of events. Today, no government can afford to underestimate the possible impact of public debts or bubbles in another eurozone country on its own economy; they would be punished by the voters. If one compares this situation with that of ten years ago, the pressure which leaders put on each other has become much more intense, as we have seen in recent days.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, market pressure has also increased. Markets will never again treat all sovereign debt in the eurozone as equal. They were asleep in the euro’s first decade and, even if they are currently overreacting, the markets will not go back to sleep again.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me stress that these three types of pressure to induce responsible behaviour reinforce each other. In fact, there is already a powerful interplay at work. To be even more explicit (knowing some of your fears), political pressure within the European Council or the Council does not undo the institutional or market pressure; no, it strengthens their impact. The President of the Commission and I both have this experience. We all work in the same direction: sound budgets, lower debts, sustainable growth. That is the result the citizens expect.</p>
<p class="contents">My second institutional remark concerns the eurozone summits. Some have expressed the fear that these will lead to divisions between Member States. My reasoning is simple. It is perfectly natural that those who share a common currency take some decisions together. In fact, one of the origins of the current crisis is that almost everybody had underestimated the extent to which the economies of the eurozone are linked, and we are now remedying that. Moreover, monetary policy is at the heart of economic policy, and the 17 have a common monetary policy. Yet we need a policy mix. Monetary policy alone is not enough to deal with the situation. We cannot have a common currency and a common monetary policy and leave everything else to the states involved. That is why the 17 will have to go further.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me be clear: the eurozone is not a derogation from the European Union, it is part of it. The Treaty is quite clear: it is the Member States which have not joined the euro which are referred to as ‘Member States with a derogation’. And, of course, most of them will in due course join the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is vitally important to safeguard the integrity of the single market among the 27. It gives the Union cohesion and is the very basis of our prosperity. So we must keep the two configurations as close as possible, in a spirit of trust.</p>
<p class="contents">I will personally do my utmost to avoid divisions between the 17 and the 27. Not only is it my intention to organise Euro Summits, if possible, immediately following a European Council meeting, but it is also the case that the Commission and Parliament will continue to play their roles.</p>
<p class="contents">A third and final institutional remark: the Euro Summit decided to reflect on a further strengthening of economic convergence within the euro area and on improving fiscal discipline and deepening economic union, including exploring the possibility, should this prove necessary, of limited treaty changes. The full European Council will revert to this issue in December on the basis of a report by myself, in close collaboration with Presidents Barroso and Juncker. Of course, any proposal for a treaty revision would also be a matter for your Parliament to consider, as indeed are other possible measures.</p>
<p class="contents">My intention is that we discuss first the ‘what’ before we discuss the ‘how’. First we should examine the goals and only afterwards the legal instruments required to get there. Treaty changes are difficult. Improvements are possible, and it can be useful to give the public and the markets a sense of our medium-term direction. But a treaty change is not the right way to deal with an immediate financial crisis. So we have to get the different time perspectives right.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to my concluding remark, on our use of time. The European Union is often charged with coming up with too little too late. The markets have the luxury of moving at the speed of a click of a mouse. Political processes, even if they are working at their most rapid, cannot deliver so speedily. Approval of the July package by the 17 national parliaments in two-and-a-half months is impressive by political standards, even if it is slow by market standards.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Parliament yourself, having been in a position to use several months to bring the six-pack negotiations to a favourable conclusion, you will appreciate the importance of sound parliamentary scrutiny and negotiation. Moreover, at some point the request to always be faster is just not credible. In politics one needs time to bring everybody on board and tie diverse interests together in a solid package. Time is the politician’s cement.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet it is crucial that we put in place rules and procedures that will anticipate problems in the future and prevent them from arising. And it is also crucial that we develop emergency procedures enabling a more speedy and flexible reaction. Improving Europe’s capacity to act is the best sign of mutual trust we can give to the public, the markets and ourselves.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Manuel Barroso</span></span>  , <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. − Mr President, President of the European Council, honourable Members, following a long but constructive meeting that was concluded just a few hours ago, I am pleased to stand before you this morning and confirm that, today, Europe is closer to resolving its economic and financial crisis and getting back on the path to growth. The Euro Summit took solid and substantial steps that should enable Europe to turn a corner.</p>
<p class="contents">Ahead of this European Council, the Commission demanded a comprehensive approach. We insisted that the different aspects of the crisis should be tackled together and not in a piecemeal, purely reactive fashion. We set this out in the Roadmap to Stability and Growth which I presented to you on 12 October and also sent to Heads of State and Government at the same time. This Roadmap was very largely supported by this Parliament, for which I thank you; I am pleased to inform you that its five elements have been comprehensively addressed at this European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that agreements are not an end point. They mean the beginning of a long path of hard work. But today we have a more ambitious platform on which to build Europe’s future growth. Let me take the five elements – briefly – one by one.</p>
<p class="contents">First, on Greece, the solution found this morning includes a credible and appropriate degree of private-sector involvement. This will ease market pressure on Greece and allow the country to continue its programmes of reforms. We are determined to conclude work on a second financial assistance programme by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the agreement on the leveraging of the EFSF means that we have also maximised the potential of our backstops. The mix of providing credit enhancement and maximised funding arrangements will increase the EFSF’s leverage effect up to four or five times. The European Commission had concretely proposed, since January of this year, that the EFSF should be reinforced and provided with more firepower. Increasing the credibility of our firewalls is the single most crucial element of our crisis resolution efforts: the element that underpins the credibility of all our other actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, on banks: the decisions taken yesterday by Member States will pave the way for a restoration of confidence in the European banking sector. We are working to design an approach for medium- and long-term funding of banks, while also requiring banks to hold a significantly higher capital ratio after taking account of sovereign debt exposures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to work hand-in-hand with the European Banking Authority, the ECB and the EIB to implement these measures through a fully coordinated approach at European Union level.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that Italy has given strong commitments to undertake further structural reforms. This is confirmed not only in a letter that the President of the Council of Ministers of Italy sent to President van Rompuy and myself, but also in the very clear conclusions endorsed by all the Heads of State and Government of the euro area. It is now imperative that Italy implement these commitments fully, and according to a clear and coherent timetable. The Commission was specifically entrusted with the responsibility of monitoring these efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">This is where we stand on the most urgent issues. The Summit decisions give us a solid platform from which to continue our work. I am also particularly pleased that the Summit conclusions highlighted the role of the Community method and of the Commission in economic governance. In effect, Heads of State and Government have pledged to build on the measures of the ‘six pack’ and the European Semester by strengthening the Commission’s role in assessing, monitoring and coordinating national economic policies and budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">But we will now go beyond the legislation recently adopted by this Parliament. The Commission is committed to a true economic Union through increased convergence. Today I can announce to you that, next month, we will present a comprehensive package on further deepening European Union and euro area economic governance. This will include: a codecision regulation linking surveillance with EFSF and ESM assistance on the basis of Article 136 of the Treaty; a further codecision regulation on deeper fiscal surveillance, also based on Article 136 of the Treaty – which means it is up to the European Parliament to decide, with the Council, on the basis of our proposals; a communication on the external representation of the euro on the basis of Article 138 of the Treaty, and a Green Paper on euro stability bonds, as announced in my State of the Union speech. We will also anticipate, in this package, the Annual Growth Survey, to give even more coherence and focus to the preparation of next year’s economic policies.</p>
<p class="contents">This package will give direction to the moves towards integration and convergence. It will give energy to our joint efforts – the efforts of all the institutions – and it will do so while upholding the principle of prioritising the Community method. In this context, the independent and objective authority of the Commission is even more important – a view often expressed by this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I can announce to you that I intend to entrust Olli Rehn with a reinforced status and additional working instruments. He is to become Commission Vice-President for economic and monetary affairs and the euro. This is the best way to guarantee independence, objectivity and efficiency in the exercise of the Commission’s responsibility of coordination, surveillance and enforcement in the area of the economic governance of the Union and of the euro area in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is also important and relevant, not only from a substantive but also from a symbolic point of view – and symbols are important – that by having a Commissioner especially dedicated to the euro we assert that we want euro governance to take place within the Community method, and with the Community institutions.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">At the same time I believe that it is also important to ensure the credibility –and further reinforce the independence and objectivity – of all our technical work, not only in terms of economic preparations, but also in terms of the independent collection of statistical data. I will therefore entrust responsibility for Eurostat to the Commissioner responsible for audit, Algirdas Šemeta. These decisions will be transmitted to this House before the November plenary session, and both Olli Rehn and Algirdas Šemeta are ready to appear before the relevant parliamentary committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Financial stability, economic governance: all this is of paramount importance, but we should never forget that our goal is to promote inclusive and sustainable growth and employment. On Sunday the European Council devoted a great part of its work to this, and I am pleased to have presented my vision – the vision of the European Commission – to all the Heads of State and Government. I am happy to say that most of these proposals are now reflected in the conclusions of the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is now working on the proposals I presented in my State of the Union address and in my announcement to this House of the Commission’s Roadmap to Stability and Growth. They include: getting agreement on the Single Market Act by the end of 2012; fully implementing the Services Directive, and rapidly adopting our proposals to temporarily increase co-financing rates in countries under adjustment programmes. I am happy that the Council has now reached this agreement, which is so important for the more vulnerable countries. I take this opportunity to urge the Council, once again, to reach agreement on the programme for food aid for the most deprived persons.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I think it is unacceptable that a time of social crisis, such as we have now in so many areas of Europe, is precisely the moment when, because of lack of decision on this matter, we put some of the most vulnerable people in our societies at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, the Commission has also pledged to fast-track a number of proposals. For instance, on 30 November we will put forward a proposal on facilitating access to venture capital as part of the Single Market Act. On 13 December we will propose the modernisation of the recognition of professional qualifications. Before the end of this year the Commission will propose a Youth Opportunities Initiative to boost youth employment, also building on the resources of the European Social Fund (ESF). So fast-tracking these measures – we are, for instance, very committed to speeding up everything regarding our digital agenda – is not just about recovering the growth we have lost over the last three years. It is about giving millions of Europeans hope in their future. It is about restoring their trust and confidence in our social market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Working in close cooperation with the President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, and the President of the Eurogroup, Jean-Claude Juncker, I will contribute to a report that will also include some options for Treaty change. I will consult widely with this House on the issue. I will meet the Committee on Foreign Affairs and take part in other debates, as discussed earlier this morning by your Conference of Presidents. The European Parliament has to be fully involved in such major changes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has argued for many months that, to complete our monetary union with an economic union, we need stronger governance in the euro area. We need more integration, more discipline, more convergence. I have always stated that any possible Treaty change should not be seen as the immediate solution to the current crisis. But it is true that, by working to embed stricter discipline and stronger governance into the euro area in particular, we may help to prevent a future crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">While deeper integration of the euro area is essential, it must be done in a way that keeps the entire European Union strong. We do not want artificial divisions between the Member States of the euro area and all the other Member States of the European Union. The euro should remain open to all Member States who may join in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The reinforcement of the governance of the euro area must be done in a way that ensures the integrity of the Single Market and the whole Community acquis. This coherence and compatibility can only be achieved through the Community institutions, because they are the ones mandated to act in the interests of all our Member States and our citizens in a rule-based – indeed Treaty-based – way.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly pleased that the role of the Commission in ensuring coherence between the euro area and the 27 Member States was clearly recognised in the European Council conclusions, particularly as regards the need to maintain a level playing field in the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">The bold decisions taken over the last days, and indeed over the last weeks and months, allow us to take a message to our partners at the G20 summit in Cannes of a Europe that is determined, that is responsible, that is united. Europe will push, at the G20, for an ambitious action plan that can address the challenges and imbalances that are still hindering growth at the global level. Europe strives to lead the global crisis response at the G20 but, of course, we will not have the credibility to lead if we can not show – as we have shown – that we are able to move towards a real solution for our own problems.</p>
<p class="contents">By the end of this year, the Commission will have presented all its proposals on overhauling the banking system, in line with our G20 commitments. That means over 30 pieces of legislation, all of which aim to make the sector more responsible and to restore its position as a service to the real economy. I know how much this Parliament is committed to this agenda, and I thank you for your constant support.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is also the first constituency in the G20 to have proposed a financial transaction tax, which we shall present at the G20 summit in Cannes. I believe that the protest movements we have witnessed in recent weeks, from Madrid to Manhattan, show that this is the kind of action people expect from their leaders to ensure that the financial sector contributes to society.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This type of response is of course most effective on a global scale, where it can be used to address global challenges such as the fight against poverty. This is a message I will push strongly for in Cannes.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I would like to say that today the European Union is showing that we can unite in the most challenging of times. We will demonstrate our unity, our solidarity and our determination for a European renewal. It is clear that growth and prosperity will not be restored in a day. As I said in this Parliament in my State of the Union address, this is a marathon, not a sprint. But today we are witnessing a level of determination that should give hope and confidence to us all.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to make proposals for a Community way out of this crisis. I know I can count on your continued support and I thank you for the support you have already shown.</p>

I see the glass as half full. I would like to thank you for the work you have done over the last 48 hours, because as a farmer, I know that it is not always the right horse that gets the oats, and this morning I would like to give you the oats and tell you ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter and applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If he does not like oats, he can give them to the Commissioners; no problem there, a few of them like them.</p>
<p class="contents">The elements that I picked up straightaway from your speech, and which I want to reiterate here, are that we are dealing with the banks, we are not doing enough to challenge the rich, you understand what I mean by that, but above all, and I thank you for saying it, we need to take care of the poorest. It would be outrageous if we failed to find a solution concerning the Food Distribution Programme for the Most Deprived Persons before the winter months.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Some people thought that everything would be sorted out by Monday. I do not think anyone here in this House believed that, since we are responsible men and women. However, we were still apprehensive, and late last night I watched the news to see whether we would effectively have an even deeper crisis this morning or, as I have often said, whether we would start to see the end of the crisis take shape. I believe this Council has at least come up with an initial solution to the crisis, and I congratulate both of you – I know that it is not easy. Undoubtedly it does not go far enough, but I will come back to this.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to highlight the progress made by the 17 countries in the euro area. Over recent weeks, we have seen the 17 countries in the euro area being criticised by those who are not part of it. I would like to point out, in this Parliament, that we are all Europeans, whether we are inside or outside the euro area. Nevertheless, we have duties and rights, and those who took centre stage the most were the 17. Here too I believe we have made progress.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to solidarity with Greece, following the release by the Troika of a new tranche of loans, the agreement announced last night with the banks sees 50% of the debt being written off. This is an achievement. The increase of the European Financial Stability Facility’s firepower is a step in the right direction and, as everyone knows, one of the trickiest aspects of the negotiation. The agreement of the 17 on this point is absolutely crucial. By ensuring that this Fund acts as a credit insurance for investors who buy loan certificates from countries deemed vulnerable, the resources of the Stability Fund will be increased. The third area in which progress has been made is bank recapitalisation. I believe that we have already referred to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the European Council and the euro area have kept their promises for the short term and for part – a small part, I would stress – of the medium term. My group encourages you to progress even more quickly, and you are not on holiday as far as I understand. Tomorrow morning further progress will have to be made.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important thing is to adopt a new model of economic governance, without which the euro cannot work effectively in the long run. We say the same things every day here, but we can see that by dint of repeating ourselves, some things are starting to be done. This integration and this European policy are an absolute necessity. I note that the countries which are the first to ask the euro area to take strong action have, for years and even decades, vigorously rejected any proposal for fiscal harmonisation. They are quite simply being inconsistent.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the European project is not about imposing something on someone. The European project is not about placing anyone under supervision, nor about governing with no regard for the democratic balance of powers. However, the rules must be complied with, Mr Barroso, and we must ensure that the measures that have been accepted and signed on paper are truly applied in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The European project and the strategy for Europe are about an ambition: that of offering the 500 million inhabitants the chance to live with dignity. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) does not want us to depend in future on Chinese and Brazilian investment, but to draw on our own work and our own know-how. What the PPE Group wants is to map out the route that will lead to that outcome, and that requires a shared European sovereignty between all those who want it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Van Rompuy, yesterday you made good decisions, difficult and brave decisions. Nonetheless, these measures are not the end result of a plan to exit the crisis, they are merely the beginning. I call on the Member States, I call on Members of Parliament, both national and European, and I also call on our fellow citizens to agree to further political integration.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on this Parliament and, Mr Barroso, on the European Commission, to carry on defending the EU model, which is a model of inclusion and not exclusion. I hope that next week, the G20 will respect the decisions that Europe has taken. For that to happen, though, they must be sure that we will not stop halfway. We need more fiscal and social integration, even if it is not written in the Treaty. We need to move forward in that area. We cannot afford to wait 10 years, to wait until we have amended the Treaty. We must adopt rules of procedure if the Treaty cannot be implemented quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we are in the process of proving that in the difficult moments of managing a crisis, we can make progress without respecting the Treaty to the letter. And that was a little painful for us in the European Parliament. We felt to some extent that we had been forgotten. However I do think, Mr Barroso, and you said so this morning, that you are applying what we voted for here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The realities are three decisions that are not final decisions, but that still await implementation. This summit is evidence of progress, however we still await the solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">It was decided to recapitalise banks by June 2012, so as to stabilise them when the haircut is imposed. There is to be a 50% haircut, however the banks still have to agree. So, we still do not have a solution. With regard to the leveraging of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) – two options are under discussion, the modalities of which are to be drawn up by the Euro Group by November, according to paragraph 19 of the conclusions. These are the three key decisions produced at the end of this night. These are three significant areas of progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The President-in-Office of the Council now tells us that a process that has taken over a year has finally reached a conclusion. Yes, that is true. If you, Mr Van Rompuy, and the 17 Heads of Government of the euro monetary union had not taken the measures you did a year ago, then we would not be where we are today. That is the problem with Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The social imbalance we have in Europe lives on. I read here in paragraph 5 of the conclusions: It is of fundamental importance that the budgetary adjustments should be implemented as planned without compromise. Fine I would have liked to see a statement included indicating that tax evasion in Europe would be pursued without compromise and, likewise, that financial transaction taxes would be introduced.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We will not succeed in building Europe on the foundations of social inequality. Because this summit is an interim step, I would urge the following: the same Heads of State or Government who, under the pressure of the actual circumstances, have now once again approved many billions – hundreds of billions in fact – in an effort to stabilise the banks, nearly lose their reason when we in the Committee on Budgets demand a small increase in the Social Fund or Globalisation Adjustment Fund. These are signals that make people in Europe extremely insecure.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, you have talked about cooperation with Parliament. You referred to the Community method. I was able to observe the President-in-Office of the Council while you spoke: your remarks elicited a slight smile from him. I believe that this also reflects the attitude within the Council. Article 3 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states: ‘The Union shall establish an economic and monetary union whose currency is the euro.’ Two countries have an opt-out: Denmark and the United Kingdom. All other Member States committed themselves to the introduction of the euro. What is the point of establishing a club of 17 countries, while the rest, all of whom are subject to the rules of the 17, have no say when it comes to decision-making? This makes no sense. That is why I understand the position of the Christian Democratic Union in Germany when their paper says: merge the positions held by Mr Barroso and Mr Van Rompuy and the problem will be solved.</p>
<p class="contents">We have an institutional crisis on our hands. You have made three remarks on the institutions, Mr Van Rompuy. The first is this: cooperation is needed between the Commission and the Head of the Euro Group – in other words you, yourself – in order to intervene in the budgetary sovereignty of the national parliaments in cases of excessive deficits, as with Italy, for example. Your second remark regarding the institutions was that the 17 need to go further than the rest, but that you would do your best to prevent a two-tier system. Your third remark regarding the institutions related to Treaty change. All three ideas, two of which we have now heard from you in concrete terms, as well as the proposal to change the Treaty, contain or provide for enormous executive rights that put an end to national sovereignty rights. There is one institution, however, that receives no mention in your proposals: the European Parliament, the platform for European Democracy. I would say to you, not just on behalf of my own group, but, I believe, on behalf of most Members of this House, that whatever your executive intentions in Europe in relation to the Treaty, you need the European Parliament! Because this is an interim summit, you should take the President of the European Parliament seriously by including him in your deliberations. There can be no Treaty change without this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I am not looking for a fight with the institutions. We need the institutions to complement one another. The institutions in Europe need to work together. Parliament with the Council, the Council with the Commission and the Commission with Parliament. If this is the case, however, then I would ask you why is it that the term ‘European Parliament’ does not appear once in the conclusions of the European Council? We are ready to work with you. I hope you are ready to work with us. If this is not the case, you will have to learn that the European Parliament will make extensive use of its rights on the basis of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>

I am relieved this morning, because it might be a totally different debate here in Parliament without the decisions that were taken at 4 o’clock this morning. I am relieved for one simple reason: finally we are starting to put in place a global approach to stabilise the euro, and I am relieved because finally – and it has to be repeated – we are now abandoning our hesitant approach of the last 20 months. Let us also be very blunt about that: this crisis, and the reason for this mess, has been prolonged and worsened by the way this has been handled from the beginning, with contradictions, hesitations and half measures. We have done our job, with the pressure we have put on the Council and on the Commission to ensure that this way of handling this crisis finally comes to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">But we also have to be realistic about it. A few good days on the markets do not mean that we have already reached our goal and that the euro is still stable, and again stable, and again strengthened. Our goal is to strengthen and stabilise the euro in the mid term and the long term, not for one day or one week, and two things are crucial in achieving this in the coming days and weeks. The first is that the new firepower of the rescue fund has to be real firepower in the sense that the markets are convinced by it.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be honest: one trillion – that is what it is in English, not one thousand million – is an impressive figure. It is big, but there are doubts about whether that firepower can be achieved in the long term if you offer, for example, a guarantee of 20% when, on the other hand, we agree on a haircut for Greece of 50%. How credible, then, is this firepower? Perhaps Mr Van Rompuy can confirm that no figure was mentioned in the Council conclusions; it is stated in the Council conclusions that there is a guarantee or a possibility that it is one of the options, but I have not seen a figure, a concrete percentage showing what this guarantee might be. It is this guarantee – the percentage of this guarantee – that makes the system credible and sustainable and ensures that the firepower is sizeable and can be used on the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">My second, equally important point is that we have to use the coming weeks and months to lay the foundations for a real economic and fiscal union for the eurozone. Let us be very clear: it is not over. Markets are waiting to see that we, by the end of the year, are establishing a real economic and fiscal union besides and in parallel with monetary union. That means in fact that we have to do two things. First of all I urge you, Mr Barroso, to come forward as fast as possible – before the end of the year, as you have announced – and put on the table the Green Paper on euro securities, the so-called stability bonds. Because in the end it is only a Eurobond market that can end the tensions within the market and avoid a repetition of last year’s mess.</p>
<p class="contents">The second and most important thing is that we now need to establish real economic government in the eurozone. Again, I have nothing against the idea, which we can also see in the conclusions of the Council, that you will share two Euro Summits every year, maybe more if required and necessary; this already happens. But that is not the economic governance we need. An economic government is more than two meetings a year. I was Prime Minister for nine years and we met twice a week and, if necessary, twice a day, but not twice a year.</p>
<p class="contents">So we need something else, which I think is in the conclusions. What we need is to use Article 28 of the conclusions of yesterday. I am very pleased that Olli Rehn has been appointed Vice-President of the Commission in charge of the euro. What we need now, Mr Barroso, is for him to be able to create an inner cabinet in the Commission where he chairs all the portfolios of the Commissioners related to the euro, so that you make it sustainable and markets see that there is a government, an inner cabinet, in the Commission dealing with these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I will repeat my proposal. We also have to ensure that this Commissioner Vice-President chairs the meetings of the Ministers of Finance of the euro, the Euro Group. Let us make the system consistent and not have two personalities again who chair and are responsible for that. My request is that you come forward now, Mr Barroso, with a legislative proposal, as fast as possible, in order to provide a solution to that problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is huge criticism, let us be honest. I had the opportunity this morning to hear yesterday’s debate in the House of Commons in London, Britain, where Mr Cameron said ‘hah, they have problems there but it is OK, we are not there, there is no problem for us’, and he was criticising Ed Miliband yesterday in the House of Commons. But let us be honest: he is pleased to be outside but he wants to be inside to influence all these decisions, and he is criticising it. I think there is a good way for Great Britain to be involved in euro politics, and that is to enter the eurozone and be part of the system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One good thing is the call for a balanced budget – the so-called balanced budget rule. Everybody wants to have a balanced budget. That is true. I just wonder how it will be received by those political forces and those politicians who have been used, for a very long time, to bribing their voters with public overspending. Will they stick with that rule or not? That is another question.</p>
<p class="contents">The main bad thing in the whole package is that it is actually only a buying of time, a temporary solution. What has happened? The vast amount of both private and public funds will be poured into the debt bailouts. Other debts will simply be written off and a bond union will be created.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that we are at the very beginning of a massive fiscal transfer, and one never before seen in European history. This is an unprecedented case and I am afraid that it will create an enormous burden for the EU economy and that it will result in very high long-term costs. I am afraid that loss of economic growth and loss of international competitiveness is unfortunately what is to be expected. Even worse, this might have a side effect on other, very viable, strategies, such as completion of a single market. I was very pleased to see Sunday’s Council giving a renewed commitment to completion of a single market. We must not just drop the single market while we attempt to save the single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">I represent a group with the most non-eurozone members and as a eurozone outsider, as an observer, my feeling is that the eurozone at the moment does not serve all its 17 members, but just a few. I have the feeling that the only answer to the current problems will be the reduction of the eurozone, and sooner or later this will have to be done, like it or not. That is the only reasonable way out of this mess.</p>
<p class="contents">On non-eurozone countries, I have one more remark to make – last but not least. We should allow non-eurozone members, such as my country, to decide again if they even wish to enter. We signed up in our accession treaty to a monetary union, and not to a transfer union or a bond union. That is the main reason why, for instance, the Czech Prime Minister wishes to call a referendum on this matter, which has my full support.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, where are we now? We have found a very costly and only temporary solution. Another Treaty change is even being considered. Let me say that this is completely out of touch and completely unrealistic. This will never be passed. Have you already forgotten the lessons of the Lisbon Treaty? I do not think so. I am sorry to say this, but there is no real reason for optimism. Merely rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic is not enough. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rebecca Harms, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I share the same feeling of relief described by Mr Verhofstadt, although I must say that it almost comes as a relief when anything at all is agreed on following the now familiar crisis summits. Before you offer us your explanation of how the Euro Area Summit will assume responsibility for economic governance in the future, I must point out that I still see no evidence of an analysis of the failure on your side. Nor have I heard that the Heads of State or Government once told Greece that the programmes they had agreed over the course of the last year had actually driven Greece more deeply into crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">My sceptical analysis does not just apply to the developments we have seen in recent months. At this point I would like once again to explain my scepticism with regard to what was agreed yesterday and finalised last night. If things do not work out as well as outlined at present, then people should not simply shrug and say that no one could have foreseen such a turn of events. It is my belief – in relation to capitalisation – that you have not yet abandoned this pattern of deciding too little, that the haircut is not sufficient and that the processes are too slow.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to Greece, we heard last week from the Troika that the haircut should be around 60%. You really need to explain why a figure of 50% has been chosen. You also need to explain why you believe that creditors, who are finally to be asked to shoulder a greater share of the burden, will implement this 50% figure, given the fact that they have not yet implemented the 21% haircut voluntarily agreed in July. I am still at a loss to know from where this hope comes.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the recapitalisation that is needed for the banks. I believe we can all quickly agree that this is a process that does not deserve particular confidence. At the very least, the process will be too slow. I daresay that the Dexia problem will not prove to be a unique case and that other scenarios similar to Dexia’s will be encountered.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the EFSF lever that provided the focus for debate prior to the summit in Germany, I am astonished at the confidence of the Council of the Euro Group in expecting the markets to use the levers they agreed in a constructive way. I believe that it is a very slim hope that the markets will suddenly start to operate in a constructive manner. I also fail to understand why we now intend limiting the capital for the EFSF to 1 billion, even though we were actually certain that 2 billion would be needed.</p>
<p class="contents">What you have completely ignored so far is the fact that the economic figures of the European Union are negative overall. Even in Germany, economic growth is starting to slip. The prospects for a stimulus programme for sustained development in the European economy, particularly in the countries that are in deficit, have been very limited to date. This is once again demonstrated by the fact that you continue to emphasise the need for austerity, failing to mention the revenue side at all. Mr Schulz has said quite enough already about the major problem of tax evasion. This is something where you have still failed to take a genuinely consistent line.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I began with a vehement criticism of the ability of the summit led by you, Mr Van Rompuy, to function properly. It is also evident that, despite the glimpse into the profound abyss afforded us by the Troika and the markets in recent weeks, you are still failing to act with consistency, that more and more crisis meetings are required, and that not enough is being decided in the end. It is for this reason that I share the opinion of those who say that, in the light of the Euro Area Summit chaired by you, it is quite inconceivable that economic governance can work with meetings to be held at six-monthly intervals. In view of what we have experienced in the last year, I believe that this is almost like a threat. I believe that we are making more progress in the debate regarding the strengthening of powers, including those of Mr Rehn, something the Council has resisted so far. We cannot continue to play politics in this crisis with this non-transparent Euro Area Summit, undemocratic procedures, and a strategy of telling our citizens half-truths.</p>

But what has the summit actually achieved?</p>
<p class="contents">The Greek debt crisis has entered a new phase with the agreed haircut of 50%. This is something to be welcomed because it means that the country is freed from a significant part of its national debt. This is a positive outward signal and eases the situation for the Greek Government. This step does not mean a reversal in the downward spiral of the Greek economy, however. According to expert assessments, the country’s financial needs up to 2020 have already risen to EUR 250 billion. Likewise, this has not reduced the disastrous consequences for the people of Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the Greek banks need to survive the consequences of the haircut. They need extensive supports if they are to be rescued from ruin, otherwise it is not just the bond holders who will bear the cost, but also countless Greek citizens with their savings, pensions and other insurance cover. Much as I welcome the fact that the main culprits for the debt crisis are being called to greater account, this may be a risky move, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises and for many ordinary savers.</p>
<p class="contents">What assets will be levied by the banks? I believe that a socially just solution can more probably be achieved with nationalised banks, although a rescue or capitalisation of the banks should be made conditional on direct consultation or even more effective controls by the state. Banks in these countries should be recapitalised to the same extent as banks in France, Germany and other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The question remains whether the haircut will bring the much-vaunted lasting solution for Greece and the other endangered countries. Will this restore the trust of citizens and investors in the international financial markets? This is a question that I can only answer by quoting a famous phrase from Faust: ‘While I have heard the message– about the summit – I am not sure I believe it.’ When I think of the general strike and the further mobilisation of the public, I know that the Greek people have lost confidence massively. What is more, democracy itself is in huge danger, after all a government can only act against the opinion of the majority of the population for so long. This is a question that must also be answered by the IMF, ECB and the Council, in other words the so-called Troika, which has placed Greece under this austerity regime.</p>
<p class="contents">My doubts also relate to the financial trick of leveraging the rescue fund. Although this will mobilise more financial resources, the question is at what cost? Countries are playing according to the rules of the financial markets and believe themselves to be in a strong position. If you will permit me, this is an illusion. The state debt crisis may not just spread very rapidly, but may also require massively increased commitments. This increases the risk to the taxpayer several fold.</p>
<p class="contents">We must act decisively in bringing the power of the international financial community to heel, otherwise the crisis will spread. Everything is to play for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A credible and effective response is thus urgently needed. As far as we know at this stage, the main points of the agreement reached have been received fairly positively. Important details still have to be added, however.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, market confidence must be restored on the basis of the quality of governance in those Member States that are deeply in debt. Above all, investors must now decide whether this package is convincing. Secondly, the size of the Emergency Fund must be addressed. It is not as large as economists and central bankers would like. The question is, therefore, whether this aspect is future-proof. The third issue is the Greek privatisation programme. It is unclear on what the optimism concerning the extra EUR 15 billion in privatisations is based. The results obtained so far do not give sufficient grounds for such optimism.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the level of impact must be examined. One aspect that springs to mind is the value of write-offs by the private sector in respect of Greek state bonds, a crucial factor which the banking sector and the authorities must work on so that this is clear by the end of 2011. There is also great uncertainty concerning the recapitalisation of the banks. The European Banking Authority still has to work a few things out on the basis of new figures for cash requirements from September, and recent estimates in this area have varied widely.</p>
<p class="contents">A fifth crucial detail relates to economic governance. The question is whether there are adequate guarantees to prevent future problems. In the conclusions of the Council, I see no agreement on stronger enforcement of budgetary rules and a fundamental tackling of imbalances at the level of balances of trade and payments. Were rules aimed at resolving these issues more effectively also on the agenda? It goes without saying that I welcome the rapid introduction of the legislative package strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact and the strengthening of the powers of the Budget Commissioner, but the wording of this final aspect in paragraph 28 of the Council’s conclusions leaves me anything but confident. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must be clear on this. That is why I have five things to say in the short time allotted me:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, democracy needs time, Mr Van Rompuy. You are quite right about this. Democracy also needs clear decision-making structures and parliamentary control – and these are precisely what we lack.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the markets react quickly – more quickly than politics and democracy. As long as the markets are driven by anxiety and greed, rather than by clear rules, we will continue to simply push the problem further down the road, rather than solving it. That is why we need these clear rules, both within the European Union and worldwide. We need responsibility in the United Kingdom, the United States and other countries. This includes tax evasion, as well as the abolition of betting on every conceivable development, and the curbing of the excesses of the financial market.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the states themselves are responsible for the debt crisis. This excessive debt was not sanctioned in the last 10 years either by the markets or by the EU Commission, or the Stability and Growth Pact. We need institutional change here. Whatever those who are tempted to print more money may think, inflation is not the solution. This would hit the poorest and weakest and would not just result in expropriation. Inflation is an unsocial solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, cohesion policy has failed. The aim of the Structural and Cohesion Funds was to improve competitiveness. They actually had the opposite effect. We cannot go on like this.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly: we need to make major changes to the substance of the Treaties. I do not want to discuss the individual points. Mr Schulz has already mentioned one. It is not enough to give new powers to Mr Rehn, someone I respect very much. The Christian Democratic Union paper quoted calls for a right of initiative for Parliament and the Council because the Commission dragged its heels, making its decisions and presenting its proposals on the basis of external influences. If we achieve broad support there, then we will start to make progress.</p>

They start with the Council congratulating itself for having taken unprecedented steps to combat the effects of the financial crisis. The fact is that it has been forced to take unprecedented steps, but always too little and too late – forced to do so by nervous markets because of its uncertainty and hesitation. The conclusions go on to talk about our ‘ambitious agenda for growth’, but the truth is we simply do not have an agenda for growth and we certainly do not have one for job creation. We should have, with 23 million people unemployed, but incredibly these conclusions do not even mention unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite outrageous that the conclusions talk about improving the growth and employment outlook. Just a few weeks ago the Council, with the support of the Liberals and EPP here, was happy to agree an economic governance package without accepting any differentiated treatment of public investment spending. Now it is calling on Member States to focus public spending on growth areas, but there is no real public money available to spend on growth areas in the next few years, what with the collapse in growth rates and the demand that deficits be brought under 3% by 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">To make matters worse, the conclusions later say that building on the ‘six pack’, the European Semester and the Europe Plus Pact, euro area Member States will be required to adopt the fiscal rules translating the Stability and Growth Pact deficit and debt rules into national legislation, preferably at a constitutional level by the end of 2012. This is fundamentally anti-democratic; it is a barefaced attempt by the currently dominant Right to permanently embed their austerity agenda into national constitutions; it is an attempted rightwing coup which tries to freeze out alternative ideological approaches to dealing with the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget balance concept is a political concept, and if it becomes embedded in national constitutions it will permanently enshrine a major chunk of rightwing ideology, moving it away from normal democratic processes. It would shift the essence of the Stability and Growth Pact away from political debate and profoundly affect the way that progressive politics can be conceived and pursued at both national and European level.</p>
<p class="contents">The other striking thing about these conclusions, mentioned by Martin Schulz, is the total lack of regard for this Parliament. This directly-elected institution should be directly involved in economic governance.</p>

We are all very keen for what you are proposing to succeed, and I would not wish to ask you to associate this Parliament with it for institutional reasons. I would like to draw your attention to the contribution that we might make to ensure the success of your own ambitions. Mr Van Rompuy, you said just now, quite rightly, that we are learning that economies are interdependent. Could you not also learn that democracies are interdependent? The peer pressure that we have to bring to bear on each other will not be tolerable if it is perceived by our peoples as coming as a result of a diktat from the Central Bank, the Commission or even the Council. Just look at what happened between the French and the Italians this week. Would it not be possible to make greater use of this Parliament as a place where some can exert pressure on others within a democratic forum, by letting, in the case of each country, the majority and the opposition enjoy the opportunity – and this is not the case in the Council – to give their opinion?</p>

Will we possibly see control of the region’s banking system handed over to the Middle East and Asia? Europe is not giving new money to the banks, and instead they are expected to find EUR 100 billion themselves and also write down EUR 20 billion of Greek debt.

Pensions in the Netherlands are falling, as is, once again, the purchasing power of the Dutch. The Dutch are fed up with it.</p>
<p class="contents">The euro is a failed project, and those responsible for it are the people sitting in this room. It is the old elite parties – the Christian Democrats, Social Democrats and the Liberals – who now have egg on their face. Messrs Verhofstadt, Schulz, Daul and your clapping machines in this room – you are all jointly responsible for the stupid choices you made concerning this impossible eurozone. You did it without asking the Europeans or the Dutch if they wanted it. No referendum was ever held. Yet ordinary citizens now have to foot the bill. The Dutch have already paid over EUR 10 000 per family towards this debt crisis, and that amount is going to rise dramatically if Mr Barroso has anything to do with it. The Greek and Italian debt mountain is being shared out between ‘Jan Modaal’, ‘Joe Average’ and ‘Otto Normalverbraucher’. Once again this is taking place without a referendum, and that is a scandal.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday it was decided that the banks must be recapitalised and, at the same time, write off Greek bonds. That is impossible, at least for the Greek banks. In everyday language, this means that the banks, which speculated with savings and paid top salaries, will now receive Dutch taxpayers’ money. Yes – Dutch and German taxpayers will have to pay to keep the Greek banks on their feet. That is the only outcome of this summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the Members in this Chamber think this is all well and good. Yes, the MEPs and leaders sitting in this Chamber have no problem paying, but it is not so easy for ‘Jan Modaal’, ‘Joe Average’ and ‘Otto Normalverbraucher’. They are not getting a 5% pay rise, like the one Parliament awarded itself yesterday. To increase its own budget by 5% in times such as these, as Parliament did yesterday, is quite simply shameless. I would also ask all my fellow Members, do you have no shame, or do you hope that your electors will not see what you have done and that you will be able to get away with it like a thief in the night? Increasing your own budget while at the same time saddling taxpayers with other people’s debts is typical of this sham parliament and of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). At the same time, however, I was also proud to be able to defend the interests of hard-working Dutch taxpayers yesterday. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fortunately, thanks to the efforts made yesterday by governments and EU institutions, we have fended off the risk that Europe may become the main threat to global stability. I agree with you, Mr Barroso, that the current crisis also necessitates changes in our institutional structure, which will allow us to show the world that we are responsible and united.</p>
<p class="contents">Today please allow me, however, in the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon, to use the platform of this Parliament to launch an appeal to the ruling class of my country: not only to politicians, but also to all those who have significant responsibilities in the economy or in civil society. The commitments made by Italy yesterday deserve an approach that goes beyond the factors that divide us and look at the needs of our people and at the contribution that we are being asked to so that Europe may be competitive and safeguard our well-being.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of the Italian Parliament in the coming days will be crucial, not only for Italy but for Europe, confirming the deep interdependence that binds together the economies of our countries. I hope, I wish, I desire, I ask with all my heart that this awareness can bring about an echo in my own country of the results achieved yesterday in Brussels.</p>

The litmus test for this question, however, is not to be found in today’s newspaper headlines, but rather in the economic developments of the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 3 of the resolution states: ‘The European Union must improve its prospects for growth and employment.’ This is absolutely correct. A question last night’s document did not answer, however, is the issue of what is to be done in order to improve the prospects for growth and employment. Much later, in paragraph 25, there is an indication of the intent to work out an appropriate strategy. I hope that this will happen. One thing is clear, however, President of the Commission and President-in-Office of the Council: a strategy of cuts without investment will not see us through this crisis. We are already in a state of stagnation and the threat of recession is not far away.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, this will come at a high cost for the people you have referred to, who are at the receiving end of this series of bad decisions, and who will find themselves with no jobs and no income.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the reason for my question today: When, Mr Van Rompuy, do you intend coming to this House with these proposals so that they can be approved by Parliament? After all, you said yourself that it is a matter for this House to discuss economic policy with you. We must assume responsibility here in a situation where you are obviously ready to curtail the responsibilities of the national parliaments. That is our present task.

The Summit has transformed the European Union into a debt union where debt is pumped around so we can all pretend we have money but in reality we do not. We only bought time – and why?</p>
<p class="contents">The root of the problem is still there. Greece cannot recover in the eurozone. Its debt has been cut but its economy remains sinking because the euro is too expensive for them. Greece will default and have to leave the eurozone to devalue, but it stays in and as a consequence the rest of the package will be undermined. The rescue fund is inflated to insure bonds from weaker Member States – but who wants to buy a bond which is insured up to 20% while you risk a haircut of 50%? If I were the investor I would stay away.</p>
<p class="contents">In May last year we stood here; the newly created rescue fund was shock and awe. It was not to be, and now we have constructed a Ponzi scheme, a debt bubble doomed to burst.

This House is your home.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make two or three comments. Firstly, we are not in a crisis of the euro. The euro is not the problem. The euro is the solution. We are not in a crisis of Europe. Europe is not the problem, it is the solution. The problem is the indebtedness of Member States. You have protected the financial stability of the Member States at the level of the euro area and the European Union, and I thank you for that.</p>
<p class="contents">We should ask ourselves the following question: what would have happened had we not had the euro? The franc, the escudo, the peseta would all have been devalued by between 10 and 35%, the Greek drachma by 40%, and the Deutschmark would have been re-valued by 20%. Let us reflect on this question and recognise that we are extremely lucky to have the euro, which is a solid currency, with vast foreign exchange reserves, which are respected on a global scale. The truth is that we are making progress towards greater European Union and, as the European Council of 23 October stated, towards a growth strategy with the single market. We shall enter the G20 summit with our heads held high. As Jean-Pierre Jouyet has written, too bad indeed if the financial markets end up imposing political Europe in an example of major historical irony.

<p class="contents">I feel relieved because at least last night’s agreement exists as we could not risk another failure. The restructuring of the Greek debt takes the European contribution to more than EUR 200 billion, adding together private debts, the euro area stability fund and the public aid plan. The first stage of recapitalising the banks loosens the current stranglehold by increasing own funds. I particularly welcome the increase of the European Financial Stability Facility rescue fund to EUR 1 000 billion, at last, in my view, as the socialists have always believed that this fund was not sufficiently resourced.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as a European, let me share with you the reasons for my concern, which are serious ones. I fear that all we did last night was to increase our capacity to carry out a patch-up job, and that we neglected the foundations of our common edifice.</p>
<p class="contents">On reading this agreement, I can see grounds for two major reservations: firstly, its ‘short term’ nature. The measures adopted this morning relate exclusively to finance and in no way provide a long-term solution to the need for economic integration. This morning, the Council responded to the European banking, debt and euro crisis: that was a vital step. However, the lack of prospects for growth and the silence on economic convergence and employment allow some people to continue to speculate about how fragile we are.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when we should be carrying out structural reforms to invest in and kick-start growth, we are recommended to opt for the ‘Euro Plus Pact’. We do not accept that. Let us not replace excessive dependency on the market by dependency on competitor nations which do not comply either with social or environmental standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reservation: budgetary authoritarianism, which adds enforcement to austerity. In point of fact, we face two crucial tasks today: to clean up our public finances and to kick-start growth. The balance between these two must be a political choice. It flows from a decision that we make for the people of Europe that we represent. The Court of Justice should not be a substitute for political will and our duty to show solidarity. We must not revise the treaty under pressure from speculators. The choice of further integration is our political duty, and that of this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can see from the example of Greece that the problem is no longer waiting for the next generation – it is now confronting this generation and we can see what this means.</p>
<p class="contents">Tightening one’s belt is painful, however we need to move towards a stability union. There have been some good developments that are going well and where things are working. Ireland is heading in the right direction. We have introduced a budgetary control watchdog, the European Semester. We have agreed a stability pact with teeth – something also to be welcomed. Last night marked an important step along the way to stability union. We agreed that the banks need to do business on a more solid basis. They are to be forced to fulfil their responsibilities and will be recapitalised, however they must have a solid 9% of equity capital. Greece is to have the haircut. It was clear that this would have to happen. We will also have permanent monitoring of the reforms in Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">Italy has announced pension reforms. We must be clear about the fact that we are still on the path to stability union. All of these things must be implemented in order for us to move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to close by congratulating Mr Rehn, the new Vice-President. I am certain that he will play a key role in taking us along the path to this stability union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet again, the possibility is being considered of amending the Treaty of Lisbon which, although conceived with a view to improving the functioning of the European Union, is still causing confusion among the EU institutions and in public opinion. A division within the European Union is now a reality. What we have is not necessarily, as has been claimed until now, a two-speed Europe but – as was recently expressed at the European Parliament – a three-speed Europe: the French-German directorate, other countries belonging to the euro area and countries that have not joined this zone.</p>
<p class="contents">However, at the summit last night the decision was made to write off EUR 100 billion of Greek debt and, additionally, to carry out bank recapitalisation. This short-term mechanism may prove insufficient, for example in the face of the threat that the crisis may extend to Italy, and for this reason, too, it is worth considering the possibility of a phased return of some countries to their national currencies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The restructuring of the Greek debt is also good news, but we would do well to admit that we were wrong, because, under the initial conditions, Greece would never have been able to pay. If we had acted sooner, the Greek people would have suffered less and the cost of the bailout would have been lower.</p>
<p class="contents">Recapitalisation of the banks: I need to look at it in detail, but I do not really understand why they have changed the criteria for evaluating sovereign debt, but have made no alteration to the evaluation of toxic assets, and I do not understand why they have set a ‘one size fits all’ rule for the limit on capital, thus establishing similar recapitalisation limits for financial institutions which, in fact, are not similar.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish Government will have to explain the transfers that it has carried out, but that will be done at home. On the other hand, the Commission does have to explain to us here why we are facing a banking crisis without it having submitted the proposal for a directive on crisis resolution mechanisms, as it promised to do when we spoke about financial supervision. A new storm, and still the lifeboats are not ready.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it is good news that they are boosting the firepower of the bailout fund. It is just a shame that we have to look externally because we are incapable of sorting out our own problems internally, and we will only do so if we have a comprehensive plan that simultaneously addresses macro-economic discipline, debt sustainability and, above all, growth.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time that the Commission came up with a universal plan and for us to get moving. If we have to amend the Treaties, well, let us do it, but we need to do it in stages, starting now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The proposed regulations based on Article 136, announced by Mr Barroso, show that the institutions that do actually exist can, instead of exhortations, make laws. We say: ‘make them; make these laws now’. We would add, furthermore, that we shall not allow any treaty reforms unless all the possibilities of the existing treaty have been exhausted.

This picture portrays the European Union today, where budget deficits prevent many Member States from developing. Now, what do we see this morning, after the mist has cleared? Why, Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Barroso have made a sortie with their warships and frightened away all the pirates. Ladies and gentlemen, the decisions made by the European Council have not frightened them away. It could be said that they have not permanently calmed the financial markets. It has bought us time – the time to put Member States’ budgets finally in order. The financial markets have no confidence in the Member States, since the latter fail to deal prudently with their taxpayers’ money. Let us put national budgets in order and use the time these guns have bought for us for now. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have seen the limitations of the method of coordination that you continue to advocate. What has been your response? It has been to bring together the ministers for economic affairs and finance of the euro area and the European Union a little more frequently and to give the Commission increased powers of control over national budgetary processes. You are nonetheless well aware of what ‘austere’ stuff the Commission is made. You have done all that by keeping national parliaments very largely out of the picture, and increasingly, the European Parliament as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, what you are suggesting looks more and more like the Chinese model, a model which I think that we do not share.

However, the money to pay for their recapitalisation will come from public funds.

<p class="contents">There is no question that a 50% debt write-off by the banks will give the Greek economy time and space to draw breath and obtain fresh funds. The second Greek rescue package clearly reflects the principle that the banks must play their part in dealing with the crisis.</p>

Most of the Members welcomed those decisions. However, there is still a lot of work to do. I want once again, on behalf of the Commission, to state that the Commission will stay very committed, working with this Parliament to achieve what I believe are our common goals.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that there are sometimes, between the different institutions, different positions in a sometimes dialectic relationship, but nevertheless I want to underline that in the preparation of this European Council and Euro Summit, the cooperation between the President of the European Council and myself and between his team and my team was really exemplary. It is important that at the same time as having different views on different issues we also stay committed to this spirit of all institutions working together to achieve more results for Europe and its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I will very briefly address some of the concrete issues put forward by the distinguished Members of this House. First of all, many of you spoke about banks and why we are taking decisions for banks and not being tougher with them. I would like to highlight that point 5 of the Annex to the European Council conclusions clearly states – and you will remember this was also our proposal in the Commission roadmap – that banks should first use private sources of capital, including through restructuring and conversion of debt to equity instruments and then that banks should be subject to constraints regarding the distribution of dividends and bonus payments until the target has been attained. Yesterday, in the European Council, I said to the European Heads of State and Government that the Commission is ready to bring forward a regulation if they really want to be sure that the banks will respect this orientation.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point that was highlighted by some of you was tax evasion. I would remind you that in my State of the Union address and afterwards in the roadmap I have been urging the Council to finally give the Commission the mandate to negotiate with third countries. Unfortunately this has not yet been done. At the same time we can – internally in the European Union – try to see what we can do to avoid this kind of behaviour. As you know, Commissioner Šemeta is working on this matter, but I have to tell you very frankly that this is one of the most difficult issues, and the fact that anonymity is required renders it even more difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the economic governance of the euro area, let me put things clearly. We are in the current situation in Europe not only because there was irresponsible financial behaviour but also because our Member States – or most of them – did not respect their commitments regarding the Stability and Growth Pact. I am saying this not only today here in front of you. I also said it yesterday in front of all the Heads of State and Government. I said also that some Member States did not report their national statistics accurately, with at least one Member State manipulating the statistics in a fraudulent way. This is exactly the kind of behaviour that we cannot accept in the future. This is why it is important to have convergence, but also discipline. If we want to have a true European Economic Union we need both. It is not just about convergence, we need more discipline so that we can achieve a higher degree of integration. I believe the Heads of Government and our Member States are learning that lesson.</p>
<p class="contents">The reality is that yesterday, if you look at the conclusions, they went beyond our proposals, which you adopted, on Stability and Growth Pact reinforcement. For instance, in point 26(e), they make a commitment – of course it is a political commitment, but it is an important one – that at national level they will stick to the recommendations of the Commission and the relevant Commissioner regarding the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact – even before any kind of formal decision by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we do have the circumstances where governments understand that, if they really want to keep financial stability and to stick to a common currency, more discipline, more integration and more convergence is needed. Of course, I really welcome this drive.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you mentioned, or put questions about, investments. I fully agree with you. This is not only about austerity. We need growth, and to have growth we need more investment – public investment. Since many of our Member States do not have the fiscal space to do this, we are proposing to use the Community level so that we can promote growth through some kind of public investment. In the European Council discussion on growth I had the occasion to put forward some proposals, such as project bonds, the Connecting Europe Facility and the possibility of anticipating some of the proposals for the next Multiannual Financial Framework, so that we can also show our citizens that we are serious when we speak about the possibilities of growth and are ready to make some kind of public investment, being committed to sustainable, inclusive growth and also to employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to conclude by saying that there is a lot of work to do. Now we have a better basis to go forward, but in fact some of the decisions that we took yesterday at the Euro Area Summit, and also in the European Council, have to be followed by consistent, determined implementation. That is where I want to ask you also to make the case for Europe in our own countries, as was highlighted on several occasions. Sometimes in Europe, when people criticise the European Union, they should be more precise about what they are criticising. Is it the European Union as a project? Is it our joint resolve or is it the attitude of some specific movements or political leaders? We need, more than ever, a stronger European Union; we need more than ever a strong euro and we will work for that if there is convergence between the main institutions. I can tell you that the Commission will stay very committed to this Community approach, looking forward to the very important work ahead.</p>

I am pleased to have heard so many positive things today. I have to get used to it. I cherish this moment. I think that it happens too rarely to let it pass without comment.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In any case, if someone uses the expression ‘too little, too late’, they must also indicate what they are referring to: of what is there ‘too little’, and with what is one ‘too late’? If the markets are your reference point, you must choose your argument. You cannot say that we should not listen to the markets because they are based on speculative movements which are negative and biased, and then, at the same time, blame us for not being able to keep up with the rhythm and speed of the markets. It is one or the other. In any case, political decision-making will always be behind the markets. This is why it is all the more important – as some have said here – to show direction, to follow a course and, even if one might give the impression of acting slowly, to always move consistently in the same direction. I am happy to admit that we have not always managed that.</p>
<p class="contents">In analysing the crisis, we must be accurate. There are problems with decision-making at EU level, at the collective level, but there are also many problems at Member State level. The crisis began in Greece and then spread in the autumn to Ireland and then on to Portugal. These countries hesitated for a long while before calling in the Emergency Fund, and an appalling amount of time was wasted. The consequence of this is that we have sometimes acted after the event. Now there are some countries that should have taken measures earlier and failed to do so, but that, under pressure, including from their partners, were persuaded a few months ago to introduce important reforms. The crisis is therefore not just a crisis at the level of decision-making by the institutions – if it ever was – but is primarily a crisis at the level of individual Member States. This is all too easily forgotten and disregarded.</p>
<p class="contents">A second comment that has just been made is that we ‘have only taken decisions of principle’. I have to say that that is how it always is. Decisions that are taken are often decisions of principle. They are then put into effect. Mr Bisky has just quoted Goethe, so I will quote Racine: </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>‘The drama is complete, it is just the verse that remains to be written.’ </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL) </span>We have therefore taken very important decisions effectively in all those areas. As far as the banks are concerned, I have a written agreement from the banks and not just something plucked from thin air. Of course, we do need to develop what has been decided in legal and financial terms, but the breakthrough has been made, the drama has been written. In any case, therefore, we made a lot more progress than was expected. Various models exist for what is known as leveraging – making the most of the possibilities offered by the Emergency Fund. These models do need to be sketched out, of course, but no further decisions are necessary. They can easily be combined and their effects cumulated. It is therefore not the case that we do not know where we are going. We just have to push things forward and further develop contacts with the private sector.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of recapitalisation, of course there is time until 30 June of next year. It is not as if we could just find EUR 100 billion from one day to the next and pump it into the banks! All these things take time, but not as much time as is often suggested, and many of these decisions have already been taken in principle, and indeed more than in principle.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not go into all of the answers given by the President of the Commission; I am merely concerned with the institutional side of things. He did indeed speak about the European Parliament. Just look at the texts. I contributed to them myself. I am willing – even though I am not obliged – to come to Parliament after each individual eurozone meeting I chair and report on the meeting as with the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If you read the texts properly, you will see that they do not just deal with the three points which happened to be included in my speech or my introduction. There are pages and pages about institutional reforms. We also go even further. I am also personally willing to exchange ideas with Parliament about deeper integration of the EU (that appears in the texts) and a further strengthening of fiscal discipline (that too), and to do this in good time so as not to surprise anybody. I am not obliged to do this, but if you are willing, I will be very happy to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not go into all the other points because I have already taken up a lot of time, but I would like to say that we are not seeing the end of the crisis at this juncture. Perhaps we have achieved a turning point. It still has to be worked out what we can do at the level of the institutions, what we can do together, but the major work still remains to be done at Member State level. Reforms need to be implemented in many countries, including some which are not at present under pressure from the market. We have now created the institution to follow this up, to monitor it and, if necessary, to force it to happen. If there is no stability at Member State level, the whole structure will not work. This is the difficult task that we will face in the coming months and years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The agreement reached is essential, not only to rescue Greece and the euro zone but also in order to reconfirm the solidarity and unity which form the basis of European integration. European leaders have taken important decisions in terms of the sustainability of public finances, structural reforms to ensure economic growth and support for the banking sector. These are designed to enable us to overcome the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of first-class capital into the European banking system will ensure lending to the real economy. Through the injection of EUR 100 billion into the European banking system, the collapse of many of the banks holding billions of euro in Greek state bonds will be avoided. It is important to maintain capital flows in EU countries, including those that are not in the euro area, including Romania. At the same time, these measures must be backed by the adoption of a viable model of European economic governance in order to ensure that we truly overcome the recession and to prevent a recurrence of similar crises in the future. We must at the same time intensify dialogue at international level in order to promote clear and appropriate rules to ensure the optimal functioning of global markets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There were some very difficult moments, and even doubts as to the outcome of the operation. However, today the patient feels well, or as well as possible following an operation. If there are no complications it will recover, which is what I wholeheartedly wish. ‘Shock therapy’ urged the Member States to take concrete decisions. After nearly 10 hours of negotiations, it proved possible to achieve compromises that are intended to result in a reduction of the Greek debt by EUR 100 billion (from the current level of EUR 350 billion). It has also been agreed to ‘multiply’ the borrowing capacity of the European Financial Stability Mechanism up to around EUR 1 billion and to provide additional capitalisation for the key EU banks to the tune of around EUR 106 billion. The President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, intends to steer Greece to ‘the road to health’, so that by 2020 it can reduce its national debt to the level of 120% (as opposed to the current level of 162%). President Barroso is right when he says that ‘exceptional times call for exceptional measures’. These decisions have already produced clear results. This morning the world stock exchanges have registered the highest growth in the last two months, and the euro is doing rather well. I believe that the current situation calls for a programme of radical reforms; the only pity is that the patient was not given the necessary medicine – to say nothing about preventive treatment … </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no quick and easy solution, taking into account the enormous number of economic variables and possible consequences that must be kept in mind. Recent years have shown that most of the measures that have been taken so far have been inadequate. If members of the eurozone cannot curtail their spending and balance their budgets, then we are likely to face an even greater crisis. We cannot go on living indefinitely beyond our means - we must return to the real economy. I am concerned that, if the increase of the EFSF and the rest of the package do not live up to our expectations and Greece defaults, it will diminish investors’ trust in investing in the rest of the eurozone. I hope that further concrete measures to tackle the growing debts in the eurozone will be presented without delay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we have reservations as to whether the neoliberal recipes being promoted will have the anticipated results, as it was these very recipes that caused the disaster. We need a more radical review of things. We would also note that the measures taken today should have been taken far more promptly. Unfortunately Greece and the citizens of Greece are living the dire consequences of a very strict austerity policy which had to be imposed on them, as there was a lack of integrated European measures during the crisis and a delay in declaring the necessary Community solidarity. Citizens in other countries in southern Europe face similar problems. We would also note that stability without growth and without an integrated investment strategy and without stamping out tax evasion is no solution. The European Parliament needs to be involved in the decisions taken to get us out of the crisis, alongside the European Council and the European Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the start of a new chapter in the history of Europe. We owe this agreement first and foremost to France and to the incredible tenacity of President Sarkozy. The only battles that are sure to be lost are those that are not fought in the first place. President Sarkozy has convinced his colleagues from the other Member States and made the banks face up to their responsibilities. Greece would not be in its current position had the banks done their job properly and ensured that the country was able to pay back its debts. They took risks, and today, at last, they are bearing those risks by writing off half of the Greek debt. This crisis shows that we need more Europe, at least for the euro area, and I hope that we will move towards economic federalism by creating a true economic government in the euro area. Lastly, it is essential that we harmonise our budgetary and fiscal policies and make the golden rule an obligation for all the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that all Member States should, at the level of the European Council, make a clear commitment to target public spending at economic growth and job creation. Moreover, all Member States should also firmly commit themselves to revising their programmes related to Structural Funds by setting new priorities for projects and focusing on education and research, high employment, implementation of the Digital Agenda and improving the conditions for enhanced economic growth and reducing the differences between regions. In order to increase confidence in the banking sector, national supervisory authorities will require banks to increase the level of the highest quality capital to 9% by 2012, as a temporary measure.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider it necessary to restrict the payment of dividends and bonuses by banks until the financial crisis is over, in other words, not only until the 9% target is met.

Tonight, Europe has indeed taken a small step forwards, but the agreed measures will only be able to provide some short-term comfort. I thus do not share the euphoria that some people are feeling at the moment. Take the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), for example. The expansion of the EFSF is needlessly complicated and indeed inefficient. The responsibility for buying up government bonds has been given to the EFSF, but without the Facility being given adequate resources to do so. EUR 1 000 billion really will not be enough to build a protective wall for Italy and Spain. The solution that the Heads of State or Government hammered out in the European Council consists merely of financial high-tech and not of measures that have an impact on the real economy and the social fabric of Europe. The Council is completely on the side of the financial markets rather than that of the citizens. We have not learned anything about fair pay, job creation or investment in the economy. A tottering economy will never recover by availing itself of financial chicanery. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
