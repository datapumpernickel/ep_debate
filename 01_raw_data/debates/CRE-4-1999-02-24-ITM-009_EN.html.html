<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pack </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to discuss the fundamental importance of this education and training programme. We have done so often enough over the past months and even years. Basically we know it all. Perhaps I could say to the President‐in‐Office of the Council, although he is not present, that good Europeans do not grow on trees! They are educated for Europe in Europe. We have to create the necessary European added value, the European dimension in the education and training system, by creating a European area of education and training.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not trying to take over any of the obligations of national, regional and local politicians to carry out European education and training activities; but we want to give them the extra help that is more than ever needed to achieve coexistence on a basis of tolerance in Europe. At the first reading we already found that the Commission had greatly improved its Socrates II proposal. The procedures are simpler, access is easier, there is less red tape. We also achieved one small thing that was important for many in the Comenius programme, namely that where necessary, exchanges of pupils can also be arranged in the framework of Comenius.</p>
<p class="contents">I will confine myself now to the amendments we are tabling today and will be voting on tomorrow that I consider important. First I want to say that I believe it is particularly important for people living in frontier regions to be taught and learn languages. Frontier regions where the inhabitants do not understand their neighbour"s language cannot fully experience the single market at local level. Learning English is of little use to them; for instance in Saarland, where I come from, on the frontier between Luxembourg and France, French is useful, which is why the inhabitants should learn French, from nursery school on! It is in their interest to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point we made is that we absolutely must strengthen the system of recognition of studies pursued abroad, what is known as the ECTS system. We need to do so to ensure that the time young people spend studying abroad is credited to them when they return home rather than being a waste of time in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another aspect we consider very important. The Erasmus programme study grants are very small, given the shortage of funds, but young people cannot go to a foreign country with only 100 euros in their pocket. They can only do so if they have parents or relatives who will finance them. If they have parents and relatives who will do so, they might not even need the 100 euros, so perhaps it would be a good idea if the universities looked at students" financial and economic circumstances before handing out grants. If someone wants to go abroad as an Erasmus student and can finance their studies themselves, it would be better to save these euros three, four or five times over. A less well‐off student could go abroad to study with four or five times these 100 euros. So that is what we have urged and I hope that at this next sitting the Council will show more understanding here than it did before and perhaps endorse our approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we have suggested something else too, for given that the programme now runs for seven years rather than five, which we have accepted, we obviously need an evaluation at the end of the year 2002. This evaluation can no longer relate just to quality but must first and foremost also be financial. That is why I hope the Council will agree that given the length of the programmes we should carry out a mid‐term review, but a serious one, not just a piece of paper!</p>
<p class="contents">The main point of dispute facing us now is, of course, as it has always been with Socrates since 1994, when I first dealt with it, funding. The Commission wanted EUR 1.5 billion for a five‐year period. We said: that is not enough, we need EUR 2 billion. And we do need that in view of the extension of the programme to all the countries that want to join in. We have just been talking about Turkey today, but Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia and Slovakia also want to join. The Council promises all that in its Sunday speeches, and then on Monday we do not have the money to pay for it. So we need more money. Now the Council has played a very clever trick. It has extended the programme to seven years and given us EUR 1.55 billion. But all that is rather symbolic, for it has given us less than we used to have for the five‐year programme. So we have made a very wise proposal: we want EUR 2.5 million. We do not want it for ourselves; we want it for all the young people in the European Union, for the 300 million people eligible for this programme, from the cradle to the grave, as I said last time. For this is a programme of life‐long learning that begins at school and continues into old age.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be a pity if the Council did not keep all its promises to allocate substantial funding. For then we really could do something for the citizens of Europe, and in view of the coming European elections, I believe we must fight for this together. I assume you will join me in this!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Elchlepp </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mrs Pack on her report and I am glad we reached broad agreement in committee on the direction of the future programmes. We have had enough discussions about the principles of this most successful Socrates programme. One thing I want to highlight today is the totally inadequate funding proposed by the Council. Unfortunately, thousands of people are still barred from taking part in this programme, as shown by the high number of applicants whom the agencies concerned have to turn away each year for of lack of funding. Here the EU could do more to demonstrate its support for the European exchange programmes. That is why my group has called from the outset for more funding, in order to give young people a chance to experience living abroad and also to make the current Socrates programme less socially biased. Sunday speeches may well tell of a Europe in which young people meet each other, a Europe of tolerance and a common education and training area; in practice, however, great difficulties arise when it comes to funding decisions. But surely it would be a good thing, and reflect a genuine European vision, if as many young people as possible could receive part of their education in a neighbouring country.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also point out that a wider knowledge of foreign languages and early awareness of the cultural situation in other countries are excellent means of promoting mobility on the European labour market, which forms part of an active employment policy. Labour market experts have long recognised this as an accepted fact. The call for EUR 2.5 billion for the new programme period agreed by the committee is the absolute minimum. In contrast, the Council"s proposal of only EUR 1.5 billion for seven years is not really an increase in funding but, as Mrs Pack rightly said, no increase at all if you consider the total duration of the programme, if you look at the extra tasks of adult education and opening up the programme to Central and Eastern Europe, if you seriously want to remove the social bias apparent in some parts of the programme. The Erasmus grants, for instance, which currently amount to about EUR 70, really offer little added incentive to young people from socially disadvantaged families to do some of their studies abroad while those who can afford it in the first place get this extra funding anyway.</p>
<p class="contents">For the rest I am very pleased that the socio‐political demands my group made in its amendments were carried, for instance that universities should in future take more account of the applicants" means when allocating Erasmus grants and that Comenius should focus on mobility measures, especially for young people from vocational schools and in vocational training, because this group has always had fewer chances of taking part in exchange projects. I also welcome the fact that the committee agreed that aid for learning the official neighbouring language should become one of the priorities under the Comenius programme. That will promote cross‐frontier activities and the creation of bilingual areas, as for instance in the region where I come from. We want to create a bilingual area on the southern upper Rhine, and if we could do so, with the approval also of the Council, that would be a wonderful means of supporting this development. All this will do much to show the public the practical and useful side of Europe, something that is often lacking in European policy.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Heinisch </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me thank Mrs Pack very warmly for her strong support for the Socrates programme. In particular, I am in favour of a financial boost for this programme. As rapporteur for the report on the European year of life‐long learning, I know how important the Grundtvig III action is, which supports life‐long learning for young people without adequate basic training and also for adults who want and need to widen their knowledge and abilities. If we want to work together in partnership on education and training at European level, we must keep all the parties concerned informed about education and training issues. In terms of schools, that means we must first of all inform parents and teachers, so that they can recognise and promote the European dimension of education and training jointly with the young people involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Especially in the Central and Eastern European countries, in Cyprus and in the Baltic states, parents and others involved in education and training expect to be given the means to support the process of democratisation in schools and in society. I spoke earlier about the report on Turkish participation in the Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes and I discussed this question with young people and teachers in Istanbul last week, as I did this week in the delegation with our Lithuanian counterparts. They all regard adult education as a big chance of moving towards a more democratic society in their country. Here again the old saying I learned at school about adult education still applies: it is often more important to educate and train parents and adults than young people. So I am glad this programme offers support in that area.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Virrankoski </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(FI)</span> Mr President, Parliament is now discussing the second phase of the Socrates action programme and the Council"s common position on it. I would like, at this stage, to thank Mrs Pack for all the very hard work she has done for the good of the Socrates programme, which is evident from the report now under discussion. Socrates has been one of the most successful of EU programmes. Within its framework thousands upon thousands of Europe"s young people have been able to study abroad, gain knowledge and stimulation, and have their image of the world enriched through actual international experience. The programme has been particularly invaluable for Member States with small populations. It has both opened new doors for students in those countries and brought new students in from other countries, thus strengthening highly‐valued European interaction.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has now reached a common position. The main difference between Mrs Pack"s report and the Council"s position is that the latter is offering a sum of EUR 1550 million, whereas Mrs Pack and the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media are asking for EUR 2500 million for the next seven years. When we consider that the EU will, in all likelihood, enlarge in the next seven years, EUR 2500 million would seem to be the right figure. It is further justified by the fact that European industrial and commercial competitiveness depends greatly on the level of education we can offer our young people and our older citizens too.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the content of the Socrates programme, I would like to raise just one question: the report specifies that the study of languages should be limited to the official languages of the EU, as well as Irish and Letzebuergesch. As the languages of the Member States" neighbouring countries are not often learnt to any considerable extent within the EU, it would be appropriate to remove this harsh restriction and broaden language learning to embrace the often ignored but important languages of our neighbouring countries. In this way we would be advancing the cause not only of EU enlargement, but also transnational cooperation.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Guinebertière </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I must firstly congratulate Mrs Pack, the rapporteur for the Socrates programme, on the work which she has accomplished not only in the House but also in the negotiations with the Council and the Commission to obtain EUR 2 000 million for the programme"s operation.</p>
<p class="contents">If there is one European programme which our citizens know about, it is Socrates. This is a programme that has proved itself, and its success has gone far beyond its financial scope. However, it is unfortunately helping to a certain extent to create a privileged class of people, namely those who have had access to Socrates.</p>
<p class="contents">Socrates brings genuine European added value to the national dimension of our education systems as it encourages the learning of European languages and the study of other cultures all around us. Why is this programme so popular? In my opinion, the answer is quite simply that it responds to people"s expectation that Europe should be interested in its people, in their personal development and in their integration within their own territory. Socrates enables students and teachers to meet and it also allows cooperation between teaching establishments, improved recognition of qualifications and experience of other European educational systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The Culture Committee tabled a number of amendments to improve the Commission"s initial proposal, and in particular we requested an increased budget in order to include lifelong training in Socrates. The introduction of Minerva, which is intended to encourage the use of multimedia in education, is an excellent innovation in my opinion, as also are the joint projects to be conducted with other Community programmes such as Leonardo and Youth for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I hope that the implementation of this programme will be effectively monitored, as I am sure it will, and that information relating to this will be distributed to those responsible for supervising the programme or even to anyone who wants such information. This is the second reading of this report and we are therefore drawing closer to the programme"s implementation. I would therefore wish everyone well who benefits from our work and consequently comes to realise that Europe is for them.</p>

Although we managed to get an increase in the budget, it is clear that the increase is inadequate to meet the demands of the growing numbers of countries that want, quite rightly, to participate in the education programmes under Socrates.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that they do. If we are going to build a greater Europe, not just confined to the current 15 Member States, it is right that we should be expanding the programmes to other countries. The evidence is very clear from my knowledge of the programmes as a former lecturer in higher education, that the more we can get young people across Europe meeting and talking to each other, the more they will understand the importance of Europe and the importance of building Europe. I only wish that a few British journalists could take part in the programme as well. Then they might understand Europe a little better.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that Commissioner Cresson will respond positively to the report and will take up the battle which Parliament wants to continue, to expand the programme and expand the budget so that we can have a truly successful Socrates programme.</p>

If every individual is to be in a position to pursue a variety of professions during their career thanks to technological change, then we have to create the necessary conditions. One major building block on the way to creating a Europe of knowledge is the Socrates programme for general education, as Leonardo is for vocational training. These education and training programmes improve individuals" knowledge and abilities and equip them for the future. Good quality school education and the application of our concept of life‐long learning are a way of mastering many of the challenges facing us, for the profile of tomorrow"s workers is as follows: the ability to develop leadership abilities and to act independently, while at the same time showing a team spirit and social skills.</p>
<p class="contents">Workers and managers must be able to communicate and represent their own interests and aims while also showing an awareness of what appear to be alien cultures, identifying the differences and trying to break down the barriers. How else, if not by improving their linguistic knowledge, can people become more mobile, can they study away from home anywhere in Europe, can they complete a training course or find a job? The fact that Socrates supports language teaching even in less familiar European languages is a plus in terms of solidarity. The proposals put forward by Mrs Pack, a proponent of practical policies, deserve unreserved support. I have learned from my visits to schools, at which Europe is put to the test nearly every Monday, how much support there is for Socrates, despite all the problems with applications for funding. Exchanges between pupils and encounters between teachers carry more weight than any number of glossy brochures.</p>
<p class="contents">But what is the use of splendid ideas if they do not serve the general good? The EUR 2.5 million we are calling for is a minimum if you look at the growing circle of recipients, if you look at the number of applicant countries. Socrates is an exemplary, sensible and verifiable investment in the future.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Frischenschlager </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I want to address two particular points in connection with this debate on the excellent and important report drafted by Mrs Pack. We are talking about the cultural project of promoting cross‐frontier language learning. Here we should take particular note of the situation in the Central and Eastern European countries. When we visit these countries we keep finding that their inhabitants have an excellent knowledge of our languages, but who of us in western Europe speaks their languages? It is here that the European Union has a special responsibility to make sure that our young people learn the languages of their Central and Eastern European neighbours, for economic but even more for cultural reasons, for reasons of European policy. That is my first point.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is one that Mrs Pack has also addressed, namely our special responsibility for frontier areas. We are now seeing a phenomenon, especially in Austrian frontier areas, where after complaining for years about dead frontiers and deaths and the iron curtain we are suddenly afraid of open frontiers again. We must respond to this with cultural initiatives, with education and training measures. So it is most important that we institutionalise this. Exchanges between pupils, between teachers, but in particular bilingual, even trilingual schools can be a means of linking up these frontier areas not just economically but also in cultural, linguistic terms.</p>
<p class="contents">We have the experience of a particular situation in Austria, in Kärnten, where we have very special Slovenian and German‐language educational facilities because of the Slovenian minority. With the opening up of frontiers, we can now see how useful these young people with their training are in terms of general and cross‐frontier economic development. So we have these examples, which is why I believe that money invested in this programme is money very well spent and well invested.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hyland </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Mr President, I join with previous speakers in welcoming the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this debate. Socrates phase one has been a very worthwhile experiment in transnational education. In my own country of Ireland there are many teachers and students who can testify to its success as a unique learning experience. Apart from its obvious educational dimension, Socrates has provided a sense of belonging and an opportunity for young people to share and enjoy the cultural diversity of the European Union and its Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It exposes young people through well‐designed educational programmes to the differing lifestyles and individuality of each EU country, while at the same time helping them to appreciate more their own rich and diverse heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that the Council has now reached a common position on future education and training programmes including the Socrates programme, that the operational time for the new programme is to be extended to seven years and that the budget is to be significantly increased. Europe, in my view, must continue to invest in young people. A skilled and mobile young population is our greatest asset in a world that is becoming increasingly competitive. Ireland has demonstrated how its young people are contributing in a major way to its significant economic growth.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hawlicek </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, first I want to warmly thank Mrs Pack for her report, and in particular for the commitment she has shown to the subject. The content of the second generation of education and training programmes was decided on the basis of the discussion on the White Paper on teaching and learning, by the Green Paper on cross‐frontier mobility and by the Europe of Knowledge programme. The aim is to give all the target groups easier access to the programmes, to simplify the application and selection procedure and to achieve a participation rate of 10 % of schools and 10 % of students and pupils.</p>
<p class="contents">Particular emphasis is also placed on removing all forms of discrimination. So at second reading we now have the additional provision that the economic situation of applicants should be taken into consideration in an appropriate fashion when grants are awarded, as should the promotion of equal opportunities for women and men and, which I particularly welcome, closer involvement of the social partners. One innovation found in Socrates II, as a consequence of the concept of life‐long learning called for in all education and training programmes, is the inclusion of adult education in the Grundtvig programme. Another innovation is that we now have a training programme with a female name, in the form of the Minerva education and multi‐media technology programme, another successful proposal by Doris Pack. In short, this means that Socrates is a good programme covering added aspects, that seeks a higher quota of participants and is open to a larger number of eligible applicant states. We must not forget that most of the applicant states can already take part in the training and education programmes and that more and more of them will be able to do so in the next seven years.</p>
<p class="contents">That makes the Council proposal to reduce the Commission"s proposed funding from EUR 1.4 billion for five years to EUR 1.55 billion – but for seven years – even more scandalous. That would mean that Socrates II had to do more for more participants for less money. So I ask the European Parliament to endorse the committee"s justified amendment, that was adopted unanimously, providing for EUR 2.5 billion for a period of seven years. That really is the minimum we can ask for if the Socrates programme is to continue to be applied successfully for young people, for students and teachers and for all those who want to teach and engage in further education in Europe.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Matikainen‐Kallström </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FI)</span> Mr President, the Socrates programme is one of the most important channels of support for mobility and diversity of education within the Community. To include the student population of EU applicant countries and certain other countries close to us in the programme is a natural step towards an enlarging Europe. In the expanding Socrates process we need to ensure that individual participation in the programme is not made more difficult by such matters as underfunding. It is important to take account of the financial situation of participants when deciding how to allocate funds. The study of minority languages in the European area, as well as support for the Sami language as part of international policy, will preserve valuable local cultural traditions, which must be kept alive in an ever more internationalist Europe. The inclusion of adult learners and trained teaching staff in the programme will broaden its scope by appealing to a much larger section of the population. Their involvement will make it considerably easier to promote the mutual recognition of courses undertaken in different countries, which in turn will help the mobility of labour. Money invested in the programme will be recouped many times over in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Council and the Commission will the give this issue the consideration it deserves and that the present Socrates programme will have a follow‐up which is just as good as the current programme, supported by the funding proposed by Parliament. Obviously, there are many parties with a claim to a share in the budget, but if we make cuts in the youth programmes, we will be making cuts for our future and the development of Europeanisation, which will be a be very shortsighted policy.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Crowley </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Mr President, I should also like to join with my colleagues in congratulating the rapporteur on the tremendous proposal she has put before us. When we discuss any issues regarding education we have to see this as an investment in the future for our young people to give them the skills to adapt to the changing technologies in the changing world in which we live. It is also an investment in the future for a greater understanding of the diversity in the European Union – cultural, social and linguistic.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is important, as the previous speaker has said, that the study of minority languages should be encouraged in the Socrates programme. I speak in particular of the Irish language. It is an official language of the European Union and should be given greater prominence.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as many speakers have said, despite what the Council may say about the importance of education and despite the Commission's good faith regarding lifelong learning, there is a lack of commitment on financial resources. Therefore, I urge all Members to support the amendments tabled by the rapporteur to ensure that this new seven‐year Socrates programme is given proper funding of EUR 2 500m.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that we learn from mistakes made in the programmes in the past. I refer in particular to the Erasmus programme which dealt mainly with third‐level student exchanges. It contained an element of exclusivity so that if a family could not afford to support a student studying in a foreign country that student could not benefit. It is incumbent on us to ensure that some financial support would be available under these programmes, either at European or national level. If Member State governments will not provide this, we should reduce the amount of money they receive under the Socrates programme and other education programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I urge all Members to support this and to give more hope for the future of the European Union.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Elliott</span> <span class="bold"> (PSE).</span> – Mr President, I strongly commend these recommendations and the amendments which the rapporteur has put forward. I have not been so directly involved with the discussions on these programmes in Parliament of late but some five years ago I was co‐author with Mrs Pack of Parliament's report on the first Socrates programme. Everything that has happened since has vindicated the strong support which Parliament gave to this programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Other speakers have referred in glowing terms – and rightly so – to the value of the Erasmus exchanges and the school networking which these programmes provide. Not only do these programmes benefit the individual students who participate in them and the schools and colleges of which they are students, but we must also remember that they make a real contribution to awareness and a meaningful understanding of the work of the European Union itself for large numbers of students and their families. It makes it real for them.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased also to see the inclusion of the applicant countries, together with Malta and Cyprus. I was in Malta last week for the joint committee and I can tell you they are very eager that Malta should be fully participating in these programmes. The key point is the funding. Unless we have adequate funding we cannot ensure that all young people who could benefit from these programmes are able to do so, nor can we avoid the elitism which means that only those able to afford it are able to participate.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much hope we will support this figure of EUR 2.5 billion. It sounds a lot of money and Ministers quail at the figure. But what is EUR 2.5 billion? It is EUR 1 per European citizen per year of the programme. For many people it is less than the cost of a cup of coffee or a newspaper. It is less than 5 % of Bill Gates' personal wealth – which is an interesting reflection. Perhaps we could ask him for a donation if we cannot find the money any other way.</p>

As a university teacher I can only endorse, year after year, what Doris Pack has described in general terms and has rightly highlighted as positive, as well as what she has rightly criticised. The idea is wonderful, but the stumbling block is the funding. Only a few weeks ago we had to award grants at my university and I well remember the enthusiasm of the young people who heard that they could now study in Rome, Paris, Trieste, Thessalonica and elsewhere, just as I remember the tears of those who could not do so because of lack of funds. I remember, and in fact see it again week after week with great pleasure, how much an Erasmus student can do for his or her place of study abroad during a traditional academic year. But as we said, the problem is the money.</p>
<p class="contents">We keep enlarging, and we are right to enlarge towards the Central and Eastern European countries. We are deliberately trying to open up new horizons there. But – and this is something I have thought about very deeply in recent weeks – when I compare the applications before me now with the typical applications of two or three years ago, I find there is a huge difference, namely that a great many people apply for grants who really do not need them any more, who already have two, three or four study periods behind them. In fact, I no longer tend to receive applications or receive fewer and fewer applications from good, young candidates with linguistic knowledge, who are committed, who are prepared to make their contribution but who have not already had one or two previous study opportunities in the course of their <span class="italic">curriculum vitae</span> . So I think we must not cut the funding but must jointly do all we can to offer the young people of Europe the kind of opportunities we would all wish them to have.</p>

As everyone has said, Socrates is a success story. Its extension to schools is an incredible success and extraordinarily beneficial. I would just like to mention one project: four primary schools, four countries, entitled ‘Water in our Culture". The children have learnt that other countries, cultures and languages exist, that we share aspects of our culture and that we must protect the environment. They have also learnt how new technology can help them communicate across frontiers – an absolutely fantastic achievement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the cornerstone of the People's Europe. I know that Mrs Cresson joins us and appreciates this point. As has been said, EUR 2.5 billion must be found. It is a very small price to pay for building empathy and understanding between our children and our young people. After all, that is the real basis for long‐lasting peace and understanding in Europe.</p>

Unfortunately the Council and Parliament have not yet managed to reach agreement on the amount of funding. Since the duration of Socrates is being extended to seven years, it is only logical to call for EUR 2.5 billion for this programme. Socrates must also be evaluated in both qualitative and financial terms by 31 December 2002. I support Doris Pack"s proposals in every respect and hope they will be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Promoting linguistic knowledge, learning two foreign languages, of which at least one should be the language of a neighbouring country, is a vital means of giving our young people the chance to obtain qualifications, to make use of the single market, to find work and to develop a sense of Europe. I also fully support the proposal to change the way grants are awarded to ensure that people do not all automatically receive grants that are barely enough to keep body and soul together. Those who need the money should be given adequate grants. I hope these points will be accepted and that the Conciliation Committee reaches a satisfactory conclusion before the end of this legislative term.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cresson, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I must warmly thank the House for its unfailing commitment and support which will allow the second reading of the new phase of the Socrates programme to be concluded today, barely two months after the adoption of the common position by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular I note the political will of Parliament to conclude the negotiations on the new programme as quickly as possible. This sends a strong political message to the people of Europe, just before the European elections, about our common desire to advance the construction of a European educational area.</p>
<p class="contents">I must particularly thank Mrs Pack for her excellent report and also her colleagues on the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media for their constant support.</p>
<p class="contents">I have previously emphasised the very positive attitude taken by the Austrian Presidency, which was strict but sensible in advancing the work within the Council so that the common position could be adopted in December. The signals from the German Presidency are also positive and encouraging, and show that a common political will exists to adopt this decision before the new Parliament is elected.</p>
<p class="contents">You will remember that we had an opportunity during the sitting on 5 November to discuss three proposals on the Socrates, Leonardo and Youth for Europe programmes. As you know, the Council of Ministers for Education of 4 December adopted common positions on the first two programmes, although a consensus was not reached on the Youth for Europe programme for budgetary reasons. I could not give the Commission"s agreement to the proposal made, which meant that an overall agreement could not be achieved. The situation at the time meant that the Commission was unable to give the go‐ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that Parliament will deliver its opinion at second reading on the Leonardo programme before the end of this Parliament so that the final decision can be made under the German Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the Youth for Europe programme, I hope that the situation will be resolved in the coming weeks so that a common position can be adopted at the Council meeting scheduled for 27 May.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has examined your amendments in an open and constructive manner, and I can tell you that it will accept in full or in part 15 out of the 16 amendments tabled. These will be included in a revised proposal which will be submitted to the Council in the next few days. Many amendments are similar to the Commission"s initial and amended proposals and therefore help to improve and even correct certain politically important aspects of the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">If you will allow me, I will mention a few of the more significant examples. I must thank you for having accepted the ‘European educational area" concept in Amendment No 2, as defined in our proposals. The term ‘area of cooperation in the field of education and training" requested by the Council has excessively technical and abstract overtones and would be difficult for people to understand. On the other hand, ‘educational area" sends a strong political message to all the citizens of the Union and clearly indicates to them the direction that the Community is taking in education and training. In this respect, I must particularly thank those who insisted on this term, namely Mrs Guinebertière, Mr Hyland and Mrs Hawlicek.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the procedures for selecting projects, I am pleased to note that Parliament agrees with the Commission"s aim of increased simplicity, greater transparency and increased ease of use for programme beneficiaries, as indicated by Amendment No 14. Parliament"s proposal to eliminate one of the Member State consultation stages within the centralised actions would considerably simplify and shorten the project selection procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that Parliament intends to introduce a revision clause in Article 12, as indicated in Amendment No 8, to allow the Commission to present a report on the results achieved, including on the financial framework, three years after the start of the programme, together with any proposals it deems appropriate. As the Council has decided to extend the programme"s duration to seven years rather than the five proposed by the Commission, the clause introduced by Parliament will allow the programme to adapt flexibly to any new requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously I accept Amendment No 12 which aims, when awarding Erasmus grants, to give priority to students whose financial situation requires special assistance. On this point I must thank Mr Rack and Mrs Tongue, who stressed the importance of this. Particular emphasis must also be placed on an aspect which other speakers have mentioned, which is that it is often students from the most‐favoured categories who apply for grants. This is because they are less inhibited, they are used to travelling with their families, they hear discussions at home about events abroad and they are, perhaps, culturally better prepared. But the decisions are, after all, taken locally and we can have every confidence that those awarding the grants will distinguish between those who have ability and those who perhaps have greater merit but less ability and for whom the awarding of the grant will be more decisive in their professional and personal development.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I would point out that, following Parliament"s initiative last autumn, the Commission launched a study on the socio‐economic situation of Erasmus students. The results of the survey, which covered ten thousand students, will be presented to you in the next few months.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, for two years now the Commission has been systematically urging universities and national agencies to take account of the financial needs of students when awarding Erasmus grants. This is something that I myself have monitored very carefully, and I would like to thank those who have looked into this question.</p>
<p class="contents">I can also accept the principle behind Amendments Nos 10 and 16, which establishes the possibility of initiating pilot projects to allow young unemployed teachers to teach for a time at a school in another Member State. All the Member States really need teachers from other countries of the European Union – we have all experienced language teaching in our own countries. It is clear that being taught even for a short while by a teacher from a foreign country who can provide a unique view of his or her own culture is very important, particularly for young children.</p>
<p class="contents">Such an initiative would allow young teachers to acquire vital professional experience while helping to give a real European dimension to teaching.</p>
<p class="contents">Several other amendments aim to clarify and reinforce certain aspects of the common position and as such their substance or principles can be accepted. This is particularly the case with Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 (second part) and 15 which cover the following aspects, among others: the importance of the European Credit Transfer System; more support for young people undergoing training in the form of language learning projects; clarification of the procedures for the participation of Cyprus; a reduction in the minimum percentages specified by the Council for Actions 2 and 3; the priority to be given to languages less widely used and taught, and, in frontier regions, the languages of neighbouring countries. Several speakers were concerned about this last subject, namely Mr Elchlepp, Mr Kerr and Mr Mann. I cannot, however, accept Amendment No 6 on the financial article.</p>
<p class="contents">I note Parliament"s support for increasing the programme"s budget to EUR 2 500 million. In its original proposal, in line with the priorities established under Agenda 2000, the Commission specified a financial framework of EUR 1 400 m for a five‐year period. Applying the same priorities to a seven‐year period, as specified in the common position, and taking into account the average growth rate, the Commission would have proposed a figure in the order of EUR 2 151 m. However, in order to achieve a common position at first reading, the Commission was forced to adopt the figure of EUR 1 550 m which was approved by a qualified majority.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the Commission and Parliament agree on increasing the budget in line with our ambitions. I hope that after the negotiations the Council will feel able to agree with us and I also hope that we can move forward together during the conciliation procedure. Obviously, I will be determinedly on your side in this procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would stress that I believe we are on course to achieve a final decision under the German Presidency which would allow us to prepare for the implementation of the new programme under the best possible conditions. Clearly I hope that a satisfactory agreement on the budget can be reached during the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by again thanking the Culture Committee and its rapporteur Mrs Pack in particular for their excellent work and their constructive amendments, and also the House as a whole for the support which it has constantly given us. I am convinced that this programme will help to build a Europe of knowledge which will send out a strong political message and respond to the needs of the public.</p>
