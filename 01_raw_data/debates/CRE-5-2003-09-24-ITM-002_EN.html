They represent an attempt at making a new start and desisting from the disputes of the past. They are about finding a solution to the problem of how we help the people of Iraq in the aftermath of war, and that of the competences of the United Nations, which must progressively take over the leadership in this area in order to be able to permanently stabilise the region. It is for this reason that I am pushing for the rejection of those amendments that seek to re-ignite the disputes between us from the time before the war in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">We owe it to the people there to look to the future rather than perpetuating old disputes, and so I would recommend that you reject all the amendments, with the exception of Mr Sakellariou’s on the International Court of Justice, which I recommend that we adopt. If you do, you will achieve a great majority in this House, enabling the European Union to be in a stronger position when it goes to the donors’ conference and us to take on a great deal of responsibility in a constructive way.</p>

<p class="contents">Two elements in particular are typical of this opinion:</p>
<p class="contents">- paragraph 1.8 talks of the need to set up a multinational military force and a police force mandated by the United Nations, in cooperation with ΝΑΤΟ, on the basis of a ‘political timetable’, thereby repeating the ‘Bosnia-Herzegovina’ argument (six-month timetable, now ten years old);</p>
<p class="contents">- Mr Brok called for and succeeded in securing a vote against all amendments calling for the immediate withdrawal of the occupying forces, the assumption by the UN of its responsibilities, the restoration of the sovereignty of the Iraqi people and the amendments which referred to the illegality of the invasion of Iraq and the lack of proof of the existence of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that only the members of the European United Left (45) voted in favour of these amendments, while 420 voted against and 68 abstained, demonstrates just how hypocritical they all are; while they are making a great show of fighting for the rights of the Iraqi people, they bless its occupation, oppression and plundering in practice.</p>

<p class="contents">My main reason for doing so was because of the legal uncertainty which is created by the imposition of a patent on software development, particularly when we can see the rapid advance of technology and the new small and medium sized enterprises that are starting up to create software packages specific to certain sectors of industry or business, or merely to create a new game for them to play themselves. All of this could now be prevented because a patent could be placed on the menu option, on the one-click option or in numerous other areas of operation.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Ahern said, some improvements have been made, but the reality is that we have to take into account the experience in the United States which has created multi-million and multi-billion dollar legal suits by large companies against small companies, which have stifled innovation, prevented new invention and prevented job creation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is lamentable that Parliament has bowed to pressure from the USA and, above all, pressure exerted by the major software companies. This is a great disappointment, especially for consumers. It is they who will have to pick up the tab for this decision; for them, it will mean higher prices and less diversity in products, reducing their freedom of choice.</p>
<p class="contents">Software patents stand in the way of a growing, dynamic and diverse European software industry. It is primarily consumers and software users who feel their effects. They increase dependence on software giants, such as Microsoft, which have secured many trivial patents, and quite manifestly curtail freedom of choice, but this is also a grave blow for the development of software in Europe, which is being hampered by the monopolies that are establishing themselves. Not only does this go counter to the interests of consumers, but it also hampers innovation, instead of encouraging competition and diversity in the software market. It is also a real defeat for Europe as a location for business, even though its advocates see it as the very opposite. That will become apparent in the future, and this decision does the utmost damage to the prospect of an open, free and sustainable knowledge-based society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What the Commission is proposing, however, encourages the domination of the software market by monopolies, as small software companies cannot afford disputes about patent rights. Greater protection for patents would enhance the large service providers’ position of strength in the market and would consequently mean that software developers would have to pay fees, in other words, royalties, for a wide variety of standard functions. It is the consumer who will end up paying the bill. The attempt to create greater legal certainty by means of this directive is to be welcomed, but, in this instance, it misses the mark. On the one hand, there is no single definition of the ‘technical contribution’ required for a patent to be granted, and, on the other, it blurs the boundaries between the end product – which can be patented – and the software itself, which cannot. The EU needs patent law that not only encourages innovation, but also gives better protection to inventors who lack financial clout. This proposal from the Commission guarantees neither of these things, and that is why we have voted against it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The majority bloc of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Party of European Socialists, although weakened by the pertinence of the arguments put forward by those who oppose this measure, once again yielded to the demands of major corporations to take the commercialisation of human activity ever further.</p>

<p class="contents">In departing from Article 52 of the European Patent Convention, according to which software is subject to copyright rather than to patenting, the European Patent Bureau in Munich is trying to extend its remit along the lines of the American system.

The European Commission and part of this Parliament want to justify this extended remit with the argument that nothing actually changes in comparison to the present situation.</p>

<p class="contents">A patent must not be reduced to the status of a trophy for whoever gets to the competent authority first with an application for a particular patent. Rather, it should be a reward reserved for those who really have created something new, and an incentive to create more.</p>
<p class="contents">In contravention of the provisions of the European Patent Convention, this proposal for a directive allows for the patentability of ideas implemented by software programs to be authorised.

<p class="contents">While I feel that the financial package should be more generous, I support this initiative, which was unanimously approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.

<p class="contents">I believe, nevertheless, that the delivery of this support should be expeditious, not encumbered by bureaucracy, and that direct assistance to national consumer organisations, including cooperatives, should not be excluded. A clearer distinction should also be drawn between organisations genuinely working to promote consumer interests and those which are merely the mouthpieces of industrial lobbies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If the European Union wants to discharge its obligations under international law to reduce greenhouse gases in line with the Kyoto commitments, this directive on the taxation of energy can be only one of many steps that will end up taking us in the right direction.

This Council compromise, therefore, constitutes a significant step in that direction, since it has brought agreement on a comprehensive energy tax directive, encompassing all forms of energy. The rapporteur, however, has some piercing criticisms of the minimum tax rates agreed, the exemptions and the tax reductions provided for.</p>
<p class="contents">We have grave reservations about this directive. We favour lightening the tax burden on workers, but the solution does not involve so-called ‘environmental taxation’ of energy or pollution. The solution involves finding a new balance of taxation between workers and capital. What is more, this type of indirect taxation is levied, when all is said and done, on the final consumers (users). It is not sensitive to levels of income and penalises lower-income households. The effects of steep tax increases on the productive fabric, especially in the least-favoured regions, should also be assessed.</p>
<p class="contents">The underlying ‘polluter pays’ principle, furthermore, engenders serious reservations, as it permits those with economic clout to generate pollution. That is clear in the liberal philosophy behind emissions trading. The bottom line is that we should not pollute at all. The battle to protect the environment and stop environmental dumping must be fought with appropriate legislation and effective enforcement. This requires a high degree of state intervention and investment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our practice is to fund pensions – to take one example – using employers’ and employees’ contributions, albeit on a participatory basis.</p>
<p class="contents">In the EU, we agreed, at the beginning of the 1990s, to lay down only minimum rates and to retain unanimity in the Council on matters relating to this. Despite the issue’s sensitivity, efforts were made, when this proposal was discussed, to abolish the unanimity principle with effect from 2010. Decisions as important as that are taken while revising the Treaties or the Constitutional Treaty and not when consulting Parliament on a draft directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the taxation of fuel, harmonised minimum rates for Luxembourg (and other Member States) always go hand in hand with an increase in tax, and thus, in fact, with an increase in prices. Although Luxembourg’s specific situation meant that it was allowed a temporary derogation, this is no reason to bring forward from 2010 to 2008 the second phase for the application of the minimum rates. I am sure that the thinking behind the rapporteur’s amendment was that it would benefit the environment if higher fuel prices were to deter consumers from using their own cars.</p>

I hope the Council’s reaction will now be equally constructive, and that there will not be a repeat of the veto which precluded any revision of this very same piece of legislation in 1997. One of the most important objectives of any sustainable development policy is to internalise environmental externalities into the economy. In other words, the price of goods must reflect their real environmental cost. The message sent by the price is essential in order to induce both producers and consumers to realign their choices towards sustainability. That situation is, unfortunately, still a long way off, which is why buying green is still a luxury and selling green is not yet sufficiently profitable. I welcome the rapporteur’s advocacy of more ambitious and binding rules, and in particular of lowering taxes on goods produced using renewable energy sources while raising taxes on fossil fuels for use in transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Member States should adopt measures to discourage early retirement and – together with companies, workers and social partners – encourage active ageing.

It tries to reconcile two disparate elements, insisting on the compatibility of the ‘financial dimension’ and ‘social and welfare aspects’. The report contains a number of apt remarks, in particular, on the situation of women. These good intentions soon, however, become meaningless. The rapporteur seems, in fact, to feel obliged to make emphatic references to the European employment strategy, which is a very bad framework to use in devising the changes to revenue distribution that must accompany demographic change.</p>
<p class="contents">The text sees the reforms under way in many Member States as positive without mentioning that they have inspired massive public opposition amongst the communities affected. Let us concede that with some trepidation the report ‘supports the aim…of increasing the effective retirement age’. We reject this objective, all the more so because it is the only one which is specifically advanced, on the basis of which all future ‘reforms’ should be organised. We will challenge these reforms for millions of employees and we will oppose a simple measure, an increase in employer contributions.

<p class="contents">We clearly have to ensure that all the Member States banish from their pensions systems discrimination on the grounds of gender. They ought to have done so ever since the directives in the 1970s on equal treatment for women and men in social security matters. With variations from one country to another, women receive between 16% and 45% less in their pensions than do men.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of those women retiring now, that results from, among other things, the fact that they, in their younger days, were, quite legally, entitled only to between 80% and 90% of the wages paid to men with the same qualifications. This discrimination lives on, in that women suffer from it to the end of their lives. Just as I had suggested, the report also makes reference to the problem of social protection for divorced women. As long ago as 1993, Parliament had adopted, on my initiative, a report on the pension entitlements of women who were divorced or living separately from their partners.</p>

Together, we provided for our future, for security at a stage in life when people are no longer productive. These days, the opinion is peddled that pension commitments are a burden on society whereby the elderly exploit the younger generations. This is not only a result of the changing population pyramid which is becoming much narrower than before, because there are fewer younger people at the bottom and more elderly at the top. It also has to do with short-term thinking, with the encouragement of individual egocentricity and with the advent of individual pension schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">Often, young people do not realise that they will live much beyond their productivity peak. Also, they often do not realise that people suffer exhaustion faster because work has increasingly become a form of top-class sport. So much productivity is being required from people that many are physically or mentally burnt out long before they reach the pensionable age. In many cases, employers do not want to employ people over the age of 55. However, people who are older than 55 are often very useful in voluntary work, in an advisory role or as childminders. Given these circumstances, it is more obvious to lower, rather than increase, the pensionable age. To refuse a pension to people who can no longer cope with the pressure at work creates problems that cannot be solved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission’s analysis covers the adequacy of pension systems, their financial sustainability and the need for modernisation. It goes without saying that I welcome the rapporteur’s conclusion that the Member States have already started their reform processes, and that a number of them have put major reforms into practice. This, I am happy to say, is the case in Portugal. There is also a clear awareness of the need for further reforms in order to safeguard the long-term sustainability of pension systems, which is linked to sound public finances.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that it is of the essence to eliminate from this debate any demagogic and stormy rhetoric styling itself as the ‘champion of workers’ rights’. The unsustainability of many national pension systems is due to demographic change, and we may be sure that it will indubitably do serious and – unless something is done to stop it – irreparable harm to all retired workers, both now and in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the rapporteur, I welcome the close cooperation between Member States in this area. Moreover, because I agree with most of his conclusions relating to three fundamental objectives – adequacy, financial sustainability and the modernisation of pension systems – I voted in favour of the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following on from what was said yesterday, I would like again to urge the bureau to give some attention to the question of how MEPs are to be guaranteed adequate access when exercising their right to vote.

It presents as a ‘constitution’ a text which not only fails to safeguard democratic achievements, but also, as we have repeatedly denounced, adds new links to the chains of the Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice which big business has used to bind the workers in the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The institutionalisation of the market economy, the further militarisation of the ΕU, in cooperation with ΝΑΤΟ, which goes as far as preventive intervention on the pretext of terrorist threat, the redistribution of power for the benefit of the powerful and the even greater transfer of national sovereignty to the international centre are just some of the ‘gifts’ which the Intergovernmental Conference is to offer the monopolies. The new venture is in total keeping with current policies, the undermining of workers' achievements, the successive terrorist laws and the interventions against peoples the world over. Nor can we fail to note that the anti-democratic procedure followed when drafting the text is being promoted as a standard of democracy and transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">The Communist Party of Greece is categorically opposed to the introduction of a European constitution which strengthens the imperialist ΕU.

As we have complained in the past, the undemocratic methods and processes by which the Convention was constituted helped produce a text to which we are flatly opposed, since we disagree with the social project it advocates. Under the terms of this text, an increasingly aggressive form of capitalism will become entrenched, society will be structured along neoliberal lines, everything will be commercialised and people will become increasingly devalued. The social aspects which the text promised to defend will become secondary, and we will slide further down the road mapped out in the Treaties of Maastricht and Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a real attack on the principles of the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic. It is a threat to sovereignty, not only in legal and institutional terms, but also in concrete areas of citizens’ fundamental rights and freedoms. It is an attempt to consign any chance of alternative routes to European integration to the dustbin of history.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of selecting as absolute priorities the quest for peace, development, and economic and social cohesion, based on high levels of social welfare for all, this text defines peace as a mere possibility and not as a fundamental objective. It embraces the profoundly militaristic NATO route, tied to United States imperialism.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the next Intergovernmental Conferences should reject the Convention’s proposal and find alternative ways of giving a positive response to today’s problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Why, then, did I decide to vote for this resolution that I do not like?

Certainly, this exclusion gratifies the Spanish nationalism of Mr Gil-Robles, but does not match in any way with what Mr Tsatsos wrote after the Treaty of Nice: 'The EU must steer a cause between the opposite poles of effectiveness and legitimacy, a balance which takes account of its <span class="italic">raison d'être</span> as Union of peoples and states'.</p>

This draft has no legitimacy because it is not the outcome of the will of Europe’s citizens and the Convention was nothing but a mockery of democratic debate. Neither those who drafted it nor the decision-makers were mandated by the people or by universal suffrage. The views of ‘civil society’ were certainly given a hearing but there was never any question of involving the citizens in the drafting process. The most important aspect, however, is that this Treaty represents the constitutionalisation of a liberal, pro-Nato, militarist and antisocial Europe, which is opposed to secularism, social rights, public services and the interests of the workers. We now refuse to give an Intergovernmental Conference the right to decide for us all.</p>
<p class="contents">The stakes, however, are high. This European constitution for 450 million citizens will take precedence over national constitutions. The container and the contents concern us all. What is really needed is a different type of process, in other words, holding binding referendums on the same day throughout the Union in order to ensure that Europe has a different, more progressive draft Constitution. The best way of opposing this free-market Europe is by mobilising the citizens, and this will happen in particular at the European Social Forum, which will take place at Saint-Denis in November of this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The extension of majority voting to a range of areas is, in an ever-expanding EU, something to be welcomed.

Why announce now something that is due to happen in 2009? I am glad that this passage, which was present in the first draft, has now disappeared.</p>

The really tough points are the confirmation of the Council’s power, which hinders parliamentary democracy, the integration of the whole of the EU into NATO and the establishment of the capitalist character of the EU economy. Soon, there will be no more room for a militarily neutral position outside of NATO, as has so far been adopted by Sweden, Finland, Ireland, Austria, Cyprus and Malta. It is not only about defending each other’s territory against outside attackers together, but also about being able to intervene in defence of our own interests outside of NATO’s and the EU’s territories. The constitution also protects freedom of enterprise and ‘free and pure competition’. In neo-liberal Europe, public utility companies in the areas of public transport, postal services, energy and telecommunications are no longer considered to be vital community tasks but are contracted out to profit-seekers. In this way, this constitution will resemble that of Cuba or the former Soviet Union, which also wanted to lay down the form of their economy and protect it from democratic decisions about change. If Europe is to have a constitution, then this is the wrong text. There needs to be a referendum on this subject in every Member State. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Even in its present form, however, the Constitution contains elements that are important in terms of Europe’s Christian heritage, in that the preamble refers to Europe’s religious inheritance, and the Christian conception of mankind becomes one of the Constitution’s important foundations through the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Article 51 of the draft Treaty, moreover, gives explicit recognition to the status of the churches and non-confessional organisations. So the Constitution includes important features relating to Europe’s religious heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">By means of its amendment, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats sought to add another important dimension to these elements. It is now for the Intergovernmental Conference, and hence for the Member States, to take on board this proposal and add it to the draft Constitution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A very complex institutional structure is, by definition, not secular but conceived for the priests of bureaucracy that control everyday life: life that cannot be controlled and cannot function.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst not denying that there has been progress in the current situation, it is in internal and related affairs. There have, however, also been steps backwards such as the inclusion of Article 51(I), the declaration annexed to the Treaty, which confirms the status of religious bureaucracies too. In fact, it obliges the EU to maintain regular dialogue with churches, thus violating the principle of secularism, the principle of separation between public institutions and religious organisations. In this way the power of churches to interfere is sanctioned, and this is likely to constitute an obscurantist obstacle to the European citizens’ right to decide freely on questions of ethics and science. Furthermore, the EU is prevented from examining or reconsidering the situation of churches in the Member States, and so the preservation of privileges that are enjoyed by churches thanks to the agreements signed with Franco in Spain, Mussolini in Italy, Salazar in Portugal and Hitler in Germany is guaranteed.</p>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, as a Member from Catalonia, a stateless nation which currently has a limited Statute of Autonomy within the framework of the Spanish state, I cannot accept the deficiencies in the future Constitutional text, particularly in relation to two specific aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, the territories with legislative powers have no clear, recognised system for participating in the EU’s policy-making. Neither is it established that those regions have the possibility of bringing cases before the Court of Justice when its competences may be affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, neither does the future European Constitution provide for the incorporation into the Union’s linguistic system of those languages which have official status in part of the territory of a Member State, as in the case of Catalan.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that in the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) the governments of the Member States will modify the text so that it is brought closer to the reality of today’s Europe in relation to the aspects I have mentioned.</p>
