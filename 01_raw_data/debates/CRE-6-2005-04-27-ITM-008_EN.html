The presence here today of MEPs that belong to the Roma community serves to highlight the importance of this role.</p>
<p class="contents">The fundamental rights upon which the European Union is founded include the principle of non-discrimination. The Roma must be given the chance to participate fully in economic, social and political life, and so we must work together to overcome the centuries of prejudice, discrimination and social exclusion they have suffered. This is an immense task, and it will require us to take coordinated action in a number of fields, in particular those of education, employment, housing and social services. The responsibility for finding a solution to these issues will mainly lie with national bodies and with regional and local authorities, as the latter are where the Roma are most likely to be represented. Although both civil society and the Roma themselves have an important part to play, the situation of the Roma is a European issue that calls for an EU solution. This solution may take various forms.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is actively monitoring the situation of the Roma in both the European Union and the candidate countries. As part of the preparations for accession, the situation of the Roma and of other minorities is assessed in relation to the political criteria. The Vienna-based European Monitoring Centre pays particular attention to this issue when carrying out research into manifestations of racism and xenophobia in the European Union. A binding legal framework has been established by the EU with the aim of combating discrimination on the basis of race or ethnic origin, and Community regulations currently in force prohibit direct or indirect discrimination in employment, education, social protection, property matters and services. The Commission is working to ensure that these regulations are transposed into national law, and it also backs cultural and educational measures, including special measures for organisations working with the Roma.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union provides substantial funding for measures promoting inclusion of the Roma community. During preparations for accession, over EUR 100 million was allocated under the PHARE programme to projects targeted at the Roma, and the Commission actively helps national bodies to utilise structural funds to promote inclusion of the Roma and other disadvantaged groups. Several other Community programmes encourage exchanges of experience and support specific projects in the fields of employment, education, vocational training and research within the EU and in a number of third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is keen to ensure that the situation of the Roma is taken into account in all EU programmes and policies that could be significant in this context. To this end, a group has been set up comprising representatives of all the relevant Directorates-General, with the aim of exchanging best practices, coordinating policies and engaging in dialogue with participants from outside the institutions. At the group’s latest meeting, an exchange of information took place with an MEP from the Roma community. The Commission also cooperates with other international organisations working to promote inclusion of the Roma, and is in regular contact with the Council of Europe, the OECD, the World Bank and other major players.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union set itself ambitious goals in the Lisbon Strategy relating to the creation of more jobs, social cohesion and sustainable development. The fact that a large number of our fellow citizens are socially excluded because they belong to the Roma community threatens our ability to achieve these goals. Combating the social exclusion of the Roma in the name of fundamental rights, social cohesion and the social and economic development of the EU is a task for all of us. The Commission wishes to thank Parliament for its support and efforts in this connection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Pervasive anti-Roma sentiment in Europe and daily discrimination thwart our full and equal participation in the social and economic life of Europe, and of the countries we deem our homeland. Several international organisations have launched programmes within the last few years with the aim to reduce anti-Roma discrimination and to help the Romas’ full social integration. However, there has not been a standard European guideline or answer to these pressing issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament’s five-party motion for a resolution and Commissioner Vladimir Spidla’s current standpoint on the subject establish milestones in this regard. This resolution witnesses various political forces united in mutual commitment to jointly combat the prevailing anti-Roma sentiment and structured discrimination, it urges equal opportunities in the fields of work, education, housing, healthcare and participation in political life.</p>
<p class="contents">Following EU accession, social discrimination against the Roma continues in the new Member States, even as it does in the existing ones. This alone confirms that the EU institutions need to continue their roles of constant monitoring and examination of human rights. The forceful manifestation of Roma rights in Europe must mean that the Copenhagen political criteria are uniformly implemented in the existing and the new Member States and also in the Candidate Countries. One of the most pressing issues facing the disadvantaged Roma minority is finding employment. Reintegration of the Roma workforce is of great importance, and short-term, introductory measures must be taken in order to expedite Roma employment. Fifteen percent of the recently increased EU population is affected by poverty, and 9% live in long-term and extreme privation. These indicators reveal a much worse situation in the case of the new Member States. It is also apparent that there is a significant number of Romas among people living in long-term extreme poverty and the rate of unemployment in the Roma population often hits or even exceeds 80%.</p>
<p class="contents">Achieving the strategic goals of Lisbon would undoubtedly have a positive influence on the life of Romas and conscious, determined political integration would definitely promote the success of the Lisbon strategy as well. The Lisbon strategy will not attain its goals unless definite steps are taken and real effort is made to advance Roma integration into mainstream society. The European Commission’s stronger and stronger political commitment must manifest itself in real action guided by professionalism, and also in the establishment of a coherent minority protection system, which promotes, in every aspect, the integration of the European Roma population. The European Parliament must act as a minority-oriented institution, and along with civil organisations and the governing bodies of the Member States, it must work conjointly with the Commission as its primary ally. We hope that the EP resolution on the situation of the Roma people in Europe will serve as a professional basis for the European Commission and also for national governments taking measures in this regard. Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues from all five parties and our advisers and civil organisations for taking an active part in drafting this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although no census of this population has been made, their number is estimated at around eight million scattered throughout Europe. The Roma are victims of discrimination, marginalisation and segregation in all fields of public and private life, including access to the civil service, education, employment, health services and housing, not to mention when crossing borders and in access to asylum procedures. That discrimination is no longer a problem for the Roma alone, but is of concern to all Europeans, and we must show solidarity to improve their living conditions. We must of course strongly condemn all discrimination to which the Roma are subject, but we must also allow them access to decent housing, education, medical services and social protection. We really must do everything possible to see that they are not forced to leave their countries because of the deplorable living conditions they have to endure there, which may go as far as persecution.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must recognise the Roma minority as such so that it can give them the means to fight against all forms of discrimination. That is why we are asking the Commission for an action plan that will make clear recommendations to the Member States and the candidate countries for a better economic integration, yes, but also social and political integration of all the Roma in Europe. We have been talking about it for a long time and it is high time for action. The situation has gone on for long enough. The rights of the Roma must go beyond access to decent living conditions. Europe is the cradle of multiculturalism. The promotion of Roma culture will play an important part in the fight against discrimination, racism and xenophobia. They must be able to remain at home if they want to, they must not be chased along the roads; that is important, it is essential for all of us. It is our duty to act and to act quickly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union, the European Parliament and every other body that controls, passes and amends regulations often criticises human rights outside the EU’s borders. On the other hand, it is a historic moment, because this is the first document that criticises human rights within the EU, with regard to Romas. This type of political mood, developing in Parliament for the first time in its history, is significant because discrimination against the Roma within the EU no longer needs to be a taboo subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the disability index is 60% on average in the twenty-five Member States. This means that on average, 60% of children who are declared mentally disabled are Roma. We have not only forfeited the child’s chance of further education, but also put him or her in a situation that he or she will never be able to get out of, and thus we practically seal the child’s fate at age seven. Housing problems, dislodgement, compulsory sterilisation, segregated labour rooms, and numerous other means of discriminatory cases that even the resolution lists in various paragraphs, are not at all surprising within the EU and I deliberately do not mention specific countries here.</p>
<p class="contents">Promoting political participation is another important role of the Union, the deficiency of which is dealt with significantly in some paragraphs. Today, Roma population in the EU is approximately 7-8 million with only two representatives here in Parliament based on our ethnic origin. I am very proud of my country, as both of us come from Hungary. However, there are no other Roma political representatives from any other country in the Commission, or in any other EU institution.</p>
<p class="contents">This participation gap must be closed, not only in the EU, which is mainly our task, but also on the level of national governments, so that in addition to EU directives and guidelines that define the strategic policies of individual countries in this matter, the national governments should also feel that this responsibility is shared by every part of society in all of Europe. It is not up to the Roma to solve this issue, since it is not they who consider that their children are disabled; it is not Roma women who want to have their ovaries cut out.</p>
<p class="contents">According to public opinion polls, it is in Europe where Romas feel most European. This statement is not at all surprising, as Roma people are no longer able to believe their own government in any country, especially in Central Eastern Europe. Term after term, different political parties keep replacing each other, but none of the governing political parties have been able to provide a solution to this problem and eliminate discrimination, for instance.

Since enlargement is an ongoing process, in future the EU will host up to 12 or 15 million Roma. For thousands of years the Roma have been living in diaspora, but being united in the EU they become our fellow citizens. The European Union means an end to years of war and the beginning of cooperation. But how can we cooperate when people are excluded?</p>
<p class="contents">Mostly, the Roma issue is connected with unemployment and a lack of education, healthcare and housing. However, the core issue is racism against Roma, more specifically anti-Gypsyism or Roma-phobia. Can we accept a situation where millions of our fellow citizens lack basic human rights and suffer from police harassment, where thousands of school children remain illiterate and the unemployment rate exceeds 70%, where attempts are made at ethnic cleansing by poisoning people and trafficking in women and children, including in western EU countries, which, contrary to the 1951 Geneva Convention on refugees, also expel Roma refugees?</p>
<p class="contents">The Roma also face a lack of political participation, as a result of which there are not enough Roma representatives to draw attention to their issues. Today’s practice is not only a human tragedy: the Roma have been turned into a political tool. What happened to the millions of dollars and euros donated by the US and the EU to Eastern European countries for Roma projects?</p>
<p class="contents">Structures set up for the purpose of helping the cause of the Roma often use this cause as a pretext. In reality most of the money is spent on salaries, trips and on buying citizens, administrators and politicians. This process is defined as corruption, but actually it is manipulation. There are people in this world who do not want a dynamic Europe; they practice a policy of divide and rule by maintaining poverty and establishing control over Eastern European countries. The Roma, Europe’s largest and most vulnerable minority, are, against their will, victims and participants in this global game.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore also necessary from a purely political point of view to reinforce the Roma population. Their political participation in elections is important. We have to target Roma as voters and as candidates at all political levels. The Roma-to-Roma approach, as developed by the OSCE, is another effective way of consolidating the Roma’s position. All European organisations should start hiring Roma for Roma and non-Roma related jobs – I have a Roma assistant.</p>

<p class="contents">A delegation of Roma from several Italian cities – who have been here for two days to meet Members and increase awareness among them – told me the news as soon as they heard it: they were saddened but stated that, unfortunately, such events continue to occur. Where do they occur? In Italy, in the heart of Old Europe, where these people – the majority of whom have not been Travellers for some time – are concentrated in camps without water, electricity or services.</p>
<p class="contents">One of them said today, ‘The first time I ever slept in a container was when I arrived in Italy; I had a house where I came from.’ The rights of the European Union end at the edges of the Travellers’ camps, and the Italian Government continues to rid itself – that is the term to use – of the Roma population through collective expulsions.</p>
<p class="contents">In such a situation it is impossible to educate the children and to make them attend school. There are young people 20 years old who were born in Italy and who do not have an Italian identity card. Recently, other children born in Italy have been considered to have a Yugoslav nationality, without knowing which one, as it no longer even exists. Many Roma citizens residing in my country have an identity card – when they do have one – that bears the address of the Travellers’ camp and, in parentheses, ‘Roma Camp’. It is obvious that they will not succeed in finding work and that they will be increasingly discriminated against, when they are in that situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by saying that tomorrow’s vote is extremely important, but that it will be all the more so if it is put into practice, particularly by the European Commission. Let us not forget that the commissioner who should be attending to this issue is an Italian, Mr Frattini, although in my view he is very much like the monkey that used to say ‘See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.’ </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to point out just one aspect that, in our opinion, is particularly important: in spite of the commitments undertaken by the Commission, including those of recent times, we must nevertheless note that in some Member States and candidate countries young Roma are often segregated in schools for the mentally disabled or sent to classes for children with learning difficulties. This obviously increases their sense of unease and social marginalisation. On the contrary, provision must be made for full access to the ordinary education system, since schools are a prime means of promoting full social integration.</p>

The implementation of various concepts has failed to bring a successful solution to the so-called Roma problem. All the attempts to address it as a social problem ran aground due to cultural differences. The efforts to integrate the Roma community often ended up in the attempts at its assimilation, which also failed. Because of its complexity, the Roma issue is clearly at the intersection of social, ethnic and/or minority problems. No doubt, the problem is not equally severe in all the countries. Thus, there are no Roma in the Baltic countries, but in the southern part of the European Union and in the new Member States, the problem quite often exceeds the capacity of a single country to tackle it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is apparent that in many countries the transformation to market economy has not created a win-win situation for the Roma. A substantial proportion of this minority have joined the ranks of those who did not manage and found it impossible to adjust to the new circumstances. Their unfavourable situation, extreme poverty and high unemployment cannot be accounted for by racial discrimination alone. The problem is very often much broader. It begins with the lack of education. Clearly the worst is the situation of those who live in remote localities, segregated settlements, often without access to school, electricity or running water, and in the regions with very high unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">Slovakia was mentioned a few months ago in connection with the Roma – alleged forced sterilisations of Roma women. I want to repeat what our Deputy Prime Minister said before the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities – that a thorough police investigation proved that these forced and unlawful acts did not occur. At the same time, however, it also revealed that the legislation in this field is outdated and lacks clarity. Concluding, I would like to express my support for the resolution since there are a number of myths about the Roma and their situation, and perhaps even more prejudices, but a lack of real understanding.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that the Roma problem transcends the boundaries of individual states and that it must be addressed as a European problem, just as Commissioner Špidla put it. It is truly necessary to make use of the best experience of individual countries and to channel structural funds to addressing the problem with the participation of Roma themselves – this is really the key point in this regard. I believe that this resolution is an appropriate and necessary step in that direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also very glad that we have plenty of like-minded friends in the other groups, which makes it possible for us, tomorrow, to join together in writing a new chapter in the history of their integration.</p>
<p class="contents">What prompted me to press for us to discuss this issue now was a visit I made, as part of a delegation from this House, to Novi Sad, where, in the course of our investigations into the situation of the Hungarian minority, we saw, on the edge of the city, a district that was home to Roma who had been driven out of Kosovo, and where conditions defied description.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an unfortunate fact that, in all our past conflicts, the Roma were often the first victims. Even in the absence of such conflicts, though, they are in a far from satisfactory position, and that not just in the new Member States – where they are present in greater numbers – but also in many of the old ones. If we want to point the finger at other countries and give them advice on how to treat their minorities, then it is vitally important that we in Europe treat our own minorities accordingly – particularly the Roma, who are the largest of them – by giving them the opportunity to integrate and break the terrible vicious circle that sees many of them less well-educated, sometimes forced into segregated schools, with this lack of education meaning that they have less chance of getting a job and that their earning capacity is reduced. In turn, lower incomes mean more health problems, and so the vicious circle goes on. Together, we have to break it.</p>
<p class="contents">Some time ago, I proposed the appointment of a Commissioner with specific responsibility for minority issues and for the Roma’s problems in particular. Although nothing has been done about this, I am confident that the Roma issue is safe in Commissioner Špidla’s hands. I would follow Mrs Roure in asking him to include, in the Commission communication for which we are calling, not only a description of how things are, but also of how they could be, of what improvements might be made even without much in the way of power at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">You very rightly said, Commissioner, that this is a European problem and that we have to find a European answer to it, not only at European level, but also, of course, in the nation states. If our cooperation in this House helps us, tomorrow and by way of this resolution, to give some impetus to the process of finding one, we will have taken an important step.</p>
<p class="contents">It is your help, Commissioner, and that of the Commission, that will enable us to achieve a real and perceptible improvement over the next 10 years in the integration of the Roma and Sinti in Europe.</p>

It was at one time possible for people to move freely around Europe, with a lifestyle and culture of their own free choosing. The 20th century, alas, was marked by the attempted wholesale extermination of certain peoples. During the German occupation of Bohemia and Moravia there were two concentration camps for Roma, one at Lety in Southern Bohemia, and the other at Hodonin, near Kunstat in Moravia.</p>
<p class="contents">Considered in terms of human rights, politics, morality and simple humanity, a pig farm strikes us as an absolutely unworthy occupant, for the past 40 years, of the site of the former concentration camp at Lety. A place where many thousands of people, many of them children, suffered, and where hundreds of them died, must no longer be allowed to be the scene of such degradation. Of the approximately 6 000 Roma and Sinti who lived in the protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia in 1942, only some 600 returned home in 1945 from the concentration and extermination camps. That amounts to one tenth of them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is because this is now no longer merely a problem for the Czech authorities, but rather a problem for Europe, that we are calling for this piggery to be relocated and for a memorial worthy of the victims of Nazism to be erected on the site of the former concentration camp. This was the theme of an exhibition we mounted last week in this House. I have documentation on the subject with me now. I would ask you to back this call, and thank all the groups in this House for their cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like every ethnocultural minority in the Union – whether native minorities, such as the Sardinians, Corsicans, Basques or Gaels, or legal immigrants – the Roma ethnic group also deserves every consideration. Precisely like the communities mentioned, however, the Roma community must also be subject to the rules of social coexistence and of mutual respect for the social order.</p>

I think the question of the Roma minority reaches well beyond constitutional state borders and their situation must be resolved at a European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday afternoon a forum was convened, the European Parliament Roma Forum, attended by Roma people who are regularly at a disadvantage and face discrimination, who live locked behind barbed wire, or have no water, gas or electricity in their homes and who are not able to have their children educated. Many members of the European Parliament and some representatives of other authorities, who believe that this situation of continual discrimination must be resolved with joint effort, participated in this extraordinary European Roma Forum. We decided to establish a European monitoring and follow-up system on discrimination and also to introduce a database which contains instances of prejudice against the Roma. We would like to ask for the Commissioner’s help in setting up such a discrimination monitoring system so that this forum can influence public opinion accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">We think that the EU, civil organisations, private persons and representatives have made a great deal of effort, but very often a lot of these efforts have not been coordinated. It is very important that the Commissioner and Parliament coordinate these different types of effort, which are not necessarily in parallel, in order to act more efficiently and effectively, and in order to provide some form of human rights protection for Europe’s largest minority in a more efficient way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is brought into sharp relief in this debate on the Roma. We have a situation where this group will certainly be the biggest minority after the next enlargement. There is consensus – apart from with the last speaker but one perhaps – that something must be done.</p>
<p class="contents">So what must be done? Mrs Bauer talked about the deep complexity of this problem. The fact is that we in this House are already able to point to those things that we can do, but that Member States will not do. For example, there is the race equality directive. I have seen cases of Roma people bringing employment discrimination cases in their own countries, but there are so few as to make this meaningless. We have in this House legislation already on the table that is not being implemented by Member States. It is certainly not being implemented in the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">With Mr Agnoletto this morning, I met members of the Roma community from Italy. As is the case of my own country, the United Kingdom, the diaspora of the Roma in so-called Old Europe are suffering as much if not more than in the new countries, because they are suffering the extra degradation of being immigrants and Roma.</p>
<p class="contents">We must address both issues. This is a unified struggle and – apart from one speaker with whom I and many of us absolutely disagree – I want to place on record that the problem is so complex that there should be an all-party move on this resolution, signed and supported by all parties, that we cannot live in a European Union where children from one ethnic minority are segregated in school, sent to school with people who supposedly have mental disabilities. That is not the European Union I want to live in and we have the instruments in this House to ensure that Member States start to act. I look forward to hearing whether the Commissioner will take urgent action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Who are the Roma, and what do we mean by this term? Are they an ethnic group, as stated in the motion for a resolution, or a stateless nation? If we agree that they are an ethnic group, consisting of citizens of all the EU Member States, then the solution to these problems is relatively straightforward. After all, each Member State has to ensure that its citizens enjoy the same rights and are treated equally, without being subjected to discrimination or xenophobia. We should bear in mind, however, that as well as rights, citizens also have certain duties, towards both the country they live in and the other people who live there. If we understand the Roma to be a stateless nation, then things start to look a great deal worse, if not hopeless. We must ask ourselves who is to defend this nation, as the answer to this question would be a starting point from which we could find a solution to the problems. The debate on this issue has recently become more heated because two new countries, Romania and Bulgaria, are in the process of joining the European Union. Romania is generally considered to be the Roma’s main homeland, although they originally come from the distant land of India. For over 600 years, the Roma have either not wanted to or not been able to assimilate into society in the countries in which they live. Feelings of mutual animosity have become more pronounced during this time, rather than less so. Even though many different measures have been taken to narrow the gap in development, education and standard of living that exists between the Roma and the rest of the population, this gap is in fact widening. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Like everyone else, I welcome the debate on the Roma in the EU. I also welcome all Roma as members of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of the ban on discrimination in the first article of the UN Charter, 12 to 15 million Roma are in a vulnerable position. The EU’s seven to nine million Roma, a number equivalent to the Swedish population, are to be found in the majority of EU Member States, but no country properly recognises the group as its largest ethnic minority. Worryingly enough, discrimination is also on the increase. Since the year 2000, when Sweden ratified the Council of Europe’s Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, the Roma group has been recognised in Sweden and the Roma language, Romany, is a recognised minority language in Sweden, but that is not enough to end the Roma’s exclusion. The whole of the EU must protect the Roma’s position and, in particular, the vulnerable position of women and children. We must join with Roma women in integrating them and their children into our gender equality policy, particularly as it relates to the protection of reproductive and sexual health, promotion of family planning, education for children and girls and increased participation in political decision-making.</p>
<p class="contents">I listened to Commissioner Špidla’s report, for which I thank him. Given that matters relating to the Roma are the responsibility of the whole of the EU, I should like to ask him, as the Commissioner responsible for equality, if there is anything more we can do specifically in terms of women’s and children’s rights and in terms of combating exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">I applaud the resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vladimír Špidla,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(CS)</span> In my opinion, the debate we have just held was an exceptionally wide-ranging one. It covered such issues as the status of the Roma as an ethnic group, discrimination against this group and the social and political position of the Roma from a number of angles. I believe that we heard a very broad spectrum of opinions, or rather points of view, and that this will provide us with a sound basis for further considerations on the resolution tabled by this House. The issues raised during the debate highlight the importance and urgency of measures to promote the social inclusion of the Roma at European, national and regional level. The backing of Parliament – and I regard your initiative as extremely important – will help us to mobilise all stakeholders and to drum up the necessary political will. The fact that members of the Roma community are present in this Chamber as MEPs is of particular benefit, as this provides us with a starting point of sorts for a European debate on the real lives and circumstances of Roma communities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue its efforts to ensure that all the relevant policies and programmes are conducted in a coherent and effective manner in order to promote inclusion of the Roma and of other disadvantaged groups. We must carry out a more in-depth analysis of both the real needs of the various groups and the areas where action at European level can provide added value. In my opinion, it would be helpful for the Commission to be given advice on such matters by a group of leading figures and experts, and I will give some thought to the best way in which such a group could be set up. I will also suggest to President Barroso that a debate on the situation of the Roma should be held at one of the forthcoming meetings of the Group of Commissioners on fundamental rights, non-discrimination and equal opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">2007 will be declared the European Year of Equal Opportunities. A number of measures will be implemented by the Commission, and the Roma issue will obviously also be given its due weight.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s debate has given rise to a number of historical reflections and asides. In my opinion, it would be fitting to remind ourselves that the history of the Roma in Europe has been one of persecution, and that this persecution has frequently been inconceivably cruel. According to a decree issued by the Austrian Emperor Leopold I in the late 17th century – and I paraphrase – any Roma who crossed the boundaries of a village should be killed, and this also meant children. Punishment awaited anyone who failed to take such drastic action. Europe’s history is a very cruel one in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the speakers said that the European Union is the Roma’s only hope. I do not believe that I would have used the word ‘only’ myself, as there are unquestionably a great many other organisations and political endeavours. Nevertheless, we can be proud of the fact that the European Union has set an example in the field of equal opportunities and human rights, in spite of all our imperfections and inconsistency, and in spite of all the work we still have ahead of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
