<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Buffet,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council. – (FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking you for devoting this morning to sport. In eight days’ time, the Olympic Games will be opening in Sydney. Athletes will be gathered there from all over the planet. The results of the various competitions are not yet known; they are not predestined; in sport, anything can happen.</p>
<p class="contents">The champions who are preparing to enter this field of dreams have their own schedules. Many are familiar with the world of professional sport, but, as you well know, all of them have at least two things in common. Firstly, their selection is the climax of several years of effort and of meticulous training, with volunteers, coaches and public and private resources all mobilised on their behalf. Secondly, and most importantly, they all began their sporting careers in an amateur club or at a school.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to promote sport, we must also – at the same time and as part of the same effort – promote local amateur clubs alongside top-level amateur and professional sport. Sport at the highest level is the stuff of dreams; it contributes to the development of mass sports and, through them, to social education. Elite sport, be it amateur or professional, receives global media coverage today. More and more men and women, whatever their age and their circumstances, are taking part in a sport. Sport has permeated the whole of society.</p>
<p class="contents">So, nobody here will be surprised to see how this human activity can sometimes be perverted by acts of violence or racism, or engender greed. Far be it for me to demonise the economic aspect of sport. Sport needs resources, and the public purse cannot provide all the necessary funding. It is not a matter of distinguishing between a pure form of sport which is untainted by money and a sponsored form of sport which is corrupt. No, the real question is a different one and may be expressed as follows: will the sporting community have the means to preserve the ethics of sport by harnessing the funds that flow into sport and ensuring that money does not rule sport?</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not beat about the bush. This problem is not one that will arise in twenty years’ time; it is already a problem today. Sporting events have become so attractive that financial interests seek to use them as a source of profits, even if it means sacrificing the ethics of sport and treating sportspeople as marketable commodities. Who has not witnessed the sale and purchase of sportsmen, some of whom are still very young? Who has not been shocked by the amounts that are paid for broadcasting rights or by the size of certain transfer fees? Who has not been alarmed at the sight of increasingly overcrowded sporting calendars? Who has not been concerned at the plans of certain private groups to create their own sports competitions, outside the jurisdiction of the national and international federations and on the basis of a single criterion, namely the size of the participating clubs’ budgets, as we have recently seen in association football and, subsequently, in basketball too?</p>
<p class="contents">What kind of sport do we want for the twenty-first century? The reply to this all-embracing, fundamental question depends on our response to the present situation. There are two options: having identified these excesses, we could consider that sport no longer depends on anything but the market or sportspeople on anything but their added value. In that case, we must apply the rules of competition and compound the present follies with a dose of deregulation, accepting, in the name of freedom of movement, the sale and purchase of youngsters aged between 18 and 20. The other option is to decide, on the basis of the European sporting tradition that has been developed in modern times, with its humanist values and voluntary structures, and in the light of the present situation, with all its economic and social implications, that we should re-equip the sporting community with the legal and political instruments it requires to protect the entire range of sporting activities within the framework of their respective federations.</p>
<p class="contents">This second option, which is supported by the French Presidency, does not mean adhering to the status quo, but actually requires innovative proposals from the sporting community itself – and I am gratified to see that these have been forthcoming on the question of transfers – and from governments with a view to combating the excesses that are affecting the sporting world and to developing practices designed to protect the associations and, hence, the cohesion of each sport.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has already devoted a huge volume of work to this option, and we are starting to move forward within the Council too. In June 1997, the sports ministers met at the Stade de France in Paris, and this was followed by meetings in Germany, Finland and Portugal. There have been the annex to the Treaty of Amsterdam, the conclusions of the Vienna Council and, last December, the Helsinki report on the subject of sport. Then, at Feira in Portugal, on the occasion of the Council meeting in June 2000, a clear call was made for the specific characteristics of sport to be taken into account in the application of Community policies.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the wish of the French Presidency that we should succeed in defining precisely what these specific characteristics are and what their recognition implies. To be absolutely precise, it is a matter of recognising that sport is rooted in the everyday practice of millions of men, women and children, in the commitment of hundreds of thousands of volunteers; that it is an irreplaceable instrument of informal education, of social inclusion, of access to citizenship; that sport is, above all, a means by which the individual can grow and flourish and can encounter other people in a spirit of mutual respect. Sport forms a whole. We need cohesion throughout the Union. I am delighted that this is emphasised in the report prepared by Mr Mennea and adopted by the Commission. This approach is the basis on which my counterparts in the other fourteen Member States and I have been working, in close collaboration with Commissioner Viviane Reding. After two meetings of the working parties established by the Portuguese Presidency, a meeting of the Troika, and a great many bilateral contacts with my counterparts from the other Member States, here are some of the objectives that seem to have attracted the broadest consensus within the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The first question concerns the protection of under-age sportspeople. We must be able to put an end to commercial transactions involving minors. Specific measures should be taken to protect the health of young athletes, especially to prevent any recourse to performance-enhancing drugs, and to ensure that they complete their education and vocational training. To that end, the subject has been placed on the agenda of the Council of Youth Ministers for its meeting on 9 November. I am very hopeful that, having regard to the 1994 Directive on the protection of young people at work, we shall be able to offer the prospect of precise recommendations on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I also wish to see measures taken to maintain the development policies of sports clubs. Sports federations and governments should be able, if they so wish, to take appropriate measures to protect the clubs that develop young talent. It must be possible to insert provisions such as a clause requiring young players to sign their first professional contract with the club where they have received youth training, perhaps with compensation proportionate to the cost of their training to indemnify the latter club if such a player is transferred. At the same time, the international sports authorities have a responsibility to take action to control club management in order to avoid excesses, especially in relation to transfers.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, in the wider context, it seems to me that there is an urgent need to recognise the unique central role played by the federations. I believe it is necessary to acknowledge the key role of the sports federations in organising sports competitions, in formulating the rules of their respective sports and in awarding titles. This does not mean that I advocate vesting these rights in the federations without demanding anything from them in return. That is why I envisage that the recognition of these exclusive rights should be accompanied by the imposition on sports federations of precise duties and responsibilities relating to their obligation to serve the public interest and to redistribute their commercial revenue equitably.</p>
<p class="contents">Identifying the specific features of sport is an enormously complex undertaking. Significant progress in this direction is a matter of urgency. I believe we are caught up in a race against the clock. France has decided to make this a priority of its presidency. I have great faith in the contribution that will come from your Parliament. I have taken note, by the way, of your call for the inclusion of an article in the Treaty and see it as a manifestation of your will to ensure that due consideration is given to these concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn now to the fight against doping, which is an absolute priority issue. I am also aware that the European Parliament shares this concern, as your reports and resolutions show. You know that it is a long and arduous struggle, one which has to be waged relentlessly for the sake of public health and the sporting ethic. Recent events show that we still have a long way to go. Be that as it may, I refuse to join the defeatists who want us to throw in the towel on the grounds that drugs are endemic in sport today. We need to enlist the support of the sporting community, but there is an equal need to enlist the support of governments and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The World Anti-Doping Agency that has now been created owes its existence to the will of the European Union. The International Olympic Committee has established the objectives of its fight against the use of drugs at the Olympic Games in Sydney. Nevertheless, as you know, a debate is raging across the Member States of the European Union on the expediency of direct EU membership of the organs of the World Anti-Doping Agency and, hence, on whether the EU should help to fund the agency. I wish to lay particular emphasis on this point, because it has emerged from our exchanges with the European Commission that the latter will not commit itself to the participation of the European Union as such unless it receives a strong and unanimous political signal in favour of participation.</p>
<p class="contents">I, for my part, believe that we have the legal basis for participation. Doping is unquestionably a matter of public health. One need only consider the increase in the consumption of performance-enhancing drugs by young amateur sportspeople. It also has to do with the fight against trafficking and, thus, with police and customs cooperation. Lastly, the struggle against doping also relates to the development of research.</p>
<p class="contents">As is proposed in the report prepared by Mrs Zabell and adopted by the parliamentary committee, the aim would be for the European Union to be able to speak positively, with one voice, in order to guarantee the effectiveness of the Agency. While we await the resolution of the legal questions regarding the involvement of the European Union in the Agency, my Troika colleagues and I have established a liaison committee, which will be very useful. There will also be a need to ensure that the Agency grows in stature so that it has the power to act in every country. Public opinion, sportswomen, sportsmen and everyone who is interested in these Games expect these decisions to be taken. The credibility of the anti-doping effort depends on it.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, European sport is at the crossroads. I hope it will continue to be a field of dreams, just as I hope that it will keep giving young people the educational and integrative framework they need – in short, that it will remain a school of life for our children. But the greed that it arouses and the threat that emanates from such greed must be taken seriously. I am convinced that the clear positions you are preparing to adopt through these two reports will be a great asset in this debate. I wish to thank you for that and to tell you how fervently I hope that we shall be able to continue this work together.</p>

I have naturally taken note of Mrs Buffet's statements. Let me also convey to her my sincere thanks for the work that the French Presidency has been doing in the interests of sport and for the solidarity it has demonstrated with the Commission and with Parliament. It is my fervent hope that these efforts by the French Presidency will be rewarded with a very favourable outcome for sport at the European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I shall respond to the report on doping in sport and sport in society at the end of the debate, if I may. For the moment I shall confine myself to a statement on the transfer issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The approach that the Commission has adopted with regard to sport is defined in its Helsinki report. We want sport to have a social function. This report invites the sporting community, the Member States and the European Union to pool their efforts in order to ensure that sport, in its new economic environment, will continue to act as an instrument of education and integration on the basis of its values of fair play, equal opportunities and the pursuit of merit.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that the provisions of Community law, especially those based on the principles of non-discrimination and free movement of persons, as well as the rules of competition, are applicable to sport. It is equally self-evident that, as the declaration annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam emphasises, the European Community recognises the social impact of sport and the importance of dialogue with the sporting community. This is the context, ladies and gentlemen, in which the Commission, under the direct responsibility of my colleague Mario Monti, has been examining several aspects of competition as they relate to sport.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission recognises that the sporting community is free to determine the rules that will ensure the proper administration of their respective sports. The Commission recognises the specific nature of sport in the sense that some degree of equality is needed in competition between players and clubs so as to guarantee the uncertainty of results, which is the very essence of sport, as the Minister has just emphasised. The Commission is investigating only those aspects of sport with a Community dimension and an economic dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the matter of current FIFA rules governing transfers, I must remind you that, back in 1998, following a number of complaints, the Commission questioned the compatibility of the FIFA transfer rules with the rules of competition and sent FIFA a list of grievances. The Commission believes that the FIFA rules on transfers unfairly obstruct freedom of movement. This is especially true of the rules which lay down conditions of transfer on expiry of a player's contract, even though the contract has been duly terminated in accordance with national employment legislation and with its own terms and the contractually agreed financial indemnity has been determined and paid.</p>
<p class="contents">Contrary to what some press articles have been suggesting, the Commission has no intention of simply abolishing the transfer system or of creating a situation in which players would be able to terminate their contracts on a sudden impulse. The Commission, as the Guardian of the Treaties, wishes FIFA to apply a transfer system which complies with the principles of Community law as well as respecting the unique nature of sport. The present system, however, satisfies neither of these criteria. It obstructs competition between clubs as well as players' freedom of movement, it has done nothing to prevent the over-commercialisation of sport or the widening of the gulf between the rich clubs and those with limited financial resources, nor has it prevented players – especially the youngest players – from becoming targets of financial speculation.</p>
<p class="contents">For many years, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has been waiting 'patiently' for FIFA to present a formula that could replace the present system, to offer a basis on which we could work together in search of a universally satisfactory and equitable solution. Mario Monti and I have established contacts with the footballing world. We have made the point that, under national codes of employment legislation, some form of compensation is warranted when a player breaks his contract with one club in order to join another. We have emphasised that, in order to avoid distorting championship competitions, we are naturally disposed to accept rules limiting transfers to particular fixed periods and, above all, we have stressed that efforts made to develop young talent must be encouraged, which means that we can accept a compensation mechanism designed to reflect the expense incurred by a club in the development of young players, provided that such a mechanism does not put young players in a position of undue dependence on their clubs.</p>
<p class="contents">For a number of years, and until a few days ago, we had received no reply. The Commission certainly cannot wait indefinitely, which is why Mario Monti and I have been declaring very plainly over the past few months that FIFA must propose other solutions or run the risk of having its rules banned in the EU – something that no one would wish to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Mario Monti and I are pleased to learn that our plea seems to have been heeded this time. Last week FIFA admitted that its transfer rules do not conform to Community legislation, and it announced its intention of establishing a new system. Since the details of that system have yet to be finalised, I cannot comment on them at the present time. We have, however, received an initial outline of the proposals. This afternoon I shall be meeting with FIFA officials and a delegation from the national leagues. They too will be making proposals. Mario Monti's departments are ready to examine these, within the shortest possible time, with the aid of my departments and those of Anna Diamantopoulou. Our doors are always open to any debate or any negotiations that will help us to arrive at a consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to conclude by underlining the commitment of the Commission to the European model of sport and its values. The European Parliament has affirmed on many occasions – for which I am deeply grateful to it – that it shares this commitment. I believe you will reaffirm this by adopting the parliamentary report devoted to the Helsinki report. The French Presidency, as I said at the start of my speech, has testified to this same attachment to sport and its values on behalf of the Council. So, if I am not mistaken, we are all on the same wavelength. The Commission is acting in the interests of sport to preserve the beautiful game, and I am convinced that, if we all pull our weight, a satisfactory solution will soon be in sight for the good of sport, for the good of football and for the good of Europe.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Zabell (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, doping is not a new problem. It did not even start this century, but comes from the last century. In fact, the first death from doping took place in 1896, when a cyclist took drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">The first measures against doping, however, began to be taken after the first Helsinki Olympic games in 1952, but it was in the Tour de France of 1998 that the problem became too big and the serious fight against it began. In fact, we have already heard this morning that it is a priority for the French Presidency, the Council and also for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to assess why this problem exists and why doping has increased so much in recent years. On the one hand, it is worth mentioning the over-commercialisation that is affecting sport, as well as the saturation of sporting calendars and greater demands on sportsmen and women, both physical and mental. Before, the motto of sport was that of Pierre de Coubertin, ‘the important thing is taking part’. Now, however, it seems that whoever comes first wins, whoever comes second loses, and the rest just take part. On the other hand, we should not forget that, these days, an increasing number of tests are being done, many of them outside competitions, and this also means that, logically, more cases of doping are being discovered.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is very important to distinguish between the two types of doping: on the one hand, there is intentional or planned doping, that is, a team plans which substances the sportsman or woman needs to take, and when, in order to improve his or her physical performance. Logically, this is more common in sports with greater financial resources. On the other hand, there is accidental doping, which often does not even improve the sportsman or woman’s physical performance. This tends to be more common in sports which have few resources, so that often public opinion does not even realise what has happened.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, we have to fight both types of doping, although each one should be approached in a very different manner. Combating intentional or planned doping is much more difficult. Police cooperation plays a very important role, because we should not forget that the trafficking of doping substances is worth EUR 1 billion per year. It is also important to listen to sportsmen and women when drawing up sporting calendars or planning a competition or trial. Sometimes, we ask them to do more than is physically possible without turning to external help. Overall, we need to fight doping globally. It is not an isolated problem for one Member State and therefore the presence of the European Union in the World Anti-Doping Agency is absolutely essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Combating accidental doping is much easier. It is mainly due to the lack of information among sportsmen and women, and the report therefore proposes that there should be an indicator on the boxes of pharmaceutical products, consisting of five Olympic rings and a traffic light. Thus, when buying a drug, sportsmen and women will be able to clearly see the red traffic light indicating the risk of testing positive, or the green light which indicates that there is no risk, or the amber light indicating that there may be a risk and that they should contact their doctor or a specialist for advice. This is very important, because we now have fifteen Member States with fifteen lists of prohibited substances, and in each country there can be a different brand name for the same drug. For this purpose, we ask for the intervention of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">However, even though the types of doping are different, sportsmen and women receive the same treatment and from the moment that they have a positive result they are considered to be guilty, with no right to prove their innocence and without an assessment of whether the doping was intentional or not, as occurs with other things in life. We also call on the European Commission to request that the Fifth Framework Programme carry out research into doping substances and their impact on the health of sportsmen and women, detection methods and the natural limits of hormones that can be produced by the human body.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to laboratories, it is very important that they comply with ISO standards on uniform methods for collecting and analysing samples, and also that there should be protection and confidentiality, both in collection and in dealing with the case, in order to preserve sportsmen and women’s right to honour and privacy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I will mention penalties. When a person other than the sportsman or woman has taken part, such as a club, an association, a federation, a doctor, a coach, etc., that person should also be subject to a penalty, exactly equal to that given to the sportsman or woman, because we should not forget that the person with the shortest working life will always be the sportsman or woman. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The system of sport which the European Union must aspire to must make the right to sport for all citizens a practical reality and aim to preserve the social function and traditional values of sport, while taking into account its economic and legal development.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the declaration on sport in the Treaty of Amsterdam annex is no longer sufficient to ensure that the predetermined objectives are met. Sport needs a new definition: indeed, it should be considered as an activity that is an integral part of the education and training of young people, free time and the integration of socially excluded and disabled people.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, sport must be an essential factor in promoting the education and integration of all social classes. Moreover, it must be able to adapt to the new business context, within which it must evolve without losing its autonomy. Some changes are needed so that the European Union can help with the developments in the world of sport.</p>
<p class="contents">The central committee has stated several times that it can no longer guarantee the pyramid structure on the basis of which sporting organisations and the social function of sport are currently organised. A legal basis is therefore essential since, without one, there is a danger that the objectives that have been reached so far will come to nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must be more forceful in the fight against doping, a phenomenon which, unfortunately, is growing very rapidly and is no longer confined to the world of sport: the spread of this scourge has led to an increase in highly lucrative illegal activities, in which many criminal organisations have been involved, and we need to recognise that entrusting the fight against doping solely to sporting organisations has been a complete failure.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe should therefore look into the possibility of promulgating Community criminal legislation which would be valid in all the Member States, and should consider setting up an independent, transparent, European anti-doping agency. Moreover, all sports-related economic activities must be subject to the rules of the EC Treaty. The monopolistic activity of sporting organisations has caused numerous problems and must therefore be subject to strict checks and possibly reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to encourage sporting associations, provided that aims are established to support amateur sport and to show solidarity with less-advantaged people, particularly the disabled. We need to try to improve the role played by sport and the role of the teaching of physical education in the curricula of schools.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the work and status of sportspersons should be properly appreciated and safeguarded by the Member States. I feel that it is the European Union’s duty to help reintegrate into the labour market athletes who have made no provision for their futures once their sporting activity comes to an end. Europe must also call for sportspersons’ professional qualifications to be recognised at European level and for their vocational training to be promoted.</p>
<p class="contents">There must be a firm, determined fight against the trade in young sportspersons, calling for the entry of young people into professional sport and their membership to take place as late as possible. Moreover, we need to ensure that the statutes of national and international sporting federations lay down mission statements and contain clear, precise rules.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to combat the violence which takes place at sporting events and ensure that our citizens are protected. Furthermore, we need to eliminate the permanent sporting contract currently used in many sporting federations, as this violates the most basic principles of the Member States’ constitutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, until a legal basis is established for ‘sport’, Europe will not be able to do much in this area and will therefore have to consider the possibility of taking on a certain amount of autonomy in the sector, not in order to take it away from other bodies, but so that it can make an essential contribution to safeguarding the values and functions of sport.</p>

We are therefore grateful to the committee responsible that it has incorporated the requests to this effect into its report. We also unreservedly support the Commission's position on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">This is necessary because of competition law and freedom of movement for workers. Mrs Reding has already made this point very well. I therefore regret all the more that it has become evident over the last few days that many people in positions of authority in football and other sporting associations are unable to learn lessons and enter into a dialogue. Judging by the statements made over the last few days, you cannot help feeling that the assumption that a lot of footballers' talents lie more in their legs than between their ears is quite justified.</p>
<p class="contents">So, when we now hear calls for Heads of Government to get involved and turn European law on its head, as it were, then I feel bound to say that this demonstrates that people clearly have no idea what the legal position is. This has got nothing to do with Heads of State and Government at all. It is the European Commission that is responsible for ensuring that the Treaties are respected. And the Commission is exercising precisely that remit. I would like to say, once again, that I unreservedly support the position being taken by the Commission on this issue.</p>

The International Olympic Committee cannot be serious with its talk of ‘clean’ Olympic Games when we all know that 1,000 syringes of erythropoietin were stolen from a Sidney hospital a month ago and when one legend of the Olympic spirit after another now openly maintains that there are anti-doping tests for every banned substance only the International Olympic Committee prefers to bow to pressure from big business than to apply them.</p>
<p class="contents">Minister Buffet, who has addressed us so eloquently here today, stated in <span class="italic">Le Monde </span>on 4 August that the basic ingredient missing in the fight against doping was strong political will. But it would appear to be difficult to exercise this will when there is the pressure of commercialisation and the pressure, encapsulated in the thoughtless and superficial motto of the Olympic Games, to be ‘faster, higher, stronger’. It is even more difficult to exercise this political will when the supply of banned substances is much more in demand, with a turnover, as we have heard, of a billion euros, although this turnover is much higher – much, much higher – if we include the mild doping which is spreading through gyms, beauty centres and God knows where else.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to bring our political clout to bear as quickly as possible, we need to harmonise lists of dangerous substances, methods of testing for the new substances which industry is constantly producing, we need to apply sanctions, we need to find out who is responsible and apply sanctions. Of course, the European Union needs to take a more active role in the World Anti-Doping Agency, precisely as the President of the Council described, and I agree with him. I should like to finish by saying that this World Anti-Doping Agency is quite simply an observer in Sidney today. And, as long as we are just observers, nothing will be done in the fight against doping. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have just had Euro 2000, the Olympic Games are about to start, and, what is more, there are an increasing number of people who enjoy sports as a leisure activity. It is healthy and brings people together from all walks of life, irrespective of age or race. This is, of course, extremely important in a society which increasingly focuses on the individual. At the same time, as has already been pointed out, there is also a downside to sport, namely violence around the pitches, the use of doping, an increase in the use of performance-enhancing substances – also increasingly so in amateur sport – and the huge pressure on sportsmen and women due to the major economic interests involved.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we welcome with open arms the fact that the European Commission has taken it upon itself to highlight the social aspect of sport and to examine how the economic dimension of sport can be reconciled with the educational and other roles that sport fulfils. The PPE-DE is entirely behind this objective and has tabled amendments to give this initiative a boost. It has, more specifically, submitted proposals to step up the support given to sports organisations, in order to invest in people, in team spirit and to improve the legal framework underpinning sport, as all we have at the moment is the declaration to the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to a few specific problems which sport is having to contend with, I would like to say the following on the issue of transfers. The Bosman ruling has mainly hit the smaller clubs, as the Commissioner has already pointed out, especially in the smaller countries, such as the Netherlands where I am from. These clubs invariably need to make major investments in training and education without sufficient backing or compensation. We therefore hope that the Commission, in tandem with the sports organisations, will produce proposals which will make amends in the short term. The sports federations, such as UEFA and FIFA, have also submitted proposals to this effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Doping is a huge, international problem, as already pointed out by the rapporteur, who has drafted an excellent report, and it is therefore vital for there to be international cooperation in this respect. We will need to agree internationally on what we take doping to mean and will need to refer to the World Anti-Doping Agency. It would be useful if pharmaceutical products could be labelled with a ‘doping-safe’ logo and a warning, and we would also welcome a more pro-active preventive policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the statement made by the Commissioner, which has our support. I recommend that, in future, she should come to Parliament before so many leaks occur from the Commission administration, which forced the Commissioner to face the press with great courage and determination, not afraid to tell them the truth. It would be better if they came to Parliament first and had our support.</p>
<p class="contents">The subject of transfers is perhaps an example that sums up the current situation of sport. There are two reports, the Zabell report and the Mennea report, drawn up by Olympic champions. On the eve of the Sydney Olympics, I would like to recall that the first, and perhaps the best, contribution to peace made by Europe, that is, by ancient Greece, was precisely the Olympic Games. They talk of sport as a citizen’s right, with a social and cultural function. There is a component of transfer fees that is justified in terms of the contribution that is made to training and preparing sportsmen. This makes sense and needs to be regulated, and we need to support young people and small clubs so that they can promote themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Another dimension is the big business involved, which in many countries is becoming the second largest sector in the economy. We are dealing with uncontrolled, unsustainable long-term speculation. A major club in my native city made the biggest transfer in football history – EUR 70 million. The person involved has said that it is absurd, and the chairman of the club has said that it is in a very grave economic situation. If we were applying the rules of economics, we would have to act differently.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I think that the Commission should act. It has managed to make FIFA begin to see sense. My group and I would like to show our support for the Commission and we maintain that action has to continue that will really express and guarantee this right of Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to point out that there has been talk of the collapse of the world of football. In the United States in the 1940s, under anti-trust legislation, the same measures were applied in Hollywood as those that the Commission is proposing. But Hollywood did not go under. Quite the opposite. We now have a considerable economic problem in coping with the clout of the American film industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, keep going, Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, UK athletes – Linford Christie, Dougie Walker and Gary Cadogan – were not presumed to be innocent by the International Athletics Association. Despite evidence, based on research by Aberdeen University, that nandrolene could be produced by a combination of dietary supplements and vigorous training, Mark Richardson is still waiting, eight days before the Olympics, in the Olympic village not knowing whether he is going to compete or not. Linford Christie has campaigned throughout his career against doping in sport. He would not do anything now to jeopardise that. These cases demonstrate the need for the World Anti-Doping Agency to harmonise disciplinary procedure that would safeguard the rights of athletes but, at the same time, swiftly punish those who knowingly take drugs and are guilty of taking drugs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has never been clear what social significance we should attribute to it.</p>
<p class="contents">By and large, I have to say that the top-level sport we are generally talking about here is not necessarily a healthy pursuit, any more than the extreme sports that I go in for, or used to do. Only the gods on Mount Olympus can say whether top-level sport is healthy or not – we certainly cannot.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the facts now. Because of globalisation, our consumer society has become ever more hungry for stars, sensations and records. So, officials and businessmen have turned ‘bread and sport’ into a branch of show business that is now one of the biggest in the world, and the process of commercialisation, is of course, continuing. And the systematic doping that this commercialisation encourages is simply intensifying this process.<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>Those are the facts of the matter. There is no way we can change those facts unless we create greater transparency, and unless we set up an independent anti-doping agency which is accessible to everyone and which everyone understands.</p>

It revolves around the legitimacy of the specific status of sport, which I should like us to stress today.</p>
<p class="contents">The specific status of sport derives primarily from the sports system, from the social pyramid which is reflected in the structure of small clubs in our towns and rural areas as well as in major sporting events. This pyramid must be respected in a number of ways. It must be respected by recognising the sole right of federations to govern their respective sports and by promoting the role that the sports federations can and do play in bonding communities and society at large. In so doing, we must, of course, ensure that money is distributed fairly throughout the entire pyramid formed by the clubs and their federations and that what we might call the sporting ethic is applied to all sporting events. Let us not forget that it is possible to confuse those who stage events with those who provide the spectacle. I believe that an effort has to be made there in the way sport is structured, a point that was raised in Mr Mennea's report, so that there can be no possible confusion between those who stage the event and those who provide us with the information, the spectacle, the entertainment, the pleasure and the dreams.</p>
<p class="contents">There is the system, and then there is the individual too. And, of course, there is the issue of doping – and I thank Mrs Zabell here for her magnificent report; all of these are relevant to the health aspect of sport. There is the training of sportspeople. But what happens to the individual outside the arena? We have been reminded that sportsmen and sportswomen are not commodities, that they are not goods and chattels. They must be able to move freely in Europe, but they are not products. They are individuals. So what happens when the competition is over?</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the system and its focal point, the sportsperson, are concerned, what the reports are calling for is the rationalisation of the specific nature of sport in our European Union. Considerations of time – the calendar of events and the course of sportspeople's lives – have been highlighted in both reports, and I thank the two rapporteurs for emphasising the need to live before, during and after sport and throughout the whole year.</p>
<p class="contents">So you will understand why we in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport are asking for sport to be enshrined in Article 151 of the Treaty in such a way that its specific character is legitimised and that we no longer have to dip into the provisions on health, on education and on employment in order to assemble a case for the preservation of this specific character of sporting activity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is primarily a form of cheating, with individuals cheating themselves as well as cheating others. That is why there is a need to establish a vast education programme to reinstate the true values of sport and to make it,once again, a school of life and an example for our youngest generations.</p>
<p class="contents">At every level, including the very highest, sport should be an opportunity to teach the virtues of endeavour, courage, team spirit and respect for others. The Commission was right to remind us that one of the first causes of the increased prevalence of doping lies in the commercial implications of modern sport. That is why our reflections should focus more sharply on the possibility of imposing stiffer penalties on the various economic operators who encourage doping or profit from it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the reason why sport has assumed an important and indeed a central place in our contemporary societies is perhaps because it has become the only means open to a nation to demonstrate its greatness. Perhaps the nations ought to rediscover other ways of projecting their greatness and their pride on the world stage, and I cannot help thinking at this moment of national currencies, which are an essential attribute of a country's sovereignty and grandeur. Today, as the euro, the currency of the Euro-optimists, plummets, it is an urgent necessity that all nations should be able to keep their own currency, just as they keep their national sports teams, of which they are so proud, with no need of artificial stimulants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not much, apparently, since some athletes – a minority, I am glad to say – are refusing to stay in the Olympic village, considering it to be below their station. Others, especially the sprinters, are proclaiming loud and long that they are only running to promote their particular brand of footwear. While it is worrying that top athletes are more motivated by the lure of financial gain than by the sporting ethic, mass sport, by contrast, is a guarantor of good physical and mental health and constitutes a veritable school of life, developing team spirit, tolerance and solidarity and presenting young people with exemplary role models.</p>
<p class="contents">An instrument of education and of social integration and cohesion, sport helps to combat racism, exclusion and violence, but sport, sadly, is being increasingly contaminated by doping, all in the name of business. Professional sport has undoubtedly become a business in its own right, subject to the dictates of profitability. Some football clubs are already listed on the stock market. But as more and more money is invested in sport, the financial rewards gradually come to take precedence over the game itself. This creates pressure to win by fair means or foul and particularly by means of doping, which is becoming ever harder to detect.</p>
<p class="contents">How can the sporting ethic be restored? First of all, the fight against doping must be globalised. Doping seriously damages athletes' health as well as the essential virtues of sport, namely honesty, fair play, respect for one's opponent, friendship, etc. In that respect, the creation of a World Anti-Doping Agency by the International Olympic Committee in 1999 has to be welcomed. Let us hope that it remains independent and that it will become operational very soon. It is our job to give it the tools it needs to accomplish its mission. Doping is not only a European problem; it is indubitably a problem of global dimensions.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as regulation is concerned, it is not up to Europe to make the rules. Europe must show its trust in the voluntary bodies by accepting the proposals from the federations and from other Olympic committees. The Bosman decision, for example, which was taken in the name of high principles, has destabilised professional clubs and has exacerbated the impact of money on European football. The latest transfer record, set when Figo moved to Real Madrid, is a case in point. Clubs in certain countries now build their teams almost exclusively with foreign players. This is particularly true of Barcelona, where they are able to field a team without a single Spanish player, which effectively makes it impossible for young nationals to play at the highest level in their country. The plundering of young players from the clubs that have developed their skills is another consequence. Transfer targets are becoming younger and younger: a player becomes transferable at the age of 15.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is now trying to legislate on the rules governing transfers, as you, Commissioner, have told us. If the scheme under consideration is implemented, which I hope it will not be, the result will be total deregulation of the system, which will benefit the richest clubs still further and despoil the clubs that develop young talent, condemning them to eventual closure. The cure is worse than the disease. It is therefore essential that we do our utmost to develop mass sport, village clubs, so that everyone can take part in sport and so that every sportsperson who enjoys competing can progress and strive for a place among the elite in healthy and fair competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We all recognise nowadays that sport is big business. This is particularly clear in football with its enormous transfer fees, often ridiculously high salary levels, and stock market deals, but it is not just football. Other sports have a lot of money sloshing around. Formula 1 is a good example. In, the UK they even had a million pounds to spare for the Labour Party. Sport has a lot of money and it cannot expect to be exempt from free market rules.</p>
<p class="contents">I do, however, disagree with the reports when they call for a Treaty clause on sport.</p>
<p class="contents">Jacques Santer was absolutely right when he said Europe must do less but do it better. So let us try to operate within our means. Let us try to operate within the powers that we already have. What is needed regarding transfer fees is a healthy dose of pragmatism and common sense. I endorse the Commissioner's remarks this morning. I have absolute confidence in her abilities and attitude and wish her well in her forthcoming discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, say that there is no rush. FIFA has certainly been very slow to act and should be criticised for that, but the Commissioner must also be prepared to listen to the small clubs, the players' organisations, and spectators. Let us work for a good solution that we can defend rather than working for a solution this afternoon, or this week, or this month. It is something that needs to be sorted out so that the people of Europe will understand. Europe needs friends, not enemies. Let us not add football spectators to those people who do not understand what Europe is about. Come up with a good solution and you will have the backing of this House and the backing of football supporters across Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are all living longer, and sport is occupying a greater part of our time. It is there not just to revitalise our bodies but also our minds and our souls, and we have to recognise the importance of that fact in European legislation. I therefore support the call for a legal basis that will put our powers on a par with those of the very important international sports organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Europeans share a love of watching and participating in football, from Newcastle through Dortmund to Barcelona, but it is important that local people should be inspired to join their clubs. I would therefore say that the most enduring teams should be built up from scratch and not simply bought up. The system needs well-run machinery consisting of clubs of all shapes and sizes and degrees of professionalism and we need to take the opportunity to reform it. I support, therefore, Commission statements and the Commissioner's action on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Sport has a huge potential. It has shown that it can build understanding and fight racism. Let us do more work in sport to bring our communities together. It has shown that it has the power to encourage disabled athletes to succeed. Let us show that we share their pride and build joint events for them and able-bodied people. Violence on the field has been the bad side of sport. Let us work to ensure that sport is violence-free.</p>
<p class="contents">Doping, finally, is a symptom of the over-commercialisation of sport. As our teams head off to Sydney they are under more pressure than ever. We have to set up facilities that fight doping on an international basis because, as we have seen, one false accusation can ruin a career or cast a shadow over an exemplary career, such as that of Linford Christie. Therefore, we support these reports and hope that they will provide the foundation for us to move forward into the next phase of European sport, a community spirit to build the industry and the potential of sport in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no doubt that doping is changing sport and that sport will be changed due to doping, which means it will become absolutely ludicrous if we do nothing to prevent it.</p>
<p class="contents">The combination of enormous and disproportionate financial, media and sponsoring interests surrounding sportsmen and women puts so much pressure on them, and the intensity of sport is so great, that in order to maintain their level of competitiveness and the pace imposed on them by sporting calendars, sportsmen and women tend to use prohibited substances. Without limiting the length of competitions and without having obligatory rest time, it will be very difficult to eradicate doping. However, we should not forget that sportsmen and women are also human beings who can fall ill or injure themselves, and will therefore need drugs and additional help to combat the stress under which they place their bodies, which is why false positive tests are the order of the day and will brand the sportsman or woman concerned forever.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need to do is to harmonise criteria, have a single list of prohibited substances, homogenise tests, have warnings on drugs and do more research. Ladies and gentlemen, we need to reinvent sport, because as it is at the moment there is a battle for glory, but also for money and sponsorship.

We might say that sport has got there first, that sport built structures before we were able to do so at political, economic or other levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Why? Because sport had its roots in ancient Greek Olympia, sport had prophets such as de Coubertin, and sport allowed peoples to meet in peace. Europe was at war but, at the same time, it had common sporting structures and common sporting rules. Today the tables have turned: we are preparing to review the Treaty, we are increasing the number of common rules and common principles and our works and structures, while sport is falling apart.</p>
<p class="contents">Why? Because big business calls the shots, because major financiers are involved, because the mass media are backed by strong centres of power and because, in my view, intervention by the European Union is inadequate and misguided. By intervening in sporting issues solely from the point of view of competition, the European Union has, in essence, strengthened this trend and this attitude.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we are at a turning point. Thank goodness we have President Buffet and the French Presidency which, I think, has taken up and taken a leading role in the matter of unifying and developing and strengthening our sporting structures. I think that Mrs Reding also has a positive part to play on behalf of the Commission in changing the way in which the Commission intervenes.

<p class="contents">Precisely to avoid sport being reduced to nothing more than a business, we must call, loud and clear, upon the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference at Nice to expressly insert a significant reference to the institutional recognition of sport into Article 151 of the Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But the problem is that media interest will focus not so much on the Mennea and Zabell reports as on the Commissioner's announcement. I think that is a pity. We are now more worried about the apple of Germany's eye, football, than about what is really at stake today.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no hesitation in supporting the two Commissioners whose task it is to implement the Bosman judgment. If FIFA had done its job, the Commission would not have needed to get involved in this. I hope that FIFA recognises that and will now finally come up with something that the Commission can include in its proposals, as long as they do not run counter to the Bosman judgment. So I think that everyone has a job to do here.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the reports, I would like to say that, in view of the big business sport has become, the social and educational importance of popular sport needs to be highlighted. There is a danger that sport as a whole will sooner or later be badly hit by rules on competition. We would like to prevent that, which is why the Mennea report quite rightly calls for a reference to sport in Article 151 of the Treaty as an aspect of culture. I, myself, called for this in my report back in 1996. That resulted in a declaration at Amsterdam, which was by no means enough. That is why I am supporting the fact that this is finally being introduced now.</p>
<p class="contents">That report also called for the Commission to declare a European Year of Sport. A European Year of Sport would be an important stimulus, and I hope that the new Commissioner will now take this up.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that Mrs Zabell has covered some broader ground in her report on doping and that she has also stressed the abuse of young sportsmen and women, and has given an impetus to jointly tackling doping.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the Commission on having joined this Anti-Doping Agency now, so that it can genuinely give an impetus to a harmonised approach towards combating doping on behalf of the Community of Fifteen. I wish it every luck. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reports we have before us also provide a basis for debate. The question that inevitably comes to mind is this: what has happened to the idealistic image of sport which is still being portrayed? It is all too easy to be complacent and attribute a very important social and unifying role to sport, where fair play is held up as a model for our interaction with each other, be it at work, in politics or whatever.</p>
<p class="contents">However, both reports show very clearly that sport has become a powerful and extremely tough economic force, and sportsmen and women are its tools. They are programmed to achieve peak performances on particular days and during particular weeks, with ever shorter gaps in between, and they have to function like machines. In order to overcome human weaknesses, which cannot always be calculated, and to achieve perfect functioning, people resort to doping substances, and it is now becoming harder and harder to detect their use.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way, young sportsmen and women cause damage to themselves, to their health, to their personal development and, last but not least, to sport as an ideal. Top sportsmen and women are a role model for thousands of young people and thus have a very strong impact on popular sport, which, as I see it, is the level of sport that most needs to be encouraged. A sense of fair play and social interaction are still easy to find at this level. But bad examples such as violent incidents, doping scandals, million-dollar contracts and bankruptcies are also destructive at this level.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to create legal bases to stem these negative trends. I welcome the fact that the WADA is now active, and that it is there to combat the worldwide problem of doping. Measures are needed against violence and racism in sport, in order to guarantee that sportsmen and women and sports fans are protected against rampaging hordes of hooligans and racists. There is also scope for top sportsmen and women to do more on their part and to make it clearer than they have until now that they want nothing to do with ‘fans’ like these.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be our job to give sport a new role in a changed society, with new and modern technical and medical facilities, and in this way to preserve its values. I believe that a European Year of Sport could stimulate this debate and make a substantial contribution here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome this proposal with open arms.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, this will cause problems, certainly in the short term, for smaller clubs in smaller footballing nations, such as the Netherlands. But holding on to the current system would not solve the problem either. A more structural solution would be if the media millions were better distributed. I therefore hope with all my heart that the large clubs will realise that ultimately, without the small clubs, their future will be bleak too.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say the following on the transfer system. I back the Commission proposal but I do hope that it will make provision for recovering training expenses for players between the ages of 18 and 24, as, for example, is being proposed at the moment by FIFA, the international football association, and FIFPRO, the organisation for players. I very much hope that UEFA, the European football union, will go along with this request and will stop being the last, self-appointed defender of a system which has created such absurd situations in the first place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Three million people dancing attendance at major sporting events and huge profits for business have eclipsed the athletic ideal. Fitness training and sport as a daily exercise and popular sport are in dire straits. As long as the winners see ‘sport plc’ thriving, doping will increase, transfer fees will increase – another form of human trafficking in a modern capitalist society – and the problem of violence at football stadiums and various other signs of degeneration will increase.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite acknowledging that the main reason for the increase in doping is excessive commercialisation, the Commission is doing nothing to combat it. How could it, when the entire structure of the European Union is built on the principle of ‘there is nothing which cannot be bought or sold’? It confines itself to half measures. Studies, codes of conduct with passing references to controls. If they intended, and really wanted, to combat doping, they would have already done so. But it is not in the interests of the International Olympic Committee, the international federations, the sponsors who invest in sport or the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The two reports do contain positive elements, but they go so far, in the Zabell report, as to state that the pharmaceutical industry cares about the health of athletes and, in the Mennea report, as to suggest that Member States adopt practical measures in their legislation to encourage private investment in sport.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless we crack down on commercialisation, unless we erect barriers to speculation by big business, unless we introduce basic and efficient controls, nothing will change in sport. We do not expect the European Union to take any such action, so we are struggling to develop a popular movement which will fight for modern sport to rediscover the principle of ‘a healthy mind in a healthy body’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Proven cases of doping in sporting competitions have diminished the reputation of many sports in the eyes of the public. At last, the International Olympic Committee has faced up to its obligations to combat the widespread use of drugs in sport. Up to 2500 drug tests will be carried out during the Sydney games.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the IOC's announcement that heavy penalties will be imposed on sportsmen and women caught using drugs in Sydney this month and in the future. The way to stop the use of drugs in sport should be coordinated on a worldwide basis. The Union must continue to work through the World Anti-Doping Agency to ensure that uniform and structured guidelines are implemented for all sporting activities.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we should recall that the Treaty of Amsterdam emphasises the social significance of sport, but the European Union has no powers under the Treaty to take action on sport. That is an issue that should be addressed in the ongoing discussions on the reform of Union policies and initiatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our 700 000 sports clubs are pillars of Europe's civil society. The Council Presidency has said that sport is education for life. Sport is a part of youth work, a part of education policy, a part of leisure activity, a part of health policy, a part of international understanding, a part of the information industry, and a part of economic affairs and of competition. Let me stress that I am saying a <span class="bold">part</span>. To reduce sport to an economic and competitive level is to deny its wider social significance. It has to be said that, up to now, Community law has been applied to sport in a very indiscriminate way, because it primarily treats sport as an economic activity. This means that insufficient account has been taken of the special hallmarks of sport and its 700 000 clubs, and of voluntary work done in areas like youth work and training for children and young people. Unless we can work successfully with children and young people, and unless Europe has an effective system of sports clubs, we cannot make our aspirations for popular sport a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Doris Pack has already referred several times to the consequent need to root sport in the EU Treaties and have it influence the Treaty of Amsterdam. The importance of sport was also mentioned in the conclusions of the Feira Summit. It is therefore both a logical and desirable consequence of all this that sport should be given a legal basis in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want to interfere in the affairs of Member States. Sport comes under the principle of subsidiarity. We simply want the overall social importance of sport to be recognised by the Commission and in European law, perhaps giving it its own budget heading so that it does not just have to be promoted through pilot projects.</p>

But does everyone see and recognise the different purposes of participation in sport? For some, it may be a question of keeping fit. For others, it may be part of their personal education process, while for others it is the presentation of a spectacle or a quest for victory at all costs. We all know that sport is a tremendous instrument of national cohesion and of social integration. However, we are also aware that sport can sometimes be accompanied by horrific acts of violence, abominable racist outbursts and unacceptable strident nationalism.</p>
<p class="contents">And for all of these reasons, we cannot accept the idea that sport should be considered in its economic dimension alone. Voluntary organisations and individual volunteers are every bit a part of the sporting world, and it is surely thanks to them that sport is alive in our countries and that mass sport will be able to survive in future. Not every human act can be priced with a pocket calculator. The effect of that approach on human relations is too dangerous for us to remain silent. Where there is no money to be won and no obligation to show a profit, there may quite simply be the desire to share these special opportunities, and sport undoubtedly has its place – indeed its foremost place – in such encounters.</p>
<p class="contents">This quest for human bonds in an increasingly commercial society contains the seeds of resistance to the commercialisation of the world and of human relations. We cannot accept this excessive striving for profits to the detriment of human development. The protection of young sportspeople is a priority of the French Presidency. It is our priority, and we must demand the prohibition of commercial transactions relating to these young people.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also, of course, provide for the introduction of sport into the Treaty – if not in the short term, then at least in the medium term. It is certainly a challenge, but we must accept it for the sake of coming generations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as Mr Mennea’s report is concerned, I have attempted to highlight three points in the amendments which I tabled, and which have fortunately been adopted in the final motion for a resolution. One is the importance of sport as a mental activity in order to learn a number of social skills. Secondly, sport helps us appreciate activities <span class="italic">in forma pauperis</span> which involve minority groups that deserve more support, also at European level. My third point serves as a warning against the yawning gap which can arise between top sport and smaller sports associations on the one hand and professional and amateur sport on the other. In both cases, one very much relies on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the question of whether sport should be dealt with at European level, I certainly believe it should. Therefore, this report does not mark the end of the game, quite the reverse. The role and impact sport has in society have become so enormous, and the entire sports scene is undergoing such change, that as far as the social debate is concerned, we are only just in the first heats, if at all. The European Parliament needs to ensure that it is not left on the sidelines in this debate, but plays an active part so that we can help decide the shape of the game. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First and foremost, we must wage a relentless fight against doping. The financial and political commitment of all the countries of the European Union to the World Anti-Doping Agency is imperative, but it is not enough. The most important thing is that governments should arm themselves with proper structures to combat doping. France has marked out the path, and I should be interested to know how the President of the Council sees the interaction between the Agency and national initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also combat the excesses of the transfer system, especially the trade in young professional sportsmen. Finally, we must strengthen the real driving forces of sport, namely the federations and sport at school. I support the efforts to secure recognition of the key role of sports federations and to protect them from the depredations of financial and media giants.</p>
<p class="contents">Young people must be the main target in the rehabilitation of sport. I support the call made by Mr Mennea in his report for sport to be accorded a higher status in the school curriculum as well as his plea that the specific nature of sport be enshrined in the Treaties, otherwise we shall tend to see sport as little more than another domain of free economic competition.</p>

<p class="contents">I wish, first of all, to express my thanks and congratulations to the two rapporteurs for their excellent work, and I should also like to highlight the action of our colleague Doris Pack, who paved the way for the negotiation of the protocol on sport which is annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">Doping is a scourge from which sport has to protect itself. It undermines both fair play and genuine competition, and endangers the sportspeople who indulge in it. I am personally shocked by the ease with which young sportsmen and women can supply themselves with performance-enhancing drugs, without being checked at all, through the Internet or in certain countries of the European Union. Mrs Buffet has been tackling this issue in France, and I congratulate her for it. Nevertheless, this evil can only be rooted out if it is combated at European and global levels, and I encourage the Union to work with the World Agency to that end.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must also rise to the challenge of the modernisation of sport. The European Commission is questioning the system of transfers between clubs, believing it to be contrary to players’ freedom of movement. But the Commission is totally ignoring the distortion of competition between Member States, the social and fiscal disparity among professional sportsmen, which encourages the best of them to migrate to certain countries. We in France should know, because out of our pool of 22 players for Euro 2000, no fewer than 20 have gone off to play in other countries of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This phenomenon falls under the heading of social and fiscal dumping, but the Commission, for all its high principles, does nothing to combat it.</p>
<p class="contents">Professional sportspeople are also preyed upon by numerous agents who have exclusive rights to negotiate their employment contracts. Not only do the agents charge the players; they are also paid by the clubs, from which they extract commission, and I have first-hand knowledge of this. These agents hand over their protégés to the highest bidder, like common merchandise, after having whipped up competition for the players’ signatures in order to raise the bidding.</p>
<p class="contents">The abolition of transfers will induce agents to break their clients’ contracts several times in the course of a year in order to earn new commission each time a new contract is signed. The system of agents must be brought under control by the Union, or perhaps even scrapped.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by adding that sport must be brought within the scope of the Treaty Establishing the European Community. I therefore appeal to all those who govern us, particularly to the French Government, which is currently guiding the work of the European Union, to ensure that the Intergovernmental Conference to be held at Nice in December confers a share of responsibility for this matter upon the European Union and involves Parliament in the implementation of this initiative through the codecision procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a source of inspiration for millions and huge sums of money are involved in it. Thousands of Finnish people travel to Hungary to see Mika Häkkinen drive, while a Vietnamese hotel receptionist asks the right way to pronounce the name Jari Litmanen.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of sport and exercise both for societies and for individuals must not, however, get buried under professionalism and commercialism. Exercise is educationally important and vital for health. Sports societies bring people together to do self-sacrificing voluntary work. Along with the positive aspects, we have to remember the flip side of the coin – drugs, violence at sports events and the negative elements associated with player transfers. To prevent these we need joint action on the part of the Union and a legal base for sport. As we shape sports policy we have to take account of sport’s various structures. For that reason, we must ensure that we continue to listen to sport’s NGOs at the Olympics in the wake of the sports conference held in 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to turn your attention to the need to improve levels of gender equality in sport and exercise. The European Woman and Sport network conference held in June in Helsinki made recommendations which I hope will be taken into consideration at both national and Union level. I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their exhaustive work, and I want to express my heartfelt thanks, too, to the President-in-Office of the Council and the Member of the Commission for their excellent speeches at the start of this sitting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is incomprehensible why sport lacks a legal base in the European Union. The European Parliament must frankly force the Commission and the Council to look at themselves in the mirror. The status of sport must have a watertight definition produced for it at the next intergovernmental conference so that sports organisations can participate in decision-making on sport themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">As huge sums of money are involved in major sports, common rules and regulations should be drawn up to take account of the system’s basic pillars, sportsmen and the organisers of sporting events. The interests of team-game players must be safeguarded, all the while honouring the principle of the free movement of labour, not forgetting financial reward for the so-called trainer associations. We have to find a balance in the question of televising the most important sports events, one between the economic power of the organisers on the one hand, and the so-called public service principle on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about drugs we have to make a clear distinction, as we do when it comes to any other discussion on sport, between keep-fit exercise and major sporting events. The ethical problems associated with the latter are known to all. Too little attention has been paid to the spread of the use of drugs among ordinary people who do sports, proof of which lies, for example, in the trade in banned substances which is rife in gyms generally. The problem can be considered on a par with the narcotics problem, especially the use of synthetic drugs, so, simply out of concern for public health, the EU must do its bit to beat the problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Buffet,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after this very fruitful debate, I shall simply make a few observations.</p>
<p class="contents">Because we are all concerned about the excesses that occur in sport, it is very understandable that we have been focusing on those excesses, but it must also be stressed that the vast majority of the men and women who are involved in sport – participants and voluntary officials in local sports clubs and in sports associations – are men and women with a high regard for the values of sport, advocates of the sporting ethic who want sport to be a means of individual and collective development.</p>
<p class="contents">I refute the charges of universal drug-taking, I refute the idea put forward a moment ago that footballers’ brains are all in their feet and that they are incapable of thinking. Sportswomen and sportsmen are citizens of our countries. Perhaps we should give them more of a hearing so that they themselves can express their hopes and their fears.</p>
<p class="contents">Setting aside the excesses, we should also be aware that, in the world of association football for example, only one per cent of all players registered with the International Federation of Football Associations are professionals. So what we must try to defend is the whole of sporting activity, not just one aspect of it. I believe that this is extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to doping, I entirely agree with the idea that its underlying causes have to be tackled. We have heard talk of sporting calendars. Let me also mention the dependence of some sportspeople on results and on sponsorship. Similarly, there is a need to speak about the pressures from the media giants, which invariably try to raise the stakes in any competition. So, the underlying causes have to be tackled, and without delay; I believe the accent must be placed on controls, on sporting sanctions and on action against the supply chains. Not enough action is being taken at the level of the European Union to dismantle the chains through which these stimulants are made available within sporting circles.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the specific question that was asked, I believe it is absolutely essential that each Member State and the European Union as a whole should work on a sort of convention which would be signed between the States and WADA, the World Anti-Doping Agency, to facilitate the work of WADA in all countries, whatever their current legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of transfers, allow me to give my position and the position of the French Presidency. I am not in favour of maintaining the status quo, because we are familiar with the huge excesses which it has created and which have no economic, social or sporting justification. Nor do I wish the transfer system to disappear completely, because that would bring about an even more anarchic free-for-all than the one we are experiencing today, and the essential focus of inter-club rivalry would be the ability to offer the fattest pay packets.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past 48 hours, FIFA has made some extremely constructive and interesting proposals, which, if adopted, would serve to protect the youth-development system and individual rights, as well as satisfying the clubs’ need to build and train teams. This should be an interesting basis for discussion with the Commission, as Mrs Reding was explaining a short while ago. So there is the possibility of innovative proposals in this domain. It is vital, however, that some of the major clubs which seek complete deregulation, so that they can organise private competitions, do not try to sabotage the discussion process on which FIFA and the Commission are about to embark.</p>
<p class="contents">Someone spoke of the ‘social role of sport’ and asked whether it meant that sport was the opium of the people. No, I believe that the social role of sport simply consists of enabling individuals to find themselves through an activity, to blossom, to meet other individuals and to engage together in something of benefit to them in their lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, you may rest assured that the French Presidency, having listened to you, will proceed with great determination towards the establishment of a solid basis for the recognition of the specific status of sport and in the fight against doping.</p>

We shall enter into dialogue now with a view to finding, along with the European football chiefs, a negotiated solution in the form of a new transfer system which is in the interests of football and is consistent with the European Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it is perhaps symbolic that we should be starting this debate on future policy just before the Sydney Olympics with two rapporteurs who are former Olympic champions. What finer symbol could there be to demonstrate the union, the collaboration, we have seen between the political and sporting worlds in this arena today? Allow me to congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mrs Zabell and Mr Mennea, for their important contributions. Allow me also to thank the chairman and members of the competent parliamentary committee for their constant, unstinting collaboration and to thank Parliament, which is a veritable mouthpiece of the European sporting family and which has always demonstrated the utmost solidarity with initiatives taken by both the Commission and the sports ministers to strengthen sport in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also gratified, Mr President, to note that the two communications issued in December 1999 have generated very lively interest and very broad support. The views of the Commission and Parliament coincide, and they coincide with those of the public too.</p>
<p class="contents">I also listened with great interest to the words of Mrs Buffet, who shed valuable light on our deliberations. If I had not already known, her words would have convinced me that we are moving in the same direction, that we are working together in the interest of sport. The concerns expressed by the President of the Council are also those of Parliament and are the same concerns which the Commission has expressed in its two communications. I shall mention four of them and shall return to them in due course. They are the protection of young sportspeople, commitment to the social role of sport, preservation of the sporting ethic and adherence to the principle of solidarity. These are common lines of action; each of us in our respective spheres and all of us together must pursue our efforts to ensure that concrete action is taken in each of those areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the declaration planned by the French Presidency for the meeting of the European Council in Nice can help to define more clearly the specific character of sport.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond the observations which the rapporteurs have made, and to which I fully subscribe, the two draft resolutions prompt me to make one or two additional comments. I shall start with a few words on the Community support plan to combat doping in sport. Doping in sport is not simply an ethical problem. It has become a question of public health, and all the relevant players need to be mobilised to deal with it. For that reason, in response to the request made by the Vienna Council and by Parliament, the ministers responsible for sport and the Commission set to work on this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The support plan you have been examining is more or less the outcome of this work – a provisional outcome, admittedly, because it is only one stage in a longer process. It does seek, however, to define a global strategy to combat this evil. Moreover, in its communication the Commission opted for a three-pronged approach, which is also reflected in this strategy: first of all, assembling expert opinion on the ethical, legal and scientific implications of doping; secondly, contributing to the World Anti-Doping Conference and working with the Olympic movement on the creation of the World Anti-Doping Agency and, thirdly, mobilising the resources at the disposal of the Community with a view to supplementing the initiatives that are already being pursued in the Member States and lending them a Community dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already begun to implement this plan, and I should like to present briefly to you today the first initiatives taken by the Commission to combat doping. Firstly, with regard to the initial objective, the Commission requested the opinion of the European Group on Ethics, which was delivered on 11 November 1999; the group proposed a number of measures, and the Commission will take these into consideration in its future actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us move on to the World Anti-Doping Agency. As you know, and as Mrs Buffet mentioned, the voluntarist approach of the European Union enabled this Agency to see the light of day. Now that it has been successfully brought to life, we must ensure that the Community presence in the Agency is strong and coordinated. At the beginning of April, I also presented a communication to my fellow Commissioners on possible Community membership of the Agency. The question was examined by the Commission, which adopted a very firm and clear position: Community participation could only be envisaged if it had the unanimous backing of all Member States. I hope, ladies and gentlemen, that the efforts currently being undertaken by the French Presidency will lead to the creation of this unanimity and that the Community will be able to participate in the work of the Agency, not only in a financial sense but also, and especially, in the formulation of ideas and political inputs. We are expected to play a leading role, and we are prepared to do so. Let me mention in passing that, pending the inclusion in the Commission budget of our contribution towards the Agency’s operating expenditure, the Commission has released EUR 1.5 million to fund specific initiatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Commission has to mobilise the resources at its disposal for the fight against doping. It is essential, for instance, to ensure maximum coordination of policies and regulatory measures. My fellow Commissioners, David Byrne, Commissioner for Health, and Philippe Busquin, who has the Research portfolio, are working at the moment on important initiatives in collaboration with my departments. The adoption of a recommendation on sport and doping is also planned for this autumn. Moreover, the Commission is funding a research project which ought to lead to the standardisation of procedures in the European laboratories that specialise in the fight against doping. Contacts have also been established with the new Commission departments devoted to justice and home affairs, since, as your report rightly indicates, new opportunities are arising to deal with the doping issue in the framework of legislation for the suppression of drug trafficking. Finally, you will easily understand that, in the departments under my responsibility, namely education, vocational training and youth, the programmes that have been prepared will play a significant part in informing young people, raising their awareness of the issues and enlisting their aid in the fight against doping.</p>
<p class="contents">Coordination, Mr President, is a means of extending the scope of the action we are able to take here. In accordance with the spirit of the Helsinki report, I have entered into dialogue with governments as well as with the European sports federations on the question of the anti-doping campaign. When I visit Sydney for the Olympic Games, I shall endeavour, together with Mrs Buffet, to meet with sports ministers from the other continents with a view to widening the range of our action and establishing bonds of solidarity among political leaders at a global level.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this occasion to thank Parliament for having given us the green light to launch pilot projects. The sum of EUR 5 million has been allocated. One and a half million of this amount has been assigned to the Anti-Doping Agency; the remainder is to be used to finance fifteen European projects. Information campaigns and a number of studies will be conducted, mainly to analyse the underlying causes of doping, in the closest of collaboration with universities, researchers and the sporting community.</p>
<p class="contents">You can therefore see, ladies and gentlemen of the House, that our response to the report has already been initiated and that the results of your work here are very encouraging in my eyes. I believe that all of this is only one stage in a process, that more is expected of us, and I am convinced that the Zabell report will serve the Commission as a signpost and a landmark, both in its present activities and in its future initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, allow me now to highlight the Helsinki report and the social dimension of sport. This report has furnished the Commission with its first defined ‘doctrine’ in the realm of sport. In that respect, the report is fundamental, and I thank Parliament for having played a crucial role in its development. In 1997, in fact, Parliament called on the Commission to prepare a Community initiative in the domain of sport, and in that same year a declaration on sport was annexed to the Treaty, calling on the European institutions to consult with the sports associations before proceeding to deal with any major sports issue. The Commission then launched the broad consultation process from which the Helsinki report drew its inspiration. I, myself, have been privileged to receive solid support from three presidencies, namely the Finnish, the Portuguese and now the French. It is my wish that this favourable combination of circumstances should serve to foster progress, so that sport can be given its due place within the activity of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, sport is in good health, maybe even in very good health. If we consider the revenue from television rights or from the sale of sportswear and sports equipment, we have to conclude that sport has never been on a sounder economic footing. It is clear, however, that this economic performance must not be tarnished by the threats that we have all identified together: the phenomenon of doping, the lack of protection afforded to young sportsmen and women, over-commercialisation and the violence that occurs inside and outside sports stadiums. A common approach must be adopted to address these problems. In its Helsinki report, the Commission clearly signalled that it cannot solve all these problems by its own efforts alone. There will be three levels of action: the world of sport, national decision-makers and the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">The world of sport comes first. Since 1989, the Commission has been regularly proclaiming its belief in respect for the autonomy of the sports organisations. But autonomy implies responsibility; it presupposes the will and ability to assimilate the new economic situation and adapt existing structures to the new realities of the sporting world. The federations, in fact, must make an extra effort to achieve internal democratisation and to adapt their structures to the needs of amateur sport on the one hand, and those of professional sport on the other. They must try to be more transparent in the way they manage sponsorship and television rights. And as long as the principles of solidarity and the social function, on which the European Parliament has laid emphasis, are clearly respected, we can provide for derogation in specific instances from the rules of competition, for example in connection with the collective sale of television rights. It must be perfectly clear, however, that a blanket exemption from these rules can never be warranted. Moreover, we are banking on transparency and dialogue. To that end, on 17 April I hosted a meeting in Brussels with all the European sports federations, and I shall do so again, together with Mrs Buffet, on 26 and 27 October. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We will organise a large European forum on sport in Lille, where we will once again arrange a dialogue between political circles and the European federations.</p>
<p class="contents">The second level is that of the national authorities. Even if the federal organisation of sport is identical throughout Europe, the way it is dealt with administratively varies radically depending on each state or even each region’s cultural and political traditions. Some questions have to be resolved at national level, in line with each state’s national laws and political approach to sport. Here I would also stress the importance of local authorities and councils, who are key players and need to be given a more important role to play. I would also add, in the same vein, that we must accord due respect for the small clubs and their countless voluntary workers who give sport a real civic dimension.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The third level is the Community level, which has to be involved solely in resolving questions that arise in relation to Community legislation and to underpin national measures, such as combating doping.</p>
<p class="contents">The Feira European Council asked the Commission to take account of the specific characteristics of sport and of its social dimension. There are nearly 600 000 sports clubs in Europe and 60% of young people who are members of an association belong to a sports club. These are the voters, Mr President, and I would be happy to see those who represent these voters listen to what I have to say, because it concerns them all.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Neither the European Parliament, nor the Commission, nor the Council can ignore the fact that the sports movement represents a real force in society. Can we pursue effective common policies without taking account of the role of the grass-roots sports organisations? I do not think so. And among the aspects I think are of major interest, I believe that the role and quality of physical education in schools come top of the list. We must not disregard the importance of protecting the education and the vocational reintegration of young sportsmen and women and sport is becoming a genuinely important part of the Youth programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with you that sport and physical activity form an excellent counterbalance to other activities. And I am convinced that we must make a special effort to protect young athletes more effectively. I know that Mrs Buffet fully shares the Commission’s views and I am also aware of Parliament’s views in this regard. To that end, the Commission has sent the Member States a questionnaire, asking them about methods to protect the health and education of young athletes, and I intend to submit a draft recommendation to the Member States on improving the protection of the education and health of young sportsmen and women.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, apart from the Youth programmes, other Community programmes, such as those on combating discrimination and gender equality, the disabled and minorities, must also take account of sport, as must the development programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to a final comment, Mr President, one that is important for the future. Do we need an article in a new treaty, or a protocol, in order to make progress in this area? As I have often told you, I am involved in performing high-wire acrobatics right now, without a safety net, and an article could provide the safety net I dream of. At the same time, though, we must keep our feet on the ground. Neither an article nor a protocol could, in themselves, resolve all the problems of sport. There is no miracle cure. First we must consider how useful these references could be and what we want to do. I will tell you my personal views.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not in favour of a protocol that would exempt the federations from the major Community principles. That kind of protocol would, moreover, make it quite impossible to take account of the social dimension of sport. I would also be against introducing an article in the Treaty seeking to harmonise sport in Europe. That is not our aim. But as your rapporteurs and many speakers have pointed out, the kind of article you are envisaging, similar to the one on education and culture that fully respected the subsidiarity principle, is, in my view, worth serious consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Pack’s 1977 report proposed organising a European Year of Sport. I have listened carefully to your messages today. You keep coming back to that idea, emphasising it, and I quite agree with you. I intend to submit a communication to the Commission on proclaiming the year 2004 the European Year of Sport.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Why 2004? Because, for the first time in this millennium, the Olympic Games will be held in Europe; even more importantly, they will be returning to their birthplace. So, we could not imagine a better opportunity to encourage the practice of sport, to promote its true values, to highlight its ethical principles, to revive the spirit of the Olympic truce. A European Year of Sport would underpin the work done by the Greek authorities, would emphasise the importance Europe attaches to sport and would remind the whole world that sport must bring people together. It would also show that Europe is a real force in terms of fair play, sport for all, and sport for the citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with that in mind, ladies and gentlemen, that, like your rapporteurs, Olympic champions that they are, I hope that those men and women who will be making superhuman efforts in Sydney in a few days’ time will all be winners, because true sport, fair play in sport, is not a question of coming first but of surpassing one’s own limitations. Let us, too, surpass ourselves in our endeavours to boost European sport.</p>

I am sorry, but many Members did, however, listen attentively to you. Some of them even gestured to me to resort to an Olympic sport – gavel-throwing – in order to silence certain other Members who were making too much noise. Unfortunately though, I only have one gavel: I would have needed 80 or 100 to throw at all the Members who were not listening to your speech.</p>

The European Parliament must denounce this barbarous and despicable act, which according to some eyewitness reports took place with the complicity or connivance of the Indonesian military authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this act occurred on the same day that the majority of Heads of State and Government were meeting in New York at the Millennium Summit organised by the United Nations itself, which demonstrates the weakness of this organisation and of the instruments at its disposal to protect men and women far from their own countries who were simply endeavouring to defend human rights and the rights of refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like you to convey a message of solidarity to the United Nations. I would also like you to inform the Indonesian authorities of the outrage felt by the Members of the European Parliament and to stress our wish that people whose sole objective is to defend peace, human rights and the dignity of the Timorese people, be they in Indonesia or in Timor Lorosae, should be respected.</p>

On various occasions throughout this year I have emphasised the potentially premature nature of the new policy being adopted by the European Union towards Indonesia, given that it is particularly clear that there is a degree of uncertainty. This has unfortunately become clear in recent weeks. I have addressed various questions to the Commission on this subject, and the seriousness of yesterday's events, together with other facts such as the infiltration of militias into East Timor, clearly demonstrate that the situation is not yet safe. The European Union must, once more, make its views known to the Indonesian Government as forcefully as possible, in particular through the channel of the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We understand the difficulty of the situation in Indonesia, but it is essential to demand that the Indonesian Government should exercise its authority on its own territory. We will only be able to change our attitude towards that country once democracy is effectively ensured in Indonesia and self-determination and peace are guaranteed on Timor. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Your predecessor in the chair has just apologised to Commissioner Reding and I think that the whole House would wish to endorse that verbal apology. This week we have demonstrated here in Parliament that when we want to call the Commission to order, we can do so and the Commission responds in the appropriate manner. But when a Commissioner is making an extremely important speech which demonstrates the amount of work and effort that she has put into a subject, which perhaps generates as much interest in the people we represent as anything else, there is complete chaos and a shambles in the Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not accept what your predecessor said, that it was difficult to call the house to order; that can always be done and it should be done. My request is that an apology to Commissioner Reding be now made in writing on behalf of Parliament and I hope this is not an experience we see repeated.</p>
