<p class="contents">The landfill directive is one of the most important environmental directives the European Parliament has dealt with in recent years. It marks the beginning of a major shift in waste management practice in Europe. For the public this is the end of an era in which many people in many countries have had to give very little thought to what happens to the waste they produce. Seven countries currently landfill more than half of the municipal waste they produce. These are Austria, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. For these countries in particular, this directive marks the end of what one might call the throwaway society. It also marks the beginning of an intensive period of innovation of waste management restructuring and, above all, of expenditure on other means of disposal by taxpayers. I represent part of the south‐west of England and a recent study that I did of the local authorities in the south‐west of England led me to the conclusion that most of them were thinking very hard about schemes for recycling and reuse and recovery of waste. However, none of them had actually been able to move near the kind of demands which this directive is going to make on them within the next five to ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">The three key features of the directive are firstly the promotion of the move away from landfill to what are considered more environmentally acceptable alternatives. I use the words ‘what are considered more environmentally acceptable alternatives" advisedly since I personally do not have much faith in the hierarchy of waste management alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the directive calls for the establishment of European Union wide standards for proper management of landfills; thirdly, it should result in the discouragement of the transport of waste across frontiers – waste tourism we call it – by removing the disparities between the practices and prices relating to landfill in the 15 Member States so that waste simply searches for the cheapest hole.</p>
<p class="contents">The Environment Committee, while welcoming the directive as amended by the Council, still wanted to insist on further amendments and it is these amendments which I move tonight since this is the second reading of this directive which is coming forward under the cooperation procedure so we will not, I regret to say, see it again.</p>
<p class="contents">First, as regards the timetable for implementation; at its maximum we will have to wait until the year 2020 before those Member States with more than an 80 % dependence on landfill, which are Greece, Ireland, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, have to reduce the volume of waste going to landfill to 35 % of the total in 1995. That is a very big switch indeed. But that is looking a very long way into the future. Think about it. Four Parliaments hence at least. We MEPs have therefore altered this grace period to two years and set the figure to be attained at 25 %. What we are saying is that at its maximum this directive should mean that by the latest 2018, all European Union Member States should only be sending to landfill 25 % of their 1995 totals.</p>
<p class="contents">Make no mistake about it, this directive does not rule out landfill as an option. Landfill will still be a very important option but it will be diminished from its present importance. This is going to be very difficult to achieve and we feel that the totals and timescales set out in the directive tend to represent, as so often in this House, the triumph of hope over experience. We have therefore submitted two amendments to Article No 5(2). The first would ensure that Parliament is involved in monitoring, over the next 20 years, what progress the directive is actually making. In Amendment No 10 to Article 5 we try to ensure that the directive does not become the kind of legislative <span class="italic">Titanic</span> sailing on into the iceberg of non‐compliance. Since the timetable set out for compliance is in three stages, we should surely monitor along the way whether compliance is satisfactory throughout Europe. If it is not, then we may need to take practical steps to make sure that in practice we get the high level of protection the directive demands. In the past the Commission has been reluctant to go along with the quite elaborate mechanism of reporting to it and to the European Parliament from the Member States which we would like to see. We believe that this system of reporting is our best hope of ensuring that this directive itself does not join other directives in, to change my metaphor, the landfill of non‐compliance.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Amendments Nos 14 and 16 represent the committee's concern that there are two important loopholes in the directive. First existing landfills below a certain size on islands would be exempt from considerable proportions of the directive altogether. We think that these should not be allowed to continue to operate without full public access to the record of what is dumped there. Secondly, we insist that Member States shall close any existing landfill sites which have not been granted a permit under the waste framework directive. It is a bad omen that such sites are still operating at all. The siting of landfills is extremely controversial. It is no part of our responsibilities to interfere in local planning matters but the committee agreed that we should set out our guideline in the annex for the desirable minimum distance between new landfills and residential areas.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I must present the report on behalf of the committee, although personally I am not in favour of some of the committee amendments, notably the refusal to place a time limit on liability for damage occasioned by land filling. I would be grateful if the Commission could comment on Amendment No 15 and its workability.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I commend this directive to Parliament. Once it is adopted, however, the work begins, especially in my country. Once we accept the directive's targets, we must put in place recycling and composting schemes – and we hope that we will get a composting directive before the end of this year – that will work and have good markets for what they produce. We must reduce the amount of waste we produce. We must make a bold assessment of the part that energy from waste incinerators can play in dealing with the waste that we must divert from landfill and take the necessary decisions, if we decide to take that route, to build such incinerators in the full knowledge that public opinion at the moment will have to be won around.</p>
<p class="contents">This evening and tomorrow when we vote, we pass the baton now to Members of Parliament and, above all, to local councillors in our various countries, some of whom may be here in the gallery tonight. I cannot think of a directive that better illustrates the partnerships that must exist between legislators at the European, national and local levels.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Malone </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Jackson for her work. I want to reassure her that people are interested in the environment but they are not interested in paying for the improvements we all want to see. I was a member of a local council for many years and I did not think it would take so long for the various Member States to coordinate action in this area. It is amazing that so little progress has been made. I represent one of the countries that has been mentioned among the guilty parties with regard to landfill. Therefore I have studied the report very carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">What I find most disappointing is the Council's attitude to this legislation. The Member States have placed the concerns of industry and their own cost concerns ahead of the interests of our citizens. I note in particular that the Council has failed to include minimum distances from residential areas for landfills which contain either hazardous or non‐hazardous waste. This is certainly a very contentious issue in my own area of Dublin.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has instead persisted with its vague commitment to consider the matter when the location of future landfills is chosen. I also oppose the Council's position that Member States should be given eight years, rather than the five years proposed by Parliament, to ensure that existing landfill sites comply with the terms laid out in this directive. I welcome the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection's support for the polluter pays principle and the proposal for a tax on waste going into the landfill sites.</p>
<p class="contents">I find it very ironic that Ireland has supported this common position. In a recent policy paper the Irish Government committed itself to reducing landfill and increasing the use of more sustainable means of waste disposal. As has been said, Ireland relies very heavily on landfill – I think only Greece is more reliant. So we have to wonder just how committed the Irish Government is to tackling the problem if it continues to support the Council's very watered‐down amendments. I would hope that the Commissioner present today will fight the case for consumers and for citizens who want to see the whole waste disposal and landfill issue dealt with in an environmentally friendly way.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Flemming </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very happy indeed to support the report presented by Mrs Jackson, because I believe this represents a great step forward in environmental matters for the whole of Europe. Although it will involve some tightening up in Austria, I have to say that a number of provisions already apply in Austria which it would have been impossible to gain acceptance for throughout Europe. I certainly tried to emphasise this by the way I voted in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to illustrate this point with a single example – Article 6, the classification of waste according to categories of waste. It is to be permissible to deposit certain types of solid non‐reactive hazardous waste on landfill sites for non‐hazardous waste. This relates to waste which is categorised as hazardous because of handling issues, that is to say where there is a risk of inappropriate handling, but which can in fact be deposited with other non‐reactive waste without any risk to the environment. This implies waste with low leachability. Such waste cannot be deposited in Austria unless it can be scientifically proven that it is not dangerous in landfill conditions. We have also developed a model for providing this proof. This chiefly relates to vitrified or solidified hazardous waste.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is a very important point which we will have to reflect on again in the future. Nevertheless, this directive represents a great step forward for Europe and I am therefore really pleased to give it my approval.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Papayannakis </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Mr President, first of all may I thank Mrs Jackson and congratulate her on her report. I would like, President, to make a few comments. Listening to this debate I feel as though I am from a different planet, living as I do in a country, Greece, which, as Mrs Jackson said, is one of those countries which depend heavily on landfills for the disposal of waste.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I agree with the proposal that there should be prevention, then recovery, followed by recycling, incineration and finally landfill. But in my country, Commissioner, virtually nothing has been done about prevention and recovery, and recycling has only been talked about. As for incineration, it has been recommended to us on many occasions, and even by the Commission itself. Is the Commission so much in favour of incineration? Personally, I have my doubts about incineration. I know that cities in Belgium, including Brussels, and recently Lille in France have come out against incineration, claiming that it causes serious environmental and public health problems. I would like a better response in relation to this issue before I cast my vote and declare that incineration is a way to solve the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point, with which I am in full agreement, is the taxation of waste destined for landfill sites. I find this a perfectly correct thing to do. But who decides the level of taxation? Who collects the tax and what is to be done with it? We are talking about a long period of time – three decades. In my own country local government does not have the power to raise taxes, which puts paid, at least for the time being, to this, in my view, perfectly reasonable solution.</p>
<p class="contents">A third point I would like to mention is this. What kind of authority is to be responsible for landfill sites? I agree with Mrs Jackson when she says that there should be a time limit. I would say, however, that I do not fully agree with her. If an authority is to have responsibility for a landfill site for 30 years after its closure and be permanently liable to pay compensation, then it absolutely has to be a public authority. I am not sure whether it should be centralised or decentralised, autonomous or independent, but it must be a public body. No other solution can be envisaged and this has to be said otherwise how, in 30 years" time, will I be able to find the responsible owner, who has meanwhile closed down his company or his establishment?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to make one further point, Mr President. We have not made sufficient reference to former debates we have had in relation to the severe problems that implementation of this legislation will entail for certain regions such as small islands and isolated mountain regions. The transportation of waste to sites which can financially justify this transportation is virtually impossible. Rather than look for loopholes in the legislation, we must find alternative subsidies to enable these regions to get rid of their waste in a hygienic and environmentally friendly way.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Collins, Gerard </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Mr President, I welcome the thrust of this report, which seeks to implement strict rules with regard to the operation of landfill sites within the territories of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The essence of the report includes the implementation of the following key provisions: procedures which must be met before a licence can be granted for landfill operations; the monitoring procedure during landfill sites' operational phase and closure; technical conditions to be met by sites and facilities which have to serve as landfill deposits; classifying the different sets of wastes which can be accepted in landfill sites across Europe and setting targets for the reduction of the amounts of biodegradable municipal waste being deposited in landfills.</p>
<p class="contents">European and Irish waste policies have to be based on a hierarchy of options, with prevention the most desirable and disposal the least desirable. However, the stark fact is that over 90 % of municipal waste is disposed of in landfill sites in my country, and four million tonnes of waste is produced each year in the continent of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Future waste disposal in Ireland does not and cannot rely on the continued search for landfill sites by local authorities up and down the country. I fully welcome the initiative taken by my government which has commissioned a study into the possible use of new, alternative forms of waste management and disposal. The government is right to look boldly at new ways of disposing of residential, industrial, commercial and agricultural waste.</p>
<p class="contents">Only 8 % of all municipal waste in Ireland is recycled and this figure is simply too low. We need to give consideration to all innovative options for waste minimisation so as to put in train the medium to long‐term process of eliminating the use of landfill sites in the future. This, in itself, would be a very bold objective. The government is presently formulating its national development plan outlining our social and economic investment priorities for the years 2000‐2006. I am very confident that, if proposals are included in this plan to deal with our waste problem in a novel manner, the European Commission will financially support alternative waste‐disposal methods during the next round of EU Structural Funds. The European Commission and European Parliament certainly want all Member States to take advantage of the cleaner new technologies which are coming on‐stream to deal with the problem of waste management.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of the Waste Management Act of 1995 is also a positive step in the right direction. Under this legislation local authorities are required to prepare waste‐management plans either individually or jointly, but I believe that there must be widespread public consultation in drawing up such plans. Finally, it is important that, as newer technologies come on stream, this process must involve the consent and widespread participation of the general public and local communities.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">McKenna </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – Mr President, I should like to ask the Commission to clarify Article 14. Authorities in some countries, including my own, are already planning to close down a number of landfill sites over the next two years. One of the important aspects of this legislation is after‐care. What I want it know is this: if, for example, these waste sites are closed down before the transposition into law of the directive, will they be exempt from the directive, in particular in relation to after‐care? That is one of the major problems. Some of the landfill sites that are being closed down pose major problems, so it is essential that these sites also come under the directive. There seems to be a slight confusion here.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most important aspects of this report that I want to raise is the whole issue of the distance of landfill sites from residential areas. We have been very disappointed with the response of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and its members who are there to protect public health, because they are basically saying that a suggested guideline is proposed in the text. That is unacceptable. It is like saying we will make legislation as suggested legislation, and you can do what you want afterwards.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been a number of recent reports – a very important study in <span class="italic">The Lancet </span> last year for example – which show that babies born within three kilometres of toxic landfill sites – and potentially all landfill sites – are more likely to suffer birth defects than babies born elsewhere. The research stated that residents within three kilometres of a landfill site were associated with a significantly higher risk of congenital anomalies and that systematic environmental health surveillance is needed for municipal landfill sites and other pollution sources.</p>
<p class="contents">It is extremely important that a precautionary approach is taken here. It is clear that the proximity of residential areas to landfill sites poses a huge risk. It is essential that this legislation makes it mandatory for local authorities and the authorities of the Member States to adhere to a minimum distance. We know that there have been cases of toxic waste being dumped in Member States, including my own, in sites that were not geared towards toxic landfill: local authorities in my own country have been found responsible for illegally dumping toxic substances like mercury into landfill sites which were not meant for toxic waste disposal. So there is a huge time‐bomb waiting to go off, if, first of all, these landfill sites are not covered by the directive and have been closed down before it enters into effect and, secondly, if no action is taken to ensure that any landfill site is beyond a certain radius from residential areas. It is not acceptable that public health be put at risk like this. We will be looking for a roll‐call vote on this aspect of the report tomorrow. It is essential that the voters in the Member States know how serious the Members of this House are about protecting the health of European Union citizens. Studies have shown that babies – the most vulnerable members of society – are at risk. There are other aspects of the legislation which are also extremely disturbing. In landfill sites which are geared to non‐toxic waste, there will be a loophole to allow toxic waste to be added, depending on what kind of justification is given.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the directive is an improvement on the Commission's proposal which we rejected in 1996, it still does not go far enough to protect the environment and public health. I would therefore like some clarification on Article 14 from the Commission. The directive must make it mandatory for landfill sites to be located beyond a certain distance from residential areas.</p>

I agree wholeheartedly with this order of priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Pollution has long been a concern in Europe and we in Galicia, Spain, face a problem with waste disposal that, in our opinion, has yet to be resolved. This relates to an urban waste incineration programme. A plant known as (...) is to be started up in Vila Boa, not the best choice of site since: </p>
<p class="contents">‐ firstly, it will be on the coast near the Galician river‐estuaries or <span class="italic">rias</span> , an area known worldwide for its fish stocks and as a tourist attraction; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ secondly, it will be located in the town of Vila Boa, which is densely populated and is near Pontevedra, a town already heavily polluted because of a cellulose factory. A river running through an extremely beautiful and fertile valley has been diverted to build a railway line which has spoilt part of the historic Portuguese route to Santiago de Compostela. A number of protests against the plant have been staged by local residents, with as many as 30 000 people marching, and messages of protest have been sent to the Environment Committee in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">It is up to the Commission to control waste elimination and processing plants like this one. Given that they are built with the aid of substantial European financial subsidies – as much as EUR 78 million in this case – there should be checks on where they are located, how they are built and how they are run. The Commission should also make sure that these investments are not only properly planned and carried out, but also used profitably.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Blokland </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, there are various options for waste processing. The solution to the waste problem must be sought in prevention, reuse and recycling. European waste policy must ensure that progressively less waste is dumped. I therefore agree with the rapporteur Mrs Jackson when she describes landfill as the very last choice on her list of possible waste processing methods.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, in the past, in other words between 1991 and 1996, attempts to introduce effective landfill regulations failed. The Commission proposal is a considerable improvement on the common position rejected in 1995. It is no longer the case that 50 % of EU territory is excluded from the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Every effort must be made to process biodegradable waste into compost and biogas, rather than landfilling or incineration. A good system of separate collection should make it possible to further reduce the 25 % norm for the dumping of such waste.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur"s proposal of imposing a levy on landfill waste. This must be based on the real operating costs, so that the taxpayer does not have to contribute. In this respect, we are concerned at the continuing practice of transporting waste to cheaper landfill sites or incineration ovens. There is a very large landfill site in Spain, for example, and this will not be closed until it is completely full, which will not be for some decades.</p>
<p class="contents">There are of course many uncertainties in regard to the protection and management of landfill sites. The risks of soil and water pollution remain very considerable, especially in the long term. It is my hope that the Member States will implement this directive effectively, but giving absolute priority to waste prevention, reuse and recycling.</p>

The release of dangerous substances into the soil and groundwater places an excessive burden on the environment and on public health. This is why we attach such importance to this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">We find it irresponsible to further delay appropriate legislation. We therefore believe the common position must be approved, as modified of course by the amendments proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect I believe the amendments on biodegradable waste are crucially important. The rapporteur is right when she says that it is much kinder to the environment to produce compost and biogas from biodegradable waste than to dump it or incinerate it. I support this view.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I believe the rapporteur is being too cautious by proposing no more than a guideline on the minimum distance of landfills for urban waste. I do not believe this is a matter for subsidiarity. In this instance we prefer the amendments tabled by the Green Group, which seek to impose a minimum distance of half a kilometre for urban waste and two kilometres for hazardous waste, the precautionary principle taking priority over that of subsidiarity.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Banotti </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Mr President, coming as I do from a small country which landfills 99 % of its waste, I am particularly anxious to make a few remarks about this extremely important directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive allows a 20‐year period for countries which landfill more than 80 % of their waste to come into line. But small countries like Ireland simply do not have 20 years! We are going to have to address this problem a lot more quickly, in particular we finally have to address the extremely sensitive issue of incineration which in most countries, I believe, causes local problems when it is mooted.</p>
<p class="contents">Many years ago somebody asked me what I thought were the five most important environmental issues of our time. I answered: number one is waste, number two is waste, number three is waste, number four is waste and number five is waste. It remains perhaps one of the most intractable problems facing all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also say that I would like to have seen the directive slightly stronger on the protection for redundant landfill sites, because resistance to landfill and also to incineration is very often directly connected to the fears of those who live near these sites that they will not be adequately maintained and protected. We also need finally to take seriously the question of the sorting of waste into recyclable groups of waste and of course, the recycling of treated waste.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the rapporteur. We have relied very much on the leadership of the Commission to push this as a political issue in our country. I am very happy to support this report.</p>

It underlines the fact that we are primarily addressing local and regional authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that there are three important points which warrant repetition because they should always be at the forefront of our minds: landfill must be a last resort; all sites must be secure and monitored; and all costs must be covered. It is easy to state these three requirements, but fulfilling them will be rather more difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the regions are constantly calling for the implementation of the principle of subsidiarity and for the autonomy to enable them to implement the relevant legislation, we must nevertheless appeal to those whose responsibility it is to comply with it. This legislation is very important, and yet there are thousands and thousands of unregulated sites. Even worse, in small villages there are official sites on steep riverbanks and waste is incinerated daily. It is incredible that this should be happening in this day and age, but it is.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Parliament is sending a very clear and positive message, and that we should congratulate the rapporteur on reaching this overall result. The European Commission is also to be congratulated of course, as it kept this proposal alive for years despite the many difficulties it encountered, even, it has to be said, in the Council of Ministers.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Watson </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – Madam President, I would also like to congratulate Mrs Jackson on the substantial amount of work she has done on this. As a Liberal Democrat I always favour measures which protect and enhance our environment and there is much in the Commission directive and in this report which does just that.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I believe that good legislation should be practicable. And I am surprised that the rapporteur, coming as she does from the south‐west of England, believes that Amendment No 11 which reduces the time allowed to Member States to postpone attainment of targets from four to two years and Amendment No 17 which reduces the compliance timetable by three years from eight years to five are practically achievable. Indeed, Amendment No 17 may lead to the rapid adoption of new means of disposal which will mean less sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">In the south‐west of England we landfill more than 85 % of our waste. We have a rapidly growing level of environmental consciousness leading to much composting and much landfill geared specifically to the production of biogas. Indeed, I launched a report this morning called ‘The Greening of Somerset" in which we pointed to what Liberal Democrat authorities have done in this direction. We are proud of our record. We are making great strides but I will vote against Amendments Nos 11 and 18 because I believe they are almost impossible to attain, will demoralise the industry and add very substantially to the costs imposed on waste site operators and on local authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I favour the use of legislation to push, to coax and to accelerate change but there are many ways to crack an egg. Using a sledgehammer is only one of them. These two amendments are the sledgehammer approach.</p>

<p class="contents">However, although these will go some way to improving the existing situation, I fear – and I do not here wish to make a prediction – that the future situation will not be radically different. I have listened to talk of measures stretching over 30 years, of measures which will come into force very gradually. However, all the waste materials destined for burial, incineration and so on are multiplying at a very dangerous level and at a much faster rate than the measures put forward by the Council and the Commission and those put forward by us in this House. We run the risk – that is, those of us who introduce such measures – of being buried along with those waste materials, because of the speed, or lack of it, with which we are moving to tackle the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I have heard the word ‘prevention" being bandied about. What does this mean? Who is producing this waste? Who is the main source, the person responsible for the excessive production of waste? Is it the individual, the citizen? And why is it that never before have we had such a rampant increase in the amount of waste? The answer is clear to all: at the root of the problem lie certain industries, certain conglomerates, which produce and sell for profit, without the slightest regard for the waste generated as a consequence.</p>
<p class="contents">Prevention, therefore, must be carried out at source, so as to reduce the volume and the hazards of waste. Prevention through the management of the reduced amount of waste produced either as a result of recovery or through alternative waste management methods. Only a tiny proportion of waste should be destined for landfill, in conjunction with preventive measures to ensure that such waste does not harm people"s health, the environment, or the eco‐system. I have not seen, nor have I heard talk of, such measures, and this is why I have expressed the fears that I have.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to say that this hesitation on the part of the Council and the Commission owes more to their reluctance to confront those chiefly responsible for this wretched situation. Take the bull by the horns and face up to the problem with courage. Parliament will be right behind you and you will have public opinion on your side. Madam President, in every corner of the Community, epic battles are being waged to avoid landfill sites being opened up. By contrast, there are numerous interests that wish to establish landfill sites in certain regions and set up incineration units etc. from which they can obtain kickbacks, rake‐offs and profits. Such are the multitude of lobbies which are milling around the issue. Liberate yourselves from the nightmare of lobby pressure and confront this problem, which is a matter of life and death for our society.</p>

As we move towards a new Millennium we are facing new problems associated with the wealth which is being created and the extra economic growth. One of these problems is how we dispose of our waste. For many years landfill was seen as the easiest and least expensive option. However, the studies which have been carried out – and referred to here – on public health and, in particular, the health of children and babies, show that there is an urgent need to take action to resolve this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome Mrs Jackson's report. It is, in the main, a balanced approach to tackling this problem. In particular, it highlights the necessity for increased use of regulation to ensure that all Member States take action at the same time. However, it also points to the fact that some Member States are more advanced than others, I believe we should also now focus on the new opportunities and new technologies available to us. Using waste for renewable energies, recycling some other types of waste and incineration are among those that have been mentioned. The dangers associated with incineration in the past have generally been overcome as a result of technological progress. Also, with new designs of landfill sites, certain of the dangers have been eliminated.</p>
<p class="contents">I would draw Members' attention to Amendment No 7 where we lay down guidelines allowing non‐hazardous waste and inert waste to be excluded from the scope of the directive. However, we should not allow this amendment, if it is adopted, to be a <span class="italic">carte blanche </span> for those who want to abuse the directive. It is there merely to help those Member States that are lagging behind or that cannot catch up quickly enough with regard to new technology.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the action of the Irish Government in initiating a process whereby the extra options will be looked at. With the reform, under the Agenda 2000 proposals, of the structural and cohesion funds, perhaps an opportunity could be found to make new funding available, not only for research and development as regards how the new technologies may be best adapted but also for cooperative programmes between the local authorities and the Member States at a local, as well as a European Union, level to try and resolve some of these difficulties and problems.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that there is no simple solution to the problems of the excess waste which is now being created. There is no one simple answer. There are a range of multi‐faceted options which can help to alleviate the problem. The waste can also be turned to good use through the different processes. Unless we are willing to cooperate with each other and learn from the best practices available, we cannot hope to resolve these difficulties. I commend the bulk of this report to the House. My group will be supporting its general tenor.</p>

It is particularly important to say that the approach to waste management has to be based on prevention, reuse and recycling; incineration and dumping, both of which involve potential risks to health and the environment, ought to be the exception and not the rule. And so it is important that we put a stop, as soon as possible, to the dumping or incineration of the organic biodegradable component of waste. Our aim has to be the production of compost or biogas and, on that point, I hope the Commission will transmit to us the proposal for a directive on composting as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I should add that if a number of different measures are applied to separate out, at the start, those components of waste that can be reused and recycled, and if compost is produced, all we shall be left with is inert waste that can be managed much more easily, avoiding the need for incineration which in any case leaves us with ash that has to be dumped.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me end by saying that it is important that we approve the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, but it is also – and I stress this – necessary to take the steps required to establish a mandatory minimum safety distance from residential areas.</p>

The amendments comprehensively cover issues required for the landfill directive. I would especially like to stress the importance of two points, in Amendments Nos 6 and 7, which deal with the disposal of non‐hazardous waste. Non‐hazardous waste is defined as that which has undergone no significant physical, chemical or biological change. This includes waste produced from mining and its associated refining processes, or by‐products of that industry. By‐products include surface material, quarried host rock and sand, which are stored in the area of the mine or service area and are used in mining, for example as filler for extra support and safety, or which may be processed further.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of sustainable use is immensely important and is something we should all be aware of. Let us exploit what materials we can. It is unreasonable to classify this sort of non‐biodegradable but otherwise still useful extracted material as landfill. Further measures simply need to be taken. Mrs Jackson has understood this very well, and included it in her proposal. Finally, I would like to ask the Commission why it still has not made any distinction in its own report between hard, non‐biodegradable, non‐hazardous stone, and biodegradable materials.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bjerregaard, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DA)</span> Madam President, I am very glad that the European Parliament has put landfills on the agenda today, because we have been making steady progress with this proposal on waste dumping. But also, listening to the debate today or reading the report, one can see that we are now well on the way to an important result. It was with great interest that I read the draft report adopted by the Environment Committee, and I would take this opportunity of saying thank you to the committee, and in particular to Mrs Jackson, for the great effort which has been put into preparing this proposal. Many views have been presented today on the significance of this report, both in relation to consumers and to the citizens of Europe in general. But I will not dwell on that. I share these views. I shall concentrate on the amendments, partly because that is the way we debate these proposals, but also because the amendments are important and worthwhile and because they will make the Council's common position more consistent and the procedures more transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, I can tell the House that the Commission is able to accept 12 of the 19 amendments adopted by the Environment Committee. I will comment on them individually. I entirely agree with Amendment No 1, which provides a new recital indicating the Community's prioritisation of waste management options. The Commission can also accept Amendment No 4, which stipulates that the costs of the financial security must be included in the price charged for the dumping of waste. The same change features in Amendment No 12, which can also be accepted. Amendment No 3 as well, which indicates that taxes on waste going to landfill can help to achieve the directive's objectives, is acceptable provided that it refers to initiatives at Member State level.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the Commission cannot promise to bring forward a new proposal to promote the use of economic instruments in the form of a tax on waste going to landfill, as proposed in Amendment No 13. Amendment No 2 calls for a proposal for a new directive on composting, which was raised by Mr Eisma in particular. I entirely agree with Parliament that composting of biodegradable waste is an environmentally friendly solution for this type of waste. So the Commission has already begun the preparatory work for an initiative on composting. However, I cannot accept the way in which this call is made in the amendment and so the amendment itself must be rejected, although of course not the work which has already been set in motion.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to see that Parliament associates itself with the desire of the Commission and the Council to reduce the dumping of biodegradable municipal waste. I am particularly happy to see that Parliament, in Amendment No 8, is seeking a return to the final target of 25 %, which had been in the Commission proposal. The common position provides for reasonably long‐term reduction targets for the Member States. Mrs Jackson commented on Amendment No 11 in particular. I agree with what she said, in other words that Member States which currently send more than 80 % of their waste to landfill should only be allowed an extension of two years to achieve the targets.</p>
<p class="contents">It is however crucial that the reduction targets for biodegradable waste in Article 5 remain unchanged and legally binding. Only in this way can we ensure that the Member States have optimum chances of planning, initiating and implementing alternative procedures for the management of biodegradable waste. The Commission cannot therefore accept Amendments Nos 9 and 10.</p>
<p class="contents">I must stress that the Commission cannot agree to more exemptions than those contained in the common position. The common position already contains many exemptions – one could say too many – which were not in the Commission proposal, and I do not think we should make this list any longer. I have special misgivings regarding Amendments Nos 6 and 7, which Mr Crowley referred to in particular. Their effect would be to exclude from the scope of the directive the use of non‐hazardous waste for redevelopment and construction purposes and the dumping of non‐hazardous waste from mining operations in landfills. The Commission cannot accept these amendments. We cannot guarantee satisfactory environmental protection if non‐hazardous waste can be dumped without regard to the provisions of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 15 specifies the site operator's responsibility in the period subsequent to closure, and it was an amendment which Mrs Jackson was specifically concerned about. I agree with the aim of this amendment. The wording of the last sentence concerning liability for damage is not entirely clear, however. The Commission can accept the amendment in principle, if the last sentence is to be understood in such a way that liability for closure and subsequent monitoring does not affect any national laws on the liability of the waste producer.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a serious problem with illegal landfill sites in the Community. This emerges clearly from the many complaints and petitions which the Commission receives and, along with Parliament and as a number of speakers have pointed out this evening, we think that this situation has to change. The Commission can therefore accept Amendment No 16, which demands the closure of such sites.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 19. It is the technical committee mentioned in Article 16 of the Commission proposal which has to determine the specifications in the annexes. The annexes are to be viewed as a whole, and the Commission cannot guarantee the necessary environmental protection if some of the parameters in the annexes are altered at this stage. The Commission can however accept the change to Annex 1 which Amendment No 18 would involve, namely reinstatement of the requirement of a minimum distance to landfills. I realise that the amendment does not introduce any legally binding minimum distance, as in the third Commission proposal. Both Mrs Malone and Mrs McKenna mentioned this in their speeches.</p>
<p class="contents">It is instead a suggested guideline for a minimum distance to recreational areas, waterways, water bodies and other agricultural or urban sites. As you know, the Council could not accept a binding minimum distance as contained in the Commission proposal and in Amendment No 20. I hope that the Council will be able to accept this looser way of securing a minimum distance to landfills. So for the moment I prefer Amendment No 18 to Amendment No 20, but it is mainly because I believe that this will give us a better chance of getting the proposal adopted by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I will just mention briefly that the Commission can accept Amendment No 17 on the time‐limit for existing landfills, Amendment No 14 on supervision of landfills which are exempt from the directive and Amendment No 5 on the definition of liquid waste. Mrs McKenna asked me specifically about Article 14, which provides that operating landfills must meet the requirements of the directive. Landfills which are closed before this directive is transposed into national law are thus not covered by the requirements of the directive. This means that, under this directive, we do not have any scope for dealing with such a situation. I naturally therefore hope that the Member States will act responsibly, but I stress that it is important to remember that existing landfills must of course comply with Article 4 of our framework directive on waste, which already now provides that landfills must be licensed and that waste must be dumped without hazard to humans and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that the European Parliament will adopt this text, which guarantees a high level of environmental protection. Many of the amendments point in the right direction and tighten up the environmental requirements contained in the Council's common position. I am therefore very pleased with this constructive support from the European Parliament. I will do my utmost to ensure that we get an environmentally responsible directive on the landfill of waste adopted as quickly as possible.</p>
