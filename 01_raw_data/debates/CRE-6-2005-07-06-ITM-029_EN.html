<p class="contents">I understand that the position is that the British Museum considers the British Museum to be the best place to house the Parthenon sculptures.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Torture by proxy</span></p>
<p class="contents">In the face of the absolute ban on torture and other forms of ill-treatment, states have defended the practice of transferring purported terrorist suspects to other countries, by insisting that they seek diplomatic assurances that detainees will not be tortured. However, there is mounting evidence that, both within and outside the European Union, certain states have seized and rendered terror suspects from one state to another, which is widely recognised as employing torture as an interrogation technique. Victims allege that they have been tortured and that the sending states actually provided the recipient authorities with lists of questions to be answered during interrogation. In the context of these reported practices, ‘reliance’ on diplomatic assurances constitutes a clear attempt to pervert justice that must be exposed and brought to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the prohibition on torture and other forms of ill-treatment is an erga omnes obligation, what steps does the Council plan to take to prevent such violations and provide remedies once they have occurred? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Member States that allow their territory to be used in this way and allow flights to leave in such circumstances are colluding in serious and persistent breaches.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Outcome of Egitim Sen case in Turkey</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Turkish Supreme Court decreed on 25 May 2005 that the teachers' organisation Egitim Sen would be disbanded. The organisation will lose its right to represent almost 200 000 members in dealings with authorities or employers.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation stems from Egitim Sen's support in its constitution and policy documents for the principle that all children should have the right to tuition in their mother tongue and that all individuals should have the right to personal development on the basis of their own cultural background. The Supreme Court considers this to be contrary to the Turkish Republic's Constitution, which stipulates that all education shall be in Turkish.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already acknowledged that Turkey maintains substantial restrictions on the right of association, the right to collective bargaining and the right to strike, and that Turkey still does not meet International Labour Organisation standards.</p>

The decision is especially disappointing after the case had twice been dismissed by the Turkish Labour Court, which had noted that mother-tongue education is permitted under European law. Again I would reiterate the general point in relation to freedom of expression that free speech is beginning to take hold and beginning to flourish in Turkey. Recent reforms include allowing broadcasting and teaching in Kurdish and constitutional amendments strengthening the freedom of the press and recognising the supremacy of Turkey’s international human rights obligations.</p>

In any event, it may be recalled that the Council has been steadfast in its support for the pursuit of efforts to achieve the reunification of Cyprus and in its desire to see all Cypriots living together as citizens of a reunited island within the European Union in the near future. It is against this background, and with this in mind, that the European Union has been examining measures capable of putting an end to the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community and facilitating the reunification of Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">More specifically, as regards the Commission’s proposals relating to part of the instrument of financial support for encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community and the exchanges with zones where the Republic of Cyprus exercises no effective control, Council bodies have already carried out important work. The fact that certain difficulties – particularly as regards direct exchanges – remain to be overcome, means that these two proposals still cannot be adopted. However, the Council can use the Presidency’s good offices to assure the honourable Member that it will continue working to encourage the island’s economic integration and to improve contacts between the two Cypriot communities and within the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the substantive point of the need for direct trade with Northern Cyprus and the query that was directed to me in relation to the views expressed by others, the Council’s position remains that which has been previously stated. We continue to believe that direct trade will help to narrow the gap in economic development between the north and the south of the island, promoting economic cooperation and business ventures between the two communities. Assisting the economic integration of the island would also boost significantly the prospects for reunification, since it would make a settlement easier and, frankly, less costly to accommodate.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the specific actions that will be taken under the United Kingdom’s Presidency, the Government wishes to see these regulations agreed as soon as possible, in order to fulfil the Council mandate to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots.

In that declaration it was pointed out that the European Union is committed to supporting national reconciliation and respect for human rights and democracy in Burma and a request was made to the state Peace and Development Council to enter into a genuine dialogue with the NLD and with ethnic representatives to find peaceful political solutions that take into account their legitimate concerns. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our commitment in Burma is to promote human rights, democratisation and sustainable development as far as we can, using all the tools available to us. The European Union remains, I am delighted to say, at the forefront of international efforts to press for improvements in human rights in Burma. Opposition groups, including the National League for Democracy, acknowledge and welcome the continued political and practical support of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights violations have been highlighted in successive highly critical resolutions on Burma in the United Nations General Assembly and in the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. The Burmese authorities can be in no doubt about our views. The EU troika expressed our deep concern over the situation in Burma directly to the Burmese Foreign Minister in Kyoto on 6 May.</p>
<p class="contents">We continue to believe that it is essential for the regime to enter into a genuine and inclusive dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy, and with ethnic representatives. Only such a dialogue can promote a peaceful democratic future for all Burma’s people.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, add this additional remark. While I am proud of the work that the European Union and European Member States have taken forward on this issue, I think it should be recognised that it is also important for other Asian neighbours of Burma to continue to take action and step up their efforts on the human rights abuses. The failure in previous resolutions before the United Nations to secure the active support of other Asian partners to the kind of initiatives necessary to bring this degree of pressure to bear on the Burmese regime was a matter of disappointment to us. So I can assure you that from the Presidency’s point of view we will maintain the pressure at European level, but we are cognisant of the responsibility of others outwith Europe as well to continue to make the case for change to the Burmese authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As for the protection of minorities, the honourable Member is kindly reminded that legislation has already been adopted in an effort to tackle discrimination on grounds of racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age and sexual orientation.

<p class="contents">Under the United Kingdom Presidency, the Council, as well as the European Parliament, will deal with the European Commission’s proposal for a decision on the European Year of Equal Opportunities For All – i.e. 2007 – built upon four key themes: rights – raising awareness of the right of equality and non-discrimination; representation – stimulating a debate on ways to increase the participation of under-represented groups in society; recognition – celebrating and accommodating diversity; and respect and tolerance, promoting a more cohesive society. The total proposed budget is EUR 13.6 million, which would cover preparatory actions in 2006, as well as the activities due to take place during the European Year itself in 2007. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, it was the subject of lengthy discussions this morning with the Council of Europe, which has expressed similar concerns in terms of how we avoid duplication. Sometimes, the language that is used in terms of synergies and complementarity should not mask the important question that he has asked in terms of the importance of being rigorous as regards the role of the FRA.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is necessary for the Presidency to be clear that steps will be taken to ensure that the FRA avoids duplication, as his question suggested. The Presidency has worked closely with the Council of Europe, which supports the establishment of the FRA. We believe that the FRA management board could include a representative of the Council of Europe and an observer from the proposed European gender institute in order exactly to avoid the kind of duplication raised by the question. This is a matter on which we will need to have continuing watchful eyes. In that sense, I am grateful to him for raising this question. It is not a matter that will be finally be resolved today, but it merits continued and detailed reflection in the weeks and months ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No. 9 by Paulo Casaca (<a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2005-0470_EN.html">H-0470/05</a>)</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Use of public telecommunications services for incitement to violence in Lebanon</span></p>
<p class="contents">After well-founded hopes of a democratic future for Lebanon, the latest events are giving rise to some pessimism, in particular the murder of journalists and the low turn-out rate in the elections – in particular by minority religious groups – in areas under the control of the pro-Iranian ‘Hezbollah’ militia.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most frequently used methods of disseminating their message of hatred and violence has been to broadcast their programmes via the telecommunications company HISPASAT, which is partly owned by at least one Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Does not the Council consider that such action is in conflict with the ‘Television without Frontiers’ Directive, in particular Article 22 thereof, and goes against the conclusions of the Council of Ministers for Education, Youth and Culture of 23 and 24 May 2005?</p>
<p class="contents">When can the Council offer guarantees that the Lebanese will cease to be the target of incitement to terrorism via European public media?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No. 10 by Charles Tannock (<a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2005-0554_EN.html">H-0554/05</a>)</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Broadcasting of al-Manar television and the persisting violations of EU Directives</span></p>
<p class="contents">Although it has been confirmed by all audiovisual regulatory authorities that content of al-Manar programmes violates the European Directive on Television without Frontiers, al-Manar continues to be broadcast in Europe and from Europe to other regions of the world: The Spanish (partly Government owned) Hispasat and France's Eutelsat continue to provide broadcast capacity to al-Manar.</p>
<p class="contents">It is surprising that although Hispasat is aware of the hate content of al-Manar it has not yet taken concrete action to suspend such heinous broadcasts, considering that in France, Eutelsat has received orders by the Government to take al-Manar off the air and has complied with these orders.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Saudi-owned Arabsat and Egypt-owned Nilesat continue to provide al-Manar directly to European viewers in most of Europe and calls on young people to carry out suicide bombings.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Council going to raise this issue with the Spanish, French, Saudi and Egyptian governments to ensure that this situation is stopped as a matter of urgency?</p>
<p class="contents">How can the EU maintain that it is taking all its responsibilities seriously in the fight against terrorism when channels such as al-Manar are able to continue undisturbed their promotion of terrorism through the media in spite of the situation having been known for a long time?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No. 11 by Frédérique Ries (<a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2005-0561_EN.html">H-0561/05</a>)</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Al Manar TV</span></p>
<p class="contents">In March 2005 the European Commission convened a meeting of the European Audiovisual Regulators (EPRA) where it was reiterated that Article 22a of the Television without Frontiers Directive explicitly prohibits any broadcast that incites hatred for reasons of race, sex, religion or nationality. At the meeting it was also agreed that such provisions also apply to third-country broadcasters using a frequency, satellite transmission capacity or an uplink to a satellite belonging to a Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Al-Manar incites hate, violence and suicide bombing, spreads antisemitic material and does not respect fundamental rights. Al-Manar is being broadcast by using satellite services and capacity of Hispasat (partly owned by the Spanish Government) and by Globecast, a subsidiary of France Telecom. From its Beirut office, the al-Manar signal is also sent to Arabsat (<span class="underline">www.arabsat.com</span></p>
<p class="contents">), and Nilesat (www.nilesat.com.eg</p>
<p class="contents">) whose footprint extends to most of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the Council doing to stop this form of terrorist propaganda which reaches Europe and other regions of the world?

<p class="contents">As the honourable Members are aware, the Council is committed to the fight against incitement to hatred in broadcasts. Article 22(a) of the Television Without Frontiers Directive provides that Member States should ensure that broadcasts do not contain any incitement to hatred on grounds of race, sex, religion or nationality. However, the directive does not apply to broadcasts intended exclusively for reception in third countries, nor to broadcasters not under the jurisdiction of a Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the measures taken successfully by the French, Dutch and Spanish authorities on the basis of the directive, Al Manar is no longer broadcast by any EU-based satellite company and the Television Without Frontiers Directive no longer applies to it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council discussed the issue of incitement to hatred in broadcasting from countries outside the European Union at its meeting on 23 May 2005 and took stock of work initiated to respond the problems posed by satellite broadcasting of non-EU channels in the European Union. This followed a meeting of the presidents of national broadcasting regulatory authorities on 17 March 2005, which agreed to reinforce cooperation between the regulatory authorities and identified concrete measures to strengthen this cooperation, notably information exchange regarding channels authorised in Member States, establishing a contact point within each national authority. In the Council, delegations took note of the measures and proposals outlined to combat incitement to hatred in broadcasts. They recognise that consideration should be given to the means of combating more effectively the broadcasting of such material in the context of the revision of the Television Without Frontiers Directive, notably the adaptation of this instrument to the most recent technological developments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having said that, I would like to ask Mr Alexander two specific questions, because our information on latest developments seems to differ, as do our interpretations of certain articles in the Television Without Frontiers Directive. France has therefore ordered Eutelsat to stop transmitting the signal. Very good. What of Globesat, which is a subsidiary of France Télécom and which has not, as far as I am aware, stopped providing the signal to other satellites that, in turn, transmit this signal beyond the borders of the European Union? Your answer appeared to me to be rather vague about the intentions of Nilesat and Arabsat, the Egyptian and Saudi satellites, which, by my reading of Article 2(4), are indeed covered by the provisions of the Television Without Frontiers Directive. As you know, we have an association agreement with Egypt, so will this issue be raised? Has it already been? We have a Council on 13 December: do you intend to discuss it then?

In the European Council declaration on combating terrorism of 25 March 2004, the Union and its Member States pledged to do everything within their power to combat all forms of terrorism in accordance with the fundamental principles of the Union, the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and the obligations set out under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the Council recalls that all EU Member States are party to the Montreal Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the safety of Civilian Aviation, which makes it an offence to endanger the safety of an aircraft in flight and requires states that have custody of offenders either to extradite the offender or submit the case for prosecution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In reply to Question <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2005-0377_EN.html">H-0377/05</a>, the Council representative stated that 21 Member States had notified the General Secretariat of the Council that they had transposed the framework decision, but in two Member States the draft legislation transposing this decision had been, or would soon be, put before Parliament and that one Member State had announced that it had transposed the decision in part.</p>
<p class="contents">The supplementary question put by the honourable Member was aimed at finding out what the situation was in the 25th Member State. On the basis of the information obtained, the Council can inform you that the 25th Member State – namely Italy – has informed the General Secretariat of the Council that the provisions implementing the Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 on joint investigation teams and the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of 29 May 2000, are contained in draft law C2372, tabled by the government on 20 February 2002 and currently undergoing scrutiny in joint committees 2 – justice – and 3 – foreign affairs – of Italy’s Chamber of Deputies.

<p class="contents">Africa, because the continent contains 18 of the world’s poorest countries. It is currently not on target to meet any of the UN Millennium Development Goals first set out at the Millennium Summit in 2000. The continent needs a step change in development, financing, health, education, governance and the capacity to trade in global markets and programmes for dealing with killer diseases and building African peacekeeping capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">Climate change is our additional priority, because it is clear that our world is warming up. Major irreversible change in our climate is a real threat and the most important issue we face in the long term. Tackling the problem needs a global approach. The summit is an opportunity to move forward the debate at the highest political level and to help forge a common vision.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union plays a leading role in both issues and has already agreed policies on them. The G8 agreement does not bind the European Union, but may serve as a catalyst for future discussions within European Union structures.</p>
<p class="contents">The G8 Summit outcome may give rise to discussion in the relevant Council formations. For example, the 12 July Ecofin meeting will discuss development financing. All political and legislative initiatives at European Union level will, of course, follow the normal EU procedures for discussion, agreement and adoption as appropriate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe it allows an opportunity for effective synergies to develop between the work of the European Union and indeed of the G8.</p>
<p class="contents">The evidence I would cite in support of that contention is already clear. If one considers the truly historic decision taken by European Union Development Ministers within the last month to effectively double the level of aid provided by European Union Member States by 2010, from approximately USD 40 billion to USD 80 billion, it is clear that it has already established a very important benchmark for the G8, as it gathers in Scotland this week.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union deserves fulsome tribute and credit for its long-standing interest in issues of development related to Africa. If I might be so bold, with the permission of Parliament, I think the United Kingdom also deserves credit in this instance for having decided to put the issue of Africa at the top of the international agenda of this week’s G8 meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say, however, that the conclusion of this discussion will not be at the conclusion of the G8 Summit this week. In the course of our European Union Presidency over the next six months, there will, of course, be this week’s G8 Summit in Gleneagles. There will then be the Millennium Review Summit in New York in September, followed by the next critical Ministerial Meeting of the Doha development round in Hong Kong in December.</p>
<p class="contents">Each of those represents a vital staging post on the onward march of progress towards helping many of the world’s poorest countries and the peoples of Africa. If you need any further illustration of the critical contribution that European Union institutions can make to that progress, one need look no further than the decisions that will be reached in Hong Kong in December, where I personally hope the European Union’s Trade Commissioner will be able to advance an agenda that is pro-growth in Europe and pro-poor in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are definitely in agreement that the peoples of Europe care passionately about the issue of development. I attended the rally that took place in Edinburgh, in my country of Scotland, at the weekend. If, like me, you had been able to see in excess of 200 000 people gathered in that city, you would have been in no doubt whatsoever about the extent to which both the European Union and the Government of the United Kingdom are acting with the full support of people from right across Europe in pursuit of the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it must be recognised, notwithstanding the level of public support for the action we have taken and, I hope, the further steps that we can take this week at Gleneagles, that the scale of the challenge we face is profound. If you take, for example, the Millennium Development Goals, and in particular their aspirations for sub-Saharan Africa, the timescale set out by world leaders back in 2000 was 15 years for the achievement of those Millennium Development Goals. At the present rate of progress in sub-Saharan Africa, some of these Millennium Development Goals will be met not in 15 years but in 150 years. We are categorically of the view that this is too long to wait. That is why we are so proud of the work that European Union institutions and European ministers of development – and, indeed, as reiterated in a decision by Ecofin when it met last month – have carried out in relation to advancing the cause of development in recent months and weeks and why we are determined to use the opportunities, not just of our Presidency of the European Union, but also the opportunities presented by the G8 this week, the Millennium Review Summit in September and the Doha talks in December, to try to continue to advance this vital and important agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The present Treaty is quite clear on this point in relation to Article 152(5). As such, the Council has no competence as regards euthanasia and so it cannot create legislation on this issue. It cannot specify the roles and responsibilities of healthcare workers regarding euthanasia because Member States have the sole competence in this area. It is therefore for Member States to ensure that they have procedures and provisions in place to define the roles and responsibilities of medical and nursing staff.

In a statement issued in the aftermath of the elections, the Presidency expressed its grave concern regarding the situation in Togo following the elections on 24 April and paid tribute to the people of Togo who took part in the ballot despite difficult conditions. The Presidency also condemned the wave of violence and launched an urgent appeal to all the parties to restore calm.</p>
<p class="contents">In a declaration issued on 3 June, the European Union expressed its support for the initiatives taken by the African Union through its Peace and Security Council, in particular the appointment of a special envoy to facilitate dialogue between the Togolese parties and the decision to send an observer mission to monitor the political, security, social and humanitarian situation, as well as the human rights situation in the country. The European Union also urged the Togolese authorities to carry out an impartial, exhaustive and credible investigation into the acts of violence against the civilian population.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union raised the issue of Togo at the latest ministerial meetings with the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States, held on 11 April and 18 May respectively. During those meetings it had the chance to discuss the complexities with regard to African mediation efforts and election monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union declares that it is ready to support the national reconciliation process and it will continue to monitor the political situation in Togo closely, particularly in relation to the 22 engagements undertaken by the Togolese Government during the consultations under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement and reproduced in the Council Decision of 15 November 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The next legislative elections in Togo figure among the election monitoring priorities established by the Commission for 2005.

<p class="contents">As a Member State of the European Union, Cyprus is entitled to play a full part in all aspects of the CFSP, whereas it does not participate in those aspects of the ESDP concerning EU military cooperation with NATO, in accordance with the relevant agreements between the two organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in all EU-NATO meetings, and in the context of EU institutional procedures, Turkey prevents Cyprus and Malta from participating even in matters not involving direct military cooperation between the two organisations, by taking a very broad interpretation of the North Atlantic Council's decision of 13 December 2002. The same situation also arises in EU meetings on the grounds that documents containing NATO classified information are being discussed.</p>

Likewise, they do not receive NATO classified information or EU classified information containing or referring to NATO classified information.</p>
<p class="contents">This state of affairs necessarily has implications for Cyprus and Malta’s participation in EU-NATO meetings, as well as in some internal EU meetings. It will not, however, affect the rights and obligations of EU states in their capacity as EU members, in particular the entitlement of Cyprus and Malta under the EU Treaty to participate fully and without discrimination in defining and implementing the CFSP, including defence aspects. The Council is fully aware of the problem and, in the absence of complete resolution of the issue, has been raising it constantly over the past year with the parties involved. Turkey has been asked to help resolve the problem, but for the time being the complexity and the wider implications of the issue have made it difficult to achieve much real progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Questions on how the North Atlantic Council interprets and applies its own decisions, including that of December 2002, should properly be addressed to NATO. I note, however, that requests to extend the scope of EU-NATO dialogue beyond military cooperation in crisis management have come mainly from NATO. The Council is happy to consider such an extended dialogue, provided that all 25 Member States are present at the table. I should also like to note that, at the most recent meeting between the European Union Political and Security Committee and the North Atlantic Council on 27 June 2005 in Brussels, it proved possible to hold a formal exchange of views on Darfur with all 25 EU Member States participating. I would like to consider this a first, even though small, step forward to more significant progress on this difficult issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consequently, the European Union aims to encourage a process of transition to pluralist democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and sustainable recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people. This approach has never been called into question by any of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has taken a firm position, especially in relation to the human rights situation which, according to these conclusions, should be raised at every high-level visit. This Council has also expressed regret at the lack of any further advance since the release of several political prisoners imprisoned in March 2003. It has, in particular, condemned the action taken by the Cuban authorities to curb freedom of expression, assembly, and freedom of the press.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Council has categorically condemned Cuba’s unacceptable attitude to foreign parliamentarians and journalists who attended the Assembly to Promote Civil Society, on 20 May 2005, and were either expelled or denied entry into Cuba.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, closer relations with the peaceful political opposition and with broader sectors of Cuban civil society through intense and regular dialogue decided at the end of January have produced satisfying results. The Council decided to maintain this dialogue and indeed intensify it according to the agreed guidelines. These meetings of representatives of the European Union and of the Member States with the peaceful opposition will continue to take place. The Council has decided to reconsider its position in the context of evaluation of the common position in June 2006. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
