The Commission is putting particular emphasis on open markets and the role of trade in growth and jobs. This is why we are such staunch defenders of multilateral trade rules and why we continue to fight against protectionism in fora such as the WTO and the G20.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout the economic crisis, we have managed rather well to maintain open markets and avoid the easy trap of closing them, which would have had very grave consequences. This is no different when it comes to our relations with the United States. We remain in close contact and address barriers where they arise, bilaterally or through the WTO system. The Transatlantic Economic Council plays a crucial role in preventing trade-distorting measures through a focus on non-tariff barriers, and I must say that this new approach agreed last year by Deputy National Security Adviser, Mike Froman, and Commissioner Karel De Gucht, is working well.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole idea of the Transatlantic Economic Council is to prevent divergent regulations before they arise, through upstream regulatory cooperation. In other words, working together in areas where we are just beginning to regulate in order to avoid barriers tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">This is at the heart of moving closer to a transatlantic marketplace where further integration will work for the creation of jobs and growth. Estimates put the number of jobs depending on transatlantic trade at 15 million and our joint aim is to strengthen this. The recent announcement of the American Jobs Act, which the honourable Member was referring to, would, according to available information, subject the proposed new spending on infrastructure to ‘Buy American’ requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">While this initiative is still at the stage of legislative proposal, we are closely looking into its details and potential impact on EU suppliers. We are raising our preliminary observations with our US counterparts both bilaterally and in the framework of the WTO Government Procurement Agreement. Our immediate aim is to ensure that the rights of our suppliers are not limited. We are generally concerned about such measures being envisaged or adopted by any trading partner. We believe that open trade should be promoted as an essential requirement for fast recovery. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, when I read what the United States is currently planning and proposing, it says, and I quote, </p>
<p class="contents">‘None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this Act may be used for a project for the construction, alteration, maintenance or repair of a public building or public work unless all of the iron, steel and manufactured goods used in the project are produced in the United States’. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Ladies and gentlemen, quite simply, this is intolerable and we must make that very plain to the Americans. This has nothing to do with partnership and friendship, it is pure protectionism which, incidentally, also does harm to the Americans themselves, as they are well aware. I therefore wish that the Commission would not stop at statements in the plenary of this House, but would take a truly active role.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish that we would finally bring an end to our purely defensive strategies. Why not try a big shot for once? We are doubtless all aware of the major economic difficulties in which the United States currently finds itself. We can also see, however, the crisis in which many Member States of the European Union currently find themselves. Why do we not use this opportunity to approach the Americans and propose that we set up a joint transatlantic project that might jump-start our economies on both sides of the Atlantic through a mutual pact for work and employment, for growth and the stimulation of our economies? I am firmly convinced that, instead of our current defensive approach, which involves attempting to hold the Americans back from lunacy, we should take the offensive and consider whether we can create a joint package with the Americans, that, taken as a whole, could drive forward the economic conditions in the world’s leading economies. I would be very grateful if the Commission were to take an active role in this area.</p>

We can all see that there has been no progress within the framework of the WTO for years now, and that the Americans have certainly played a crucial part in that stalemate. This legislative proposal is likewise certainly no indication that the Americans are serious about opening up markets, which is what could take us all forwards. It is therefore all the more important that the Commission should finally take a new direction. What I just proposed – namely, that we should attempt to conclude a real transatlantic pact for growth and employment in order to produce a joint stimulus package for both economies on the two sides of the Atlantic – could perhaps be an approach to maybe hold back the Americans from lunacy – I am repeating myself here – and truly make a difference to the strongest economies in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The world is certainly sending some undesirable signals with regard to the approach we must take in order to relaunch the economy, with our focus being mainly on regulating the financial markets and, to a lesser extent, on the possibilities of developing the global economy. We have to move away from the debate between those in favour of economic rigour and those who support growth, because Europe and the rest of the world need rigour in the management of their public debt and public resources, but they also need to grow, and we need to be seriously concerned about the protectionist signals coming from the United States, from Argentina, from Brazil, with the introduction of new taxes, and from parts of the world such as the Mercosur countries, which are facing difficulties today.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore pay a great deal of attention and understand that the world markets have to be extended, safeguarded and broadened, and that we have to eliminate barriers in order to encourage growth. Mr Caspary’s proposal was very interesting, and I think that as part of the logic of opening up world markets, we should have a far-reaching Marshall Plan, a new Marshall Plan for developing countries, so that they can compete with the major players that compete with us. On the same day that the House rejected President Obama’s plan containing the ‘Buy American’ provisions – which we oppose – the United States Senate passed a law on the issue of the yuan and the strengthening of the yuan against the dollar.</p>
<p class="contents">These are also measures which must be seen in the context of a new way of managing world monetary policy. Alongside an open global trading policy, we need to safeguard EU interests, and we also need a new Bretton Woods agreement to define the world’s monetary framework. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is, however, a serious discrepancy between EU and US measures that is a reason for concern. The protectionist tendencies in the US Jobs Act seem to block access to public procurement for EU-based companies. This is of concern not only to this Parliament, but also to large sections of the US business community itself, where it is feared that the Jobs Act is out of step with a balanced US procurement policy, and that it will undermine the US ability to grow exports and jobs by accessing foreign markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Countermeasures may well result, such as those we saw in 2009 from the Canadian side. Trade is necessary for job creation, and trade is global. In global trade, the US should not alienate one of its closest partners, the EU. We both face the challenge of the emerging economies and we also have a number of opportunities, such as the development of a comprehensive, transatlantic growth and jobs initiative – which would include plans for the removal of remaining non-tariff barriers to trade and investment by 2020 and steps towards zero tariff levels for certain types of product.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that the Senate has voted against the Jobs Act in the US, this should be the moment for the EU to address some of our problems again. Can the Commissioner explain whether he sees a difference between the impact of ‘Buy American’ and that of ‘Buy America’ – applying respectively to public procurement at federal and local levels? These remarkably similar titles could easily confuse people. Is ‘Buy America’ applicable to Canada and to EU partners, despite the WTO general procurement agreement, as Canada and the US business community argue, or is Ambassador Kirk right in rejecting these concerns? Will the Commission push for reciprocity in the public procurement rules between the EU and the US at both the federal and local levels?</p>
<p class="contents">The asymmetry between US and EU access to markets is striking. I would like to learn from the Commission what the results of conversations with the Americans on this subject have been so far, and whether it proposes that flexible rules or measures should be introduced on the EU side, should that be necessary. I would also like to ask what this Parliament and the Transatlantic Economic Council could do to help the Commission sustain openness and global trade between the two sides of the Atlantic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I totally agree with what Daniel Caspary said. We are at a crucial stage in the world economic crisis and the US has G20 commitments to which it must adhere. We should be working together to bring both our economics together in difficult circumstances. Furthermore, the US should be further integrating its economy into those of the western world, especially those with whom it shares values. This is because of the rise in Asia. Daniel touched on some of the problems there. Let me just remind the Commissioner – who said that Commissioner De Gucht had made an agreement a year ago – for public procurement in the US, there is a 25% tariff on anything that goes in from outside the United States. If that is shared values, then there is something wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">I am going to ask the Commission if it can answer two questions. Does the Commission consider closer economic integration towards a transatlantic market place a realistic goal? What action does the Commission intend to take to develop, together with the United States, an involving comprehensive transatlantic growth and jobs initiative, which would include plans to remove the remaining non-tariff barriers to trade and investment in 2020, the so-called ‘transatlantic market’, and to take steps towards zero tariff levels in some product areas?</p>
<p class="contents">While I have been in this Parliament – and I have been involved in the Committee on International Trade for quite a while – there has been an ongoing battle with the United States over Boeing and Airbus. The WTO ruled recently in Airbus’s favour. What has happened? What has the Commission done to ensure the survival of the European industry? It is vital for jobs at a time when the economy is suffering. I call upon the Commission to look further.</p>
<p class="contents">I see the Commissioner is leaving now, so he cannot answer the questions. I will leave it, Madam President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It should already be clear that, without changing the policies and fundamentals of the economic and monetary union, it is impossible to prioritise jobs with rights, and the elimination of poverty, social exclusion, and society’s inequalities and injustices. We would therefore stress the urgent need for an employment and social progress pact, and the abolition of the current SGP once and for all.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time to terminate programmes of veritable aggression towards the workers and peoples of Greece, Portugal and Ireland currently being imposed by the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the Commission. As the struggling workers and peoples in various Member States are demanding, it is time for a break with the monopoly capitalism policies that are exacerbating the economic situation and causing profound social injustices in the majority of our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">All this is happening at the same time as they are preparing to give billions of euro to the banks, transferring their debts to the public sector. In other words, these debts will be transferred to the workers, young people and women who are in precarious situations or are unemployed; to the pensioners without a decent income; and to the small and medium-sized enterprises that can no longer withstand the financial throttling and the sharp decline in the public’s purchasing power.</p>
<p class="contents">The key issue in this debate, more than worrying about what is happening in this area in the US, is knowing what the leaders of the EU, the Commission and the Council will ultimately propose in order to reverse the severe situation of unemployment, precarious and poorly paid work, and poverty and social exclusion currently being experienced in various EU countries, and which will become exponentially worse if they persist with these policies.</p>

We have holiday entitlements. We have a job tax – called national insurance in my country – which is absolutely huge, so the employee does not actually get half the money that is being paid by the employer.

<p class="contents">On the one hand, we could smile laconically at the fact that when the chips are down, the strong players adopt protectionist measures and the principles of fair competition that they preach when it suits them are cast aside at these times of crisis. On the other hand, though, I find a certain amount of assertiveness in its own way attractive. The assertiveness with which the American administration approaches the solution to the economic crisis could be, in its own way, an inspiration to us in the European Union. Let us try to set aside the question as to whether the law violates the rules of free trade or not. The zeal with which the US President Obama presented the law before Congress is something that European leaders are unfortunately lacking at both a national and a European level.</p>
<p class="contents">The assertiveness with which the United States of America presents the argument in accountable political circles that the crisis is not primarily about the deficit, but about the economy and employment, is indeed impressive and inspirational. I believe that from a certain angle, this could make an impression on us and I reiterate that it is my belief that this should inspire, in particular, our national leaders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span> </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(SV)</span> Madam President, I agree with the criticism directed at this package and President Obama’s attempt to obstruct free trade. We know, after all, that a free market economy and free trade are the way to bring about progress and better economic conditions for the whole world. Now this comes as no surprise and it is the Democrats, in particular, who are not making sufficient effort to stand up for free trade. The Republicans may be wrong in many respects, but they have always been better when it comes to free trade.</p>
<p class="contents">I certainly think that a number of Members of this House can also consider Europe’s experience. Yesterday, we had a proposal for an agricultural policy that involved anything but free trade, and there are many proposals in the European Parliament that advocate restricting trade even within Europe. However, I hope, and I share Ms Schaake’s assessment (and incidentally, she is not in the Chamber), that right now, when Congress does not really know which way the decisions will go, we have the opportunity to negotiate a better proposal that takes account of both the economic problems in the US and the economic problems in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, it is the deficits that are the absolutely fundamental problems, and we must get away from these deficits in both the US and Europe. That is the only way that we can have a viable economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish by pointing out that the Tea Party movement in the United States is making it more difficult for President Obama to produce a reasonable proposal, which is something that we should not forget. May we be spared the Tea Party movement in Europe – otherwise it will be even more difficult to produce proposals based on sound economic policy that will create prosperity on both of our continents. I would like to say that President Obama is a good friend and a good combatant when it comes to Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We often discuss the financial crisis and rescuing the banks and the euro. Incredible sums of money have been made available that should have been enough to boost employment throughout the world and thereby conquer hunger.</p>
<p class="contents">We talk far too little about the people whose real existence the crisis has hit. The banks that we are to rescue have driven millions of people into unemployment through their speculation whilst also, at the same time, irresponsibly gambling with people’s pension funds.</p>
<p class="contents">With the American Jobs Act, President Obama is seeking to finally put the fate of these people back at the heart of politics. His idea of removing financial burdens from businesses that take on new employees is a good one. European policy should learn from the example that the United States is setting.</p>
<p class="contents">The non-policy of strangling the life out of the economy through lunatic austerity measures must be brought to an end. In difficult times like these, I also give my firm backing to the use of public procurement resources to promote local production.</p>
<p class="contents">So, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, whoever it is sitting over there, I urge you to use the upcoming Transatlantic Economic Council in December to tackle the issue of unemployment in a concerted manner in this context and to prevent a downward spiral, while counselling a joint new start for economic, employment and social policy. Be sure that the European Parliament will be very actively involved in the transatlantic dialogue between legislators. The Occupy Wall Street movement has not only earned the support of millions of Americans; it will, I hope, also act as an inspiration for the population of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I, too, would like to point out a different aspect of this American Jobs Act, namely, that it takes a radically different approach from what current European leaders are doing. We should pay attention to this and take it into account when drawing up plans for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Although Congress did not pass it at this point, the bill formulates diverse proposals which are important to us, for example, infrastructure investments that create jobs, the reduction of taxes on work, investment into education, this being based on the same recognition that we, too, have often pointed out, namely, that without education, there can be no real economic upturn, as well as helping job retention in the public sector, increasing the duration of unemployment benefits – as we know, unemployment benefits for many people in the US will expire in the near future – and the reduction of long-term unemployment through various means.</p>
<p class="contents">The package is based on the realisation that there is no better answer to deficit than economic growth, job creation, and support to education. This is a lesson that we, Europe’s leaders, should also learn. European decisions have so far been belated and weak. They in fact exacerbated and prolonged the crisis rather than actually mitigating it. The next European Council meeting will be of historic significance. The real question is whether a European investment and growth plan will be conceived, or if we will at least see some outlines of such a plan in the near future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And your idea of a transatlantic pact is a fools’ deal, against our jobs, because free trade and competition will inevitably prevail.</p>

However, conservative forces in the US Senate blocked their approval for two days in a stance paralleled in Europe by the austerity six-pack; our only approach to the severe economic crisis we find ourselves in. The ‘Buy American’ provisions enshrined in the American Jobs Act which emulates Obama’s approach in the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is understandable in the face of US unemployment figures, but protectionism is not the way out of the economic woes afflicting both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

However, the benefits of this almost uninterrupted economic growth have not been enjoyed equally by all.

The problem has been further compounded by the current economic crises, the effects of which are being borne mainly by the lower classes.</p>

This philosophy is reflected in the employment legislation proposed by Barack Obama. The bulk of new jobs are not created in jet aircraft factories, shipyards manufacturing luxury yachts or financial institutions speculating in global markets, but in enterprises that provide goods and services for mass consumers. It seems that any potential economic growth will be achieved not only through reducing budget expenditure but, first and foremost, through stimulating consumption.

This by no means represents disrespect on the part of the Commission for remarks made in the European Parliament. This change was necessary because Commissioner De Gucht is working on exactly what we have been discussing today, namely free trade in Korea, and my colleague, Mr Šemeta, had to go on an urgent trip to Moldova. But I would like to assure you that all your remarks and questions have been properly noted and that, if you are not satisfied with the answers I provide, I will be very happy to continue our discussion in written form.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the topic we have been discussing today, I would like to thank you very much for putting this very important issue on our European agenda. I think you are right: when it comes to protectionism, the Trade Barriers Commission has to behave very responsibly and very actively, which is exactly what we always try to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that you very rightly pointed out the specificity and importance of the trade relationship between the United States and the European Union. If we look at the size of the relationship and the size of the economy – and, as was rightly pointed out by one of the honourable Members, there is the feeling that the future of American trade lies with Asia – I always say: let us have a look at the real figures; let us have a look at how big the GDPs of all the big countries are. And you know that all of them together have a smaller GDP than the United States, and that the United States has a smaller GDP than the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, our trade relationship is a most robust one. It creates 15 million jobs on both sides of the Atlantic, our trade represents more than 400 billion in trade goods and more than EUR 260 billion in services and, if you look at mutual investment in mutual stock options, we are talking about more than EUR 2 trillion. So it is a very solid and robust trade relationship, and therefore it requires appropriate care.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we are investing a great deal of energy in TEC contacts and in TEC cooperation between the Commission and the United States, represented by the White House in this particular case. We know how much we can gain if we are able to remove just one of the barriers and how much we could lose if new barriers are erected. This is exactly the approach the Commission and Commissioner De Gucht will take at the upcoming very important negotiations, whether they be part of the EU-US Summit at the end of October or the subsequent TEC meeting, which should take place a day later.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to assure you that we remain in close contact with our American partners; that this issue, which was raised by several Members of the European Parliament, will be followed very closely; and that the Commission will do all that is necessary to defend the rights of EU businesses and EU job holders and to protect the good economic and business environment between the United States and the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The recent American Jobs Act is aimed at creating as many jobs as possible, returning to work people who have lost their jobs and investing as much money as possible in employment policy. This Act received support in Congress, and the United States expects the country’s economy to move forward. It is vital for the European Union that the United States economy should recover because it is one of the world’s most important economic markets. The European Parliament stresses that we need to overcome the existing barriers to global trade because we must strengthen transatlantic trade relations. The European Union itself must also combat the current ever-growing unemployment, poor working conditions, poverty and social exclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
