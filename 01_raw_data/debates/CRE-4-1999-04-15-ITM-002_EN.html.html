<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Söderman, </span> <span class="italic"> Ombudsman. ‐</span> Mr President, let me begin by saying how grateful I am for the opportunity to address the European Parliament concerning my annual report for 1998. This is the fourth annual report of the European Ombudsman and the last to be presented during this legislature.</p>
<p class="contents">When the annual report for 1997 was dealt with by Parliament, some critical voices suggested that the Ombudsman had success in only a small number of cases. This view was reached on the basis of all the complaints received, including those which were outside the mandate. I do not believe that this way of judging the results of an Ombudsman is really fair. There is not much to be done about a complaint which is outside the mandate other than to advise the complainant or transfer the complaint to a competent body. We have done that in almost 80 % of such cases so that citizens do not usually leave us empty‐handed.</p>
<p class="contents">In many cases these complaints could be dealt with effectively by an Ombudsman or a similar body at national level. We therefore try consistently to promote the idea that these non‐judicial bodies be encouraged and assisted in dealing with complaints from European citizens concerning Community law. Although there have been calls to broaden the mandate of the European Ombudsman to deal also with complaints against national authorities, especially in cases concerning freedom of movement, I still believe it is preferable to create an effective system of cooperation with the national ombudsmen and similar bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">During 1998 the Ombudsman's office received 1372 new complaints, compared with 1181 in 1997 and 842 in 1996. We also closed 185 enquiries with a reasoned decision as compared to 101 in 1997. In 45 % of these cases the institution settled the matter, a friendly solution was found or the case was closed with a critical remark. In 1997 and 1996 the figures were 40 % and 35 %. During 1998 no maladministration was found in 52 % of the cases in which an inquiry was carried out. A finding of no maladministration is not always a negative result for the complainant. The institution or body has to explain its behaviour to the complainant and, in some cases, even manages to convince the complainant that it has acted correctly.</p>
<p class="contents">Today is the right moment to try to summarise what we have achieved together so far in cooperation with the Committee on Petitions and the European Parliament. Firstly, we have achieved a practice of cooperation in dealing with complaints and petitions which has been described in the annual reports of both bodies. Furthermore, we have developed a fruitful dialogue through the committee's reports on the annual reports of the Ombudsman, beginning with the first report by Mrs Ahern, through the reports of Mr Papakyriazis, Mr Newman and, this year, Mrs De Esteban Martín. For example, the call in the Papakyriazis report for a clear definition of the term ‘maladministration" led me to offer a definition in the annual report for 1997. Following Mr Newman's report, the European Parliament adopted a resolution welcoming the definition. The practice of smooth and efficient dealings with the Ombudsman's reports in the European Parliament has now been properly and formally established by bringing Parliament's Rules of Procedure in line with the Statute of the Ombudsman and by expressly providing for the competent committee – the Committee on Petitions – to deal with both the Ombudsman's annual and possible special reports.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, an own‐initiative inquiry into public access to documents, supported by the committee through the report by Mrs Thors and by the European Parliament, has led all the Community institutions and bodies concerned to adopt rules on public access to documents, except for the Court of Justice. We have recently written to the European Central Bank to enquire if it has already adopted rules on public access to documents.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I should like to refer to the idea of a code of good administrative behaviour, which was first mentioned in the Perry report on the Committee on Petitions' own activities for 1996‐1997 and supported in the Newman report on the Ombudsman's annual report for 1997. It appears likely that such a code will soon become a reality, as the European Commission has adopted the draft in its first reading before the Commissioners resigned. The new Commission may of course even improve the draft before adopting it.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we have managed to improve the administrative procedure the European Commission uses in its role as the guardian of the Treaty when dealing with complaints or petitions from European citizens. The procedure has become more open and effective as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say a few words about the recent revelations and accusations about fraud and corruption in the European administration, in particular within the European Commission. An open administration makes most cases of fraud and corruption very difficult to carry out and extremely easy to detect. A closed administration, on the other hand, that conducts its business through secret meetings and the holding of secret files and documents creates precisely the murky circumstances that enable fraud and corruption to flourish. So openness is an effective tool in preventing and fighting fraud and corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">In the present administrative practice, there is still an old‐fashioned principle of exaggerated hierarchy. This principle, when applied, leads to a lack of motivation amongst those staff who really interact with the citizens. It makes all kinds of malpractice easier because the properly‐acting staff cannot speak about their concerns over the activities of the institution. If civil servants cannot speak and write about their daily work without the consent of their superiors, this does not encourage a motivated and sound atmosphere in the workplace. So more transparency and less old‐fashioned hierarchy would give more motivation to the staff and spare the EU administration many of its troubles.</p>
<p class="contents">In improving transparency, it is essential that the new regulation on public access to documents under the Amsterdam Treaty be adopted as soon as it is possible to do so. It must contain modern and comprehensive principles in this domain.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also essential that the Statute of the European Ombudsman contain a clear provision to give the Ombudsman the right to inspect all necessary files and documents, if unnecessary and time‐consuming disputes with the institutions are to be avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the Committee on Petitions supports my initiative in this respect in the De Esteban report. I hope that this position will be confirmed by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to use this opportunity to thank all the Community institutions and bodies for another year of constructive cooperation. I wish especially to address the Commission and its member responsible, Mrs Gradin, and thank her for her commitment to an open administration. My thanks are due also to the chairman of the Committee on Petitions, Mr Fontana, and all the members of the committee for their supportive attitude in their contacts with the Ombudsman's office. Special thanks go to Mrs De Esteban for her professional and competent work in drafting the report now before you. Thank you for your attention.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">De Esteban Martín </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (ES)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should firstly like to congratulate the Ombudsman"s office and its services on the transparency and speed with which it has provided details of its activities not only to Parliament and the Committee on Petitions but also directly to citizens and associations in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This House has always defended the institution of the Ombudsman as guarantor of the protection of citizens" rights in cases of possible maladministration on the part of Community institutions and bodies. It has also always defended the need to enhance the relations between these institutions and the public. However, protecting the rights of Community citizens would not be enough if closer collaboration and cooperation were not fostered between Parliament, through the Committee on Petitions, as the committee responsible, and the Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no coincidence that the defence of citizens" rights is the chief aim of both institutions. This collaboration should therefore continue to guarantee these rights and the democratic work carried out by the Union in order to enhance the credibility of our administration.</p>
<p class="contents">The institution of the Ombudsman constitutes one of the most important elements for European citizenship. It is also important in improving the democratic control of the Community administration, democratic control that can be seen as the task of this House, as the body which directly represents the people of this Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the annual report presented by the Ombudsman, we must highlight the rise in the number of complaints submitted, a development the Ombudsman himself mentioned. A total of 1 372 complaints were lodged this year, 191 more than last year, which goes to show how important the Ombudsman is in the eyes of the public in terms of rectifying the alleged irregularities that may occur in the administration of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the years, Parliament has noted the increasing interest the public has taken in the European institutions and how the decisions taken here affect their daily lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Making administration more transparent and accessible to the public is one of the main aims of all the national administrations in the Member States. Therefore, the Community administration should not aim at anything less and should endeavor to make such accessibility a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">This House has adopted various reports on the transparency and simplification of Community law which have brought us closer to achieving this aim. An important step that needs to be taken to create harmony between the Community institutions and our citizens is to actually draw up a code of good administrative behaviour to increase the level of trust between officials and the public and to ensure that the code is accessible and easily understood by all.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must be aware that this code should not overlook the specific nature of each of the Community institutions. For example, I believe that within the European Parliament, given the nature of the institution, such a code should be negotiated with all the political groups.</p>
<p class="contents">With this same aim of promoting collaboration between the institutions and the public, it is important to highlight the involvement of citizens in the preliminary infringement proceedings provided for in Article 169 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, I think that it is vital for the Ombudsman"s work to ensure that his statute is amended, as I mention in the report, in order to allow him as effective access as possible to the documents related to the inquiries he is involved in.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the work carried out by the Ombudsman in the field of information and communication serves as a good example for other European institutions, especially as regards the use of new communication technologies, for example, the use of the Internet to make the institution more accessible to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">However, and this is something that the report also refers to, we need to make greater efforts to provide citizens with proper information on their rights so that no one is prevented from exercising his rights through ignorance of how to proceed.</p>
<p class="contents">This information should be provided by the Community institutions through the press and the audiovisual media. In this way, we would avoid, among other things, a situation whereby more than 69 % of the complaints submitted to the Ombudsman in recent years have been beyond his remit, for example, the many complaints every year about restrictions on the freedom of movement.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I should like to acknowledge the efforts of the Ombudsman in his relations with national and regional ombudsmen. Such collaboration will clearly enhance the role played by these authorities and might lead to a system whereby those matters that one authority is not empowered to deal with may be passed on to the relevant body elsewhere, which will be able to resolve them more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve all of the aims that we have outlined, the office of the European Ombudsman must respond effectively to our citizens, which is why the report congratulates Mr Söderman on the commitment he has shown in trying to ensure that his secretariat functions properly.</p>
<p class="contents">Although his efforts are appreciated, it is clear that for the secretariat to function properly, we must firstly have sufficient financial resources and we must also draw up a statute for the officials that work for the Ombudsman.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Newman </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span><span class="italic">rapporteur. ‐</span> Mr President, the right to petition is an important aspect of European citizenship. The right to petition can be exercised by all residents of the European Union, not just EU citizens, and by organisations based in the European Union. Petitions are admissible if they come within the fields of activity of the European Community. This definition is wide enough for the Committee on Petitions to apply common sense and political judgment in deciding whether a petition is admissible or not.</p>
<p class="contents">During the past five years of this mandate 10 million people from all 15 European Union Member States have signed over 6 500 petitions. These fall into two broad categories: those raising individual problems and those raising broader policy questions. The areas most concerned are social security and pension problems often arising out of worker migration, free movement of persons, recognition of qualifications, taxation including VAT, environmental issues and animal welfare issues.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Committee on Petitions has only administrative and secretarial support. It does not have an investigatory staff. Therefore, our investigations into the grievances of petitioners rely on officials of the Commission and the Member States' representations to the European Union. The Commission officials cooperate greatly in our work and we thank them for this. Nevertheless, for those minority of petitions which find fault with the Commission, it is obviously not good practice that we are so reliant on the Commission staff.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Member State governments – who do not seem to be represented today – through their representations to the European Union or collectively as the Council, their cooperation with the committee is usually only the minimum level possible and they are not prepared to send officials to the committee to argue the merits of petitions with committee members. Member States need to be more positive and to reply fully and promptly to requests for information and action addressed to them by the Commission concerning petitions.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally during our meetings the committee members have and do exercise the most vital role in questioning and urging on the Commission officials and in the decisions we make. In fact, if it appears that petitioners are being unfairly treated or fobbed off we take up the cudgels on their behalf. In a number of cases every year a petition leads to the opening of formal infringement proceedings under Article 169 of the Treaty against Member States not implementing European Union law correctly, to the detriment of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The analysis of the infringement procedures since 1996 shows a minimum of 97 total cases linked to petitions out of 535 cases relating to direct complaints for which the Commission sent letters of formal notice thus initiating infringement proceedings. These figures indicate that petitions play an important role in the detection and handling of infringement cases. In its annual report on the application of Community law, the Commission should clearly identify the cases where infringement procedures under Article 169 were initiated through petitions. This is underestimated at the moment. The Member States must improve the action taken in cases in which infringements are reported.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament's information brochure for the public on the right to petition states that petitions often reveal practices in a Member State which are contrary to the letter or the spirit of Community legislation. In some cases the involvement of the Community authorities has prompted the national authorities to apply Community law more correctly. As a result of petitions the European Parliament has had a positive effect on the daily lives of citizens and has been able to act to find a solution to actual cases involving matters within the Community remit. This brochure needs circulating much more widely than at present.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish by saying that, as the only MEP with continuous full and active membership of the European Parliament's Committee on Petitions since its formation twelve‐and‐a‐half years ago in January 1987, I hope that MEPs elected to the new Parliament will ensure that they continue to take seriously the right of European citizens and residents to petition the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">As this is likely to be my final speech to the European Parliament meeting in plenary session, I want to thank all those people whom I have worked with over 15 years' membership of the European Parliament and, in particular, the good people of Greater Manchester Central who under the fine individual constituency system I have had the honour to represent since 1984. I thank you and them.</p>

As he told us, he has been a member of the Committee on Petitions since it was created in January 1987. I entered Parliament in March of the same year, and ever since then I have been a member of the Committee on Petitions, where I have been able to observe his efforts and his achievements on behalf of the European people. I should like to express my sincere thanks to him for that and for this annual report. May I also thank Mrs De Esteban Martín for her report on the Ombudsman's annual report. Both of them, like Mr Söderman himself, have presented reports which show very comprehensively that dialogue with the people is an indispensable element of European democracy and will remain so.</p>
<p class="contents">What this means for us is that the Committee on Petitions is the interface between the European people and their Parliament when it comes to enforcing Community law. Regrettably, that fact is all too often disregarded by national, regional and local authorities, whether out of unawareness or because of a combination of bureaucratic power and national self‐seeking. By acting as that link, we have been able to assist in some cases, for example in securing recognition of academic or professional qualifications and provision of welfare benefits, as well as in solving petitioners' specific problems.</p>
<p class="contents">So that this direct contact with the citizens of the Union continues to be guaranteed in future, we in the committee are unanimous in advocating the preservation of a separate Committee on Petitions. In order to overcome the general information deficit among the people of Europe as regards their rights, we call on the relevant administrative departments of Parliament and the Commission to establish telephone advice centres in the Member States, and in particular to go on developing the whole sphere of information and communication technology with all the opportunities it offers.</p>
<p class="contents">Our cooperation with the Ombudsman has always been extremely fruitful. For that I should like to reiterate my sincere thanks to Mr Söderman who, in his wrangling with European administrative bodies, has never been deterred by the initial placatory answers he has received from administrators but has insisted on a satisfactory response. His initiatives and enquiries have brought greater transparency and openness to the European bureaucracy. Indeed, the draft code of conduct for good administrative practice which the Commission presented in January was developed as a result of his own initiative, together with that of Mr Perry.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore call for the Ombudsman to be given access to all documentation in the pursuit of his enquiries and for all civil servants to provide him with the information he needs, rather than having to refer him to their superiors; these measures must be implemented so that the Ombudsman can work without unnecessary obstacles.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that cooperation between the Committee on Petitions, with its scope for intervention, and the Ombudsman, with his wide remit, will become an increasingly important factor in the promotion of democracy and the enforcement of citizens' rights in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents" align="center">IN THE CHAIR: MR IMBENI<br /><span class="italic">Vice‐President</span></p>
<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Perry </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Mr President, Parliament this week has been debating very many important issues, such as war and peace in Kosovo. We have heard speeches from the Commission President‐designate, Mr Prodi, and a speech from the President‐in‐Office of the Council of Ministers, the German Chancellor Mr Schroeder. This morning's debate may well seem insignificant alongside those great events of the week – but it is not.</p>
<p class="contents">All parliaments have four roles: to legislate, to control finance, to control the administration and to represent the citizen; but the greatest of those roles is the last of them. Our supreme responsibility is to represent and protect the rights of the 370 million European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">No committee of this Parliament performs that role more directly for the citizen than the Committee on Petitions and no European office‐holder has the interests of the individual citizen higher on his list of responsibilities than the European Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the value of the right to petition for the individual citizen I fully endorse the recommendations of the Newman report. As has already been said this morning, Mr Newman has worked very hard for the Committee on Petitions. He and I come from different political traditions, but we share a similar belief in the importance of protecting the rights of citizens. My group would like to thank him for the work he has done in the Committee on Petitions over many years.</p>
<p class="contents">I will use this speech to stress just one section of that report. It is paragraph 8, where we regret, as did Mr Newman, the continued absence of any representative of the Council of Ministers attending the Committee on Petitions. In recent years, British, German, Austrian presidencies have boycotted this committee. I hope that the Finnish presidency, coming from the Scandinavian democratic tradition, will set a better example. However, given that the Secretary‐General of this Parliament himself at one stage was proposing the abolition of the Committee on Petitions – and as I understand it some of the big groups have only at the last minute backed away from proposals to abolish the Committee on Petitions – perhaps we can understand why the Council of Ministers adopts that attitude. But we in the European People's Party have never waivered in our determination to keep the Committee on Petitions.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the Newman report, I support the report by Mrs De Esteban on the Ombudsman. I did not vote for Mr Jacob Söderman to become the Ombudsman in Europe. I was wrong. There is one word in that report that stands out, and that is the word ‘irreproachable" used to describe cooperation between the Ombudsman and Parliament. Irreproachable is not a word that is often used dealing with European institutions, but I am happy to see it and it was rightly used in describing the work of the Ombudsman and his relations with this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I support him in his call for greater transparency. That is certainly necessary. I thank him for continuing the bid I made to see that we should have a code of good administrative behaviour. I would say to this Parliament: if we want the Ombudsman to work well, we must make sure he has the powers and the resources to do that job. We should give him our fullest support in achieving it.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Thors </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, Mr Ombudsman, it is a pleasure to be able to agree with everyone today in saying that the office of the European Ombudsman has so far proved to be a very important feature of EU life. Having an Ombudsman facilitates openness and transparency in the Union. Perhaps I might mention a few of the many successful initiatives taken.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we had the own‐initiative report on public access to documents; as a result, virtually all the institutions now have some kind of code of conduct. Secondly, the Central Bank has been approached with a request for access to its documents. Thirdly, Council of Ministers documents will in future be deemed to include presidency papers. Fourthly, the absence of an inventory of documents within the Commission has been branded maladministration. And fifth, the Council has now drawn up a list of measures adopted under the third pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">Once a functioning Commission is in place, we should soon see a new regulation on public access to documents. Some very significant parameters have already been established by the measures and initiatives to which I have referred. It is unfortunate that the whole process of the Commission"s resignation has noticeably slowed down this work.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a pity that the decisions taken so far by the Council on public access to third pillar documents have proved relatively insignificant in their impact. What are we, the public, set to gain from learning about regulatory texts that have already been adopted and are available over the Internet? We also need to know about future plans. Over recent days, much attention has rightly been focused on the ‘Enfopoldo" document. This comprises a draft version of a text designed to regulate the interception of communications via the new media, together with a draft convention on mutual assistance between the Member States in respect of criminal cases. The whole exercise has been shrouded in secrecy; the Council"s new pledges have been of scant value in this particular instance. It is not enough to keep us informed of when third pillar meetings are being held and what measures have actually been taken. We also need access to information on matters pending, and we should be given details of initiatives coming from the working groups, the presidency and the Member States. The debate on the Austrian ‘strategy document" also pinpointed shortcomings in the Council"s arrangements for transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">As for police and judicial cooperation under the third pillar, many measures touch on the fundamental rights of ordinary citizens. I therefore look forward to the time when, with the backing of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Ombudsman will be able to envisage overseeing a body such as Europol.</p>
<p class="contents">We were told yesterday that the German Presidency intends to come forward soon with a timetable for the intergovernmental conference. This will be an opportunity for reviewing the status of the Ombudsman. His role must be strengthened in the manner called for in the De Esteban Martín report.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, we need to ensure continuation of the good cooperation observed in the past between the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman. The latter will need to forge cooperation with ombudsmen or equivalent bodies in the Member States, in this way facilitating the fight against breaches of civil liberties in the actual application of Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me say a few words about the vote that will be taking place today on the future of the Committee on Petitions. This committee must be allowed to continue its work, but I hope that the Commission will be able to provide comparable assurances on the processing of petitions to those it has given with regard to complaints under Article 169 of the Treaty. I am particularly gratified that Commissioner Monti – who takes a special interest in this article – is with us today and has undertaken to speed up the procedures governing complaints. Sadly, it would appear that the Commission has been listening to the Member States and is slowing down the processing of complaints within the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I also feel strongly that the newly constituted Committee on Petitions should exercise scrutiny over internal administration, although I concede that the current committee worked very hard indeed to speed up the handling of petitions. But it still takes far too long for a complaint to reach the Committee on Petitions at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, may I join the chorus of speakers who have expressed their heartfelt thanks to our former chairman, Mr Newman. He has done an excellent job in demonstrating the importance of this committee. And as he pointed out, 10 million citizens have availed themselves of its existence during the life of this Parliament.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">González Álvarez </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, I shall probably not use all of the five minutes allocated because I am not used to having such a long time to speak and usually have to keep my speeches brief.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to begin by expressing my delight that the proposal put forward by the Conference of Presidents, which will be put to the vote at midday, includes – among its 17 remaining committees – the Committee on Petitions in its own right and not as secondary to another committee. In my view, the Committee on Petitions is vital for the citizens of Europe. I fully agree with the rapporteur, Mr Newman, that this committee is constitutional in nature and should be maintained within Parliament"s future committee structure.</p>
<p class="contents">A short time ago, Mr Newman himself headed a delegation from the Committee on Petitions – a delegation that included our colleagues Laura de Esteban and Barbara Schmidbauer – on a visit to the Doñana park. This visit was aimed precisely at allaying the fears of the local population that had been expressed in a great many petitions submitted to the Committee on Petitions, fears relating to the Doñana national park, which is a biosphere reserve. While we were there we had the opportunity to meet not only representatives of the institutions involved – who explained the problems the area was experiencing – but also the ecological groups and members of the public who had expressed their concern at what was happening.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore of the opinion that bringing the European institutions closer to the citizens" concerns sets an excellent example and it should continue indefinitely. In my view, this is one of the lessons to be learned from the work both of the Committee on Petitions and Mr Newman, who we were delighted to accompany to the Doñana area.</p>
<p class="contents">I refer to this issue precisely because my relationship with the Committee on Petitions is based on the work I carry out within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. Most petitions received by the Committee on Petitions relate to social security, the internal market or the environment. The fact that so many petitions are received in relation to the environment clearly proves the extent to which the people and the non‐governmental organisations – who submit the complaints – are concerned about preserving the natural environment.</p>
<p class="contents">What problems arise in dealing with these petitions? The rapporteur and other Members have already referred to the problem of how slow the process is. In environmental issues, and I do not know if this is true of other areas, such slow progress can have irreversible effects. When a complaint is made that a road is going to be built in a natural area and decisions on it are not taken immediately, the road might still go ahead although the final decision may rule that it is illegal. As a result, the fact that the process is so slow becomes much more evident in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, a more effective method of dealing with petitions perhaps needs to be found between the Committee on Petitions, the European Commission and the Member States during the next parliamentary term. Perhaps we will have to ensure that the Member States comply with the demands of Parliament and the European Commission immediately rather than confusing the issue still further by taking far too long to deal with matters since this might have negative effects.</p>
<p class="contents">If this does not happen, the public will feel increasingly frustrated about the concerns they express to the Committee on Petitions regarding the various problems that exist.</p>
<p class="contents">The successful coordination that has been developed between the European Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions must also be welcomed. Both the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman should have their own independent budget to be used reasonably and sufficient staff, as these are two institutions that genuinely uphold the rights of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that we need to develop and draw up a code of good administrative behaviour which would help the Committee on Petitions and the European Ombudsman in their work and thus help make European integration more meaningful for the people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I believe that brings me to the end of what I wanted to say and, as you can see, I still have a minute left to speak. I find it is impossible to speak for five minutes when I am used to only speaking for one.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Ullmann </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Ombudsman, Commissioner, it seldom happens that the quality of a rapporteur's work is quite so pleasing as the content of this report. The European Ombudsman's annual report for 1998 shows that his institution has now become one of the best‐functioning and most effective in the European Union. This applies particularly in terms of closeness to the people, which as we all know is one of the fundamental principles of the European Union. Mrs De Esteban Martín highlights this point so convincingly in her report that one can only hope it will be very widely read, particularly by those who would be responsible for fulfilling Professor Söderman's requests for his office to have its own budget and for the change of status he has suggested, developments that would enable him to continue his work.</p>
<p class="contents">Against the background of the Commission's resignation, the call made by the Ombudsman for a code of good administrative practice to which citizens would have recourse is extremely topical. Foremost among the responsible parties I referred to is the European Parliament, since the European Ombudsman is commissioned by Parliament. One of the duties of the Committee on Petitions is to discharge that responsibility. How can it do that if it is not adequately equipped for its work? The Committee on Petitions has already approached the parliamentary administration on this point, although its plea did not elicit much of a response. Every Member of this House should look at the annexes to Mr Newman's report in particular, which bring home the absurdity of the proposition that the work of the Committee on Petitions could be divided up among other committees.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry to say that I must close by asking certain bodies in this House how they feel about the rights of their constituents when they seek to diminish the status of the basic right of petition by abolishing the Committee on Petitions, or when they try to change the name of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights and call it the Committee on Legal Affairs and Consumers' Rights. The people of the Union are citizens first and foremost, then consumers, and any rights they have as consumers surely only exist by virtue of their civil rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me, Mr President, to thank Mr Newman, not only for his instructive and authoritative report but also for the work he has done in this important committee. I was only on that committee for a short time, but I was able to experience at first hand all those things for which my honourable colleagues have been expressing their gratitude. Thank you, Mr Newman.</p>

We are here to protect those rights because we act on the public"s behalf, and it is becoming increasingly necessary for us to be able to hear what they themselves have to say. The institution of the Ombudsman is answerable to Parliament, which I think is a good thing because it helps him to be independent, a position which he exploits to the full, as we have seen from the report he has presented to Parliament today. I welcome the fact that he called so strongly for an open administration, and I could not help thinking that officials in various Member States have the right to speak, but this still seems to be taboo here in the European institutions, as we have seen with Mr Van Buitenen.</p>
<p class="contents">The facts have borne this man out, yet the Commission still feels it necessary to continue with disciplinary proceedings against him, and he has been removed from his post in the financial control department where he had done some excellent work. It was precisely as a result of his work that we in Parliament were able to act and, together with the Committee on Budgetary Control and later the Committee of Independent Experts, arrived at such damning conclusions. I would therefore strongly urge that we should use all our influence to ensure that Mr Van Buitenen is reinstated.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the Ombudsman certainly made his point in calling for openness and information, and I would like to conclude by urging a change of direction, so that Europe comes to stand not for a bureaucracy behind closed doors, but for democracy and transparency.</p>

<p class="contents">Recent experience has highlighted, as well as reminding those who had forgotten, that remoteness and a lack of transparency lead to irresponsible behaviour and fraud. The common good needs to be constantly enhanced by daily realities. Without this, it risks becoming the confused expression of individual interests.</p>
<p class="contents">By their very nature, the Community institutions are the furthest removed from daily life. Officials who are lost in the interminable corridors of their offices in Brussels try to draw up uniform rules in all areas that are to be applied to all the different national traditions. In the worst cases, these texts merely add rules with no European dimension to existing national legislation. It is therefore not surprising that the implementation of all these absurd Community rules might generate an increasing number of difficulties that form the basis of the appeals lodged to the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman. Both bodies should certainly be granted the necessary resources to function properly. However, is it not more urgent to reform the process of European integration so as to prevent these drifts and the complaints they generate? Artificial empires always end up collapsing because all too often they forget about the people that are involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite their good points, in the future, the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman will not be enough to offset the lack of consistency and excesses of a technocratic machine. This machine will inevitably lead to a rise in the number of problems and complaints from the citizens, who might find it hard to understand why these rules are not useful, realistic or applicable.</p>

This joint debate will also pass on a heritage to the next European Parliament as it takes over from the current one. I therefore believe that it is a special honour for us all to take part in today"s debate. It is a joint debate because the Committee on Petitions and the European Ombudsman function jointly. The operation of these bodies is joint yet distinct, complementary but without their powers overlapping and becoming confused, and with absolute respect for the independence of the European Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank our rapporteurs, Mrs De Esteban Martín and Mr Newman, for their reports which, as always in this committee, are the end product of the collective contribution and work of all its members.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs De Esteban Martín, I would like to make just one small parenthesis here and thank Mr Newman warmly for the help he has given to all of us through his example, but especially for the help he has given to ensure the smooth operation of this committee, and not just for the 15 years he has served the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very glad that today – and it is perhaps not a coincidence – we will soon be called upon to vote on the continuation of the work of the Committee on Petitions. I have the feeling that the Committee on Petitions has come out of this period of questioning rebaptised, and precisely because the European Parliament has realised the extent of its contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Söderman, Mr Perry has referred to your appointment and I will add to what he said by saying that I had the pleasure and the good fortune to vote for you as Ombudsman. I am delighted that my choice has been vindicated. I think that Mr Söderman, as someone who has represented the institution, has offered a new creation, a new body, to Europe and to the European Union.</p>

But first of all I would like to pay tribute to Mr Newman. He has been a veritable ‘British bulldog" in that committee, continually raising his voice in the name of the citizens of the Community. We will definitely miss you Eddy.</p>
<p class="contents">I had also hoped that I would have a chance to personally thank President Gil‐Robles because he has been a continual support to me in my work as mediator for abducted children, and also to thank Mr Söderman for his excellent work as European Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">You will note in the report that in the past year I have dealt with 29 petitions as mediator. When we receive a petition about abducted children we immediately make contact with the petitioner. Abducted children are always an emergency and have to be dealt with as such. They cannot wait to go through the long process of administration.</p>
<p class="contents">Good law exists to deal with the problem of transnationally abducted children. But it is not always implemented in a proper way. Because of that, I have had an increasingly heavy work load in relation to this issue. The Council of Ministers should make a point of discussing this as soon as possible so that we can establish some kind of ground rules to respond to the problem. It is an increasing problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The Hague Convention is meant to do one thing, and one thing only. It is not a custody hearing on children. It is a piece of legislation that requires children to be returned to the country where they habitually reside, for discussions and decisions about their custody to be worked out. There is considerable international ignorance about family law and what happens in the event of marital breakdown and children being taken back to a country where they do not normally live.</p>
<p class="contents">We continue to have very serious problems with countries that have not signed the Hague Convention and where there are still a number of abduction cases. Our big problem lies primarily with countries that have religious courts – but not exclusively. Many European states do not implement the Hague Convention either in spirit or, indeed, in law. We have recently had a very significant success concerning a French mother and a German father. We are very happy with the decision by the German courts. But all too often these cases are heard in front of judges who are either ignorant of or badly informed about the law relating to child abduction.</p>
<p class="contents">We need special courts that will deal with these issues as quickly as possible to prevent the inevitable trauma, particularly to the children, but also to both parents. Most of these cases are dealt with by national central authorities. Inevitably I get the cases that have not worked out that way. All our countries need the Hague Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to my work in the committee I have also participated, on behalf of Parliament, in a great many international conferences. An increasing amount of concern is being expressed in all the Member States about the increase in the incidence of child abduction. I would like to thank Parliament for its assistance in this matter.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Sjöstedt </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Madam President, I should like to say a few words about the annual report by the Ombudsman and the report by Mrs De Esteban Martín, although I need say very little about the latter. It is a good report and, overall, I agree with everything it says.</p>
<p class="contents">The office of the Ombudsman is manifestly playing an increasingly important role. The Ombudsman has a very positive effect on the whole EU system. I myself have been in contact with him and have met many other people who have approached his office. They generally seemed happy with the arrangements and their reception, including the manner in which their concerns were dealt with and the speed of response. Top marks must surely go to a structure which manages to make people feel that they and their complaints have been taken seriously and that they can now take matters forward. Bearing in mind that quite a number of people experience a sense of powerlessness in the face of the EU institutions, the way in which they are treated matters. And now they have a place to which they can turn. The Ombudsman"s prime merit is – and has always been – to promote greater openness and transparency in the Union as a whole. Let us not underestimate that.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the crisis within the Commission, several factors come into play. The situation has in fact been developing for quite some time. The nub of the problem – and the reason why the Commission had to resign – was of course mismanagement of the Union"s finances. There was also a partial loss of control over expenditure. Yet there is another element which should not be discounted, namely the lack of openness and the particular administrative culture which have predominated hitherto in the Commission. Many ordinary citizens feel the Commission to be a powerful institution, but one which is closed, insensitive – and sometimes simply arrogant. When they approach the institution directly, people find it hard to obtain answers and information. This perception – justified or otherwise – helps to explain attitudes towards the Commission. An institution which leaves such an impression on people is no longer up to date; change is required. The idea of a code of good administrative practice is therefore to be welcomed. This initiative should go some way towards remedying and improving the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Staff Regulations also need amendment, that much is clear. EU staff should not need to fear reprisals for drawing attention to mismanagement or exercising criticism. They must be able to have their say – publicly, where necessary. Otherwise they are operating in a very unsavoury environment. A change of culture, accompanied by new rules on openness and public access to documents, should bring about a real transformation in the way the administration is run.</p>
<p class="contents">Top of the agenda now should be a strengthening of the office of the Ombudsman. Two aspects require particular attention, beginning with the financial parameters. If the office is to be able to handle properly all the complaints that are coming in, it needs long‐term planning and an adequately resourced budget. Secondly, it is self‐evident that the Ombudsman must have access to all the documents he needs. This is essential if a good job of work is to be done. An immediate increase in resources is therefore necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">As an MEP, I myself am critical of much of what goes on in the EU. In the case of the Ombudsman, however, I have no criticism to make whatsoever. Instead, I should like to thank Jacob Söderman and his team for the excellent work they do.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hautala </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(FI)</span> Madam President, Mr Ombudsman, Commissioner, I am one of those who feel that the Ombudsman is the European Union"s best institution. He has certainly been responsible for positive developments in the Union"s institutional structures, and it is important that he should be given greater powers. The report mentions freedom of movement. I myself recently met an Irish dentist who had problems practising in Greece. All such questions should be raised when discussing the Ombudsman"s powers.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation regarding public access to documents has improved in the European Union mainly as a result of the efforts of the Ombudsman and the courts. The legislative bodies have not done very much on the subject as yet, and I fear the Commission"s work on the future regulation on transparency has slowed down somewhat. I should like to ask Commissioner Monti how work is proceeding on the transparency regulation based on the Treaty of Amsterdam, because that will also be an absolutely essential ingredient in solving the institutional crisis caused by the resignation of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Good administration will be essential in solving this crisis. I have noted to my satisfaction the Ombudsman"s positive attitude towards civil servants" freedom to write and say what they wish. It is vital that the Staff Regulations are interpreted accurately, and changed so that civil servants have a real obligation to highlight any shortcomings they identify in the work of an institution or in their own department.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, producing document registers for all institutions is a very important innovation. I would point out that the European Parliament must also be a part of this programme of revision and embark on a course of good administration itself.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Sandbæk </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Madam President, I completely agree with Mr Söderman that if the EU had had a culture of open administration, whereby the public could inspect the files of its officials once they have been finalised, we would be able to avoid a great deal of fraud and many irregularities. Officials who know that their files may be scrutinised by the public at any time are sure to be more inclined to administer them correctly. The EU does not have such a culture of openness, and this is also reflected in the Ombudsman's annual report, which incidentally is well set out, clear and meticulous. This is gratifying, since we are after all talking about consolidating an institution which is still very new, but already well known and valued. Nevertheless, there has been insufficient political will to give the Ombudsman proper working conditions. Incredible as it may sound, it is evident from the annual report that even he, who is supposed to be the public's guarantor with regard to the EU administration, simply does not have full access to Commission and Council documents. It is therefore clearly necessary to amend Article 3(2) of the Ombudsman"s Statute, so that he has full and unimpeded access to all the relevant documents. To have a provision whereby the Community institutions can refuse to give the Ombudsman access to documents either by pleading duly substantiated grounds of secrecy, or because officials and other employees are speaking on behalf of and in accordance with instructions from their administrations, is not just unnecessary, it is extremely inappropriate. It is high time for a revision of the legal basis which underlies the Ombudsman's work. Otherwise, the institution is giving the people of the EU a completely false sense of the guarantee of due process of law. It is therefore particularly important to support paragraph 6 in Mrs De Esteban's motion for a resolution.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Monti, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (IT)</span> Madam President, Mr Söderman, ladies and gentlemen, under the Treaty on European Union, it is Parliament and not the Commission to whom the European Ombudsman's report is addressed. Let me nonetheless say a few words on behalf of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission firmly believes that the creation of the European Ombudsman is of real benefit in terms of European citizenship and that it is a fundamental right of all Europe's citizens that the European institutions should be properly administered and operate in a manner that is both transparent and fair.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1998, the Commission was once again the main subject of the investigations carried out by the Ombudsman. The Commission was happy to try and give satisfactory answers to all of the questions and endeavoured, as far as possible, to meet the deadlines that were set. The supervision that citizens are able to exercise over the operation of our administration, through the Ombudsman, is bound to encourage us to work better, to correct our mistakes and to increase the transparency of our work. That then is why I am in agreement with the excellent report by Mrs De Esteban Martín, who calls on all of the institutions to do more to alert the European public, by all possible means, to the opportunities they have of enforcing their own rights, and in particular of course to the possibility of approaching the Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point made by the House, by the Committee on Petitions and by the Ombudsman himself concerns the code of good administrative behaviour aimed at the institutions and the European bodies. The Commission has reached agreement on the principle underlying that code, has set about drafting it, in consultation with the Ombudsman, and has taken an initial decision on this. However, it intends making the code one of three elements of a wide‐ranging reform of all its internal and external practices, which has yet to be completed for reasons of which the House is very much aware. Furthermore, improving the relationship between citizens and the administration also implies substantially enhancing transparency and giving the public easier access to documentation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees that transparency does not simply mean that documents should, wherever possible, be accessible to the public but also that any refusal to provide such documents must be justified on the basis of rules previously laid down. As Mrs Hautala pointed out, the Treaty of Amsterdam established that concept of transparency by according citizens a genuine right of access to the documents of Parliament, the Commission and the Council. Article 255 requires the Commission to draft a legislative proposal on the general principles and the limits governing the exercise of that right, so we shall soon be tabling the relevant proposal and the House will then have the opportunity to state its view through the codecision process.</p>
<p class="contents">On a similar but separate issue, the Commission shares the rapporteur's view that the Ombudsman should have as wide an access as possible to the practices and documents of the institutions which he needs in order to carry out his investigations. That is crucial both to the work of the Ombudsman himself and to enable the people of Europe to have confidence in him. As to changing the rules and conditions governing the work of the Ombudsman, in relation either to that point or the taking of evidence from officials, it is clearly up to the House to take the initiative here in accordance with Article 138e. It will then be for the Commission – the next Commission, clearly – to give its opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also agrees with the importance that the rapporteur and the Ombudsman himself attach to increasing public confidence in the European institutions, in particular where citizens complain about situations which they do not believe to be compatible with European legislation. That is why, as a follow‐up to the Ombudsman's own‐initiative inquiry into infringement proceedings, the Commission has undertaken to provide, at the point at which it informs the complainant that it intends closing the file – if that is what it intends to do – a statement giving the reasons why it does not consider that Community law has been infringed. But giving the public real rights in proceedings under Article 169 will clearly involve an amendment to the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank Mr Söderman for his excellent work and for the helpful cooperation he has made possible with the Commission. In addition to investigating the cases referred to you, Mr Söderman, you have taken the initiative to draw up a range of proposals on transparency and citizens' rights. There has already been mention in the Chamber of your involvement in questions concerning the role of the public in Article 169 proceedings, the drafting of a code of good behaviour for officials, and access to the documents of the institutions and the bodies which you supervise. I should just like to draw attention once again to your efforts to introduce greater transparency into the procedures for competitions and to change the age limits. In both these areas, thanks to the cooperation between yourself, Parliament and the Commission, considerable progress has been made towards improving the relationship between the public and the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, Madam President, to say a few words about Mr Newman's report. The balance‐sheet which Parliament draws up every year on the processing of the petitions submitted by the public provides a valuable opportunity for reflection. This relationship between our citizens and the institutions has, for the Commission, been one of the main themes of its review of the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The right of petition marks an important breakthrough in terms of the political rights of our citizens, and I think it useful to point out once again, as did the rapporteur, that this right is fully recognised in the Treaty on European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Processing petitions rapidly and effectively is another important way of increasing public confidence in the institutions. When a member of the public sends a petition to the European Parliament, not only is he criticising something which he believes constitutes improper application of Community law, he is at the same time expressing his confidence in Parliament and the other institutions, relying on them to right the wrong. As the life of this Parliament draws to a close, the Commission therefore attaches great importance to bringing the processing of petitions up to date, so that, at the last two meetings of the Committee on Petitions, chaired by Mr Fontana, it is possible to consider the bulk of the cases still pending.</p>
<p class="contents">Close examination of the whole range of petitions submitted reveals another interesting factor. The Committee on Petitions must in fact be considered the main parliamentary platform for our citizens, the barometer, the gauge of their real concerns. This year, the rapporteur has rightly stressed the important role of the Committee on Petitions in monitoring infringement proceedings. As we realise, of course, proceedings under Article 169 are instituted as a result of many petitions from members of the public.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as proceedings under Article 169 are concerned, as Mrs Thors will be well aware, the Commission has been making and will certainly continue to make great efforts to ensure that the procedure is swift and transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has played an important role in another sector too: I am thinking here of the code of conduct to ensure that the administration behaves properly in its relations with the public. Mr Perry, the rapporteur for the Committee on Petitions for 1996, had already pressed for that code and the Ombudsman made a similar request. As I mentioned, the Commission has taken an initial decision on this.</p>
<p class="contents">The point on which I wish to conclude, and to which I attach the greatest importance, is that a healthy relationship between the public and the institutions must be founded on transparency: on transparency in a very broad sense, requiring above all that the public should be well informed of their rights. In that connection, I wish to express my thanks to the House for the support it has always given the Commission in launching the <span class="italic">Citizens First</span> information campaign, which has enabled the public to be informed of their rights as never before.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) Lastly, Madam President, allow me to thank Mrs Banotti for her work as a mediator for the President for transnationally abducted children. This work is based broadly on the petitions submitted and I should like to express the Commission"s gratitude for the excellent work by Mrs Banotti.</span></p>
