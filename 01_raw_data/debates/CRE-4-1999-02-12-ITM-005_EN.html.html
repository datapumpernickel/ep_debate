<p class="contents">It also attempts to gradually implement the decisions taken at the meeting of the European Council in Cardiff on the same issue. The report aims to turn the Mediterranean Sea into a bridge of political, economic, developmental and cultural communication between all the countries of the European Union and the third countries on the shores of the Mediterranean. It discusses all modes of transport from the European Union to these third countries and vice versa. It attempts to set out guidelines for developing modes of transport within the third countries of the Mediterranean and establishing links between them.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Forum on Transport in the Mediterranean, which will meet on 24 and 25 March in Malta, will turn to good account the green light which I am sure the European Parliament will give today, and that the Council will draw up a list of priorities relating to the implementation of the plan to develop modes of transport in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the EU"s budget will be able to reinforce this attempt, but I must confess that I am not very optimistic. You only need to look at the EU budget for 1999, or at what has already been discussed in relation to the budget for the year 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to draw the attention of the Commission to the question of the continuous monitoring of the proper use of funds which will be made available to the third countries of the Mediterranean region. We know that in a number of these countries there are problems of democracy and transparency, and that in some of them there are also problems of political stability.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament strongly emphasises the need to protect the environment during the implementation of this programme – especially the marine environment – from all types of pollution, mainly involving toxic and nuclear waste. I should like to draw the Commissioner"s attention to this last point in particular, because of the decision that has been taken by the Turkish Government to construct its own nuclear power station on the shores of the Mediterranean, in the region of Akuyu. This comes at a time when we know that the epicentre of the major catastrophic earthquake which struck Adana just a few months ago is just 50 kilometres from the proposed site of this nuclear power station.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the Malta forum will take place in March, and it is a great pity that the European Parliament will not be allowed to participate in it. Moreover, it is Parliament"s view that it should have taken place earlier to enable us to put forward more specific proposals. Be that as it may, we hope that you will keep us informed of the decisions that are taken there, above all in relation to the list of priorities I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to make a correction to paragraph 3 on page 6. The Malta Euro‐Mediterranean transport forum, which was to have taken place in February, will now take place in Malta on 24 and 25 March, and the corresponding changes need to be made.</p>
<p class="contents">My thanks go to my colleagues on the Committee on Transport and Tourism. Their amendments have done a great deal to improve my report. I would also like to thank the secretariat of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, and indeed the Commission. Our opinions may have differed on certain points of detail, but cooperation overall has been very good.</p>

We are constantly talking in Parliament – and not just here, but in international organisations in general – about globalisation. This report brings home to us the fact that this concept of globalisation is not always appropriate. The fact is that we cannot even manage to establish a proper order and structure in our immediate vicinity which is beneficial to a body like the European Union in matters that concern its immediate sphere of interest.</p>
<p class="contents">In talking of the Mediterranean region, I think we must of course look too at its common history. We should not forget that the Mediterranean was once really an inland sea in Europe and only later became Europe"s southern frontier. This common history means that the goals we have set ourselves, such as the creation of a free trade area by the year 2010, should really be perfectly feasible if the necessary infrastructure can be put in place, if it is possible to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">Inadequate infrastructure, especially in transport and telecommunications, is the main barrier to the development of this area"s foreign and interregional trade. I think it is most important to look at transport not just for the states immediately bordering on the Mediterranean but for the region as a whole, including the various Balkan states. These countries must be included, and they must be included in a report of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">I think a critical eye is important and necessary to ensure that this debate, this support and also the involvement of Parliament continue, and that communication between Commission and Parliament also continues in future to help bring about progress in this region.</p>

<p class="contents">It is nearly four years since the 1995 Barcelona Euro‐Mediterranean Conference, and I believe that the Commission has acted positively in presenting this document on transport in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">Transport is the means of communication which makes trade possible. The last speaker said that the Mediterranean was an inland sea, but for many years it divided the North from the South, a developed North and an undeveloped South, a North with a stable population and a South with a rapidly growing population, a generally Christian North and a Muslim South. And this division has made dialogue and mutual understanding difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">The major challenge of the Barcelona Conference was greater mutual understanding and a closer relationship between the North and the South. There is talk of a free trade area for the year 2010, but this needs groundwork. Communications must be improved as must the relationship between North and South. If that relationship does not improve, then unfortunately the only transport on the Mediterranean will be those little tubs full of immigrants, struggling across the Straits of Gibraltar to find the answer to their problems in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Better transport and more mutual understanding can lead to development in this area, which should be an area of close relationships and mutual comprehension to the benefit of all concerned. As our poet says, there should be <span class="italic">’un pont en la mar blava"</span> , a bridge across the azure sea.</p>

We all know that, and not a great deal can be done about it in the short term. What we need to do is to set priorities amongst all the work which is planned. A number of comments on this initiative therefore suggest themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not altogether agree with the objectives of the agreements, although I do believe that the effort put into ties with the Mediterranean countries is certainly justified, in view of the agreements reached by the various parties.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first place, I think the Union has a duty to improve relations between the Union and the Mediterranean countries. Once we have done that, we can worry about relations between the various Mediterranean countries themselves. These countries must also make efforts of their own to improve their position.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Barcelona declaration on the Euro‐Mediterranean partnership mentions transport, and specifically infrastructure. This means that the European Union does not have to concern itself with promoting particular transport services in the Mediterranean countries. It must, however, ensure that investment is consistent with the policy of sustainable transport initiated by the European Parliament. This must lead to prime consideration being given to sustainable connections between the sea ports of Member States and those of the Mediterranean countries. Only at a later stage should connections between the Mediterranean countries themselves be addressed. Naturally, these connections too must be consistent with efforts to achieve a sustainable system of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">I am all the more sure of this when I see that the trade flows between the European Union and the Mediterranean countries, in themselves not all that large, are considerably larger than the trade flows between the Mediterranean countries themselves. To my mind, this makes the reservations which the rapporteur mentions in his report somewhat relative.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, we have to respect and abide by agreements. So I would like to see us upholding the agreements we have concluded with and in respect of the Mediterranean countries. But this must not be at the expense of other, equally important tasks. Hence my amendment, which seeks to ease somewhat the pressure which the rapporteur is putting on the Commission.</p>

The programme has been drawn up, so we have made a fair amount of progress. We shall of course monitor the work of this forum and make suggestions in the context of the priorities set at the Barcelona conference. We do not need to change those. For example, environmental measures too have already been dealt with there as a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall also – and this is the other matter arising from the debate – support and prepare the first meeting of the forum to be held in Malta on 23 and 24 March. The European Parliament will be fully briefed on this. All the texts presented and adopted there will be published. Here too, there is already a clear emphasis on environmental activities.</p>
<p class="contents">So I think that we are currently well advanced with our efforts and have no need to fear a lack of success.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course – and that is really the problem with all this work, and with industrial cooperation too – success depends not only on our goodwill, but on that of our partner countries as well. This goodwill on the part of our partner countries is certainly there, but to varying degrees. Some partner countries in the Mediterranean area will certainly react very positively to all these activities. Others would like to, but for a wide variety of reasons cannot, so we shall probably have to reconcile ourselves to a variety of results. But that is not down to us, it is down to the partner countries themselves. We in any case will do everything necessary to ensure a successful outcome.</p>

The minimum degree of economic prosperity, social balance and security that is desirable in the region depends on the revival of a dialogue which is currently faltering, and which needs to produce greater consideration for the interests of the countries on both sides of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1995, the Barcelona conference came up with an answer, launching the MEDA programme which built a new partnership on three pillars – political, economic and human.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication placed before Parliament outlines a general strategy for transport. This text has the virtue of restating the importance of transport links towards the south, which have to be balanced against the extension of the trans‐European networks, the TENs, towards the east.</p>
<p class="contents">But like our rapporteur, I wonder if the will to rebalance the TENs is really there. There are no concrete plans for financing them at all. Are they to remain merely a pious wish?</p>
<p class="contents">We need to launch, support and give practical form to a genuine Mediterranean project. There is no apparent will to do this, and that must be deplored. Let us get away once and for all from all the shilly‐shallying and endless fine words that never turn into deeds. If we look at the fact that the MEDA programme has been translated only into one or two association agreements, it must be said that all this falls well short of the intentions stated and the resources promised at various summits both before and after Barcelona.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
