<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Korhola (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FI) </span>Mr President, this directive is a second pillar in the legislative process, designed to amend EU legislation to take account of the Aarhus Convention. The first pillar concerned the transparency of environmental information, and it is currently going through the conciliation procedure. We are still awaiting a Commission proposal on the third pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning both the first and second pillar, it must be said that the Council has shown a very positive attitude, and over several presidential terms I have found that there is genuine commitment and good will on its part. With regard to this directive also, the Council has already approved many elements of Parliament’s first reading and now Parliament is to adopt many elements of the common position. Nevertheless, problems do remain and it would appear that this directive will also only take on its final shape in conciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">In the general approach alone there are already differences. The Commission proposal and the Council’s common position are based on the ‘quick fix’ principle, while Parliament has wanted a broader horizontal approach. It is nevertheless clear that it is not Parliament’s aim to defend its amendments to the letter but rather ensure that there remain no grey areas in EU legislation, where public participation would be justified, but not possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of the report before us cannot be overemphasised. Unusually, it directly affects all citizens in the EU Member States and candidate countries. The public will now have the invaluable right to participate in decision-making on the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also an important tool for the environment, and one which may improve the quality of decision-making on the environment considerably. For these reasons, this is a tool that must be closely guarded. It would be in nobody’s interest – and least of all in the interests of the environment – if this tool were to be used for defending selfish interests, for politicking by opposition groups or to cause wilful mischief.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur I have been conscious of the fact that the tool now being created may be abused. Furthermore, the authorities in Member States must be aware of the risks involved in national implementation. Moreover, that alone is not enough. The environmental organisations must also know they have an immense responsibility not to allow pettiness to inflate the importance of the rights granted to our citizens and the special status accorded the organisations themselves. There is also the problem of Mr and Mrs Nimby or the 'Not in my backyard' syndrome. But I myself have tried to avoid this by stressing the importance, insofar as it has been in your rapporteur’s power to do so, of arguing the case and the high quality of participation. Opposition alone and the self-centred defence of one’s own territory cannot be sufficient. The tool now being created for this is too important and the resources used for its creation too invaluable.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons I wish to defend the rights of our citizens to participate in decision-making on the environment and I am, moreover, prepared to repel any opportunity to abuse this tool. I also want to remind everyone of my solution, which was rejected by Parliament at first reading, which Member States might yet consider when they implement the directive nationally. In it I hold that the public as a whole have the right to express an opinion but the right to access to justice only applies to that section of the public affected by a decision taken. My solution is unusual in that it would have simultaneously benefited both those citizens who were genuinely keen to participate and the authorities, and the parties responsible for the relevant projects. Firstly the work of the authorities would be easier as they would not need to specify beforehand the parties concerned and, at the same time, the likelihood of omission when the parties were being heard would be removed. Secondly, the ready cause for complaint of those who want to apply the brakes would go: the party was not heard. Above all, however, it would mean the quality of participation would be highlighted and the importance attached to hearing Mr and Mrs Nimby would decline.</p>
<p class="contents">A precondition of the ratification of the Aarhus Convention in the EU is that the working practices and procedures of the EU’s institutions should be revised as necessary. In addition it is especially important for the Commission to submit a proposal on the third pillar regarding review and access to justice as speedily as possible, as this is surely the most problematic of them all. Unfortunately, the Commission has not been able, despite its promises, to put forward a clear timetable and course of action in respect of the measures that need to be taken for ratification. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has already been the subject of frank and, at times, lively debate between those who call for the citizens to be fully entitled to be involved in certain structural policies at the decision-making stage and those who feel that the political, technical and administrative institutions set up to perform the task of decision-making should have a greater degree of competence and autonomy. In its response to first reading, the Council scaled down the rapporteur’s proposals somewhat, appearing to consider them to be too advanced and too open to a form of democratic participation that could slow down the process of drawing up texts or which, as the rapporteur herself said just now, could open the door to exaggerated<span class="bold">, </span>authoritarian<span class="bold"> </span>or distorted interpretations. In short, the Council intends to confer on the citizens’ organisations a consultative role – an important role but not a decision-making role – giving the legislators elected to take decisions on the basis of the input of civil society sole responsibility for doing so but without rendering it impossible for exceptions to be made.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur proposes various forms of legal review where the positions of the citizens and the decisions of the relevant authority do not tally, particularly where the subject involves major issues such as security, the environment and public health. As regards the need to ensure that the Member States have the possibility of exemption from the directive in the event of an emergency, there is a specific amendment providing this loophole with due regard for subsidiarity and for specific environmental conditions or crises.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as public participation is concerned, the rapporteur has resurrected a number of amendments already rejected by the Council, clearly hoping that the role of the citizens and their lawfully established organisations in the drawing up of environmental decisions will be reconsidered.</p>
<p class="contents">Many amendments were accepted by the Council, and some of them propose again particularly important, not to say essential principles. Here are some of them. Most importantly, there is the principle that the public must be furnished with the necessary information through electronic media providing access to the institutions’ documents. Secondly, the public must receive, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, information about the right to participate in decision-making in the forms and quantities permitted – we touched on this just now. Thirdly, the public must be entitled to express both minor and far-reaching comments and adopt positions without prejudice to any options. A further obligation is placed upon the competent authorities, and that is to make reasonable efforts – as the document states – to reply to the public individually or collectively, and an obligation is placed upon the Member States too, to adopt practical, tangible measures on the review procedures and to make available to the public all the necessary information on how to obtain access to both administrative and judicial review procedures. This is to make it possible for the citizens to defend any grounds they may have for dissent throughout the judgment process and uphold an opinion which is different from that of the competent authority.</p>
<p class="contents">This line of reasoning may, of course, be interpreted in different ways in different countries, depending on the level of democracy permitting public participation and, above all, protecting the organisations through which the public exercises this right of participation. Two things appear to be particularly important: firstly, the provision of access to cooperation and to the drawing up of legislative documents, and secondly, the provision of access to legal review throughout the judgment process in the event of differences. In this way, we are following faithfully the basic philosophy of Voltaire, who said, 'I may disagree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it'. Even if Europe is not improving our knowledge of law, it is, at least, teaching us some philosophy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to the statistics of the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions, 40% of these petitions concern failure to comply with Community Law on the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, if these measures for public participation in drawing up certain plans and programmes concerning the environment were really put into practice, if we really complied with the Directive on the public right to information, I am sure that a significant number of these petitions, which are noted each week in the Minutes of the sitting, would probably not reach here, because what we are seeing in the Committee on Petitions, where all these petitions arrive, is that not only is the public not allowed to participate in these environmental programmes, but it is sometimes denied the information that the Directive on the right to information should guarantee it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I think that if we manage to have the amendments from this second reading adopted, and this third pillar of the legal aspects the rapporteur talked about is discussed in Parliament and ends well, we shall manage to reduce this list of petitions on the environment at each sitting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At least I was not aware of anyone mentioning the fact that the right to participate in decision-making is an absolutely essential aspect of citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect the report under discussion, which Eija-Riitta Korhola has skilfully taken through from the Committee stage to plenary session, is absolutely indispensable, as the fact that the European Union has begun to implement the Aarhus Convention shows that it is understood in the Union that, at least in environmental matters, we can make a start and give our citizens the right to participate. Mrs González Álvarez also raised a very important matter. She said that the public would have far fewer complaints about non-compliance with Community legislation if they had the right to participate in decision-making relating to it right from the early stages, and this is precisely what this report is about.</p>
<p class="contents">It is absolutely essential that this right to participate should be applied widely to the parties concerned. In this regard it is important that Amendment No 10 actually goes through. I have no doubt that it will, but it does state that non-governmental organisations shall also be deemed to meet the definition of what constitutes a party concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I took note of the fact that, unfortunately, the final document produced by the United States of America and the group of developing countries at the Johannesburg summit on sustainable development that has just ended made no mention of Principle 10 of the Rio Conference, which specifically concerns the right of the public to participate in decision-making on the environment. It is even more important that the European Union should swiftly bring the Aarhus Convention into force. Now we will discuss the second part of the Convention which deals with the right to participate in decision-making.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur said that the right to participation can be abused. Unfortunately, however, much too much is made of this subject of abuse. In fact when the public actually start to exercise the rights they have, those who could not care less about their opinions all too readily claim those rights are being abused. I believe that when people are granted the right to participate they will also exercise that right responsibly and will eventually enjoy even fuller rights as citizens and that it will not occur to them to upset or terrorise the decision-making process. That is perhaps more an unfounded concern on the part of the decision-maker. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bernié (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, after having supported public access to environmental information in May 2000, today we back public participation in environmental programmes. The objective remains the same, that is to say to make decisions more transparent and to allow the citizens concerned to bring a civil action. But let us avoid hindering public lawsuits with the burden of costly inquiries.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, the limits of the directive must be based on Amendment No 3, that is to say, 'effective public participation in the taking of decisions enables the public to express, and the decision-maker to take account of, opinions and concerns which may be relevant to those decisions, thereby increasing the accountability and transparency of the decision-making process and contributing to public support for the decisions taken.' In the same manner, Member States must, in accordance with their national legislation, be able to exclude these provisions from programmes affecting national defence.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, certain amendments approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy are not acceptable as they stand. Providing the public with information relating to decision-making is, in my opinion, a matter for citizens’ associations. Achieving widespread public participation in the entirety of Community legislation seems utopian. If this is the case we will soon witness a marked increase in litigation. This type of procedure should be reserved for certain directives, such as Seveso or Natura 2000. In this particular case, owners affected by zoning have not even been consulted. The concept of the public has also not been defined, this wide and all-embracing concept ranging from a physical person to an association, as well as the more specific concept of the public concerned. In my opinion, only the public concerned should be included. Yet, the directive recognises non-governmental organisations working for the protection of the environment as having an interest in this context, which considerably increases the scope of our measures to the detriment of public prerogatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore it is an honour for me to participate in this debate on her behalf.</p>
<p class="contents">The first meeting of the parties to the Aarhus Convention on access to information, public participation and access to justice in environmental matters will take place at the end of October. The Community will not yet be in a position to participate as a party to that convention. We can, however, show that we take our commitments seriously and make good progress in adopting the implementing legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">This common position deals with the second pillar of the convention, public participation in environmental decision-making. In addition, other recent Community legislation already incorporates the principles of the Aarhus Convention concerning public participation and the common position on access to environmental information is under consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will present the remaining proposals, notably on access to justice and the application of the convention to Community institutions, by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">The present common position, with one exception, provides a good basis to enable this directive on public participation to be adopted fairly soon. The Commission is happy that the rapporteur and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy as a whole share this positive view and also support the Commission's position on the outstanding issue.</p>
<p class="contents">On the main amendments tabled for the vote tomorrow, the Commission's position is as follows.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, public participation in the updating of permits under the IPPC directive. I will start with the exception where the Commission is not happy with the common position. Under the Aarhus Convention, public participation is as a rule required, not only for the issue but also for the updating of permits for the activities covered. This was provided for in the Commission's proposal concerning permits under the IPPC Directive, where such updating is a key revision.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position largely restricted this requirement and its wording leaves a wide discretion to the Member States and the competent authorities in charge of updating permits. This will lead to widely divergent practice and legal uncertainty and will potentially mean that public participation is possible only in a few cases when permits are being updated, rather than being the rule.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 15 requires public participation for the most relevant cases of permit updates, which are those covered by Article 13 of the IPPC directive. While the Commission proposal included permit updates as such, the amendment is in line with Article 6(10) of the Aarhus Convention, which allows for the rules on public participation to apply updates where appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers public participation in permit updates covered by Article 13 appropriate. The wording of the common position fails to identify where public participation is deemed to be appropriate, leaving it entirely to the discretion of the Member States. The Commission therefore fully supports Amendment No 15.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the extension of the public participation provisions to cover other Community legislation plans and programmes which may have a significant effect on the environment, Amendment No 18 proposes extending considerably the scope of Article 2 to cover other Community legislation, plans and programmes, which may have a significant effect on the environment or health. The Commission cannot accept this amendment, nor can it accept related Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 6 to the recitals, for the following reasons. To the extent that the wording refers to public participation in the preparation of Community legislation, the present directive is not the correct legal instrument. In addition, public participation in the preparation of legislation is referred to as soft law under the Aarhus Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">In regard to plans and programmes, the amendment would considerably deviate from the original approach to cover clearly identified plans and programmes in the environmental field. It would not provide sufficient legal certainty as to which plans and programmes are covered and would duplicate measures in different pieces of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In respect of plans and programmes in other sectors likely to have significant environmental effects, Directive 2001/42/EC on strategic environmental assessment already incorporates measures of particular relevance. This directive provides for an environmental assessment of relevant plans and programmes in the integration sectors. As part of the assessment, public participation will take place in line with the Aarhus Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn now to access to justice. The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 10 providing for access to justice in relation to plans and programmes covered by the directive, or Amendment No 5 on the related recital.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 9(2) of the Aarhus Convention explicitly requires access to justice in relation to projects that may have a significant effect on the environment. This is dealt with under the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to plans and programmes, access to justice is not explicitly required. It would also be inconsistent to apply it to certain plans and programmes when it is not provided for in the case of those covered by the directive on strategic environmental assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission is preparing a legislative proposal on access to justice to fully implement the third pillar of the Aarhus Convention. In the framework of that proposal, the content of Amendment No 10 could more appropriately be addressed in a horizontal way.</p>
<p class="contents">On the amendments concerning information about the outcome of public participation and practical information concerning administrative and judicial review, the Commission would like to point out that the provisions on public participation have to be practicable to allow smooth implementation in the different administrative systems of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 7, 13, 14 and 16 require the competent authority to make reasonable efforts to reply to the public and to ensure that information provided about decisions taken includes practical direction concerning the procedure for seeking review. The common position already incorporates the obligation to inform the public about the final decision and the underlying reasons and considerations and provides for appropriate information to be made available on the review procedures. Requiring more would constitute a disproportionate administrative burden and hamper effective public participation. The Commission therefore cannot accept those amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise our position on the amendments: the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 15 and 19. Amendments Nos 3, 4, 11 and 12 can be accepted in principle. The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 5 to 10, 13, 14, nor Amendments Nos 16 to 18.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to emphasise that it is in our common interest, which is the interest of the European citizens, to have this directive enter in force swiftly so that public participation can be fully integrated into administrative practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
