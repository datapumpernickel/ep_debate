<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The European Parliament and the Council established a clear objective in the legislative package of the Seventh Research and Development Framework Programme 2007-2013 (FP7)<a href="#defann_1_1" name="refann_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, according to which particular attention is to be paid to ensure the adequate participation in the Programme of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME).</p>
<p>Consequently this objective is at the core of the FP7 implementing measures, notably the "Cooperation" programme, which provides that a strategy should be established for SMEs for each priority theme and that the aim will be to enable at least 15% of the funding available under this programme to go to SMEs. The SMEs also benefit from a higher funding rate of 75% of eligible costs in FP7 (compared to 50% for larger companies). The collective financial responsibility that existed in FP6 was in FP7 replaced by the existence of the Guarantee Fund, which minimized financial risk for SMEs.</p>
<p>As the Honourable member is aware, the Commission is responsible for the implementation of the FP7 according to the objectives of the Programme therefore, the Commission should take all necessary measures to promote the participation of SMEs. One of such measures is the conference Research Connection 2009 organised by the Commission under the Czech Presidency in May 2009 in Prague. One part of this conference is directly dedicated to the participation of SMEs in FP7.</p>
<p>The Council would also like to draw the attention of the Honourable Parliamentarian to the important European Community initiatives in support of innovation, such as:</p>
<p>The Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 2006<a href="#defann_1_2" name="refann_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a></p>
<p>The lead market initiative for Europe launched by the Commission, which the Council welcomed and encouraged in its conclusions adopted on 29 May 2008<a href="#defann_1_3" name="refann_1_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The regional innovation cluster policy, which the Council welcomed in its conclusions of 1 December 2008 as a tool to stimulate the SME potential and integration in high technology networks<a href="#defann_1_4" name="refann_1_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Finally, one should also point out the European Investment Bank's recent decision to mobilise EUR 30 billion to support European SMEs in the context of the European Economic Recovery Plan.</p>
<p>These elements need to be mentioned together with the research activities provided for by the FP7, given that innovative SMEs conduct research and technological development activities not falling under the FP7could develop with the help of these other innovation support schemes provided by the European Union.</p>
<p>I would like to ensure the Honourable Member, that the Czech Presidency is fully aware of the importance of small and medium enterprises (SME´s) as drivers of research, its application and innovation. According to the Presidency a special approach towards SME´s is needed in order to facilitate their participation in the FP7 – we believe that further simplification of procedures linked with participation of SME´s in all framework programmes needs to be encouraged. The Presidency will also lend full support to the European Commission in its implementation activities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The European Union is the world's largest giver of aid to the developing world, yet a BBC Panorama programme broadcast in late November 2008 highlighted how this aid is too often misspent, inefficiently used, or fails to reach its target population. Among the many issues highlighted was the inefficiency of aid spent in the education sector, where money is spent on buildings rather than on training and wages, with the result that teaching standards can be low. There are often high levels of teacher-absenteeism as teachers are forced to work in multiple jobs to get by. Such trends could very easily lead to a very worrying and frankly unacceptable situation where the MDG 2 of universal primary education is superficially achieved, but with the education being of such a low standard as to be of little merit or value in changing the lives of the children involved.

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council recalls that it is the responsibility of the Commission to programme the use of financial resources and support the management of Community aid, and the European Development Fund (EDF).</p>
<p>The Council would like to draw the attention on the two dimensions of the aid, i.e. (1) the specific provisions intended to monitor the delivery of aid and (2) the initiatives designed to improve the effectiveness of aid. On both aspects, the Council is and will continue to be vigilant and active.</p>
<p>1. Monitoring of aid delivery</p>
<p>All EC development cooperation instruments contain specific provisions intended to protect the EC's financial interests. The Commission and the Court of Auditors are entitled to perform audits, including document audits or on the spot audits of any contractor or subcontractor who has received Community funds.</p>
<p>Both the Council and the European Parliament have the possibility to assess the way in which EC external assistance has been implemented on a yearly basis through the Annual Report on the EC's Development and External Assistance Policies and their implementation that the Commission usually presents towards the end of June.</p>
<p>This being said, the Council believes that the proper management and implementation of development aid is not just the donor's responsibility: the principles of ownership, good governance and mutual accountability must apply, and in this regard our eligible partners are also co-responsible. In its Conclusions of 27 May 2008, the Council reaffirmed the importance of implementing strengthened mutual accountability mechanisms at the country, regional and international level for ensuring more equal partnerships.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission set up in July 2008 an Internet website offering comprehensive information on the management and implementation of all EC external cooperation programmes. It is managed by Europe Aid and is accessible to the wider public.</p>
<p>2. Aid effectiveness</p>
<p>The EU is firmly committed through both the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness of March 2005<a href="#defann_2_1" name="refann_2_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and the EU Consensus on Development of November 2005<a href="#defann_2_2" name="refann_2_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> to deliver more and better aid. In particular, the EU is committed to promote better donor coordination and complementarity by working towards joint multiannual programming, based on partner countries’ poverty reduction or equivalent strategies and country’s own budget processes, common implementation mechanisms including shared analysis, joint donor wide missions, and the use of co-financing arrangements.</p>
<p>Complementarity of donor activities is of paramount importance for increasing aid effectiveness, and thus for a more effective and efficient development assistance. In this sense, the Council and the Member States adopted in May 2007 an EU Code of Conduct on Complementarity and Division of Labour in Development Policy<a href="#defann_2_3" name="refann_2_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. Finally, the Ministerial Declaration adopted in September 2008 after the third high level Forum on Aid Effectiveness (i.e. the Accra Agenda for Action) provides for a very ambitious approach of the EU and wanted strong, precise and measurable commitments as well as a timetable for implementation</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>With regard to the Spring European Council and the EU strategy for growth and jobs, the Czech Presidency will indeed put the European Union's competitiveness agenda on top of its priorities, as it is well aware that the current economic downturn requires the EU to act, and to do so with strength and resolve. A significant economic slowdown underlines the importance of the Lisbon Strategy as a set of instruments to strengthen economic growth and resistance of economies to internal and external shocks. Therefore, the March Competitiveness Council will be dominated by the adoption of the Key Issues Paper<a href="#defann_3_1" name="refann_3_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> of the Competitiveness Council to the Spring European Council 2009, which will be all about growth and jobs. The rest of the Presidency will be dedicated as a priority to implementing the European Economic Recovery Plan<a href="#defann_3_2" name="refann_3_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and to fulfil such new European Council mandates as the European Innovation Plan.</p>
<p>The Presidency's intention is already quite clear from the motto it has chosen for its term, i.e. "Europe without Barriers", which is much more than a political catchword. In fact, it includes an ambitious programme to work towards effective strengthening of the single market and the knowledge triangle including research, education and innovation in order to preserve and stimulate growth and job creation, while keeping in mind necessity of administrative burden's reduction and simplification of legislation</p>
<p>The fifth anniversary of the most extensive EU enlargement creates an opportunity for an evaluation of its costs and benefits for all Member States. The Czech Presidency, in cooperation with European Commission and the OECD, will present a study that will identify remaining barriers in the internal market and will discuss it at the international conference "5 Years After’, to be held in March 2009.</p>
<p>In this framework, the Czech Presidency intends to focus its activities and mobilise Member States on the following six major issues:</p>
<p>- A fully-functioning single market without barriers.</p>
<p>- Promoting seamless interaction within the knowledge triangle.</p>
<p>- Better regulation, focussing on a reduction of administrative burden</p>
<p>- Strengthening the backbone of European industry: support for small and medium enterprises (SMEs)</p>
<p>- Speed up the economic reform process in order to achieve a sharper focus on competitiveness and innovation</p>
<p>- Stepping up and improving investment in knowledge, research and innovation</p>
<p>These activities cover a short-term, a medium-term and a long-term perspective on Europe's competitiveness. In other words, we need to act now while thinking ahead. With this in mind, the Czech Presidency intends to centre discussions amongst Member States on these issues of the competitiveness agenda, and it firmly believes that a clear message on them should be sent to the heads of state and government leaders who will gather in March 2009 to discuss, among other subjects, the EU's economic situation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The fight against trafficking in human beings is among one of the present greatest challenges not only in the EU but word-wide as well. Trafficking in human beings is one of the most serious forms of organised crime and, due to the huge profits made by offenders through such activities, it is one of the most profitable forms of crime. As trafficking in human beings takes a range of forms, the measures adopted against it must be equally broad and comprehensive.</p>
<p>In its Legislative and Work Programme 2009<a href="#defann_5_2" name="refann_5_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> under "Organised Crime Package: helping the victims", the Commission announced the submission to the Council of a legislative proposal for up-dating the Council Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA on combating trafficking in human beings<a href="#defann_5_3" name="refann_5_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. Therefore it is firstly for the Commission to examine the possibility and the necessity of further harmonisation concerning such criminal law provisions. It is the intention of the Czech Presidency to initiate rapidly thereafter the discussions in the framework of the Council on such a proposal.</p>
<p>In the area of combating trafficking in human beings, the Czech Presidency intends to contribute mainly to the introduction of best practices with regard to the harmonisation of data collection. An expert Conference, titled "Joint Analysis, Joint Action" is scheduled in Prague on 30-31 March 2009. Among other topics, the conference will aim in particular at exploring possibilities for the creation of a network of national rapporteurs on trafficking in human beings in the European Union, as well as at the issue of protection of vulnerable victims and their position within criminal proceedings.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>In addressing the question of work performed within the context of the family, and especially the recognition of that work, and its implications for the family, the Honourable Member has raised a highly important issue.</p>
<p>As you know, the European Parliament and the Council can only act in a legislative capacity on the basis of a proposal from the Commission. I would like to recall that the Commission has indeed recently tabled a proposal that addresses the concerns expressed by the Honourable Member. I refer to the proposal for a new Directive on the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity and repealing Directive 86/613/EEC<a href="#defann_6_1" name="refann_6_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The proposal aims at improving the social protection of self-employed workers, with a view to removing disincentives to female entrepreneurship. It also seeks to improve the social protection of "assisting spouses", who often work in the self-employed sector without enjoying the corresponding rights. As the Honourable Member knows, the vast majority of such “assisting spouses” are women, and many of them work in the agricultural sector. The Commission's proposal aims also at enhancing the recognition of such self-employment within the family. By providing for maternity leave rights to be granted to “assisting spouses” who wish to have them, the proposal also seeks to redress the sometimes problematic implications that informal employment within family businesses can have for the family itself, especially when “assisting spouses” have children.</p>
<p>Turning to the broader implications of unrecognised work by “assisting spouses” in the long term, I would also like to assure the Honourable Member that the Council is aware of the particularly difficult situation faced by unsalaried women who depend on their husbands for their income and whose financial situation is often precarious when they retire, or if they divorce or are widowed. The Council expressed its concern with regard to this issue in December 2007, when it adopted a set of Conclusions on "Women and Poverty", including a set of statistical indicators developed by the Portuguese Presidency in the context of the Beijing Platform for Action<a href="#defann_6_2" name="refann_6_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. In these Conclusions, the Council recognised that women were more vulnerable to income poverty than men and that the gender gap increased with age.</p>
<p>More recently, in December 2008, the Council adopted a set of Conclusions on "Women and the Economy: the Reconciliation of Work and Family Life", once again in the context of the follow-up to the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action<a href="#defann_6_3" name="refann_6_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. Here, too, the Council reaffirmed the importance of measures allowing women and men to reconcile their work and family responsibilities, and called for appropriate policies.</p>
<p>To conclude, the Council is actively addressing the concerns that the Honourable Member has raised with respect to self-employment within a family context. The Czech Presidency will continue with discussions on the above-mentioned legislative initiative and in this respect will follow development in the European Parliament.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council shares Parliament's concerns in relation to the high number of road fatalities every year on European roads and the difficulty in punishing traffic offences committed by non-resident drivers.</p>
<p>The Council would like to point out that in September 2008, the French Presidency of the Council organised a seminar on the European coordination of road safety campaigns. During this seminar, possibilities were explored for making action on road safety more effective. As a follow-up to the conference, the Council adopted on 27/28 November 2008 conclusions on the coordination of police action on road safety. These conclusions aim to put in place a Europe-wide process of coordination of police forces involved in road safety. The Council also affirmed its determination to launch the necessary initiatives to improve strategic and operational cooperation to improve road safety on the basis of what already exists.</p>
<p>In this regard, the Council recalls its Framework Decision 2005/214/JHA on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties<a href="#defann_7_1" name="refann_7_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. This Framework Decision covers financial penalties imposed in respect of road traffic offences. The national legislation enacted in line with the Framework Decision should enable judicial authorities and, in certain cases, also administrative authorities to transmit a financial penalty to authorities in other Member States and have that penalty recognised and executed without any further formality.</p>
<p>The Council also recalls its Decision 2008/615/JHA on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation<a href="#defann_7_2" name="refann_7_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime. This so-called "Prüm Decision" provides for cross-border co-operation in matters covered by Title VI of the EU Treaty, and inter alia facilitates the exchange of vehicle registration data between Member States.</p>
<p>Finally, the Council would point to the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council facilitating cross-border enforcement in the field of road safety of 19 March 2008. This proposal aims at improving road safety in the European Union by foreseeing the cross-border enforcement of sanctions for four road traffic offences, which provoke the largest percentage of deaths, namely speeding, drink-driving, non-use of a seat belt and failing to stop at a red traffic light, committed with vehicles registered in Member States other than the State of the offence. This proposal has been examined by the Council.</p>
<p>It is true that a large majority of its members is not convinced that the legal case proposed for adoption of these measures allows the Community to do so, it cannot be inferred from this position that the Council would be unwilling to support other proposals for new legislation that may be submitted to it. Indeed, the legitimacy of the objective of ensuring cross border enforcement of traffic offences has not been questioned as such by Council members.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The idea of setting up a European coastguard was put forward by the European Parliament and the Council in Article 11 of Directive 2005/35/EC on ship-source pollution and on the introduction of penalties for infringements<a href="#defann_8_1" name="refann_8_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. In that Directive the Commission was asked to submit a feasibility study on a European coastguard dedicated to pollution prevention and response. That study has not so far been submitted. The question of whether a European coastguard should be set up is also one of the issues raised in the Commission Green Paper of June 2006 on an EU maritime policy<a href="#defann_8_2" name="refann_8_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>As regards border controls and combating illegal immigration, the “Hague Programme: strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union”<a href="#defann_8_3" name="refann_8_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, approved by the European Council at its meeting on 5 November 2004, raises the possibility of creating a "European system of border guards". This idea was taken up in the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum<a href="#defann_8_4" name="refann_8_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, adopted by the European Council on 15 and 16 October 2008, which states that ultimately the setting up of such a system may be examined.</p>
<p>It is a matter of fact that threats need to be addressed with appropriate measures and this concerns sea, land as well as air borders. Frontex plays a significant role in the management of operational cooperation of the Member States at the external borders and is still in a phase of developing the use of tools available based on the current mandate.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Article 62, point (2)(a) of the EC Treaty limits Community competence to the adoption of standards and procedures to be followed by Member States in carrying out checks on persons at external borders, which implies that responsibility for carrying out such checks lies with the Member States.</p>
<p>To date, no Commission proposal, either on the setting up of a European coastguard or on a European system of border guards, has been received by the Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council is aware of the recent problems with regard to Belarusian children travelling on aid trips (Chernobyl charities) and holidays to various European countries, including Ireland, and is following the situation since the beginning.</p>
<p>The states concerned are currently holding consultations with the relevant Belarusian authorities to address bilaterally the concerns that have arisen in this matter.

<p>Furthermore, it should be noted that in this regard a démarche by the local EU Troika had been carried out on 3 December 2008 at the Belarusian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Minsk. On this occasion the importance of the continuation of these visits was stressed and had been received in constructive spirit by the Belarusian authorities.</p>

<p>In July 1999, the Council adopted Directive 1999/74/EC on minimum standards for the protection of laying hens. The Directive provides that as from 1 January 2012, rearing of laying hens is no longer permitted in the EU in cages that do not meet the minimum welfare requirements set out in the Directive.</p>
<p>With stakeholders' concerns in mind, the Directive had mandated the Commission to submit to the Council a report, drawn up on the basis of a scientific opinion which takes into account the physiological, ethological, health and environmental aspects of various breeding systems of laying hens, and on a study of their socio-economic implications and their effects on the Community's economic partners. The report was to be accompanied by appropriate proposals taking into account the conclusions of the report and the outcome of the World Trade Organisation negotiations.</p>
<p>The report in question was submitted by the Commission to the Council in January 2008, together with a Commission Working Document citing the sources used. It was drawn up taking into account, inter alia, a socio-economic study containing Member States reports.</p>
<p>Based on this report, the Commission confirmed to the Council its intention not to propose any deferment of the date foreseen for the prohibition of conventional cages, nor any other appropriate proposals.</p>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>As the Honourable Member certainly knows, the Accession Treaty with Bulgaria and Romania provides for a transitional period of up to seven years regarding the freedom of movement for workers. During this period, the EU-25 Member States may apply national measures regulating access to their labour markets by nationals of the new Member States.</p>
<p>The initial transitional period of two years from accession indeed expired on 31 December 2008. The Council is now called upon to review any transitional restrictions on the basis of a report from the Commission. The Council took note of the Commission's presentation of its report on 17 December 2008. The Report will be again on the agenda of the next Meeting of the EPSCO Council in March 2009. The Czech Presidency put the removal of any barriers in the Internal Market of the Union, including the barriers to free movement of workers, as one of its main political priorities with the objective of thorough political debate at various levels, for example at the Informal meeting of employment ministers in the Czech Republic, and encouraging Member States to remove barriers to mobility and free movement of workers where they prove useless and unsubstantiated. The Council will promote various measures which facilitate mobility and free movement of workers throughout the European Union.</p>
<p>However, national measures may continue to be applied until the fifth year after accession and may be prolonged for another two years in those Member States where would be serious disturbances on the labour markets.</p>
<p>In any event, it should be underlined that, according to the Accession Treaty, the decision on whether to continue applying national measures, as well as the nature of these measures, is a matter of national competence. However, such a decision should only be taken after serious reflection by the Member States concerned on the basis of an objective assessment of the situation on the ground.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1002"></a>

<p>The motto of the Czech Presidency is Europe without barriers. Dismantling barriers is our aim not only in terms of internal, but also external policies. The EU exists in a world of relations and contingencies and as such it has never been a solitary player in the field of trade policies. The internal objectives of the EU, be it employment, high standard of living, development or security, are linked to a large extent to the capacity of European economic players to assert themselves beyond the borders of the EU itself. The Czech Presidency is aware of this fact and will actively contribute to the opening of more markets to products, services and investments from the EU - free trade is one of the tools for solving the contemporary crisis.</p>
<p>On 15 November, the members of the G20 emphasised the importance of reaching an "agreement on modalities that leads to a successful conclusion to the WTO’s Doha Development Agenda with an ambitious and balanced outcome this year ". In this context, the Council was briefed by the Commission on 8 December on the latest developments at the World Trade Organisation concerning the trade negotiations of the Doha Development Agenda, with a view to a possible ministerial meeting in Geneva by the end of December.</p>
<p>On 11-12 December 2008, the European Council in its conclusions indicated that it endorses the objective of arriving this year, within the World Trade Organisation, at an agreement on the modalities leading to the conclusion of the Doha Development Agenda with an ambitious, global and balanced result.</p>
<p>In this sense, the Commission and the Council were ready for an EU constructive participation at a Ministerial meeting if and when convened. However on 12 December 2008, the WTO Director General, at an informal meeting of heads of delegations, indicated that in the absence of "dramatic changes in the following 48 hours", he would not convene ministers to finalize modalities by the end of the year. On that occasion, he said that after a week of intensive consultations, he had not detected the sufficient political drive for a final push towards agreement and considered that holding such a meeting would have a high risk of failure which could have damaged not only the Round but also the WTO system as a whole, and so the Ministerial meeting took not place.</p>
<p>The European Union continues to stay fully committed to the multilateral trade system as well as to the conclusion of a balanced, ambitious and comprehensive agreement of the WTO Doha Development Round, especially in the present economic and financial circumstances. For the Czech Presidency the DDA is a tool for achieving transparent liberalisation of trade on the multilateral level, which will bring about long-term advantages. The Presidency will strive to renew discussion as soon as possible and will also support more intense negotiations within the framework of other WTO agendas, in particular in the services and TRIPS area. The Presidency supports the most extensive application of the multilateral trade system possible. For these reasons it will continue the process of the extension of the WTO membership base.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1009"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council strongly considers that discriminations based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation are incompatible with the principles upon which the EU is founded. The EU institutions have repeatedly rejected and condemned all manifestations of such discriminations.</p>
<p>The EU, within the limits of the powers conferred on it by the Treaties, determinedly pursues a clear policy of fighting these phenomena, both within its borders and in the context of its external action around 80 countries worldwide still criminalise homosexuality.</p>
<p>Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the European Community provides a legal base on which to develop "appropriate action to combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation". Using these powers, the EU unanimously adopted the Racial Equality Directive in June 2000 (2000/43/EC)<a href="#defann_14_1" name="refann_14_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and the Employment Framework Directive in November 2000 (2000/78/EC)<a href="#defann_14_2" name="refann_14_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In the external relations context, the EU is actively engaged in efforts within the United Nations to tackle racism and discrimination, including discrimination based on sexual orientation. In this regard, the EU has fully and successfully supported in 2006 Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender (LGBT) rights groups to have UN consultative status in the NGO Committee of the UN ECOSOC. In addition, the declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity was presented in the General Assembly on December 18, 2008 on behalf of the (so far) 66 states as a part of the debate of the General Assembly agenda item 64b "Human rights questions, including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms". The declaration reaffirms the principles of universality and non discrimination (among other things) and "urge(s) States to take all the necessary measures, in particular legislative or administrative, to ensure that sexual orientation or gender identity may under no circumstances be the basis for criminal penalties, in particular executions, arrests or detention."</p>
<p>The EU has incorporated racism, xenophobia and discrimination issues in its political dialogues with third countries and constantly promotes the principle of non-discrimination which requires that human rights apply equally to every human being regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.</p>
<p>Concerning applications for asylum, the Council Directive 2004/83/EC on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted introduces the concept of persecution ground based on the membership to a particular social group. According to its Article 10 (d), a particular social group might include a group based on a common characteristic of sexual orientation. Member States shall take this element into account when assessing the reasons for persecution in the context of the decision to be taken concerning an application for international protection.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>According to recent reports appearing in Spain, a official document has come to light which states that in January 2002 senior Spanish government figures were informed by the political-military attaché of the US embassy that his country wished to use Spanish airspace and airports for purposes of transporting 'prisoners' to the Guantánamo military base. Also requested was the use if necessary of Spanish military bases for transport back-up. The document, which until now was secret, states that the same procedure was being followed with other countries on the American planes' route, including Italy and Portugal. On accepting this request the Member States concerned appear to have been informed that the US was going to use their airspace to transport illegally held prisoners to Guantánamo.

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Presidency is concerned about the global financial crisis and its potential repercussions on developing countries. An exchange of view on this issue among Development Ministers will take place at their informal ministerial meeting set to take place in Prague in a few days [on 29-30 January 2009].</p>
<p>As far as Official Development Assistance (ODA) is concerned, in the Council Conclusions adopted in May 2008<a href="#defann_16_1" name="refann_16_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the EU strongly reaffirmed its long-term financial commitment with developing countries to achieve a collective ODA target of 0,56% GNI by 2010 and 0.7% GNI by 2015, as set out in the May 2005 Council Conclusions, the June 2005 European Council Conclusions and the European Consensus on Development in November the 22nd 2005.</p>
<p>In the context of Council Conclusions of May 2005<a href="#defann_16_2" name="refann_16_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, in particular, it was specified that Member States which had joined the EU after 2002 and that had not reached a level of 0,17% ODA/GNI would strive to increase their ODA to reach, within their respective budget allocation processes, that level by 2010, while those that were already above that level undertook to sustain their efforts. Moreover, EU Member States undertook to achieve the 0.7% ODA/ GNI target by 2015 whilst those which had achieved that target committed themselves to remain above that target; Member States which had joined the EU after 2002 will strive to increase by 2015 their ODA/GNI to 0.33%.</p>
<p>The commitment of the Czech Republic should refer to the context of the collective ODA target which the EU undertook in order to achieve the targets as has already been reaffirmed at several occasions.</p>
<p>In its recent Conclusions adopted on 11 November 2008<a href="#defann_16_3" name="refann_16_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, the Council, underlining that this issue falls within the competence of Member States, encouraged Member States concerned to work on national timetables, by the end of 2010, to increase aid levels within their respective budget allocation processes, towards achieving the established ODA targets.</p>
<p>We find of substantial importance that the essential tools and modalities of financing should aim at emphasizing the inevitability of aid effectiveness taking into account of the role of trade and the WTO in the development as well as the importance of the Aid for Trade Program. The responsibility for sound development policies of our partners in their respective countries in light with our accountability to tax payers for resources provided is vital both for the donors and receiving countries. These issues have been broadly discussed at the international forums. The recent ones in New York and at the HLF in Accra as well as the Doha Conference have stressed that discussions on strengthening of FfD follow-up mechanism will be initiated at the spring conference of the ECOSOC in April 2009. We believe that different modalities of the ODA should be considered as an effective way and thus consequently enable all actors become beneficiaries of the ODA commitments.</p>
<p>The actions of the Czech Presidency are and will be in accordance with the previously mentioned Council Conclusions. Similarly as a number of EU Member States, the Czech Presidency will strive to increase its ODA to the level of 0,17% by 2010 and to the level of 0,33% by 2015. In the current situation of global financial crisis we do not expect any substantive increase of our ODA.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council follows up closely the human rights situation in Tanzania and has noted with great concern the deteriorating situation of Albinos in the country. In line with its human rights policy, the Council will raise the issue with the Tanzanian authorities, calling for further action to put an end to the phenomenon and for justice to the victims and their families.</p>
<p>In Tanzania Albinos have traditionally been victims of discrimination. In some regions, getting an Albino child was long perceived to be a curse for the entire community, and quite a number of them were killed at birth. However, the problem has recently taken another dimension and gruesome Albinos' murders now occurring are driven by sheer lure of money, killers taking advantage of poverty, despair and strong belief in witchcraft.</p>
<p>The Government of Tanzania has already taken some measures in order to put an end to these crimes and President Kikwete has instructed the regional commissioners to that effect.</p>
<p>Measures include improved security and protection of Albinos in Mwanza region and awareness raising. Among others Albino schoolchildren whose lives were threatened have been transferred to a special school in Misungwi district and other boarding schools in the region which are guarded by police force. A census of Albinos is on its way.</p>
<p>At the same time NGOs are actively involved in the field of awareness raising. In many concerned villages people have been sensitized against the killings of Albinos. All households with Albinos have been visited separately to sensitize them and to encourage them to report any suspected person to the police.</p>
<p>The Council will continue to closely monitor the situation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1021"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Energy belongs to one of the three main political priorities of the Czech Presidency. It is generally recognised that in the implementation of the European Council Action Plan (2007-2009), as agreed by the Spring 2007 European Council, an emphasis should be placed on energy security. This is where the Czech Presidency will concentrate its efforts to further and strengthen the EU Energy Policy. The recent interruption of gas import from Russia and transit via Ukraine have highlighted the weight of this issue on the EU agenda.</p>
<p>Regarding the imports of gas into the European Union, the Council recalls the aim stated in that Action Plan, namely to enhance security of supply through effective diversification of energy sources, suppliers and transport routes. The Czech Presidency has reiterated the need to reinforce confidence vis-à-vis existing suppliers, but at the same time to intensify cooperation with other complementary suppliers at the informal General Affairs Council, which took place in Prague on 8 January 2009. Energy security was one of three main topics of this informal meeting of Ministers of European Affairs and Foreign Ministers.</p>
<p>In February 2009, according to the Presidency's calendar, the Council is scheduled to adopt conclusions on the Communication "Second Strategic Energy Review – an EU energy security and solidarity action plan", which the Commission presented in November 2008. In the larger context of intra-EU energy security, this communication mentions the Baltic Interconnection Plan, along with the Southern gas corridor. These Council conclusions and the Communication itself will be submitted to the Spring 2009 European Council.</p>
<p>The Czech Presidency furthermore intends to signal the interest of the Community to gas producers and transit countries in the Caucasus region and in Central Asia at the “Southern Corridor Summit – East West Link”, which will be held during its Presidency. The summit, the preparation of which is being pursued by the Presidency in close cooperation with the Commission and Member States, will be held at the heads of states level with the aim to launch a stable cooperation with countries of the region.</p>
<p>The diversification of gas resources will be improved by the construction of the LNG terminals too.</p>
<p>But this is a timely, financially and energetically demanding variant.</p>
<p>Apart from decreasing the dependence on gas imports, the repeated dispute between Russia and Ukraine over gas, which has held EU hostage to an unprecedented extent, has highlighted the importance of strengthening solidarity of all Member States in case of disruptions of supplies. This issue belonged to the topics of the extraordinary Energy Council convened by the Czech Presidency on 12 January 2009. Possible measures include revision of the Directive 2004/67/EC concerning measures to safeguard security of natural gas supply, which is currently the main legislative tool for implementing energy solidarity, investment into interconnections of energy infrastructure (so as to technically enable Member States to assist each other in need) or introduction of a transparency mechanism for sharing information in the field of energy between Member States (including contacts with third-country partners or planned investment into infrastructure projects).</p>
<p>As regards the Council's position on the Nabucco project and its effect on the export of gas to the European Union, the Council refers the Honourable Parliamentarian to its replies to Oral Question <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2007-0590_EN.html">H-0590/07</a> on that subject.</p>

<p>Information which has recently come to light refers to the systematic arrest of asylum seekers in Greece, their squalid conditions of imprisonment and the actions of the Greek authorities in forcibly expelling them from Greek territorial waters or hampering their asylum application procedures.

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The question put by the Honourable Member refers especially to the effects of the application of Council Regulation n°343/2003/EC establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national (Dublin II Regulation). Art 28 of the said Regulation provides for the submission of a report by the Commission to the European Parliament and to the Council on its application, as well as of proposals for the necessary amendments, where appropriate. Accordingly, the Commission has presented in December 2008 a proposal intended to recast the Dublin Regulation. The aim of this proposal is mainly to strengthen the asylum seekers´ set of rights and guarantees that fall under the scope of the Dublin II regulation.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Commission is expected to submit a proposal intended to recast asylum directives which will focus on improving the minimum standards that were adopted so far and which will aim at further building the common European asylum system. Great emphasis should be put on the initial stage of the asylum procedure, i.e. access to the procedure as such. The first proposals have already been published in December 2008 – proposal to recast reception conditions directive, Dublin II and Eurodac regulations. In spring 2009 proposals to amend qualification and procedural directives are expected. These ones also aim at strengthening the status of asylum seekers. It should be noted however that all EU Member States are bound by minimum standards on reception conditions for asylum seekers set out in Directive 2003/9/EC.</p>
<p>For both proposals, which will be considered by the Council in 2009, codecision procedure applies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The four Funds in the general ‘Solidarity and management of migration flows’ programme, namely, the European Fund for the Integration of Third Country Nationals, the European Refugee Fund, the External Borders Fund and the European Return Fund, have just been launched. The total value of the Funds is EUR 4.02 billion for the period 2007-2013.</p>
<p>To date, the vast majority of the programmes from those States participating in the Funds have been adopted by the Commission. For the Return Fund, for which credits only became available in November 2008, it is expected that the process of adopting the last programmes will be completed in the first quarter of 2009. At the end of this process, the Commission will have committed EUR 580 million to the launch of these four Funds. In 2008, three Member States also benefited from extra support to the value of EUR 10 million in the framework of the emergency measures in the European Refugee Fund: these countries are Greece, Italy and Malta.</p>
<p>The payment of sums to Member States for the financing of actions for the initial years of the programme is currently under way.</p>
<p>The launch of these Funds has required a major effort from the Commission and from national governments. This demonstrates the European Union’s commitment to putting the solidarity principle into practice in the management of migration flows.</p>
<p>The Commission attaches particular importance to involving regional and local authorities, as well non-governmental organisations, in the implementation of the Funds. In fact, the Commission invited the Member States to organise a partnership with the authorities and bodies participating in the programmes and with others who could make a useful contribution to their development. These partnerships could include all competent public authorities, especially regional, local and municipal authorities, as well as international bodies and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) representing civil society. The constitution of the partnerships is the responsibility of each Member State and depends, among other things, on the characteristics of each Fund. In this framework, many NGOs should see, for example, their projects cofinanced by the European Union from the Integration Fund, the Return Fund and the European Refugee Fund. </p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0986"></a>

<p>(EN) The Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre – Narcotics (MAOC-N) is a law enforcement supported military intergovernmental organisation set up by means of a Treaty signed on 30 September 2007 in Lisbon by seven EU Member States (UK, F, I, ES, PT, IRL, NL), MAOC undertakes high sea interdiction operations, by coordinating the exchange of actionable (maritime and aviation) intelligence, available assets and trained personnel to respond to the threat posed by trans-Atlantic drug trafficking.</p>
<p>The aim of the collection, exchange and analysis of information is to optimise the use of the naval and aerial assets of those Member States that are the contracting parties to this Treaty. Its operational area as defined by the contracting parties themselves comprises the eastern part of the Atlantic Ocean from Iceland to the Cape of Good Hope, including European and West African seaboards.</p>
<p>Since January 2008 the Commission has the observer status, as has the United States (US) Joint Inter Agency Task Force – South (JIATF-S) based in Key West (USA) to which some EU MS take part due to its regional (Caribbean dimension) which covers some Member States' territories, notably some included under Chapter IV of the TEC), and Canada. Brazil has shown interest in becoming an observer too.</p>
<p>The Commission is co-financing MAOC-N activities, namely € 661.000 via the Directorate General JLS<a href="#defann_26_1" name="refann_26_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> ISEC budget line<a href="#defann_26_2" name="refann_26_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, as a part of the Prevention of and Fight against Crime Programme, to cover staff and equipment costs until September 2010.</p>
<p>As not all EU Member States are parties to MAOC-N it is important that its initiatives are neither overlapping, nor contradicting potential initiatives to be taken at EU level or by any EU Member States not party to MAOC-N. Therefore Europol is tasked to closely monitor the activities of this regional maritime law enforcement organisation, by participating in the MAOC-N Executive Board meetings which took place so far, as well as by appointing a liaison officer from January 2009.</p>
<p>The Commission considers Europol to be the suitable body of an EU based law enforcement cooperation, namely for intelligence exchange, to ensure coherence and interoperability and avoiding possible duplications of mandates, tasks and expenses.</p>
<p>Against this background therefore Commission (i) supports coherence of maritime law enforcement efforts with other maritime regional initiatives and (ii) closely monitors interactions with the extensive Community acquis in the maritime safety, security and environmental domains and foster potential cooperation with other actors notably European bodies such as Frontex and EMSA<a href="#defann_26_3" name="refann_26_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> that have to conform with different specific rules.</p>
<p>In 2009 a pilot project will start that aims to test solutions for a more effective sharing of maritime surveillance information amongst maritime authorities in the Mediterranean and Atlantic approaches and a preparatory action will determine the effectiveness of space-based receivers for picking up AIS identification signals far from the coast.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In July 2007, to enable it to meet its new, broader mandate, the Agency issued an invitation to tender to acquire the required legal expertise. In November and December 2007, the Agency signed framework contracts with a series of contractors selected against strict criteria, including FRALEX.

<p>(FR) The Commission is aware of the difficulties facing Member States due to the arrival of many unaccompanied minors. In this matter, the Commission stresses that existing policies can be used to address this issue from different angles in the absolute respect of the child’s best interests, even if it is not yet possible to provide an overall solution to the issue raised.</p>
<p>As regards internal policies, the Community instruments in force in the field of immigration and asylum include provisions to give stronger protection to the rights of minors, especially unaccompanied minors<a href="#defann_28_1" name="refann_28_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The scope of the ‘Solidarity and management of migration flows 2007-2013’ Programme, and more specifically, the Integration Fund, the European Refugee Fund and the Return Fund, also covers measures and policies aimed at unaccompanied minors.</p>
<p>As for the external dimension, this issue has recently been added to the priorities of the Cooperation Programme adopted at the Euro-African Conference in Paris on migration and development and to the Council’s conclusions on the Global Approach to Migration.</p>
<p>Through the ‘Aeneas’ programme and its successor, the ‘Migration’ thematic programme, the Commission is already supporting several projects in this field aimed particularly at helping unaccompanied minors of Moroccan origin who have arrived in Spain and which, as far as possible, support their re-integration in their country of origin and prevent the departure of more illegal migrant minors. In addition, new initiatives in Morocco, Algeria and Senegal have been selected for financing in 2009.</p>
<p>It is evident, however, that more attention should be given to the issue of unaccompanied minors. This will be one of the priorities in the next call for proposals for the migration and asylum thematic programme (first half of 2009). In addition, this issue will appear in the migration clauses in EU agreements with third countries and on the agenda for policy dialogues with third countries. Finally, where appropriate, the situation of minors could be the subject of specific offers of cooperation in the framework of mobility partnerships.</p>
<p>As for future proposals in this field, it should be remembered that in Autumn 2009 the European Council will adopt a new five-year programme in the area of Justice, Freedom and Security, which will succeed the Hague Programme (‘Stockholm programme’). Any new policy or measure should be proposed and discussed in the framework of the preparation of this new programme.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) In March 2009 the High-Level Segment of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) of the United Nations (UN) will finalise its review on the 1998 United Nations General Assembly Special Session Declarations on the World Drugs Problem, usually known as United Nations General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) 98<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, by the adoption of a new Political Declaration.</p>
<p>In preparation to the UNGASS 2008 review, the Commission has been active in supporting the process, i.a. by providing funding for UN expert groups that provided advice to UNODC<a href="#defann_29_2" name="refann_29_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on the implementation of the 1998 Declarations. Furthermore, the Commission has actively contributed to the EU Position Paper on the UNGASS review process that was adopted by the Council in October 2008<a href="#defann_29_3" name="refann_29_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Within this UN framework, the Commission has – with the exception of the field of drug precursors – no competence to represent the European Union and its Member States. The latter represent themselves while the European Union is coordinated by the EU Presidency whose object is to present as many common EU positions as possible. The above mentioned EU position paper on the UNGASS represent such a common position</p>
<p>In this paper, the EU Member States conclude that although progress has been made in several areas of the implementation of the 1998 Declarations and attached Action Plans, there has been no containment or major reduction of the global drugs problem, which was the major target of the 1998 Political Declaration.</p>
<p>The position paper reconfirms the EU's commitment to the UN Drug Conventions from 1961, 1971 and 1988, while it reiterates the aims and objectives of the 1998 Declarations. At the same time, it calls for a serious assessment of experiences gained in the past decade and to incorporate lessons learnt. The paper also presents a number of key principles for future declarations and action plans, including:</p>
<p>Strengthening the balanced approach in UN drug policy, by enhancing drug demand reduction efforts and by recognising harm reduction as an effective and important element in drug policy.</p>
<p>Raising attention for the respect of human rights and proportionality in law enforcement interventions in drug policy and interventions in demand and supply reduction.</p>
<p>Strongly advocating sustainable alternative development, while not making this conditional on the prior eradication of drug crops.</p>
<p>A stronger emphasis on the need for evaluation, data collection and monitoring, to base policies on evidence (rather than ideology).</p>
<p>In early 2009, the Commission will furthermore publish the results of a broad study containing a 'Detailed analysis of the operation of the world market in illicit drugs and of policy measures to curtail it'. This study is one example of the Commission's contribution to the knowledge base that underpins European and international drug policies. Last September 2008, the Commission also introduced further proposals for action in the framework of the EU Drugs Action Plan (2009-2012), with specific emphasis on shared monitoring, data collection and evaluation in the field of drug supply reduction and law enforcement, areas in which little analysis has been done, or at least published.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Information transmitted by Member States early in 2008 indicates a positive trend concerning international cooperation in the fight against trafficking in human beings. In particular Member States, more than in the past, are ready to use Europol and Eurojust resources in order to improve the quality of the institutional response to trafficking.</p>
<p>In respect of the submission by the Member States of information and data to Europol, Analytical Work File (AWF) Phoenix was opened in June 2007 with a focus on trafficking. 22 Member States have signalled their support for this work file and the Analytical Work File is currently supporting a number of diverse investigations on trafficking for sexual exploitation, labour exploitation and child trafficking. Since September 2007, when Analytical Work File Phoenix became active, Member States have forwarded 131 intelligence contributions to the work file.</p>
<p>Beside these contributions, there have been 127 Member States contributions to the Europol Information System (EIS) on trafficking cases since the Information System went live in April 2006.</p>
<p>Regarding the role of Eurojust, 78 new cases of trafficking in human beings have been recorded in 2008. The trend shows a substantial increase, since 13 cases were recorded in 2004 and 33 in 2006. Eurojust also held 10 coordination meetings in 2007 specifically for cases dealing with trafficking and smuggling, which makes up more than 10% of Eurojust’s coordination meetings.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1010"></a>

<p>The Greek Government has recently drafted a law regulating matters concerning nationality and immigration policy in relation to children. Children of immigrants, who were born in Greece, have reached the age of 18 and whose parents are legally resident in the country, may, under certain conditions, acquire the status of 'long-term resident immigrant' but not Greek nationality. The draft law does not take account of the case of children who were not born in Greece but are growing up there and studying at Greek schools or of similar cases of children whose parents are not legally resident in the country. The European Union is a signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, while the Commission has also stressed in a communication (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2006&amp;nu_doc=0367">COM(2006)0367</a>) that 'Another challenge is to ensure that the rights of children as immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees are fully respected in the EU and in Member States' legislation and policies.'</p>
<p>Does the Commission consider the above provisions to be consistent with Community law and human rights? What measures will it take to safeguard the rights of immigrant children as a whole?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) Greece has exclusive competence in determining the conditions in which a citizen of a third country can acquire Greek nationality. This question is not covered by Community law.</p>
<p>As for the common policy on immigration, one of the main requirements of Directive 2003/109 for the status of long-term resident is to have five years’ legal residency. The question refers to the situation of children of parents without legal residency. Pursuant to Directive 2003/109, these children are not automatically excluded from long-term resident status. This status may, in principle, be acquired by a minor under the age of 18 independently of its parents, where all the conditions set out in the directive are met. In addition, the conditions set out in the directive to benefit from the status of long-term resident are comprehensive. As there is no obligation to be born on the territory of a Member State, the introduction of such a condition by Greece would seem to be contrary to the directive. The Commission will therefore contact the Greek authorities for more information on these two issues.</p>
<p>As for children’s rights, the Member States should respect fundamental rights as arising from the constitutional traditions of the Member States and from their international obligations. The Convention on the Rights of the Child, adopted by the United Nations in 1989 and ratified by all the Member States of the EU, obliges signatory states, for every child under their jurisdiction, to respect and guarantee the rights therein, irrespective, among other things, of the child’s situation and, in particular, irrespective of the residence status of the child’s parents.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1014"></a>

<p>(FR) At present, the Commission has no plan to present a legislative instrument focused explicitly on the question of profiling.</p>
<p>The conditions in which the processing of personal data may occur are laid down in Directive 95/46/CE on the protection of personal data, of 24 October 1995<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>This directive details the obligations of processing managers, whether these be companies or governments. It also details the rights of the individuals whose data are being processed and sets out the sanctions and recourse where these rights and obligations are infringed.</p>
<p>In particular, Article 15 of the Directive prohibits, unless exception has been made, recourse to automated decisions.</p>
<p>This provision stipulates that individuals may not be subject to decisions carrying legal consequences for them or significantly affecting them, that are based on a single automated data processing event. Human intervention is always required in arriving at such decisions.</p>
<p>The Council of Europe, for its part, is preparing a draft recommendation on profiling, broadly inspired by Article 15 of the Directive. The recommendation is expected to be adopted by the Committee of Ministers towards the end of 2009. The Commission is participating actively in this work, which will require coordination at EU level, once the draft is further developed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The Commission had received the mandate to develop the new system, scheduled to begin operating in March 2007, on 6 December 2001.

<p>(FR) The second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) should in time replace the current SIS 1+ system, which relies on a platform designed in the 1990s. SIS II will use the latest technologies, offer new functionality and will offer the option of including biometric data. In addition to the technical advances, the legislative instruments relating to SIS II include provisions on strengthening data protection and transparency for Parliament.</p>
<p>Between November and December 2008, the Commission’s main contractor on the SIS II development ran a set of tests to prove the functionality of the central system operating interactively with a given number of national systems.</p>
<p>The final test report and the analysis of the Commission’s ‘quality’ contractor confirm, in essence, that the contractor had been unable to show the correct operation of a number of the functions required of SIS II. Therefore, they are unable to meet all of their contractual commitments.</p>
<p>This setback will also affect the project schedule. The objective of commissioning SIS II in September 2009 will have to be reviewed.</p>
<p>The difficulties SIS II faces, however, are not a problem for the operation of the Member States’ borders, as SIS 1+ continues currently to play its role, guaranteeing a high level of security on the external borders of the Schengen area.</p>

Such cases are the natural and predictable consequence of the climate of terror and repression fostered by the unprecedentedly authoritarian laws being adopted by the EU and the Member States, which have created a leviathan of hitherto unrivalled proportions for the repression and suffocation of basic human rights and democratic freedoms, treating the people and organised popular protest movements as ‘the enemy within’.</p>

<p>(EN) The financial crisis has demonstrated how interlinked global financial markets are today. The G-20 process marks a new phase in international economic and financial co-operation, where advanced economies work more closely with emerging countries. This is key if we are to ensure a more stable global economic and financial system.</p>
<p>At the Washington Summit of 15 November 2008, the leaders of the G-20 approved an action plan to reform global financial markets following five common principles: (i) strengthening transparency and accountability of financial markets and align incentives in order to avoid excessive risk-taking; (ii) strengthen regulatory regimes, prudential oversight, and risk management, and ensure that all financial markets, products and participants are regulated or subject to oversight, as appropriate to their circumstances; (iii) promote the integrity of financial markets by bolstering investor and consumer protection, avoiding conflicts of interest, preventing illegal market manipulation, fraudulent activities and abuse, and protecting against illicit finance risks arising from non-cooperative jurisdictions; (iv) reinforce global cooperation on regulation, crisis prevention, management and resolution, and (v) reforming the International Financial Institutions (i.e., the Bretton Woods Institutions) in order to increase their legitimacy and effectiveness. The Action Plan includes a set of high priority actions to be completed prior to March 31 2009 as well as a number of medium-term actions. Europe is playing a full role in transforming these principles into practical and concerted action ahead of the next G-20 summit on 2 April 2009 in London.</p>
<p>While acknowledging that regulation is first and foremost the responsibility of regional and national regulators, the G-20 agreed that intensified international cooperation, strengthening of international standards and consistent implementation is necessary to protect against adverse cross-border, regional and global developments affecting international financial stability. The Commission strongly welcomes and is actively contributing to the international efforts to reform the world's financial systems. Key countries such as the United States, Brazil, India and China are part of these efforts, and the Commission is confident that this process will indeed strengthen financial markets and regulatory regimes, thereby reducing the possibility of similar crises in the future. As the Commission represents the EU in some key policy areas and prepares and enforces critical pieces of legislation in the area of financial services, it will continue to be an active and engaged partner in these international discussions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0976"></a>

<p>(EN) On November 26<span class="sup">th</span> 2008, the Commission proposed a European Economic Recovery Plan<a href="#defann_37_1" name="refann_37_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>in order to provide the appropriate Europe-wide policy response to the current economic downturn. It presents a framework for actions to be taken both at the EU and Member states level. The European Council held in Brussels on December 11 and 12 2008 agreed upon this Recovery Plan and its main proposal for an immediate budgetary stimulus package amounting to € 200 billion (1.5% of EU GDP) along with a series of other priority actions grounded in the structural reforms of the Lisbon strategy aimed at strengthening the long-term growth and adjustment capacity of the EU economy.</p>
<p>The Recovery Plan includes measures both at Community and Member State level, aiming to restore growth and increase competitiveness of the real economy, especially for the Small and Medium-Sized Entreprises (SMEs). Member States were asked to bring forward national budgetary stimulus actions. In addition, a number of initiatives were proposed at Community and Member State level including:</p>
<p>A major European employment support initiative.</p>
<p>The enhancement of access to financing for businesses, notably through an European Investment Bank package of € 30 billion for loans to SMEs.</p>
<p>Proposals to increase and bring forward investments in Europe’s infrastructure and promote high-speed internet connections.</p>
<p>Proposals to improve energy efficiency in buildings and increase the take-up of green products.</p>
<p>A key element of the Recovery Plan is the full implementation of the Small Business Act action plan<a href="#defann_37_2" name="refann_37_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>In particular, in order to significantly reduce administrative burdens on business, promote their cash flow and help more people to become entrepreneurs, the Community and Member States are invited to:</p>
<p>Ensure that starting up a business anywhere in the EU can be done within three days at zero costs and that formalities for the hiring of the first employee can be fulfilled via a single access point.</p>
<p>Remove the requirement on micro-enterprises to prepare annual accounts and limit the capital requirements of the European private company to one euro.</p>
<p>Accelerate the adoption of the European private company statute proposal so that from early 2009 it can facilitate cross border business activities of SMEs and to allow them to work under a single set of corporate rules across the EU.</p>
<p>Ensure that public authorities pay invoices for supplies and services within one month to ease liquidity constraints and to accept e-invoicing as equivalent to paper invoicing; any arrears owed by public bodies should also be settled.</p>
<p>Reduce by up of 75% the fees for patent applications and maintenance and halve the costs for an EU trademark.</p>
<p>The Recovery Plan also stresses the need to increase investment in Research and Development (R&amp;D), Innovation and Education. It is indeed very important that industry and in particular SMEs are encouraged to maintain and even increase their activities in R&amp;D and innovation. R&amp;D spending should be seen as an investment and not as a cost to be decreased. Investing in R&amp;D and innovation now will lay the foundations for a strong competitive position of the European industry in a short and medium term future. The Commission is continuing to support R&amp;D activities for SMEs through the different actions under the 7<span class="sup">th</span> R&amp;D Framework Programme. For instance, the dedicated scheme "Research for the benefit of SMEs" will be allocating an extra € 25 million in 2009 to fund more projects and the Commission is also providing support to Member States for improving the coordination of their support programmes for R&amp;D in SMEs.</p>
<p>In addition the Commission put forward in the Recovery Plan, a number of initiatives to increase the competitiveness of its industry, in particular of the automobile and construction industries. The Commission will launch 3 major public-private partnerships to support innovation and prepare these sectors to face the significant challenges in the transition to the green economy.</p>
<p>In the automobile sector, a European Green Cars initiative will support research on Energy-efficient transport technologies and their market uptake.</p>
<p>In the construction sector, a European Energy-efficient Buildings initiative will promote green technologies and the development of energy-efficient systems and materials in new and renovated buildings with a view to reducing radically their energy consumption and CO2 emissions.</p>
<p>Finally, a Factories of the Future initiative will help EU manufacturers across sectors, in particular SMEs, to adapt to global competitive pressures by increasing the technological base of EU manufacturing through the development and integration the enabling technologies of the future, such as engineering technologies for adaptable machines and industrial processes, ICT, and advanced materials.</p>
<p>The Community-level priorities for the Recovery Plan were further detailed in the Implementation Report on the Community Lisbon Programme<a href="#defann_37_3" name="refann_37_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> published on 16 December 2008 that will be discussed at the Spring European Council 2009.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The economic and financial crisis is affecting many of the Member States, and every week brings more reports of new measures affecting thousands of employees in different Member States.

Constructing transport infrastructures (rail, road, air, sea) requires major investment, and project implementation is only concluded in the medium or long term. If there is to be sufficient investment in transport infrastructures, the Member States will need to agree a corresponding increase in the TEN-T budget, or else allow their budget deficits to grow for a certain period of time.

<p>(EN) The Commission welcomes the emphasis of the Honourable Member on the role of investment in transport infrastructure as a means of tackle the economic crisis. Indeed, such investment results not only in stabilising macro-economic demanding and creating jobs, both directly and indirectly, but at the same time paves the way for sustainable economic growth and increased productivity in the future. It is essential for the whole of Europe to turn the challenge represented by the current crisis into an opportunity.</p>
<p>The European Economic Recovery Plan, which has been recently endorsed by the Council, is the Commission's direct response and calls for smart investment including infrastructure. In particular, to enable an increase in investment in transport infrastructure the Plan provides for four specific actions:</p>
<p>1. Reinforcing the capital base of the European Investment Bank and enabling a increased financing from the bank by some €15 billion over the next two years;</p>
<p>2. launching an equity fund which would target infrastructure as well as energy and climate change projects;</p>
<p>3. enabling a wider participation of the private sector in the infrastructure investments by clarifying the legal framework and eliminating administrative barriers for partnerships between the public and private sectors;</p>
<p>4. launching in 2009 an additional 500 million EUR call for proposals for Trans-European Network Transport (TEN-T) projects for which a Community grant would lead to construction beginning before the end of 2009.</p>
<p>The latter alone is expected to accelerate the delivery of the trans-European infrastructure and mobilise national investment of more than €3 billion. But it is apparent that a €500 million call is not going to satisfy existing demand. Works for several projects cannot advance due to funding limitations, particularly severe under the current economic circumstances. Many more concrete TEN-T projects could be accelerated immediately which would also usefully contribute to the recovery programmes of individual Member States, were additional budgetary funding available.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1001"></a>

<p>(EN) As a Party to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, the Community and 26 Member States are bound by the commitment to provide for protection from exposure to tobacco smoke in all indoor workplaces and public places.</p>
<p>In 2006-2007, the Commission services participated in the work to formulate extensive guidelines on how to implement this obligation. The guidelines were adopted by all the Parties in July 2007. They formulate a "golden standard" that every Party should aim to achieve within five years of the Convention's entry into force for that Party – that is by 2010 for the EC and the majority of Member States.</p>
<p>To support Member States in adopting comprehensive smoke-free laws, the Commission intends to put forward a proposal for a Council Recommendation on smoke-free environments in 2009.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission has decided to start consultations with the social partners at Community level on the need for additional measures to protect workers from risks to their health arising from exposure to environmental tobacco smoke at the workplace.</p>
<p>The evidence reported in the literature on the impact of smoke-free policies on revenues and employment in the hospitality sector appears mixed. Overall, there seems to be a largely neutral effect.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that an international review of the studies on the economic effects of smoke-free policies on the hospitality industry found that 47 of the 49 studies that are best designed report no negative impact on objective measures such as taxable sales.</p>
<p>Importantly, there are reliable reports that the health of bar and restaurant workers has improved considerably within months of implementation of smoke-free regulations. The respiratory symptoms in hospitality staff have been shown to drop by up to 50% as a result of smoke-free policies.</p>
<p>The Commission will address this issue in detail in the Impact Assessment which will accompany the Commission's proposal on smoke-free environments.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1005"></a>

<p>The European Union is negotiating the ACTA anti-counterfeiting treaty with Japan, the United States and other countries. Those negotiations are taking place in secret, without the European Parliament, national parliaments or the public being informed. In the leaked versions of the treaty, provision is made for a set of criminal and civil measures on breach of copyright, and for very extensive powers for border and airport security staff. It seems, in particular, that checks will be permitted on travellers’ computers and digital music players, as will confiscation of their equipment and even their arrest.</p>
<p>Can the Commission confirm the above, and provide further information on ACTA? What guarantees are envisaged for travellers in respect of checks that are extremely privacy-invasive and safeguards on the presumption of innocence and the right to due process? What cross-checks have been made with the EDPS, the Article 29 WP and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights?

<p>(EN) The goal of the negotiations on the Anti-Counterfeit Trade Agreement (ACTA) is to provide for improved international standards for action against large-scale infringements of intellectual property rights (IPR).</p>
<p>Counterfeiting now takes place on an industrial scale. It has become an extremely profitable business, generating income that can compete with narcotics and weapons trafficking, but at much lower risk. Obviously, this type of activity causes enormous damage to the EU economy, whose major comparative advantage consists of quality and innovation. This trend is particularly worrying also from the point of view of consumer protection since many counterfeit products are clearly dangerous (fake medicines, spare parts, toys, food stuff etc.).</p>
<p>The EU is therefore working together with partners sharing its concerns such as the United States (US) and Japan, but also Mexico, Korea, Morocco and others on the negotiation of an anti-counterfeiting trade agreement (ACTA).</p>
<p>ACTA is first and foremost about tackling an activity pursued by criminal organisations which harm the economy or the consumers. ACTA is not designed to limit civil liberties or to negatively affect consumers. There is therefore no question that the ACTA current negotiations would result in creating new powers for border or airport security staff to check travellers’ computers or digital music players.</p>
<p>The current EU regulation has a de minimis clause that excludes goods in traveller’s personal baggage from the scope of the legislation, as long as these goods are no part of commercial traffic. The aim of ACTA is not to affect consumers negatively but to provide a clear basis for customs to act against commercial importations of fake goods and protect consumers from potentially dangerous products.</p>
<p>ACTA will not go further than the current Community acquis on the enforcement of intellectual property rights<a href="#defann_41_1" name="refann_41_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which does not limit fundamental rights and freedoms and civil liberties, as consecrated by the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Additionally, this acquis in terms of IPR enforcement is without prejudice to national or Community legal provisions in other areas, in particular in the area of personal data protection [e.g. Data Protection Directive<a href="#defann_41_2" name="refann_41_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and the Directive on privacy and electronic communications<a href="#defann_41_3" name="refann_41_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>].</p>
<p>As is the case in any trade negotiation, the ACTA negotiators have to respect a certain level of confidentiality. This does not mean that these negotiations are secret or that the EU institutions are prevented from exerting their institutional prerogatives. The EU's objectives in the negotiations are very clear and both the Council and Parliament have been regularly informed of, and consulted on, the state of play of the negotiations. Discussions have also been held with civil society stakeholders.</p>
<p>The Council and Member States have been closely involved in the process due to the possible inclusion of matters of criminal policy, which are not yet harmonised at EU level. Consequently, the Presidency will be negotiating on this matter (and other non-harmonised issues which may arise, such judicial and police cooperation).</p>
<p>Also, the Commission has discussed the matter on a regular basis with European Parliament in particular in the INTA Committee<a href="#defann_41_4" name="refann_41_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, and will continue to do so. Of course, the Commission is prepared to appear before other Committees to give further information on these negotiations if so requested.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The meeting heard a great deal of criticism of the administration of EU research resources.

<p>(EN) The EU Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development is a major tool for research policy and research funding with a dedicated budget that has increased over time. Its European character, with the majority of projects carried out by multinational and multisectoral consortia, and the legal and financial framework governing all EU expenditure, bring about an intrinsic level of complexity that is somewhat higher than in national research schemes. The Commission must also ensure the sound financial management of public resources and comply with the obligations and reporting requirements of the legal base of the programme.</p>
<p>In this context, the Commission is striving for continuous improvement and streamlining of processes, rules, documentation and Information Technology (IT) systems to limit the administrative burden for participants. With the successful starting phase of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (2007-2013) (FP7), the Commission can already identify a number of improvements in simplification compared with previous programmes:</p>
<p>The installation of a system for unique registration of participating legal entities, abandoning the need for repeated checking of existence and legal status of each participation. Legal documents now have to be provided only once, all information is stored in a central data base accessible to all Directorates-General implementing FP7.</p>
<p>By introducing a threshold of € 375,000, the number of required certificates on financial statements is reduced in FP7 to one tenth of that in FP6.</p>
<p>Much fewer ex-ante financial capacity checks and protective measures are required due to the introduction of the guarantee fund in FP7. Ex-ante checks are now only necessary for coordinators and participants requesting more than a € 500,000 EC contribution. This is of particular benefit for the participation of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) and start-up companies.</p>
<p>Grant agreement negotiation and amendments: A new Web-based electronic system for negotiation, used by all research Directorates-General, was introduced by the end of 2007. The system allows online interaction between participants and Commission project officers. The guidelines for amendments are streamlined. Many changes can now be handled by simple information letters, i.e. they will not require a formal amendment procedure. A Web-based electronic system will also be used for the handling of all amendments.</p>
<p>The alleviation of burdens on project reporting and certification of financial statements: The structure of periodic and final technical reports was considerably streamlined and the Commission aims at extended reporting and payment periods (increasing the average period from 12 to 18 months), leading to a considerable reduction of the overall number of reports and payment transactions.</p>
<p>All these initiatives, together with the streamlining of guidance documents for participants contribute to the simplification of the procedures related to FP7. The Commission is committed to continuing the work in this direction. The eFP7 initiative, for instance, aims at a major improvement of the IT systems for all interactions between the Commission and participants. The Commission will also soon make proposals for implementing ex-ante certification of audit methodologies in order to extend the use of average cost reporting by certain beneficiaries. For the identification of further potential areas for simplification, the Commission seeks advice from many parties, including a sounding board of smaller research actors.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1019"></a>

<p>(EN) The attention of the Honourable Member is drawn to the attached Excel file giving the current amount of authorised expenditure which the Commission has been obliged to cancel so far under the n+2 rule, by year, by Member State and by fund (ERDF – FIFG – EAGGF – ESF).</p>
<p>The total amount to be decommitted under the n+2 rule for the programming period 2000-2006 will be finalised at the closure of the Operational Programmes (Article 105 (3) of Regulation</p>
<p>n° (CE)1083/2006).</p>
<p>As far as closure dates are concerned, the Commission is not in a position to give a detailed answer per operational programme and per Member State as each operational programme has its own end date of eligibility and this date is the basis to establish the closure date. Moreover, given the pressures arising from the current economic and financial crisis, the Commission is willing to consider constructively requests from Member States for an extension tothe final date for the eligibility of expenditure of the operational programmes of period 2000-2006. However, in general, the estimated closure dates are the following:</p>
<p>End March 2009 for programmes for which the final date of eligibility is at the end of 2007 and without state aids.</p>
<p>End July 2009 for programmes for which the final date of eligibility is at the end of 2007 and include state aids.</p>
<p>End March 2010 for programmes with commitment in 2006 and without state aids;</p>
<p>End July 2010 for programmes with commitment in 2006 and with state aids.</p>
<p>End September 2010 if programmes under 4. or 5. request an extension.</p>
<p>End March 2011 for Greek programmes already benefiting from an extended eligibility date.</p>
<p>It should be recalled that the n+2 and n+3 rules are an integral part of the regulatory framework for the programming periods, 2000-2006 and 2007-2013, respectively, as approved by Parliament and the Council. The rules are an important incentive to managing authorities to accelerate the implementation of the operational programmes on the ground, in order to maximise impact on economic and social cohesion and employment. Accordingly, the Commission does not intend to propose the abolition of neither the n+2 rule for period 2000-2006 nor the n+2 and n+3 rule for the period 2007-2013.</p>
<p>Rather, in the light of the current economic and financial crisis, the Commission has proposed a recovery package that seeks to ensure that spending targets for the Structural Funds can be met. This means that additional advance payments will be made to Member States as soon as the proposed modification of Regulation n° (EC) 1083/2006 is approved, which should boost the implementation of the operational programmes by increasing liquidity in the system.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the fisheries area, the Council has adopted in July 2008 Regulation n° (EC) 744/2008 instituting a temporary specific action aiming to promote the restructuring of the European Community fishing fleet affected by the economic crisis. One of the measures adopted is the opportunity for Member States to request a second pre-financing in order to speed up the implementation of measures under the EFF operational programmes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1025"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission is committed to the objective of eradicating child labour at a global level. This is reflected in its Communication "A Special Place for Children in the EU External Action"<a href="#defann_45_1" name="refann_45_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and in the EU Action Plan on Children's Rights in External Relations. Both were welcomed by the Council on 27 May 2008<a href="#defann_45_2" name="refann_45_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The EU effectively encourages improvements in third countries' labour standards through incentives and cooperation, including via its bilateral trade negotiations and agreements (eg FTAs) and the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP).</p>
<p>The EU's GSP scheme is a key tool to encourage trading partners to improve their performance in this area. In particular, in the Special Incentive Arrangement for Sustainable Development and Good Governance (known as GSP+), the EU offers additional tariff preferences as an incentive to vulnerable developing country partners to ratify and effectively implement a set of international standards, including the relevant International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions on Child Labour (Convention 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labour and Convention 138 on Minimum Age for Admission to Work and Employment) and the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Rights of the Child. At present (as of 1 January 2009), 16 countries have taken sufficient steps so as to benefit from additional preferences under GSP+. At the same time, the Commission may temporarily withdraw GSP benefits from any GSP beneficiary in the event of serious and systematic violations of core UN/ILO human and labour rights on the basis of the conclusions of the relevant international monitoring bodies.</p>
<p>This is actually the case for two countries, Belarus and Myanmar, where the Commission took action after carrying out detailed investigations and in the light of clear findings by the ILO.</p>
<p>Child labour is, in most cases, a structural and development problem in poorer countries closely linked to their individual development challenges, the lack of social structures and the access to education. A holistic approach through development policy, political dialogue and cooperation in the multilateral context – ILO and UN – are considered best tools to address child labour. The major programme of the ILO for the eradication of child labour (IPEC) is supported by the Commission. Mid-2008, a new programme under IPEC (TACKLE –Tackling child labour through education) was launched with the financial support of the European Community as part of an effort to accelerate the fight against poverty and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in 11 countries in Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific Region. The project aims at strengthening legal frameworks on child labour and education and increase institutional capacities for implementing strategies to eliminate child labour.</p>
<p>The Commission regularly raises with partners the issue of labour rights violations, and in particular child labour. Even though progress has been made so far, the fight against child labour remains a global challenge and continued efforts are required.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Bowing to pressure from shipowners, the Commission is pushing ahead with full implementation of Regulation (EEC) No. 3577/92<a href="#defann_47_1" name="refann_47_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on maritime cabotage, while 36 coastal shipping vessels have been arbitrarily laid up and over 2000 seafarers laid off without pay, workers' rights have been trampled under foot, coastal shipping services are being dismantled, and the country is left 'maimed'. The shipowners complained to the Commission about infringements of the regulation, demanding the abolition of the basic obligation to operate vessels for ten months with a full complement of crew, the restriction of the Greek language requirement to crew members involved with safety, and the deregulation of economy class fares on services between islands, which have risen by 376% since 2001, and on subsidised routes.</p>
<p>Has the Commission accepted the coastal shipowners' complaints as legitimate? Will it ask the Greek Government to comply with their demands?

<p>This implementation means that cabotage is liberalised: the Commission does not envisage the abolition of liberalised cabotage, but rather its completion. Similarly, any well-founded complaint from any plaintiff of incorrect application of the regulation in question has been considered to be valid and examined by the Commission.</p>
<p>Liberalisation of cabotage will allow Greece to take all the measures necessary to improve service and reduce prices in the long term. That being said, price trends for maritime transport are not solely determined by the regulatory system and this ought to be taken into account in any assessment of the effects of liberalisation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission has accordingly closed the infringement procedure against Ireland for non-communication of measures for the transposition of the Directive.
