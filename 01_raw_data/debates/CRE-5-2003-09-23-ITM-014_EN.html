It is a privilege to address you in a plenary session of the European Parliament, and I am grateful to Mr Cox and all of you for giving me this opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">I speak to you today at a time of great hope for my country and for its European destiny. Almost a year ago in Bucharest, Mr President, you spoke before the Romanian Parliament and shared with my fellow Romanians your vision for Europe's future and Romania's destiny within Europe. It is this Europe of values and principles that we wish to join.</p>
<p class="contents">Today I stand before the European Parliament to let you know that we have faced countless challenges. We have overcome many of them and our political will is to overcome them all. But my main message today is that Romania is a country that the democratic community of nations can count on. Romania will be a consistent and reliable European Union member. The European Union will gain much more than just a new EU Member State of over 22 million inhabitants; it will gain a firm believer in European integration, a Euro-optimist by choice.</p>
<p class="contents">Connected to Europe throughout our entire history, we believe in the system of positive values now underlying the European construction: democracy, respect for citizens' rights and liberties, justice and social equity, tolerance, solidarity within and among nations and accountability to future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">For us Romanians, sidelined by history for more than half a century, natural evolution within the European Community, whose values served as a beacon, was an aspiration which came true upon the revolution of December 1989. Coming out of totalitarianism - both fascist and communist - was neither simple nor easy. We had to face a twofold handicap, the first of which was institutional: the institutions of a totalitarian state are incompatible with democracy and the market economy. The second handicap was represented by our isolation from the world and our autarchic tendencies. All this occurred against the background of a deeply-rooted, historical delay in economic and social development.</p>
<p class="contents">We had to build up institutions, see them in place and functioning, confer on them power originating in their legitimacy and functionality. Assisted by friends and partners of Romania - who are very many, and some of whom are present in this Chamber today - we have mapped out and adopted a modern and democratic constitution, we have trained people to cope with the new demands of a working democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Politically, over the past 14 years, Romania has developed its functional democracy, which has twice successfully passed the test of alternative governance. Meanwhile, civic society has emerged and asserted itself ever more strongly, thus presenting - by way of its organisations - a necessary and useful counter-power, and forming a catalyst for public debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The formulation of a national strategy on the relationships between the majority and ethnic minorities, including the implicit representation of such minorities in parliament, has been highly successful for this political transition. The treatment that ethnic minorities enjoy in Romania is exemplary and meets every European and international standard. Our country is a realm of tolerance and dialogue and of fruitful cooperation between various ethnic groups; such treatment has become a tradition and a culture of dialogue and consensus has developed. There is an important party belonging to the Hungarian minority, just as there are parties and organisations representing, politically and culturally, the interests of the Germans, Roma, Jews, Ukrainians, Polish, and so on: citizens of Romania. At the moment, we are focusing on making better use of the programmes for the economic and social integration of the Roma minority.</p>
<p class="contents">We have scored significant progress in the field of economic reforms, although most delays in our transition occur in that sphere. Such delays are the result of a whole host of factors, both objective and subjective, as well as the consequence of a particular historical reality. We have often been criticised for not having carried out shock therapy, and for our gradual approach to reforms, which has prevented us from scoring the results envisaged. We consider such accusations to be unfounded.</p>
<p class="contents">The first days of 1990 saw the most astonishing shock in the Romanian economy: the complete and unconditional renunciation of the planned, centralised economic system, the dismantling of the institutions and mechanisms characterising the state-controlled economy. When harking back, we realise that this brought about deeply entrenched economic imbalances, caused inflation and enhanced de-industrialisation and increased unemployment and the migration of the labour force from the city to the countryside. All these consequences were entirely inconsistent with the mainstream world economy. Moreover, a lack of domestic capital and the extremely low volume of foreign investment in the Romanian economy have made privatisation an even more difficult and lengthy process.</p>
<p class="contents">We needed more than a decade to redress the macroeconomic balances and to resume - over the past three and a half years - a steady economic growth of about 5%. The economic reform which began in the absence of the market institutions and mechanisms has entailed extremely high and hardly bearable social costs. As a matter of fact, the process of economic recovery is not over yet.</p>
<p class="contents">Poverty is our main problem in the social sphere. We are aware that we cannot succeed in alleviating poverty significantly without continued economic reform, without speeding up the creation of new, more stable and better paid jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Responses to the economic and social problems facing Romania need to be formed, first and foremost, from within the country, mainly through a concerted effort by all the accountable political forces, so that the principles and institutions of good governance can be established. That means that we must reprimand corruption and red-tape efficiently and firmly, and give to the public servant a professional status that should no longer be used to reward political clients.</p>
<p class="contents">Such efforts need to result in the Romanian State's modernisation. They must enhance its institutional and administrative capabilities and turn it into a genuine and friendly partner of the citizen. We have made good progress in that direction, but we are aware of the many problems that still await adequate responses.</p>
<p class="contents">The logic applied to state modernisation and the preparations for accession to the European Union also applied to the revision of our constitution, which has been carried out through the active participation of representatives of all parliamentary political parties and through consultation of civil society. The revision will soon be submitted for endorsement by national referendum.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the hardships and flaws in Romanian society, I truthfully believe that Romania is now on the right track, that the Romanians have now come to understand that democracy is a better and more efficient political system than totalitarianism, securing higher levels of performance across the board. Freedom of choice and freedom to set up and implement alternative political, economic and social projects provide the democratic system with better opportunities. Conflicts can be settled by way of dialogue, negotiation and consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">Romanian society has grown up. It has acquired new foundations for national cohesion and social solidarity. It stands ready to assume the new responsibilities incumbent upon it in terms of Romania's new status as a Nato member and future Member State of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Romania belongs to European culture and civilisation, by its history, its traditions and its values. That is why its integration into the European Union, a process of returning to democratic normality for our country, has been and still is a strategic objective of Romanian society, and this objective has always been the subject of a broad political and public consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">Accession to the European Union is regarded as a political objective as much as a means of accelerating the processes of institutional modernisation and economic and social development with the aim of narrowing the gaps in progress that still separate us from the industrialised world.</p>
<p class="contents">In February 1993 Romania signed the Association Agreement with the European Community and took part, along with the five other associated countries of Central Europe, in the first summit to which those countries were invited, in Essen, in December 1994.</p>
<p class="contents">Immediately afterwards, Romania began the task of drawing up a national strategy for integration into the European Union, embracing all aspects of the process, laying particular emphasis on economic development problems. This was the beginning of what we Romanians call ‘the spirit of Snagov’, that is the consensus of all the political powers and of civil society regarding European integration. In effect, the Snagov Conference in June 1995 culminated in the adoption of the policy declaration of support for accession to the European Union, and in the approval of a strategy for preparing for accession, the first of its kind to have been conceived by an associated country, which also, moreover, received positive assessments from European Union leaders.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, for reasons which have more to do with the dynamics of the political and economic processes following the change of government in November 1996, Romania did not stick to the letter of the provisions of its strategy, which resulted in the build-up of a series of delays.</p>
<p class="contents">We appreciated the true worth of the gesture by the European Union and the Member States, when they invited Romania to begin accession negotiations in December 1999 in Helsinki. That decision gave an impetus to our efforts to reform governance, and forced the politicians to return to the spirit of Snagov and draw up a national strategy for the economic development of Romania. This strategy was presented in Brussels on 20 March 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">In February 2003, a national forum was convened in order to support Romania’s accession to the European Union. Representatives of all the political parties and of civil society took part in this forum. On that occasion, the parliamentary parties adopted a united action plan with accession as its objective.</p>
<p class="contents">I wanted to remind you of these stages in the structuring of Romania’s move towards Europe in order to emphasise the fact that, in Romania, integration is a process on which the political classes and the vast majority of Romanian citizens are fully resolved, and of which the costs and benefits are known and accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware that Romania has to continue its efforts to meet the accession criteria and to attain the objectives of the road map drawn up at the Copenhagen Summit. Romania has already achieved remarkable results and will speed up its action in order to create a functional market economy, to reform the judicial and administrative systems, and to fight a merciless war against corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">Although 2004 is an election year in Romania, we hope that, thanks to a concerted effort, and in particular the work and the actions of the Romanian Government and Parliament, the accession negotiations will be completed towards the middle of 2004. In 2007, therefore, Romania will be able to become an integral part of the great family of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware that the success of the negotiations depends above all on our capacity to carry out reforms, to make the State institutions work, to offer stability and predictability in political, economic and social life, and to spend in an effective and transparent way both public money and Community funds.</p>
<p class="contents">We appreciate our fruitful collaboration with the European Parliament, with its President, Mr Cox, and with the special rapporteur for Romania, Baroness Nicholson, who have helped us a great deal with their advice, experience and support.</p>
<p class="contents">In the enlarged Europe of the future, Parliament will be called upon to give greater legitimacy to the institutions of the Union, to do more to ensure that the desires and aspirations of European citizens are heard, and to direct the process of intensifying democracy in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate on the future European Constitution is also a debate on the future of the democracy and the democratic legitimacy of the European Union. From this point of view the roles of the national parliaments and of the European Parliament are essential.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware that knowledge, innovation and scientific research contribute to the well-being of a nation, and that increased economic competitiveness via modernisation and the updating of technology ensures sustainable development and enables us to seize, in full, the opportunities for well-being offered by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategic objectives of the European Union, adopted in Lisbon, will strengthen the ‘market economy’ nature of the Union, as defined by dynamism and competitiveness, and this is also provided for in the draft European Constitution. This European development model, which pays particular attention to social cohesion, is able to provide a long-term response to rapid demographic change and technological developments around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Romania welcomes the European Union strategy, <span class="italic">Wider Europe – Neighbourhood</span>,<span class="italic"> </span>which makes provision for a beneficent extension of European economic prosperity to include neighbouring areas, by means of peaceful relations based on cooperation and dialogue, a collaboration which is extremely beneficial to the Union itself. In our opinion, the creation of a stability and prosperity belt around Europe could not be complete without including the Black Sea area. The South Caucasus region, which from a geopolitical viewpoint represents the real European South West, requires particular attention from the European Union, which implies an increased interest and a commitment on the part of the Union in this region.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the area occupied by the Former Republic of Yugoslavia is concerned, Romania supports the European integration prospects of the states in this region, and welcomes the decisions taken at the summit in Thessaloniki. The new framework for dialogue and cooperation established at Thessaloniki provides a series of opportunities for relations with the countries of the region, opportunities which must be turned to advantage, both at the annual forum and via the strengthening of regional economic cooperation in the fields of energy, infrastructure and involvement in European Union affairs. Special attention must also be paid to the fight against illegal immigration, trafficking in human beings and drugs and organised crime, but above all to the war against the phenomena linked to international terrorism. Romania supports the continuation of peace-keeping and aid missions in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Romania would like to intensify its cooperation with the countries of Central Europe and with Malta and Cyprus, future Member States of the EU, which it regards as real partners in European construction. With EU 2007 in mind, the strengthening of political dialogue and cooperation is being pursued in all spheres of European integration with the new Member States of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">At a strictly economic level, Romania proposes to contribute towards the development of bilateral trade, and to extend its presence in the markets of the countries of the region. It intends to contribute towards the strengthening of cooperation and regional economic integration so as to improve the region’s economic competitiveness and to participate in the implementation of reconstruction projects in the context of the Stability Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">By reducing economic disparities in the context of the enlarged European Union, the Union, as an actor on the world stage, will gain in transparency, cohesion and efficacy in the pursuit of its objectives at world level, thereby contributing towards the reduction of poverty, the improved distribution of the benefits of globalisation in favour of less-favoured areas, and the increased participation of those areas in world trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Members of the European Parliament, I believe that in such a debate it is also necessary to mention what we do not want the united Europe of the future to be. First of all, the project of European unity cannot be designed in opposition to transatlantic construction, but rather as a complement to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we do not want an exclusive, restrictive project. Sooner or later, countries such as Turkey, the countries of the Former Republic of Yugoslavia, Albania and Moldova will have to find a place in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Europe must be a non-discriminatory construction. In that sense, the concept of a multiple Europe composed of groups of older members and more recent members is totally inadequate, like the concept of a multi-speed Europe. Europe needs everyone, all committed to one united and cohesive effort. Bearing in mind its values and its special experience, the enlarged Europe must also be prepared to implement a programme that seeks to reduce the development lags between the various countries of Europe. Such a programme could serve as a model for the reduction of those same lags at world level.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we do not want to reduce the European construction to the mere creation of a free-trade area. What we want is that a political Europe should emerge, and that it should be equipped with a robust common foreign policy which will enable it to assume a world role of the first order. Europe is, and must remain, an area of unity in diversity, which enables it to derive maximum benefit from its rich spiritual and material heritage, accumulated over the years by all the peoples of Europe, from a culture of dialogue and cooperation, both of which now constitute an integral part of its identity.</p>
<p class="contents">In the new international context, the European Union is being called upon to assume its responsibilities as an actor on the world stage, to reveal itself with greater transparency, cohesion and efficacy, to contribute towards the creation of a multipolar system based on the principles of international law and on the construction of a new world economic architecture which can counter the negative effects of globalisation, at the same time taking full advantage of its benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, the social model can become a reference model for the reduction of the economic gaps which are a feature of the modern world, gaps which are widening and becoming the most dangerous source of conflict and instability at international level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With the conclusion of the fifth phase of enlargement in 2007, when we are confident that Romania will become a Member State, the European Union will have completed a first virtuous circle of progress and reunification.</p>
<p class="contents">Romania belongs to Europe and whatever it does stems from its desire to confirm its European identity. We know this is not an easy thing to do. We need to work harder and more earnestly to fulfil the commitments we have undertaken in order to consolidate your trust - as our European partners - in our ability to monitor complex processes, such as the reforms required for our accession to the European Union, and we need to take action and behave like genuine Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">Now nobody and nothing can question Romania's European future any more. We possess both the ability and the willingness that are needed to complete the structural transformation of the Romanian economy and society, in order to become compatible with the exigences of the European Union and, in this way, to enhance the welfare of Romania's citizens.</p>
