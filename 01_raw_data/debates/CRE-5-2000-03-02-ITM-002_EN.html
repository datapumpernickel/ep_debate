Our President told us yesterday that the Commissioner would be unable to attend today due to prior commitments. He must have reconsidered and, in so doing, has, as usual, shown great respect for this House. I thank him for this.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, I must highlight our concerns about the shipwreck of the tanker <span class="italic">Erika</span>. There are two political reasons why our committee and myself as its chairman must speak out about this issue. Firstly, we must show the Commission, the Council and the Member States that this House cannot and will not forget about this serious incident. Secondly, we must focus today on one specific aspect of this terrible environmental disaster, namely its effect on the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The epilogue to this disaster must surely be the urgent adoption of measures to minimise the damage and to prevent this happening again in the future. Enough regrets and thoughts have been expressed about this event. We must now get down to adopting measures, Commissioner. Firstly, efficient controls are needed in Community waters and ports in order to ensure safety in maritime transport, particularly where oil and dangerous goods are involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The construction of these vessels, the use of double hulls, their age, their control by classification companies, insurance, the creation of databases containing all relevant information, Community cooperation and coordination, the reinforcement of control by inspectors and the liability of carriers and owners of cargoes are all issues which must be tackled. Who better than the European Commission to make serious proposals for European harmonisation in these areas?</p>
<p class="contents">Flags of convenience must also be specifically monitored and regulated in maritime transport, particularly as they do so much damage to the fisheries which we have taken to calling ‘responsible fisheries’. Access into Community waters of vessels flying flags of convenience which do not meet Community safety standards must be controlled.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect concrete action from the European Commission. The fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected areas of Brittany and the Vendée are particularly important, well-developed and prestigious. The European Commission must therefore publicise the damage caused and its assessment of this damage. It must also indicate all the specific measures, including political, economic, social and financial measures, which it intends to adopt in order to minimise the damage and compensate the fishermen and industries which have been dramatically affected overnight.</p>
<p class="contents">How can consumer confidence in products from this area be regained? How can those affected be compensated? This is a very serious problem which the European Union, as an economic, commercial, industrial and fishing power, must tackle.</p>
<p class="contents">We must get to work and lead the way in these issues which are damaging our environment and destroying industries and occupations. We must adopt preventative measures which can stop disasters like this from happening in the future. This is the essence of my oral question on behalf of all the members of the Committee on Fisheries. We hope to hear specific proposals from the Commission, with plenty of action and no more regrets. This House will today approve a very important and appropriate joint motion for a resolution tabled by several groups. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as the contamination of the west coast of France is concerned, which came about following the sinking of the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, we know what extensive and terrible damage this disaster has caused, and that this was further exacerbated by the fact that the disaster coincided with a major storm off the west coast of France. The combined effect of the oil spillage and the storm caused massive contamination, with the oyster banks and mussel culture being hardest hit and completely obliterated in parts.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the fisheries sector has suffered various kinds of damage, particularly to nets. Consequently, fishing activities had to be suspended in some zones on account of this oil pestilence. We are working in very close cooperation with the French authorities on this and the competent Commissioner is already in the process of examining the whole package of measures for improving safety at sea and, if necessary, will present proposals to the Commission accordingly, so as to preclude any such incidents from happening in future. The Community must show solidarity with the victims and we must use every available opportunity – I am completely with Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna on this – to provide assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">The primary instrument available to the fisheries and aquaculture sectors for such eventualities – and I can only speak for these sectors here – is the financial instrument for the alignment of fisheries. The funds can be employed under the terms of the French fisheries-structural programme for 2000-2006, and the French authorities have informed us that they intend to send their programme to Brussels next week. EUR 225 million will be available to France for structural measures up until the year 2006.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Working within this range of options, how can we help the fishermen on the one hand, and the mussel and oyster farmers on the other? It is possible that fishermen and ship-owners will receive compensation for the damages incurred on account of the temporary suspension of their activities, with up to 50% being financed by the state. The Community is prepared to co-finance 50% of this. France has the exclusive right to determine the level of compensation, and a total of EUR 9 million are available to this end.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">So how can we help the oyster and mussel farmers? The funds could be used for cleaning the oyster vats. New equipment could be procured for the oyster vats, or damaged aquaculture equipment could be repaired. The effluent from aquaculture installations could be treated and, in addition, regulations for improving and monitoring the quality of follow-up and hygiene could be financed. Another idea worth considering, among others, would be a general sales promotion campaign.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">If France submits its claims to us before the end of this month, then it will be possible to backdate the compensation to 1.1.2000. At all events, we are prepared, for the Commission’s part, to examine the claim as soon as we receive it, and we will also approve it quickly, so as to be able to get the aid for the victims off the ground with immediate effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The disaster off the coast of Brittany is truly enormous in scale. The accident involving the oil tanker <span class="italic">Erika</span> has had such a huge economic and ecological impact that this is the second time we have dealt with this issue in the space of a few weeks, and rightly so. A whole branch of industry, fisheries and aquaculture and the jobs they generate, hangs in the balance. We cannot, and must not, stand idly by in the face of this. Fine speeches and bitter tears are not much use. We could talk for two, eight, or sixteen hours, but it would not bring fish back to life or put food in a Breton fisherman’s stomach. There is certainly more to solidarity than making speeches. That is why our motion for a resolution can only be a first step, and deeds, i.e. measures, must then follow which will at last serve to ensure that never again will there be a disaster of this kind, particularly off the coast of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">We demand recognition of the polluter pays principle in this motion, which has the overall support of the groups. We also demand red tape-free aid for the fishermen and aquaculture operators whose livelihoods are under threat. However, this must not become a competition-distorting, long-term subsidy. We also demand improved safety conditions for sea traffic and we want there to be better monitoring overall.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">As we have heard, the Commission is getting stuck in. A meeting with representatives of industry is to make the Commission’s proposals known. The need for more stringent Port State Control will not be the only subject of discussion on this occasion, as the pressing need to deploy double-hulled tankers in the future will also be on the agenda. I welcome this with open arms. My demands go further, however. The <span class="italic">Erika</span> is the straw that broke the camel’s back. In the interests of the safety and protection, through preventative measures, of European coastal areas, and of the continued existence of the fisheries sector as an established economic factor, we need a European environmental coastguard and a maritime data network affording effective cooperation between the Member States, which is what we were appealing for yesterday. This is the challenge Europe faces. Europe’s credibility is at stake. We cannot afford to have another disaster where all we do is make a few speeches! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Miguélez Ramos (PSE).</span></span>   <span class="italic">– (ES)</span> Mr President, the shipwreck of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> off the coast of Brittany on 12 December caused an oil slick whose effects on the environment will be felt for years. In addition to destroying natural resources, this accident has had a serious impact on certain economic sectors, particularly those dependent on fisheries. With 20 000 tonnes of crude oil left in the holds of the sunken vessel, the situation could still deteriorate.</p>
<p class="contents">The consequences of this accident have been disastrous for the aquaculture and ostreiculture sectors which were defenceless against the pollution that could not be prevented from coming ashore. These consequences not only stem from the pollution which occurred immediately after the accident but also the subsequent loss of market share and the rejection by the consumer of a fully guaranteed product which is now affected by the pollution itself.</p>
<p class="contents">The regions affected are outlying ones with an unstable economic balance. They have been profoundly affected by this oil slick which, unfortunately, is not an isolated event. The main resources of these and neighbouring regions are those granted by nature, which is nowadays too often being punished by man’s activities. These events could be prevented with more care and control by the public authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Prevention is better than cure or so the saying goes. Surely the budget would agree, as prevention is much cheaper than the cost of disasters like these.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Fischler says that he always comes to the House when asked. Yet on the issue of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> he has given the impression, perhaps not to us but certainly to the inhabitants of Brittany and the Vendée, that, as the Fisheries Commissioner, he is not always available or, at best, available only on a part-time basis.</p>
<p class="contents">As this House indicated in its first resolution on 20 January, the needs of the severely affected fisheries, ostreiculture and tourism industries must be taken into account. We therefore now call upon the Commission to urgently adopt measures to help the fisheries sector by means of special funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Galicia and Brittany now have the common ground of having suffered from oil slicks. We cannot understand how it is that experiences like the <span class="italic">Urquiola</span> or <span class="italic">Amoco Cadiz</span> have not served to reinforce legislation on maritime transport in terms of both controlling safety in the movement of dangerous goods and flags of convenience.</p>
<p class="contents">Please let this be the last disaster of its type and let us learn all possible lessons from this. We must urgently amend our legislation and close the loopholes which keep allowing these terrible disasters to happen. The polluter pays principle is both necessary and appropriate. It is time that polluters started to pay because, up to now, it has been those affected and taxpayers who have paid, and they have not just paid but cleaned up the affected areas as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore delighted at Mr Fischler’s response, particularly his recognition of the need to apply retroactive measures and to give a rapid response to the applications submitted. On behalf of the PSE Group, I want to send a message of solidarity to those affected, to the fishermen, farmers and businesspeople who enable the products of the sea to be regularly brought to market. My message of solidarity also goes out to the mayors and politicians, to the volunteers who have worked to clean the affected areas and to all those who deserve our full support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament has passed a resolution calling for the polluter pays principle to be applied in this instance and for both the shipowners and the owners of the cargo to be liable. The question for the Commissioner is really whether these principles can actually be applied and whether we will get any money by way of compensation from these people. The second point relates to the future and the publication of the Commission’s White Paper on environmental liability which is designed to ensure that the polluter pays principle applies in future and to ensure that we are better able to enforce European environmental legislation properly.</p>
<p class="contents">It is recognised in that White Paper that liability is only effective where the polluter can be identified, where the damage can be quantified and where a clear causal connection can be made between the two. The <span class="italic">Erika</span> incident could not illustrate the point more clearly because it sums up exactly what that White Paper is seeking to address. This question really would therefore seem to be a perfect measure of how to deal with problems of this kind in future.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed directive provides for strict liability for damage caused by EU-regulated dangerous activities and my concern, and perhaps the Commissioner can deal with this, is whether or not the environmental liability paper will be able to deal with problems of the type of <span class="italic">Erika</span> in future. Will it really address the concern or will, in practice, in the case of maritime accidents involving ships on the high seas, the polluter once again escape from having to pay for the damage they cause.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are pleased to hear the Commissioner announce the urgent need to act and to offer compensation, and for this to be backdated.</p>
<p class="contents">We also deplore the excessively lax application of vessel inspection, and we are in favour of creating a European coast guard authority, and also, in particular, of introducing more binding regulations and making double hulls mandatory.</p>
<p class="contents">We further deplore the system of flags of convenience with regard to both merchant vessels and fishing boats.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we were shocked to learn that the cargo was extremely carcinogenic, with a polyaromatic hydrocarbon content of more than 1 000 parts per million. This means that the 15 000 tonnes of cargo released into the sea include 15 tonnes of highly toxic products. This is not acceptable. We only found out too late and, as a result, medical inspection must be provided, paying special attention to the volunteers who dedicated themselves to restoring the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we think it absolutely essential to pay particular attention to preventing such risks, as well as to scientific research work in order to avoid and eliminate damage. A great many proposals have been made which warrant investigation. Solutions cannot be found at the last minute, when the disaster is already in progress.

While reiterating my solidarity with all the victims of this, I should like to salute the dedication of the workers, professionals and volunteers, who are still involved in cleaning the polluted beaches. Thanks to the grass-roots involvement, which this House furthered by organising a debate and adopting a resolution on 20 January, an initial raft of measures has been announced. The French Government has initiated a discussion and made proposals to strengthen maritime safety, particularly by fighting against the phenomenon of flags of convenience and by implementing much more extensive inspection. The lessons of this latest oil slick must be learnt in full, and decisions must be taken speedily at Community level to prevent coffin ships sailing off our shores or berthing in our ports, to make double hulls mandatory for the transportation of pollutants, and to strengthen standards for safety and inspection.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also demand that the parties truly responsible be made to pay the costs incurred due to the pollution. So, yes, Total Fina must provide the financial resources to contribute to the repair of ecological, economic and social damage and to compensate the people affected by the disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">The French State has released funds for compensating damage. I feel, however, that the European Union has so far not actually come up with any expression of Community solidarity at the requisite level. So, yes, appropriations must be released at Community level to support the cleaning of the contaminated coastlines, to assist the organisations which went into action to save oil-covered birds, and to contribute towards getting the affected businesses back on their feet. Specific compensation should be provided for the fishermen and shellfish farmers who have suffered considerable loss of income and who face having to invest considerable sums in order to repair everything and regain consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">I was pleased to hear the statement which Commissioner Fischler has just made, and I take careful note of the commitments he made before this House. I should also like to say that my Group shall remain vigilant and committed, in collaboration with the grass-roots action groups, to ensuring that the parties affected receive compensation as soon as possible and that legislation is strengthened at every level, supported by realistic penalties in the event of non-compliance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Souchet (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the reason why it is important to return to the subject of the oil slick, two and a half months after the wreck of the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, is because the extent of the economic, social and ecological disaster affecting our Atlantic coastline is, in fact, far greater than the first assessments gave us to understand. </p>
<p class="contents">Cakes of tar are still washing in along 500 km of the Atlantic coastline on a daily basis. Curiously, the exact composition of the cargo has still not been clarified. The ecological disaster is a major one, possibly unprecedented in scale. Large-scale degassing proliferates and the 16 000 tonnes of tar remaining in the wreck at a depth of 120 m present a major risk of fresh pollution. All workers in the fishing, fish farming and aquaculture sectors have already been hit hard. The chief victims today are the shellfish farmers who were once the most successful producers in Europe. The frontline victims are the producers or freight forwarders banned in the Vendée and Loire-Atlantique regions. Some of them have already lost several years’ worth of harvests, but the 50% to 80% slump in sales is affecting all the harbours on the Atlantic coastline, and even those in the Channel and North Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards fishing proper, passive gear fishing is currently the hardest hit. After shellfish, the slump is now affecting crustacean sales. The many fishing days lost affect the entire industry and, above all, the future of fishery products, an area in which prices had seen something of a turnaround in very recent years, now hangs entirely on consumer reaction and we are starting to see signs, unfortunately, of initial disenchantment. The two principle resources of the Atlantic shore, fishing and tourism, both closely interrelated, have both been seriously affected. There is a danger that the season will be lost, resulting in an extremely serious crisis by the end of the year. The fact that Parliament is presenting a new resolution, one to which our Group has made a significant contribution, is therefore perfectly justifiable. It emphasises a number of points deemed crucial at grass roots level.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point is that the polluter must accept his liability in full. Our resolution calls for two principles to be applied: the first is the ‘polluter cleans’ principle, since it is unacceptable that the cleaning of coasts polluted by hydrocarbon cargoes should be borne by the local authorities, i.e. the taxpayers, i.e. the victims, and not the cargo owner.</p>
<p class="contents">The second principle is the ‘polluter pays’ principle. According to our resolution, the polluter’s liability must extend to fishing, fish farming and aquaculture industries and businesses. This is essential. It means that the polluter cannot claim to limit the amount of compensation for victims in line with the ceiling set by FIPOL, which is to say, by the goodwill of the major oil companies.</p>
<p class="contents">If the FIPOL ceiling is insufficient, and it has clearly been underestimated, then it must be raised. Our resolution calls for this. If the increase is not enough then the polluter should pay the balance. It would be particularly unfair to have an oil company, whose profits this year amount to FRF 10 billion, refusing to give 100% compensation to its own victims, the great majority of whom are small businesses and employees.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the stricken people await tangible expressions of solidarity at European level. Our resolution calls upon the Commission to take the necessary steps to assist in repairing the damage caused in the fishing industry affected by the consequences of the disaster. Maritime Europe and the CFP must today demonstrate that, in addition to imposing constraints on fishermen, it is not unfamiliar with the concept of solidarity. The European Union must also participate in the restoration of the wetland and coastal environments affected, whose biological value is important to the Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Fischler has just told us that he would welcome France’s requests. I am pleased to hear it.</p>
<p class="contents">We must act as a catalyst in this crucial issue of maritime pollution. Twenty years after the <span class="italic">Amoco Cadiz</span> disaster laxness and irresponsibility still reign supreme in Europe in matters of maritime safety, resulting in yet more oil slicks.</p>
<p class="contents">This time, we must not let inertia win the day. A basis for maritime safety must be drawn up speedily, respecting the principle of subsidiarity, and we must at long last put an end to this downward spiral of widespread irresponsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">35 000 deaths in Caracas. The disturbing thing about the <span class="italic">Erika</span> disaster, however, following the <span class="italic">Amoco Cadiz</span> disaster and so many others before it, is that it was all so predictable. It was all perfectly avoidable since the same causes produce the same effects, and we had identified the causes. The causes are not the trivial details, the lack of technical measures, double hulls, all the petty details that the Greens are so fond of. Just now Mr Piétrasanta offered us an anthology of these petty details.</p>
<p class="contents">The causes are: the lack of a merchant navy, forcing people to resort to slave ships; the floating wrecks which are to be found in the waters off Athens; the lack of shipyards, causing us to go to Montenegro for ships; the lack of a fiscal and social policy enabling us to compete in the globalised system, and the maritime imperialism which dates back to the time of Grotius of Holland, which involved obstructing everything else in order to preserve Rotterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">And what does Brussels do instead of bringing in changes? It accepts Malta, the world leader in flags of convenience, as a candidate, in the same way that accepting Turkey would be a sensible course of action in terms of the fight against immigration. I am therefore fearful on behalf of the shellfish farmers, the fishermen, the coastal communities, the wild birds and nature. Yet more Erikas will be wrecked because natural disasters and Erika-type disasters are the offshoots of globalisation, and globalisation is the hidden cargo sailing under the European flag of convenience. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Having withdrawn the budget line for ‘natural disasters affecting Member States’ with such poor timing, Europe has a duty to respond, firstly in the name of solidarity but also because it shares responsibility in this umpteenth oil slick disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">European citizens find it hard to understand why Europe accepts conditions which the Americans refuse and why Europe, normally so quick to pass environmental legislation, has until now blocked any measures to do with maritime safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must pass legislation at the earliest possible opportunity and investigate the matter of this wreck thoroughly, but, in the meantime, the Commission must, as a matter of urgency, harness European funds to aid the businesses affected in order to deal with the wreck, clean up the coastline, increase the capacity of waste storage facilities, ensure that waste is processed or recycled, and set up a research programme into the recovery of oil spilt at sea.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission must reintroduce an appropriate budget line for ‘natural disasters involving Member States’, and make the regions affected eligible for Structural Funds.</p>

The debate on preventing these disasters has already been held in Strasbourg and it highlighted the importance of a European plan for maritime safety.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to prevention, however, we should not be blind to the ramifications of such disasters, not least the ecological ramifications. Many hundreds of kilometres of French coastline have been polluted. Thousands of fish and birds have been killed. It cannot be ruled out that certain habitats may have been permanently damaged, and the restoration of the environment is often a long drawn-out process.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The present system of compensation, which has an upper limit and which only takes into account financially quantifiable damage to the environment, is no longer satisfactory. We need to move towards removing the upper limit on compensation payments as a matter of urgency, also in the case of environmental damage which cannot be quantified financially. The polluter pays principle must be applied consistently. I advocate zero tolerance of marine pollution. For this purpose, stricter and better controls are required. </p>
<p class="contents">But we must also give some consideration to the economic ramifications. I am in favour of a European recovery plan for the affected industries, from fisheries, via mussel farms and oyster beds, to the hotel and catering industry. In short, a contingency plan which kicks in in the event of shipping disasters. Those who are at the receiving end of other people’s reckless pursuit of profit deserve our solidarity, certainly as an interim measure. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to highlight the health aspect. Belgian volunteers, too, sacrificed their Christmas holidays to clean the beaches and rescue birds and fish, often with their bare hands. I was surprised to read reports in the press that the sludge was carcinogenic. I was even more surprised to read that the French authorities had wind of this days before but did not warn the volunteers to take protective measures. I would like to know from the Commissioner whether and, if so, when the European Commission was informed of the possible threat to public health. </p>
<p class="contents">We must learn from past experiences. Shipping disasters such as that involving the <span class="italic">Erika</span> could well strike again off the Dutch, English, Spanish or Belgian coasts. The regulations which we are drawing up today in Europe should be regarded as a precedent. We should therefore be strict with the polluters and generous to the victims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are two aspects, the first being the environmental angle. The wreck still contains 16 000 tonnes of heavy gas oil which is leaking and, in addition to these leaks, unfortunately, last week we observed and counted 35 acts of ecological piracy, 35 degassing operations, disgracefully aggravating this already catastrophic situation. Mrs de Palacio expressed her views at length regarding this issue and I feel she set to work without waiting for an element which today is absolutely essential, a draft European maritime law, following a draft directive on the maritime transportation of dangerous goods. From this point of view, this fits in with the wish of the French to see their presidency characterised by regulations which work towards increasing safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The secondary impact, however, is proving to be on the economy, the primary impact being environmental and only the second economic, as many Members have stated. Shellfish farming, fishing, oyster farming and fish farming are today seriously affected, for the effects of the oil slick have been compounded by the storm damage affecting many areas. Unfortunately, these sectors have been devastated: they have first to rebuild and then, perhaps the most difficult thing, to regain consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Confronted with this situation, the inhabitants of Brittany, the Vendée and Charente, as well as the forestry workers in other regions, await a signal from the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot claim that rapprochement with the citizens is the touchstone of this legislative period if, at the same time, we hold our tongues and do not offer practical responses in the face of phenomena of this magnitude.</p>
<p class="contents">I took very careful note of Commissioner Fischler’s remarks, perhaps the most practical suggestions we have heard to date. There have been many declarations of sympathy and solidarity, and many announcements, admittedly, but now it is time for expectations to be met with a tangible display of European solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now we must continue both to apply pressure, together with citizens’ organisations, to ensure that Total pays the full costs for everything destroyed due to its unbridled pursuit for profits, and also to make a firm commitment to ensuring that this type of disaster never happens again.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though the joint motion for a resolution is an interesting one, it does not tackle the subject of flags of convenience, a problem which must be both condemned and resolved as a matter of urgency if we are to contribute to the principle of preventing maritime disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">It is actually not so much a matter of improving safety checks on these flags of convenience, as stipulated in the resolution, as actually working right now to eliminate their existence. This is the only solution to ensure that seafarers’ living and working conditions are satisfactory, that they are covered by effective legislation and social protection, and that fishing operations and the environment are respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament adopts a resolution after every maritime disaster. Generally it puts forward positive technical measures, some of which are adopted in directives. If they were applied, they would in fact serve to counter the idea of cutting costs to the minimum, a policy which is maintained through flags of convenience. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was stated at this conference that disasters account for 5% to 10% of oil pollution.

<p class="contents">What I would like to propose within the framework not so much of technical improvements, better inspection or improved legislation (which, I admit, are all necessary) but, rather, within the framework of socially responsible management, is a kind of round-table conference comprising those involved in, and affected by, the pollution of the seas with oil.

It has become quite evident that there need to be two strands to our approach. Firstly, preventative measures, i.e. we must consider how we can improve the guidelines, maritime law, etc. in the various sectors in such a way as to lessen the risk of disasters of this kind happening in the future.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, what can we do to help the area in which the disaster happens? Now I think you should know that my colleague, Mrs de Palacio, has already included three very specific proposals in the interservice procedure. I hope that the Commission will adopt these proposals before the end of March, for this will enable us to make progress on the preventative measures front.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">These three proposals are quite specific. Firstly, it is proposed that national supervision of ship safety should be stepped up and secondly, that the Commission’s supervision of the organisations responsible for assessing safety conditions on board ships should be reinforced. Thirdly, following a transition period, we want single-hulled tankers to be completely banned from travelling through EU waters.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe these measures will enable us to make true progress. In addition, further measures have been planned for later in the year, and we will certainly examine the flags of convenience issue in the process.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">As far as aid is concerned, many people have asked for the budget line for compensation to be re-instated. However, I would ask you to recall how much money was earmarked for this budget line. The money available under this line was not a meaningful amount in aid terms. I clearly remember having major debates in this House on BSE, and people saying what a placebo it all was and how it would do no good at all in reality.</p>
<p class="contents">The only way to deliver aid of any consequence is through the programmes I have described to you. As I have already indicated, the ball is now in the French Government’s court. I have given you my promise that as soon as we receive the programmes from France, we will examine and also approve them with all haste. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been said that the Commission will meet to adopt a range of technical and legal measures. This is the right way to go. These measures are very welcome and the Committee on Fisheries will monitor these very closely so that we do not have to spend more time in this House regretting such disasters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
