Our proposal for a regulation on aid for policies and actions on reproductive and sexual health and rights in developing countries is very important in contributing to improved health outcomes and achieving the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me reinforce this message by giving you one stark fact: maternal mortality in Africa has remained relatively constant in the last 10 years and largely affects the poorest women. In some countries, for example Malawi, maternal mortality is increasing. I find this unacceptable and we, as Europeans, need to show our commitment to improving this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">This regulation addresses the unacceptably high death and illness rates of women by giving us the means to carry out the principles and policies agreed in the Programme for Action of the International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo in 1994 and the Key Actions adopted five years later.</p>
<p class="contents">The main principles are: the basic right for people to protect their reproductive and sexual rights; the right of universal access to care, services and products; and the right to choose freely the number and spacing of their children.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need for this regulation to fund innovative actions, which are cost-effective and have the potential to be replicated in other areas or scaled up using other funding resources. It will serve to develop local partnerships with the different actors and, where appropriate, contribute to regional or global initiatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank the Commission, the Council and the secretariat.</p>
<p class="contents">This regulation replaces a former one that expired in December last year. It was necessary to try to get this regulation adopted at first reading. Without the cooperation of all these actors this would not have been possible. For the same reason, it is only necessary to adopt those amendments that have been agreed upon among these actors. This is, as Commissioner Nielson mentioned, a very important regulation. Every minute of every day, 380 women become pregnant. Of them, one woman dies. One hundred and ninety women have unwanted pregnancies; 110 women face a pregnancy-related problem; 40 women have unsafe abortions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a fact that pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of death and disability for women in the developing countries. Every year 600 000 women die as a direct result of getting pregnant. An estimated 30% to 40% more are left with serious complications. This is appalling, especially since at least 75% of all deaths and injuries could be prevented through basic and affordable reproductive health care measures.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what reproductive health care and rights are all about - saving women's lives. This regulation is about providing women in the developing countries with access to the most basic services – those services which we take for granted – and also, where it is legal, to include in these services the choice of a safe abortion.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation specifically underlines that abortion should never be used as a means of contraception. The regulation also emphasises that everything possible should be done to avoid abortions. In fact, it has been proved that in those countries where reproductive health care was introduced, the abortion rate dropped by 25% immediately. This has, for instance, been the case in Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">A lot of allegations have been made against this report. There has been misinformation, confusing information, unacceptable information and misleading information, such as the statement that, for instance, in the US the teaching of abstinence only has resulted in the decline of teenage pregnancies whereas, on the contrary, it has been proved that good sex education, information and counselling have reduced teenage pregnancies. It has been implied that this regulation could leave the door open to use abortion as a means of contraception or even birth control. It has even been implied that this regulation would be used to keep down the number of the poor. The use of condoms has been compared to playing Russian roulette. Those are just a few examples of what this regulation has been accused of.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this is obviously completely untrue. The Commissioner has already mentioned that this is a follow-up to the Cairo programme which was signed by all of our Member States, and that is exactly so. Moreover, it has become a very balanced report. It puts a lot of emphasis on education. It puts a lot of emphasis on counselling. <span class="italic">Nobody</span> who reads this report can doubt that it never recommends abortion. On the contrary, it says that everything should be done to avoid abortion, but if a woman in a developing country has an unwanted pregnancy she should not be deprived of the right to a safe abortion, a right which we have in our part of the world. We cannot leave a woman in the Third World to die because she has an unwanted pregnancy. That would be immoral.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been travelling extensively in Africa. Wherever I have travelled I have visited small clinics for reproductive health and rights. These clinics are the only place people can go to be tested for HIV-AIDS. When they come with their children they are treated for all kinds of other diseases as well: if they have malaria, then the malaria is treated. It is extremely important to have centres for reproductive health and rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The HIV-AIDS issue is one of the reasons why we have asked to have the amount of money raised compared to the last regulation. It is very important that a woman can be tested to see whether she is HIV positive. It is very important that a woman can have counselling as to how she can protect herself against HIV-AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">You cannot fight poverty without sexual and reproductive health care. I am very happy that we have raised the amount, in comparison with the last regulation. I am very pleased that we have now secured the consensus reached so painstakingly at the UN Conference in Cairo and which is soon to have its 10th anniversary. We will soon be at Cairo+10, and this is therefore a very important signal: we back the Cairo consensus here in Europe, here in the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Without getting into an assessment of the main report which, naturally, is the responsibility of the Committee on Development, from a budgetary point of view I would like to say that the new financial framework proposed by the Commission meant an increase of 78% in the new programme in comparison with the previous one, which ended on 31 December 2002, which reflects the importance the Community attaches to this programme with a view to improving the reproductive health of people without sufficient economic resources in the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial framework we voted on in the Committee on Budgets was the one that appeared in the Commission’s preliminary draft budget and which was finally ratified in the 2003 budget. It will not be possible to increase the amount proposed without reducing other policies in the same heading, because the financial ceiling has already been reached.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Rules of Procedure have already entered into force and we therefore have Rule 63, which says: 'When the committee responsible amends the financial endowment of the act it is considering, it shall request the opinion of the committee responsible for budgetary issues'. This is not trivial.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Development, for its part, has increased the amount without requesting the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. In turn, at the meeting of coordinators of the Committee on Budgets it was agreed to present an amendment on behalf of that committee to the legislative proposal in order to clarify this issue and re-establish the initial amendment presented in my report.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware of the efforts made in the Committee competent for the main report to reach a consensus which would allow it to be approved at first reading and I congratulate them on their work. I am also aware of the thankless role the Committee on Budgets has to play on this issue, since it makes it the final judge of sensitive programmes whose verdict is based strictly on the budgetary framework. And I have already said that I am not going to get into assessing the fundamental aspects of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we must be coherent with what we approve on this new regulation and we must use it, because that is what differentiates us from a secondary school assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, for the sake of responsible and coherent parliamentary conduct, I would urge you to vote in favour of the amendments presented on behalf of the Committee on Budgets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, we have had plenty of time to do so, for the opinion was, I believe, expressed last September. Indeed, we were aware of the importance of not leaving a gap between the adoption of a new regulation and the expiry of the previous one.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Committee on Women’s Rights, we decided to emphasise, first and foremost, the need to accompany these policies with a literacy programme promoting education, training, knowledge and culture, including basic information services on communicable diseases, hygiene, health and human rights. Great importance and value were accorded to this element, precisely because we believe that all the agreements we negotiate should be accompanied by the requirement of strict observance of human rights and, in particular, by a clear demand for policies of gender equality, as a precondition for any policy on the countries in question.</p>
<p class="contents">We are convinced that reproductive health problems are also closely linked to issues of poverty and underdevelopment. We therefore believe that it is only by pursuing this line that they can be resolved. There is, of course, an urgent need, a need which we intend to address, first and foremost, with preventive and aid policies relating to pregnancy and birth but also responding to the need to combat diseases communicable from mother to child. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martens (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, we are discussing an important matter. Every year 100 000 women die of complications during or following pregnancy, the overwhelming majority of them in developing countries. Very much larger numbers are involved when you include people suffering from sexually-transmitted diseases such as HIV and AIDS. This programme is about the whole range of problems. The EU wants to do something about this urgent state of affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme is geared, therefore, to the treatment and prevention of disease and infection, the reduction of maternal mortality and the prevention of abortion. In the considerations you can read and I quote: 'schemes to promote sterilisation or abortion and improper methods for testing contraceptives in developing countries will not be eligible for support under this regulation'. Commissioner Nielson guaranteed to the Commission once again in a letter that these are not included in the policy of the Commission. Some fear misuse of the scheme but I cannot read the report as promoting abortion. It may not be possible to give a watertight guarantee that it will never happen but it can be stated with certainty that the regulation itself is aimed at prevention – prevention of sexually-transmitted diseases, prevention of unwanted pregnancies and prevention of abortion. It is a sensitive issue, with opinions divided even in our group, and the text that has been produced is a compromise. It is not exactly as our group would have drawn it up ourselves but we have managed to reach a reasonable compromise, based on the action programmes signed in Cairo by all the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Examination of the problem clearly shows that it cannot be solved solely by emphasising rights, provisions and resources. An important part of it has to do with mentality and taking responsibility, which is why I am pleased that the point of view of our group has been given a much better place in the text to be voted on tomorrow and by that I mean that there is more emphasis on the importance of education, information, counselling and personal responsibility and the special role of the family. The text clearly states that there will be no support for the promotion of sterilisation and abortion. We have negotiated to reach a solution quickly so as not to have to stop programmes unnecessarily. It is unfortunate that the Commission was rather late with its proposal, which meant that we had to complete the whole process so quickly. That did not make it easier.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the budget is concerned, I am pleased with the compromises reached on the amendments and I hope that they can also be accepted tomorrow in order to give the budgetary authority the last word. I assume that we can count on the full support of the Council and the Commission after this long process of negotiation. I would like to thank all those who cooperated with us in such a constructive way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Reproductive health is one of the fundamental aspects of development and principally, but not solely, affects the developing countries. In those countries, pregnancies and births are the main cause of death and illness amongst women, as has been said previously. Therefore the Group of the European Socialist Party will undoubtedly support an active European Union policy on this issue which does not involve any moral stand, but rather a universal ethical imperative, human rights and development, and we therefore support the regulation being debated today.</p>
<p class="contents">This regulation comes at a very appropriate time for the European Union to demonstrate its determination, when other large donors, such as the United States, are pushing for a reconsideration of the commitments made in 1994 at the Cairo Conference on Population and Development. That conference represented great progress, by correcting the political view of population which traditionally focussed on demographic objectives, and since then it has focussed on women’s rights. No less than 179 countries agreed to an action plan on this new basis.</p>
<p class="contents">However, at the 5th Conference on the population of Asia and the Pacific, held in Bangkok in December, there was a desire to remove any reference to rights in the field of reproduction and services relating to genetic health in order to conserve United States aid, which refuses to fund organisations which promote family planning, including the United Nations Population Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, in order to reassure those people who are fundamentally opposed to rights relating to genetic health, we must make it clear that family planning, information and access to reproductive health services prevent abortion and, if it is carried out, it is better that it happens under safe and hygienic conditions in order to prevent the 78 000 deaths per year caused by unsafe abortions.</p>
<p class="contents">This report and this regulation do not deal with abortion, but the European Union’s contribution to social development, the population’s access to information, to contraceptives, to health care during pregnancy and birth and responsible sexuality.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must be generous. Therefore the Group of the European Socialist Party will do all it can within the framework of the financial perspectives and in accordance with budgetary authority to increase the funding for this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">We will vote tomorrow in favour of the amendments relating to funding and against any other amendment that may affect the content of this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to raise two points.</p>
<p class="contents">My first point is of a financial nature. The main problem is that the financing is lagging behind the ICPD objectives, with, in addition to President Bush’s decrease, the fact that 0.7% ODA has not been reached. Taking all those things together, this means that many programmes cannot be implemented. That is why, Commissioner, the financial section in this proposal is immensely important. Now I would like to hear from you whether the Commissioner supports Amendment No 46, which deals with the level of the amount, but also the promise that the budgetary authority will consent. Even more important: does the Council agree with this proposal? We consider it very important that agreement is reached at first reading, and this amendment may put that in jeopardy.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point concerns the anti-abortion actions being conducted in relation to this issue. There is a lobby group in America screaming blue murder because they say this European regulation promotes abortion. They say it supports the Chinese policy of forced abortion as a means of stemming population growth. It is all nonsense. I want to publicly reject this. Of course we are against the Chinese practice, just as we were against the forced sterilisation of men in India in the time of Mrs Gandhi. The decision to have an abortion must be taken freely by women but not seen as an alternative to proper methods of contraception. Once a woman has taken the difficult decision – and take it from me, it is a very difficult decision – the opportunity has to exist for her to do this in a responsible way, so that she does not have to resort to clandestine abortion, often with dire consequences. The proposal as it now lies before us is also entirely in keeping with the principles adopted in 1994 in Cairo. I eagerly await your response. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nor can anyone continue to plead ignorance regarding the ways in which, in certain countries, women’s rights on these matters are abused. This evening’s debate enables us to demonstrate how urgent it is to make substantial funding available for setting up infrastructures covering the people who are most vulnerable, the provision of information, basic public health care and methods of contraception.</p>
<p class="contents">The undertakings given at the International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo should be maintained and honoured. While more than ten million children die each year of curable diseases in developing countries, and while forty million people with HIV-AIDS also live in developing countries, the initiatives of the European Union are even more important when the present situation also features the attempt by the United States – fortunately unsuccessful at the moment – to include in the Plan for Action recently adopted in Bangkok the promotion of fidelity and chastity as the sole means of protecting people against sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) or AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate, and I would like to thank our rapporteur for her work on the subject, has to remain serious. A society which sets up as a model the so-called ideal family cannot be anything other than a moralistic and sectarian society, of which women are always the first victims, with their rights being all too often dependent on the goodwill of men, whether father, husband or brother. What sort of society do they think they are creating, when on the one hand there is the US District of Columbia, which still denounces extra-marital sex as a crime, and on the other there is Nigeria, where women are stoned for the same reason?</p>
<p class="contents">The emancipation of women and the full development of everyone requires rights and actions. These include the inalienable right of women to have full control of their own bodies, without any constraints, and also to have the freedom to choose when they have a child. As for the right to abortion, it still has to be defended, and for some women, including some in Europe, it still has to be acquired. On this point, having been warned by Polish women’s groups and feminist organisations, I should like to draw the attention of the Commission and of the Council to a real and present threat. The Polish Government is apparently asking now that the Treaty of Accession which it is getting ready to sign with the Union should include a reference to morality, culture and the promotion of life, which would in fact legitimise the current restrictive law on abortion in Poland. Like the sixty percent of the population of that country who are opposed to that law, I would like to associate myself with the appeal launched against the inclusion of any such statement in the Treaty of Accession. The Commission and the Member States would be giving a very bad signal to those people, in particular women, who believe in the values of liberty, dignity and the emancipation of our European societies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think the time has finally come to make more funding available for that proportion of development aid which is spent on health and education. That is why I support the amount of funding proposed by Mrs Sandbæk in her report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maes (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is really amazing that we only hear voices of agreement in this Chamber this evening when behind the scenes so many obscure forces are trying to undermine the regulation and the financing of it. This has to do with the fact that the right to autonomous control over your body, your fertility and reproduction has never been completely accepted. In some circles people evidently still do not understand that women cannot be denied this right. Nor men either, but there has always been more sympathy for that in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">When we consider the situation today, we see big differences in theory and in practice. If we look at the European Union, we find something that has not been discussed today that there are many cases in which men’s, and especially women’s, desires with regard to having children cannot be fulfilled because this is so difficult to combine with a demanding professional life and a busy life in general. Up to now we have not seen this as a collective problem. But in any case we know that very many women would like more children than the average 1.4 per family that, for example, is reached in Belgium.</p>
<p class="contents">In the third world it tends to be the other way round. Of course a woman’s fertility is a blessing there too, but it is also a curse because the number of children born is often more than the number she wants and more than she can give a decent upbringing to. That is, of course, because of the poverty in which the women and children live, as, of course, do the men too, but the number of women in the third world having to bring up children on their own is increasing more and more. The situation is very grave. At the time of the elections in Kenya, a social worker in one of the slums of Nairobi told me that the women find it so difficult to bring up their children that they are refusing to marry, because then they would have another person to look after and one who hits them. Family life is so disrupted by poverty that they say: we would rather try on our own. Of course the children have different fathers who do not care about the women or the children. We have not explained the need for this programme at all, because if we had we would set all the budgetary concerns on one side and give it far more resources.</p>
<p class="contents">But I was talking about the social implications. In the European Union and the other rich countries this leads to the phenomenon of an ageing population, in the poor countries it leads to overpopulation and worsening poverty that often takes on structural forms. But your regulation is absolutely not targeting those large-scale societal phenomena. It is actually elementary, the help, the access that women and men but especially women must have to escape the frightful consequences of unwanted pregnancy, the frightful consequences of rape and also the frightful consequences that occur in other communities. I heard of a case of Roma women who are sterilised against their will at the moment they give birth. They are made infertile without knowing it. All this results from ignorance, of course, but it mainly due to grinding poverty. That is why we will support the Commissioner and the rapporteur and those who submit amendments, in order to oppose those in the world who through their resistance attempt to smear these regulations, the resources and the people who are working hard to promote reproductive health. We will make every effort to get these financial resources increased in the future and to see that they are used well. In view of the spread of AIDS, it has to be said that all our resources are insufficient at the moment. Fortunately official policy has come back to that meanwhile but in Kenya a few years ago people used not to tell pregnant women infected with the HIV virus that they had it, because they did not have the means to do anything about it. Now fortunately we have the means to prevent this dreadful disease being passed from mother to child. That 36 million people have to live with the HIV virus and that millions die of it every year must surely make an impression on those who only care about unborn lives and leave those who have been born to suffer and die.</p>

<p class="contents">Four of them, from Mrs Montfort and Mr Mauro, deal with the specific and important question of the need to have special provisions in favour of extensive access to services that cater for and support future mothers in distress so as to help them bear their children.</p>
<p class="contents">In a regulation covering reproductive health in developing countries, it would be difficult to understand where our policies are heading if support for motherhood and special care for mothers in distress were not properly taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">The other specific issue is a sensitive one which must be addressed clearly: is the European Union going to fund abortion worldwide or not? This is a key aspect of the text on which we will vote. I know that in substance our views are different and that laws differ from one Member State to another. I do not want to open a debate that is not in the competence of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept, however, that European Union funds would be applied in abortion-oriented policies. The matter still requires clarification. The official policy of the EU must be open and clear to everyone, not disguised or covered up. Ambiguity is very wrong here. Our Amendments 49 and 53 are in the direction of clarification.</p>
<p class="contents">I was pleased to hear Commissioner Nielson in committee, the day the report was adopted, assuring us that it is not correct to say that the EU is trying to develop an abortion policy and that those who imply that are ill-informed or wish to distort the reality. I would be even happier if I could be reassured tonight. The EU should not promote abortion.</p>
<p class="contents">There are details that raise concern. For instance, on an official Commission website on the development sector, the term 'population' is defined as: 'an umbrella term now used to describe issues relating to demography and reproductive and sexual health and rights which can include issues such as abortion'. This raises concerns. Who adopted such a biased and twisted definition in the Commission and what are the implications?</p>
<p class="contents">It is not a secret that an NGO, Marie Stopes International, actively worked with Parliament to prepare this legislation. I have here a message, sent a few days ago to several MEPs, that indicates that Marie Stopes was working at the secretariat of the European Parliament Working Group on Population. Once out and in the open this, though a bit awkward, might not be such a big problem. But in a report published by Euro NGOs, the representative of Marie Stopes states that her organisation is a major provider of abortion that is working with Vietnam and in other countries where abortion may be illegal. This raises huge concerns. The apparent active involvement of Marie Stopes in the preparation of this legislation reinforces the need for crystal clear clarification in our debate and in the text of the regulation. That is what we are asking for in Amendments 49 and 53. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, abortion is not a Community competence, being too far away from the aims of development cooperation ever to become a Community competence via that route. The second reason why abortion may not be a Community policy concerns the supplementary nature of the policy. It is not allowed to replace the policy of a Member State, which support for abortion would do, given that it is a criminal offence in one Member State and in several candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also lacks clarity because it fails to define reproductive health. Does the definition of the World Health Organisation apply? This includes termination of pregnancy and therefore abortion! Amendments Nos 49 and 53 deserve strong support because they clearly rule out abortion. Moreover the organisations implementing the Community policy are not unequivocal in their efforts to reduce abortion. They actually have so-called ‘safe abortion’ as one of their objectives. However, the greatest potential for improving health is not in abortion but in a different area. The report states that 13% of maternal mortality is caused by so-called ‘unsafe abortion’, as if there was such a thing a safe abortion. This means that 87% has a different cause. Better care during pregnancy and better health care in general would therefore reduce maternal mortality considerably. The 13% caused by so-called ‘unsafe abortion’ can also be brought down, through more compassionate counselling of women with unwanted pregnancies.</p>
<p class="contents">Next the share of the budget taken by the report is unbalanced. The annual budget of EUR 20 million represents a doubling of what was spent last year. That will be at the expense of other budget headings. Figures from the UN population fund show that people worldwide have better access to contraceptives than to clean water. In short, we are setting the wrong priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, hopeful developments can be seen in several African countries in reducing sexually-transmitted diseases, due to education that emphasises fidelity in marriage and abstinence. Is the Commission aware of these positive results? I ask this question again because the Commission did not answer it during the debate on hunger, trade and the role of HIV/AIDS in that. I refer to Uganda and Zambia. In South Africa beneficial effects have also been acknowledged. Fidelity in marriage and abstinence produce better results than the present secular European morality! I eagerly await Commissioner Nielson's response. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We European women are lucky in that we are able to complete a pregnancy, have access to information and reconcile family life with professional life. How can we accept the fact that so many women experience difficulties which we in Europe are spared? However, we must not allow ourselves to make our aid conditional upon family planning. It would be absurd to impose our model on these women. It is vital to help these women to organise their society, their lives as women and mothers, in accordance with their traditions, their values and their culture.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we cannot reduce issues involving women’s rights merely to those issues involving reproduction and sexuality. These women are pillars of their society. They should therefore have more access to education, information and training, and they must be able to pass on to their children all that they have learned, so as to enable their countries to experience real development, in which access to health and information will occupy its rightful place.</p>
<p class="contents">Although pregnancy and giving birth are the main causes of death or injury among women living in these developing countries, and although sexually-transmitted diseases occur more frequently in those countries, it is certainly not by suppressing pregnancy that we shall succeed in overcoming these problems. It is vital, in fact, to treat the causes, not just the consequences, by providing access to information, as I said just now, and by providing access to medicines, particularly generic medicines, as we said on Monday evening, so as to ensure that healthcare is not a luxury enjoyed by industrialised countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Sandbæk, you tell us that abortion will never be a form of contraception. In order to convince us, your report should have been more precise. The amendments which I tabled in committee and which provided an alternative to abortion, namely a reception centre for those women who choose to have their babies in spite of their difficult lives, should have been supported. I should like to thank Mr Ribeiro e Castro, who took up the amendments again, because health and rights regarding reproduction and sexuality will always be linked to the freedom and responsibility of every person. In this way I hope that these women will be able to exercise their responsibilities in complete freedom and without any pressure from our Western model. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Health care is desperately needed yet, as this bundle of e-mails shows, it is also a highly sensitive subject and one that must be treated with respect by those at both ends of the spectrum. I would therefore begin by thanking Mrs Sandbæk for the long negotiations she has had, firstly with the Council and Commission representatives, and then with the co-ordinators, the political parties in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">In any such sensitive issue, no one will be completely happy with the outcome. That is why - even with the strong feelings I have on this subject - I genuinely believe that the compromise reached in the Committee on Development and Cooperation gives us a package that this House should accept.</p>
<p class="contents">I know there is a problem with the budget aspects of this report, but I hope that the amendments tabled are acceptable so that this report can have a clear majority in favour at first reading. It would be a tragedy for sick women in developing countries if this report were delayed in any way because of budget technicalities. The facts speak for themselves. At least 75% of all maternal deaths and injuries could and should be prevented through reproductive health care. Reproductive health in the context of this report covers all areas related to reproduction and associated diseases such as HIV-AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">Through long-term investment in reproductive health supplies, services and the appropriate counselling much can be done to stop unwanted pregnancies and to go some way to controlling the spread of sexually-transmitted diseases. I sincerely hope that honourable Members of this House will support this report.</p>

<p class="contents">In recent days we have once again suffered – as also happened during the committee procedure and as also happened in this House in the case of the Van Lancker report – the bombardment of our e-mail systems with messages which have always been threatening, aggressive, laden with insults and furthermore always, without exception, lacking in arguments or a rigorous analysis of the content of the report, which is solely attributed with the aim of imposing mass sterilisations, and I will read out a fragment of an e-mail I have received: 'If this report is approved, the European Union would become one of the major promoters of abortion and the culture of death, and its approval would mean accepting the annihilation of the poor'.</p>
<p class="contents">Accusing this Parliament of wanting to annihilate the poor leads me at least to entirely reject the content of such positions and virulent expressions which attempt to conceal a complete lack of arguments, because these groups who harass us and who claim to be pro-life, resorting to their religious convictions, are the ones who condemn poor women to the illness and death resulting from their reproductive role.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to explain the true significance and importance of approving this report it is necessary to highlight certain crucial aspects. On the one hand, the importance of women as the main promoters of health, and on the other, the ratification – as has already been said – of the idea that there can be no social development without a healthy society and that the health of women is directly related to their reproductive role.</p>
<p class="contents">Currently, 20% of the world’s population is at the reproductive stage of their lives and it is therefore crucial that information on their sexuality and their reproductive capacity is available, in order to ensure that that population is protected from unwanted pregnancies and sexually-transmitted diseases. By ignoring the reproductive rights of women and denying them the power to chose, we are condemning them, their families and the communities they live in to illness and poverty, because we must not forget that health is undoubtedly a decisive element in the fight against poverty, a fight which the European Union advocates and is committed to.</p>
<p class="contents">That commitment – made many years ago by the international community – must be reinforced at this time when we are faced with a cut in the funds allocated to sexual and reproductive health by certain governments which take a false and hypocritically moral approach to life. It is not possible to be in favour of life and then deny women in developing countries their right to information and to controlling their sexuality and reproductive capacity. In the developing countries female mortality relating to pregnancy and childbirth is 33 times greater than that in the industrialised countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Reproductive health services are included amongst the indicators selected for evaluating the millennium development objectives. Improvements in reproductive health lead to lower pregnancy rates and reduction in dependency. Bad health leads to higher pregnancy rates and condemns families to poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2015 there will be 742 million people requiring sexual and reproductive health services or supplies. Control of their sexuality is a woman’s right, but this is only recognised in the rich countries. The illnesses and consequences which women in the poor countries suffer principally originate from their reproductive role. Feminine health is an essential element if the poor countries are to make progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The relationship between poverty and low levels of development and sexual and reproductive health is very close and makes it incumbent on us to adopt measures that will enable us to end or at least to mitigate the extremely worrying situations we are seeing today in this field which, unfortunately, are growing worse.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence the importance of this proposal for a regulation and the report by Mrs Sandbaek. I must point out, with regard to this report, the rapporteur’s efforts to improve and to achieve a compromise, even at first reading, which enabled a broad consensus to be achieved on the proposals we are studying today. These efforts are all the more noteworthy because of the vague suspicions and frustrated attempts to include groundless justifications in the guidelines in question. Fortunately, the rapporteur, the political groups, the other committees involved and also Commissioner Poul Nielson, and everyone who has worked on this issue have been able to focus on the essential and I am sure that plenary will adopt the same approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The essential lies in what has been acknowledged by the various international conferences on population and development, in understanding that access to reproductive and sexual health services forms a crucial part of the fight for development and against poverty and consequently the prevention of communicable diseases such as AIDS. Nor should it be swept under the carpet in this context that pregnancy and childbirth are the main causes of death and disability of women in less-developed countries. Nor should it be forgotten that a major proportion of maternity-linked deaths in those countries are closely linked to abortions carried out in unsafe conditions. These are undeniable and enormously serious occurrences that must be ended by means of appropriate measures, such as those now being responsibly proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also why means are also necessary and these have been clearly insufficient. This is why it is essential to make an effort, with the European Union leading the way. This is also why I believe it is crucial for Parliament, in accordance with its powers and responsibilities, and in the spirit of consensus and balance, to now earmark the amount proposed for this purpose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fully support efforts by the European Union to improve health and sanitary conditions for women in these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout the developing world, particularly in the poorest countries, hundreds of women are dying in childbirth because the health systems in those countries cannot afford proper medical care and appropriate services. This is why it is so important that the European Union helps to improve the health facilities in these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to state for the record that I fully support the agreement reached at the Cairo Conference on Population and Development in 1994, which was updated in 1999. The Cairo agreement states that abortion cannot be promoted as a family planning method, and that regulations regarding abortion are solely for individual countries to decide upon. I am fully satisfied that this draft regulation on sexual and reproductive rights fully complies with the requirements laid down by the Cairo agreement. I will be monitoring this legislation very carefully, at all stages of its enactment, so as to guarantee that it is in full conformity with the provisions of the Cairo agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that the Irish Government is very vigilant in monitoring the terms of this proposal. I also want to state, in the clearest possible language, my strong commitment to defending the rights of children and the unborn. The European Union has no power whatsoever to deal with the issue of abortion, which rightly remains the sole preserve of individual Member States. There is nothing this report can do to propose a change in this legal position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The WHO estimates that 88-98% of all maternal deaths are avoidable if women have access to proper reproductive and obstetric health services. Recently on a visit to Rwanda I learned that 2 000 women die per 100 000 live births. In my own country, the United Kingdom, that figure is seven.</p>
<p class="contents">Maternal mortality continues to rise in developing countries. Women die from haemorrhaging, from infections, from high blood pressure, from obstructed labour. They also die from unsafe abortions. The last speaker talked about the rights of governments to choose. I would emphasise that women in these situations also have the right to choose. If women in a country like mine have that right, then I would also argue that a woman who wishes, because of a variety of different circumstances, to make that choice, then that should be her right. Providing for reproductive health is not a euphemism for abortion services. Women have the right to reliable information and to compassionate counselling.</p>
<p class="contents">We must at all costs avoid being drawn into debates which are only about us reflecting United States domestic policy. The reality is that if we do not receive a positive vote tomorrow, there will be no budget line. We will be guilty of turning our backs on a maternal carnage such as we see in developing countries. Is that the signal we want to send from this Parliament to the suffering women of the developing world?</p>
<p class="contents">Now the European Union – and I emphasise also the governments of the south – needs to do more on maternal mortality, on HIV, on reproductive health and on contraception. North and south need to work together on everything from the country strategy papers which we produce with developing countries to prioritising gender issues and reproductive health and rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say that it is very important that we have an understanding of gender and reproductive rights as a cross-cutting issue. We must invest more resources and interest to ensure that women can bear children in safety and with the freedom to choose if, when and how often to do so.</p>

It is revolting, in fact, that pregnancy and giving birth should be among the principal causes of death and injury among women living in developing countries. Of the 600 000 deaths which occur following a pregnancy, 99% occur in developing countries, a dreadful figure, to which we then need to add the 50 million women who suffer serious complications.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also revolting to find that AIDS and, more generally, sexually-transmitted diseases, affect poor countries much more than developed countries. Consequently, the proposals which have been put forward seem quite derisory as a means of dealing with this situation. Moreover, the failings noted in these proposals are not merely connected with the insufficiency of the funding proposed for the implementation of a health policy for poor countries. Even more serious is our inability to lay the blame at the door of the pharmaceutical trusts which, in order to preserve their profits, are even opposed to the idea of marketing generic medicines. The dictatorship exercised on society by industrial and financial groups, which is unbearable in all areas of society, has drastic consequences in areas involving the health and physical integrity of human beings. In the face of this dictatorship, all these proposals merely serve to illustrate the powerlessness of the European institutions as soon as it is a question of an area which touches the lives of women and men.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless we shall vote for those amendments which are likely to lead to a certain amount of improvement or which at least confirm certain human principles, including the right to contraception and abortion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Therefore, within the framework of a global policy to combat poverty, the aspects relating to sexual and reproductive health demand special attention. Hence the need for a proposed regulation of the type we are debating, in the understanding that, when we talk about the right to sexual and reproductive health, we are talking about the right to health services which ensure safe pregnancy and birth, for both mother and child.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about the right to information and guidance on family planning methods which are safe and acceptable to everyone, the right to an education which teaches people to live their sexuality in a responsible manner and to combat sexually-transmitted diseases, particularly AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">Under no circumstances must this Regulation – and this is what I believe – open the door to the practice of abortion in the developing countries, and this is not for religious or moral reasons and far less for sectarian reasons. It is a question of prioritising the right to life, particularly the lives of the most vulnerable beings, because this right is more important than any other and is the basis and the principle on which all other rights stand.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, within the framework of the fight against poverty, it is very important that the Community commit itself to carrying out actions in the field of sexual and reproductive health in line with the proposals of the Sandbæk report, because these actions are instruments intended to drastically reduce maternal and child mortality and to prevent, as a consequence, the resort to abortion, since they are also instruments intended to protect the right to life and health. And I would hope, Commissioner, that you also share this approach.</p>

His very significant decision to substitute the funding through UNFPA that the Bush Administration wrongly withdrew is a hallmark of his distinguished record as Commissioner for Development.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and Parliament, this week, have been subject to fundamentally misleading lobbying and publicity concerning the purpose of this regulation. For example, this e-mail from one of my constituents in Cambridge accuses us of 'obliging EU Member States to fund abortions', and adds the labels 'mad', 'irrational' and 'politically correct' for good measure!</p>
<p class="contents">As colleagues across the House have made clear, the regulation clearly incorporates the Cairo Agreement that specifically prohibits abortion as a method of family planning. Instead, these people, sadly given succour by some in the House tonight, want to prevent good reproductive health for women in developing countries, where 600 000 entirely preventable deaths of women in childbirth still occur each year. This is also absolutely essential to halt the spread of HIV-AIDS, which currently kills 8 000 people every day.</p>
<p class="contents">This is about saving lives, not about losing them.</p>
<p class="contents">Men as well as women must take responsibility for sexual health. As a man, that is why I joined with other men and women in this House to seek extra money this year for the reproductive health programme, in my role as budget rapporteur. One has to recall that 160 Members denied us the qualified majority, and EUR 6 million was lost. That money would have helped over 2 million women around the world to have safe pregnancy and birth. I hope that tomorrow we will be able to reinstate this funding, subject to the agreement of our budget colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">In April my own partner is expecting our second baby. I hope and pray that it will be a safe birth, knowing, as I do, that in Europe we have access to the best medical facilities, trained staff and health services that minimise the risks to mother and child. I do not see why any mother, anywhere in the world, should not have the right to the same protection.</p>

<p class="contents">I myself spent some time working as a doctor in Guatemala, an impoverished developing country, where I could see how necessary such aid is. Throughout these discussions, I have had in my mind's eye a woman who was one of my patients at the time and who had her eighth child at the age of twenty-four. I believe that we are under an obligation to bring to these women's attention what options are available by way of contraception. We are also, for example, under an obligation to increase the availability of condoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind you, Commissioner, of how Mr Schmid of the Group of the Party of European Socialists proposed – all of two years ago – the establishment in Africa of a factory to manufacture condoms, enabling these to be made available there at low prices. I would ask the Commissioner to reconsider that.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also my belief that ‘contraception and birth control’ is not just an issue of concern to women alone. I do believe that we have to give more support to science in its search for contraceptives for men. An international consortium has submitted an application in this area to the 6th research framework programme, but the Commission has, unfortunately, not considered it yet. One example of why I consider this very important is the medical fact that many women have an intolerance to the contraceptive pill, so alternatives are a matter of necessity, and this is one area where men cannot go on holding back.</p>
<p class="contents">I do believe, though, that we have to make a very clear distinction between the issue of abortion and that of birth control, as well as the other issues discussed in the report. Abortion is a sensitive subject, and rightly so. I do not think it would be a good thing for the European Union to allocate to something like that any of the limited resources we have at our disposal for the support of people in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">When I was, for five years, a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, I constantly heard the Commission saying that there was not enough money. That was why they rejected many projects put before us by NGOs – projects that were not in the least controversial, and which everyone said we should support. As a result, I would have preferred it if this report had expressed, more clearly than it had done, that we support a great number of things – things that Parliament does not regard as controversial – but not abortion. I think Amendment No 53 expresses this very appropriately.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that this report has been successfully focussed on the prevention of unwanted pregnancy and on the provision of real help for women. Above all, I wish to thank Mrs Martens for her great commitment. I would have liked us, however, to have put things in more precise terms – and perhaps tomorrow will find us managing to do that – so that we can indeed be united in our endorsement of this programme and of this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to hear her apologise to this House for the scurrilous lies that she told in the Irish media about this report: claims that EUR 50 million was being taken from Irish fishermen in order to promote abortion in the world; claims that Irish taxpayers' money was going to be used for promoting abortion in the world. They are scurrilous lies that should be retracted. We should have an apology here tonight from Mrs Scallon for promoting these falsehoods.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pro-choice. I believe it is the responsibility of every man and woman to choose the number of children and the spacing of their children, as and when they choose. It is not for me to decide or for Mrs Scallon to decide. It is for each individual to decide. If I came across a woman who was pregnant and drowning, I would not ask her if she was pregnant, an abortionist, or if she would likely have her pregnancy aborted, before I threw her a lifeline. There are 600 000 women this year who will die, who probably have other children, certainly parents and certainly lovers or husbands who want them to live. We are being asked to deny them the right to life.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, we are not giving enough money in this programme to save them all, but at the very least, we have the right and a duty to provide what we propose to provide and not pretend that we are in some way saving lives by opposing this programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The attitude of Mrs Scallon and President Bush is based on heartless, theological hair-splitting which has nothing to do with life. We should stand up and be counted on this issue in this House and make it clear that we are 'for life' and 'for the lives' of the 600 000 women who die every single year.</p>

The opinions within this House may differ, but no one should doubt the sincerity of all present in wishing to offer the best help to women in the poorest countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been made very clear by the contributions tonight, there is just one main problem: some definitions within this regulation are not clear enough. It is in everyone's interest to clarify the meaning of the wording of this very important and much needed regulation for the care of women, for mothers and their children.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to do this to the best of our ability, we should support, in particular, Amendment 53. There is no conflict presented by the wording of this amendment. It is in keeping with the compromise reached and the expressed opinion of the Commission and Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has very often decided in favour of this very same wording. Without any doubt, it protects the Irish Constitutional position and supports the Irish Government, as well as reassuring the political representatives of accession countries and members of least-developed nations who have contacted various members of the European institutions to express their deep concern at the possible interpretation of some terms of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">As we are all aware, the European Union has no legal competence to decide on or to fund abortion in Member States. Nor does it have the legal right to do so in the poorest of countries in the world, but this does not deny women the highest level of medical care to prevent maternal mortality and morbidity. This I absolutely support.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no conflict presented by the wording of this amendment. It will clarify beyond doubt the intentions of this Parliament, the Commission and Council. For these reasons, I would respectfully ask for support for Amendment 53. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The amendments voted by the Committee on Development and Cooperation have received wide support and strengthen and clarify the text of the regulation, without altering its main objectives. The Commission welcomes them.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendments Nos 46 and 47 on the financial proposal, I am not able to commit the Commission formally tonight because the broader discussions on allocations have not yet been concluded. However, I do not see this as something that should lead to a second reading. I am confident that we will find a solution.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The new amendments tabled in plenary – Amendments Nos 48, 49, 50, 51, 52 and 53 - skew the focus and the substance of the regulation and are not acceptable to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Ribeiro e Castro and a few others have remarked that laws are different in Member States and also said something about the competence of the European Union on these matters. We are on very firm ground in what is happening here. We are not discussing abortion policy in European Member States. We are discussing development policy and we are proposing to do what is clearly in line with what has been internationally agreed. This is the purpose of all this. I warn against changing this discussion into something totally different.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Ribeiro e Castro said that Amendment 49 is about clarification. I disagree. It is a change of the substance. We may not have this meeting taking place in full daylight, but I find it light enough in here to make the following remark.</p>
<p class="contents">In the existing text, no support is to be given under this regulation to incentives to encourage sterilisation or abortion. Amendment 49 says: 'no support is to be given under this regulation to sterilisation or abortion, nor to …'. This is not a clarification. This is a change of the substance. A spade should be called a spade and a text should be called a text.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to some of the other remarks made by Mr Ribeiro e Castro, I warn against throwing around quotes which are very difficult to verify. This debate has already had an overdose of that sort of input.</p>
<p class="contents">One strong reason to remain with what the Committee on Development has concluded, as expressed by Mr Corrie and others, with whom I agree, is that it reflects the Cairo consensus - no more and no less. To Mr Ó Neachtain I say that I can subscribe to his observations. They are a precise account of the reality and the formalities of the issue, as stated.</p>
<p class="contents">Anything other than what is now emerging here as the consensus from the Committee on Development and Cooperation represents an unacceptable deviation from Cairo. I advise that we stay on track. When following the international discussion on these issues over the last few years, we have repeatedly seen that proposals or attempts to backtrack from Cairo or to go beyond Cairo in all cases have been futile. That is another good reason for the European Parliament and the European Union to stay on track. I hope that we will be able to stay on track on this issue.</p>

<p class="contents">We should always be mindful of our ability to produce texts which require respect for human rights, inviolability, self-determination and responsibilisation of the individual as a priority. The violent practice of abortion should therefore be excluded as a general means of family planning. A regulation whose objective is to protect health cannot contradict itself and attack life, the supreme good of the individual from the moment of conception.</p>
<p class="contents">Another general consideration is countries’ approach to these instruments, which reflect the responsibility that every State, every community and every individual should feel to protect life. With the help of the donor countries, the governments of the developing countries must provide information, education and appropriate instruments and encourage responsibilisation of the individual, to free people from ignorance, taboos, superstition and the archaic practices which go hand in hand with underdevelopment.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point concerns the issue of the subordination of women to men. The culture of the hierarchy of force must be eliminated once and for all during the Third Millennium. The Third Millennium is characterised by the culture of information and knowledge and, therefore, must provide the conditions for free exchange between minds. Women must be able to dialogue with men without being affected by any form of sexism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
