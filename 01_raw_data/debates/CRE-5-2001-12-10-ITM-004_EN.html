<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Whitehead (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Madam President, today's debate is the culmination of a long process which began in the days of the BSE epidemic. It is in a sense a proposal that comes as much from this House as from the other institutions of the European Union because our two temporary committees of inquiry culminated in the recommendation that there should be a body of this kind. One Commission fell, another came into office accepting that something of this sort should happen and it is that proposal from President Prodi, driven forward by the Commissioner, which we are dealing with today.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, therefore, the work of many hands and if this debate today is considered, calm and, I hope, rational it is because of the extent to which the three sides in the triangle of forces have attempted to come to an agreed conclusion by the time of this second reading debate, in order to expedite the introduction of the new authority itself. There should not be any undue delay. If we can avoid the conciliation stage, we will do so.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still perhaps a few reservations which I shall refer to in a moment, but we have come to a point where we believe we have a consensus in this House. We certainly have a majority in this House and I should like to thank the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs of the other political groups, particularly Mr Bowis, Mrs Paulsen and Mr Staes for the work they have done right through since the original White Paper. I would also like to thank my own researcher, Michelle Smythe, and everyone from the Commission and the Council, under both the Swedish and Belgian presidencies, who have brought this forward. Since Mrs Aelvoet has taken a bit of a pounding today I shall pay tribute to her part in it also.</p>
<p class="contents">We have now agreed on a timetable to get the new authority up and running. To do that there is a series of specific compromises: 16 new amendments which broadly find favour with the Commission – I hope Mr Byrne will be able to indicate that – and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we had to adopt an unusual procedure for one point that remains in some doubt, that is, the site of the new authority. We wanted to set out criteria for the site of the new authority as we believe we should. The Council, however, were not prepared to accept them in the body of the text. But you do not throw away the whole report for that: we have put it into the legislative resolution and we hope that you, Madam President, will be able to set out exactly what our reasoning is. The decision will have to be made on merit and not through the kind of political horsetrading that is currently being whispered about. It would be the worst possible start if this body were sited in an inappropriate place for the worst of reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">We tabled the compromise amendments in order to bring forward the major priorities that this Parliament has always emphasised: firstly, a parliamentary hearing for the proposed executive director of the new authority and a three-month period for Parliament to express its opinion on the candidates for a small and tightly-focused management board. That is the board that will meet in public and will make its opinions equally public so the citizens of Europe can see what it recommends. It will have a role to play in risk analysis, risk communication and risk management, where its advice is appropriate. These are substantial powers. In addition, this legislation gives protection to those who want to report on unsafe practices in the food and feed business. Citizens have a duty to tell the truth and I believe we have guaranteed that.</p>
<p class="contents">If the 16 compromise amendments, and the others already agreed with the presidency, are passed, we can proceed to set up the new EFSA. The problem of BSE, for example, is still with us: cases of it have been notified in two previously clear Member States this week. Everybody knows that food and animal feed have to be safer. The procedures whereby such products come in and out of the European Union have to be open, transparent and, above all, safe. Some of the practices of industrialised farming have threatened us all. Producers and consumers alike have everything to gain from a monitoring authority which protects the interests of all and is beholden to none. On that basis I commend this proposal to the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At that time I had the privilege of writing the report for Parliament with my friend across the floor – Mr Whitehead – acting as shadow. Now I am reciprocating as shadow for his report. My party is not a great party for harmonisation but we are a party for harmony and that is what we have seen in this report and the way it has been dealt with.</p>
<p class="contents">I too wish to play tribute to the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs, also the Commissioner, Mr David Byrne, and – dare I say it in the light of earlier comments –to Magda Aelvoet, the minister. I hope Ms McKenna will not take offence if I give her praise in her absence as she too has played her part in looking for and helping us to find compromises which make sense, which do not betray anybody and which take forward the concept of food safety for the peoples of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an issue which is of considerable importance to people. There is nothing more important than the safety of the food and the drink that they and their families partake of. There is a European dimension to this because, increasingly, not only does food cross boundaries but people cross boundaries. So we need to be certain that the food we eat has been grown in soil we can trust and the fertilisers added to it are known to be safe. The feed that is given to livestock also plays its part in ensuring that the food that ends up in our supermarkets and on our tables merits our confidence. Then we want to make sure that the processing of food is safe and, finally, we want to make sure that when it is stored and retailed, it is still safe for us to take home. Then of course it is up to us.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many critical issues in this report – the title of the food safety authority has been crucial to us. We do not want to see an all-singing, all-dancing bureaucracy – we want an authority which is focused on safety, on the assessment of risk, on giving guidance where appropriate to the managers of risk. An authority that understands that risk can never be eliminated but it can be adequately spotted and dealt with. Science is crucial, so is independence – that is why the siting of this authority is important.</p>
<p class="contents">The pre-conciliation process – if I can call it that – that we have been going through is an example of how to take measures through Parliament and the institutions. At this last stage Parliament has spoken overwhelmingly with one voice. I know the Commission and the Council have listened and I believe they will have benefited because we are working together on this measure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is that we are convinced even now, without this Food Safety Authority, that the food people in the European Union are consuming is safe. So safe, that I am convinced that it is among the safest in the world. However, if we believe that a food safety authority would have advantages and lead to improvements in the European Union, there must be good reasons for that. I would like to name three conditions that I believe need to be met to achieve such improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bowis and Mr Whitehead have already touched on these points. The first is the quality of the experts. It is not acceptable for people the Member States want to get rid of to be sent to this authority as experts and scientists. It is your job, Commissioner, to invite the Member States to send only the cream of the cream. Secondly, to secure improvements we need transparency and openness. Even more than the scientific committees, which have had a high degree of transparency since the BSE crisis, the Authority needs to ensure that it earns the people's trust. That means that it must be open and transparent in its activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, ladies and gentlemen, and Mr Byrne, we need controls. It is also your job, the Commission's job, to convey to the Member States that supervision and control are the most basic tasks of the Member States, something you have criminally neglected in recent years. If we want to carry on guaranteeing safe food, and perhaps even safer food, if we want to win back the people's trust, then we can only do this by meeting these conditions and by tightening up controls. If we do that, the new Food Safety Authority will be a step forward for the European Union. I call on you, Commissioner, to make sure that is the case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Two years is certainly a long time, but I personally thought it would take longer.</p>
<p class="contents">It is incredibly important that we talk about safety, on which we can arrive at a common view. Safety has to be assessed. Openness and public control are more important than anything else in this new legislation. Whatever we say and however we behave, new crises will occur and there will be new scandals. We are going to be presented with new scientific proposals which point in one direction or another and which, rightly or wrongly, will frighten people. The only way to deal with this situation is through complete openness and with total public scrutiny, for people cannot be calmed down simply through publishing decisions. Now, everyone with an interest – consumer and environmental organisations and the media – will immediately be given information, and not only information from a majority of scientists on a panel but also details of minority views. In that way, no one will be able to say that the EU is concealing anything from its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to say that this is all well and good, but that I wonder how things will work out in terms of compliance and control. What is there in terms of a possible system of penalties to be imposed upon those Member States and companies which do not comply with the safety standards? That is one step. It is a large step and also the first. Let us never forget, however, that it must be implemented. Otherwise, it will be merely hot air. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am indeed of the opinion that something good can come out of a crisis situation. We often see this in the food industry too. Crises can lead to headway being made in the legislative field. The Regulation that is before us constitutes one such step forward. I should like to underline a few aspects which were important to my group in particular, and which we have also adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Regulation will ensure that it will no longer be possible for infected food to be exported to third countries, often Third World countries. Secondly, the diversity of food is highlighted. It is also pointed out that traditional products exist, that we should recognise this and that food has a certain cultural role to play. Thirdly, we as Parliament have ensured that we have turned the proposed food authority into a food safety authority, which is quite an achievement for our Parliament. Thanks to Parliament and you, Mr Whitehead, we have been able to play a role and have been able to underline the significance of transparency in this respect. It is indeed true that we need transparency in order to restore consumer confidence. We, as Parliament, have also ensured that we have gained more insight into the make-up of the management board and into the appointment of the executive director. Finally, we have also called for more objective criteria for the location.</p>
<p class="contents">When we came out of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy at second reading, we noticed we had 28 amendments, 28 amendments which the Council struggled to accept at times. We carried out a kind of pre-conciliation exercise, one with which I am delighted, because the rapporteurs, along with the co-rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, made certain that we, as Parliament, were able to take a united stand at the Council, a Council where we heard one voice, where Mrs Aelvoet listened to us, and I am really very pleased about that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We also think that it is right to table a number of those amendments again that have not been incorporated into this common position. Furthermore, we think that these amendments are of such a kind that it should not now take very long at all to find a common solution together with the Council of Ministers and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important amendment from the European Parliament is that which makes it clear that what we are concerned with here is an authority dealing purely with food safety and not with food in general. For us, this clarification is important. It is important to focus specifically upon the safety issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 4 concerns the correspondence between the EU’s food regulations and other international agreements and regulations. Obviously, the EU must cooperate in this area with other parts of the world. However, the trend within the World Trade Organisation, in particular, is in danger of leading to a situation in which we have a series of different conflicts between different systems of regulations. In that case, we think it is incredibly important to assert the right to tougher rules for health and environmental reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 22 relates to the funding of the authority. For us, it is an issue of principle that an authority should be financed from the Budget. It must not be financed by means of fees deducted for its services. That is why Amendment No 22 is important to us.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of amendments relate to openness, and those we naturally support. According to Amendment No 41, board meetings must, as a rule, be public and not held behind closed doors. We think that is incredibly important. We also approve of the proposal that members should be drawn from a broad geographical area.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals we are now discussing have their background in the serious food safety crises within the EU in recent years. Dioxin, BSE and salmonella are just a few of the areas concerned. These scandals are closely linked to heavily industrialised agriculture and to an agricultural policy in which large-scale production and yield have become more important than the environment, animal protection and safe food. If the EU is really to be able to attend to the causes of the problems in this area, reform of the common agricultural policy is needed, above all, so that sustainability and the protection of animals and the environment are put first. Only then shall we really be able to tackle the basis of the food safety problems in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is partly due to the advent of BSE, foot-and-mouth disease in Europe and the chicken dioxin scandal that took place a couple of years ago. Of course the consumer is always right, but on this occasion the European Union legislators have had to redouble their efforts to improve the safety of the food chain in Europe and to restore consumer confidence in food products within the Union. It has not been an easy task. However, the White Paper mentioned by Mr Bowis that the Commission brought forward outlines a raft of directives and regulations that need to be updated and modernised so as to make the food chain in Europe safer.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to commend Mr Byrne, the Commissioner for Consumer Protection and Public Health, for his absolute determination to guarantee that European Union consumers have total confidence in all food products that are sold within the Union. That not only means improving safety standards of production within the Union but also tightening up rules and conditions for the importation of food products into the Union. The key element of this White Paper is the setting up of the food authority, as we discussed today.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important that this authority is up and running as soon as possible, no matter where it is located. This European Food Authority can work with the 15 governments of the Union, in an advisory and preventative capacity, to guarantee that food products from farm to table comply with the highest public health standards. We live in an internal market with free movement of goods, persons, services and capital. Food is an internationally tradable product and it is therefore very important that a coordinated and common approach is taken to promoting food safety in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This is only right and proper in the light of the fact that consumers are criss-crossing the frontiers of the European Union on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="contents">I also support the approach taken by Commissioner Byrne in guaranteeing that all interested parties are given due representation with regard to the implementation of the new directives and regulations under the White Paper on food safety. Groups representing the food industry, farm organisations and consumer interests are all actively involved in the implementation of these directives and regulations. Indeed, as a result of the Amsterdam Treaty the European Parliament has the power of codecision with regard to the implementation of the new directives and regulations in the area of consumer protection and public health. We intend to remain vigilant at all times so as to guarantee that confidence in the European food chain is fully restored, sooner rather than later.</p>
<p class="contents">I commend the rapporteur, Mr Whitehead, and all involved in producing this excellent report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the beginning of 2002, Europe will create its own food safety authority. This new body aims, on the one hand, to meet citizens’ expectations by placing food safety at the top of their list of priorities, on a par with unemployment, and, on the other hand, to provide the European Union with a body that is able to defend and promote the European agricultural model on the international stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Agricultural products are now an integral part of the World Trade Organisation negotiating round. Within the WTO, the Cairns group is opposed to an approach to agriculture that takes into account food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, in order to be successful, the authority will have to resolve the following problems. On the one hand, the composition of the Management Board, since, in order to involve all players from all parts of the food chain, the body will have to ensure a place on the board for representatives of the agricultural world in the same way as consumers, the food industry and distributors.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we remain in favour of a Management Board composed of 16 members, and not of 12 as proposed in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, as regards the definition of functions, who will be responsible for the alert system, for management and for monitoring? This means bringing up the thorny issue of revamping the Rapid Alert System. The role of the French Agency is limited to risk assessment, whilst the Minister for Agriculture is responsible for risk management. The European Agency will have to restrict itself to a monitoring role.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point relates to the potential conflicts with the national agencies. France, Great Britain, Ireland, Belgium and Greece have their own national agencies. Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain are about to create their own. The European Agency will have to fulfil a coordination function, whilst respecting the independence of the national agencies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A new body is being set up – the European Food Safety Authority – and it must be said that this authority, because of the representatives appointed to form its Management Board, will necessarily be dependent on the European Commission, despite its legal title.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us cast our minds back to the unforgivable errors that the European Commission made during the mad cow epidemic. Its priority, at the time, was the creation of the single market, come what may, rather than the safety of food for European consumers. In order to make the European Food Safety Authority more credible in the eyes of Member States’ citizens, it is not enough for its seat to be independent of the European Commission as well as physically distant. The members of the future Management Board of the new body must be monitored by the same citizens, through their representation at the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">It does not seem that the Authority is giving sufficient assurance that it will be independent. It will be subjected to the power of lobbies and to the wishes of the European Commission and therefore, will be independent only of universal suffrage. Furthermore, who can assure us that it will respect the principle of subsidiarity and individual food characteristics? Will it smother small- and medium-sized food businesses with even stricter regulation, that will be tolerated by fewer and fewer citizens? Why call it an ‘Authority’ when it has no legislative power? And lastly, why give it so many resources – EUR 67 million and 339 officials – when it could be equally efficient and less costly if it worked together with the existing national agencies?

We must acknowledge that there was some excellent consultation in the management of this dossier and we must not fall behind with this today.</p>
<p class="contents">Zero risk does not exist and the consequences of a bacteriological problem, whether or not this is linked to terrorism, can be extremely significant for all our citizens. We are well aware that food contamination can affect a large number of people. That is why safety must be at the heart of this system.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not be overcome by panic either, because the European food chain, as a result of the many decisions that we have taken in this Chamber, is certainly one of the safest in the world. However, the shortcomings that have come to light during previous crises compel us to take further measures in the area of food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to be effective and credible, the Authority must bring together the leading scientific experts; it must only undertake risk assessment, as part of the Rapid Alert System, whilst risk management must remain in the public domain. It must also work together with the national agencies. Its intervention must be proportionate to the level of risk, in other words, if there are simply rumours, communication must then be stepped up. If, however, there is a risk, the required precautionary measures must be taken; if there is a danger, then preventative measures are necessary. Lastly, the Authority must be independent and utterly transparent. At the same time, monitoring must be increased and, in the case of a serious offence, penalties must be substantial as well as effective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, 2 000 people worldwide die every year of salmonella poisoning. In the United States alone, 9 000 people die each year of microbe-related food poisoning. These are worrying statistics, and we are not even talking about other food-related illnesses. With the general principles of food law, we are laying new foundations for safe food and we will be building on those in the next few months and years. We must work on a system which fills consumers with confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Emotions sometimes run high where food is concerned, beef being a recent European example of this. Politicians cannot and must not ignore these emotions, but we must consider the facts. That is where the European Food Authority comes into its own: it must be a beacon of objectivity. The European Food Authority must join forces with national authorities, but we must ensure that it is not rendered powerless from the word go and that it is headed by an approachable front man who does not need to fight to impose his authority but who embodies quality and authority.

The European Food Safety Authority, an essential food safety mechanism serving the consumers and the political authorities of Europe alike, is essential to the performance of the functions that it will be assigned.</p>
<p class="contents">Its first task is to investigate all the failings that led to the recent food safety crises, both the crises in the food business, such as chicken dioxins, food and mouth disease, trafficking in veterinary products, the excessive use of vaccines and tranquillisers on animals and also the original BSE crisis. I would point out that even Finland now has its first case of mad cow disease. That is the first point I would like to make. My second point is that it is the agency that must also stop the uncontrolled spread of contaminating transgenic products that are even infesting traditional cereal crops, since consumers are rejecting transgenic crops, whose only virtues are commercial. Therefore, this agency must also, other than resolving all those problems, ensure food safety from the farm to the fork. In order to do so, the Food Safety Authority must apply, from the beginning of 2002, the principles of transparency and monitoring that my fellow Members have already mentioned. The failings in the area of hygiene as being the sole criterion, which has been highlighted in the many crises that we have listed, particularly in animal feed, shows that the agency must give advice on good practice, on labelling, on products that have been produced locally, that contain dairy products, instead of dealing with industrial standards alone, which do not prevent salmonella, listeria or any of the more distressing epidemics.</p>
<p class="contents">Its main function is therefore to coordinate the national agencies, and to do so, the agency must be independent and transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I have doubts regarding Amendment No 34, which deals with the appointment procedure to the Management Board, a process that seems hazy at best, since it refers to the meritocracy of the Management Board. So what exactly does meritocracy mean in an agency that should be composed of experts in the relevant scientific fields? The Management Board has a political and managerial role. I very much fear that this meritocracy is simply a way of masking the pressure exerted by large food corporations. I hope that the Commissioner will be able to reassure me on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">As for where the agency will be based, we believe this is a side issue…</p>

This does not contribute towards safer food or consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point of concern is our keenness to impose our strict standards on the rest of the world. In this respect, I have to say that other parts of the world often do not have the luxury of aiming for the highest possible safety standards for food. Their priority is to collect sufficient food to survive. Needless to say, we should not simply export food which fails to meet our safety standards to those countries. But in those cases where export increases food safety in the countries concerned, export of this kind must be allowed. In those cases, the automatic destruction of batches should not be an option.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the appointment of the management board is concerned, I do agree with the compromise that has been struck with the Council. It is indeed unwise to enlarge this management board any further, because this could compromise its decisiveness. Furthermore, I am opposed to organising hearings in the European Parliament prior to appointing the members of the management board. This applies even more to the executive director. It would be wise for the European Parliament to move further away from the executive tasks of the future European Food Safety Authority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know how important it is that this decision is made. Several years have already passed since the beginning of this procedure; this proposal has been on the table since 1999, at least, so it is high time that the decision is taken. I feel that, in tabling a second time the amendment which was voted upon at first reading some months ago, Parliament is trying to make two statements, which you, Commissioner, must convey to the governments. The first is that this is a matter covered by the codecision procedure and so Parliament’s opinion on the criteria to be put to the vote tomorrow should also be taken into consideration when it comes to deciding the site of the authority.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that one of the approaches taken at Laeken will be horse trading – you can appoint the Chair of the Convention if I can choose the site of the Authority, and you can have the Police College – but I feel, rather, that all these decisions need to be taken on the basis of certain criteria which are strictly related to the interests of the institution we are attempting to create. Therefore, when Parliament points out that the site chosen for the Authority should have a longstanding tradition in food safety and food safety research in general, this is clearly a criterion whose importance must be stressed. When we talk about a good scientific infrastructure and facilities in the field of food safety, you, Commissioner, and the Commission must stress the importance of this criterion. When we say that it has to be easily accessible in terms of communications and have efficient and rapid transport connections; when we say that it has to have connections with those services that deal with<span class="bold"> </span>public health and consumer protection issues; of course it springs to my mind that the Joint Research Centre, which employs thousands of European researchers, is situated in Ispra, and therefore, my opinion can only be that these criteria apply to one candidate city alone: Parma, in Italy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that this regulation and this legal basis will, with the measures that follow, help to improve food safety in the European Union, and will establish the general principles of the new food law. With reference to general food law, I would like to mention, in particular, that this represents a real success in developing the principle of a seamless improvement in the food chain from farmer to consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">A key aspect of the principles set out here remains the traceability of products. I believe that we have accordingly established two significant new principles and requirements for improving food safety. The centrepiece of the regulation is the creation of the European Food Authority, or, as it is designated in the amendment, the ‘European Food Safety Authority’.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to spend too much time on definitions here. What I consider most important is the fact that the framework conditions have been created for this Authority. The first of these is adequate financial provision. It seems to me that this has not so far been achieved to the extent we might have wished, and the same applies to conditions governing communication between the Authority and the various authorities in the Member States. Appropriate arrangements have not yet been set up in the Member States, and there is still a lot to be done in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the openness of the authority, I believe that this House's amendment is certainly correct, but we also have to guarantee that in certain circumstances the Authority can also meet behind closed doors. An important issue, as many others have already said, is the location of the Authority, and if the Council rejects our proposals, it seems to me that it must intend to locate the Authority in such a way that our requirements and conditions cannot be met. We cannot let such a situation prevail, nor can we accept it. The Council must finally give in on this and select a location that will facilitate communication with the Commission, Parliament and the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are, of course, minor points which require further attention, and I would mention monitoring as one of them. Who authorises this monitoring? But also, who will be organising, inspecting and running this food safety authority? This should not be sixteen, but twelve, for we need independence.</p>
<p class="contents">What do we actually mean by food safety? We mean that in the internal market, we will ensure that we can guarantee food safety everywhere. That not only includes Europe’s fifteen Member States, but also all the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a few concerns in this respect. Not because food in the acceding countries would not be safe, that is not what I am saying, but I am worried about the lack of good networks in the new Member States that could carry out inspections and instil consumer confidence. Last Thursday, there was a meeting involving experts from the acceding countries who alerted us to the lack of such a structure. That is one side of the coin. Inspection, also from the government, to ensure that the process runs smoothly. There is also a flip side, namely the lack of a civil society. That means a lack of well-trained consumer organisations that are independent and that could encourage the government at any time to pursue the policy effectively. The same also applies to product organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">I wonder if the Commissioner would be willing to give us some information on that score, enabling us to see what we can do about this in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While the European food chain remains one of the safest in the world, recent scandals have damaged our consumers' confidence in the food we eat and the methods we use to produce it. The public has lost confidence in the national and European food safety systems after the scandals and scares with beef, E.coli, lysteria, salmonella, dioxins, eggs, poultry, milk and hormones. The list goes on. The public wants to be reassured that the road from farm to market, to the supermarket, to the oven, fridge and table is as safe as can be reasonably expected. They want safety assessment that is neither secretive, behind the closed front door of the Commission, nor tainted by producer or pressure-group interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the beginning of your tenure, Commissioner Byrne, you have responded to the needs of the consumers of Europe by making every effort to improve the safety of the food chain. This proposal is one of key importance for consumer protection in the European Union. The institutions of the Union have come together to set out the principles of food law with a new authority which can safeguard the food we eat and the way it is produced.</p>
<p class="contents">I commend the rapporteur, Mr Whitehead, and the shadow rapporteur, Mr Bowis, for a job well done throughout the discussion in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. The result of their consensual approach has been to strengthen and unify the voice of the European Parliament on the key issue at stake. I would ask the Commission and the Council to listen to this united voice and to adopt 'European Food Safety Authority' as the title of the institution. Keeping the word 'safety' in the title of the authority will give a clear signal to consumers as to its purpose and goals. I also firmly believe that if the authority is to have the confidence and backing of the people of Europe, it is imperative that it operates and communicates in a wholly transparent and independent manner, dedicated to the assessment of food-safety risk.</p>
<p class="contents">Risk communication will also be a key element. One has only to look at the BSE inquiry in the UK and the Philips report which stated that breakdown in risk communication was a major factor in exacerbating the crisis there.</p>

As far as the European Food Safety Authority is concerned, I feel that the European Parliament has played a very major role: a great deal was achieved between first and second readings and, in my opinion, tomorrow’s vote will produce an extremely important report for, indeed, at this point, there is no longer any excuse for procrastination. We will have an instrument which will help us to keep a constant check on food safety in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards this major work, achieved through the efforts of both the rapporteur and the committee responsible, there are still a number of small points which, I feel, will have to be specified: for example, it is extremely important that the management board should include a representative from the agricultural sector because the fact that we are dealing with a process means that all the sectors need to be represented.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still a number of gaps as regards the procedures. We are definitely going to use operators from the food sector and people and companies specialised in all the parts of the food chain in order to ensure that the necessary information flow banishes all fears from the tables of our fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">One last question is that of the site. An amendment has been tabled seeking to ensure that the locations of the sites of the Commission and the other institutions do not affect the choice of site. The site should be in a place which has a longstanding tradition in food safety and which has scientific infrastructure and substantial resources in the field of safety. Of course, I must put in a word for Parma, for Parma is one of the most important places in the Italian agrifoods system. It is my genuine hope that the Laeken Council will take this candidate into due consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should act as a transparently functioning scientific reference point for the Commission, Parliament and the Member States, but it should also be open for producers and consumers. Advice, information and risk communications for consumers can help to increase our confidence in the food we eat. Food safety is a fundamental requirement for consumers who want to eat healthily and we must take responsibility for that here.</p>
<p class="contents">The food scandals over the past few years have demonstrated that we need, in particular, consistent implementation of directives and on-the-spot controls on food and animal feed. If we are to achieve seamless traceability of production, it is essential to optimise the way we link the scientific facilities of this Authority with the control authorities in the Member States. This will ensure safety in the whole chain from producer to consumer. And imported food must be just as safe as food produced in the EU. This safety can be guaranteed by imposing strict controls on food imports at the EU's present external borders.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel to this, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe need to establish properly functioning systems for monitoring the safety of food and animal feed before accession. However, one important problem will not be solved by the regulation before us today, and that is the dividing line between food and medical products. We need to minimise the grey area between these two product categories, food and medical products, as far as possible. If we do not succeed in this, the result will be new demarcation problems and legal uncertainty. That is why it is a matter of urgent necessity for us to make sure that when legislation on medical products is reviewed, an unambiguous EU-wide definition of food and medical products is established, so that there is a clear dividing line, because we can only improve safety for the consumer if we establish a clear definition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He particularly suggested the importance of establishing a food safety authority during that period also. He said that it was important that the consumers of the European Union had the same confidence in such an institution as US consumers have in their Food and Drugs Administration. I hope that the new authority can deliver on this for our consumers and for our citizens. I should like to take this opportunity to thank President Prodi for his ongoing support during our work to make his idea a concrete reality.</p>
<p class="contents">The wide scope of the general food law covering all aspects of the food and feed production chain that may have a direct or indirect impact on the safety of food has been maintained throughout the first and second readings. The Commission welcomes this. We also underline the importance of the wide remit which has been retained for the work of the European Food Safety Authority. It is important that the food authority builds a comprehensive overview of the entire chain. This should include aspects of animal health and welfare, animal feed safety and plant health, in particular at the primary production level. Given our recent food safety problems, it would have been unthinkable to have a food authority that did not cover such matters.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission supports Amendment No 1 which proposes that the authority be called the European Food Safety Authority, while ensuring that the broad remit, which is so important, is not affected. The Commission can support Amendments Nos 29 to 44 by Mr Whitehead, Mr Bowis, Mrs Paulsen and Mr Staes. These replace Amendments Nos 2 to 6, 9, 11, 12, 15, 17, 18, 20, 25 and 27, which I do not support. I can also accept Amendments Nos 7, 10, 13, 14, 16, 19, 21 and 26. Many of these add clarity to the text or enhance the transparency of the development of food law or the procedures of the European Food Safety Authority. I also welcome Amendments Nos 22, 23 and 24 which adjust the text to ensure that the correct budgetary procedures are in place and that arrangements for third countries, notably EFTA countries, are appropriate and in line with normal procedures for agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 8 which would allow unsafe food and feed to be exported from the Community to the original supplier in a third country without any constraints or controls. This is clearly an unacceptable practice that I am not willing to support. Rejected food or feed could end up being used either in a third country or being shipped back to the EU and that would constitute a risk to food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">From experience, the Commission knows that such practices are also potentially open to fraud and black market abuse. I do not support Amendment No 28 which refers to the selection procedure for the seat, as well as defining the selection criteria. However, I note that Parliament is also proposing another approach. This involves adopting a resolution to the report which calls upon the Council to consider certain criteria in its selection of the authority's seat.</p>
<p class="contents">This House is aware that I believe strongly that the authority's seat should be chosen on rational and operational criteria that will facilitate the smooth working of the EFSA. For these reasons I can support the principles expressed in the resolution. I also support the joint declaration from the Commission, Council and Parliament concerning the members of the management board of the authority. I believe that Amendment No 37 on the board's size, the selection process and membership criteria achieves the right balance between the different views expressed at first reading by the three institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to say that since I took up office as Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, I have made it clear that the establishment of the European Food Safety Authority was a top priority. Community measures which protect the safety of the food supply require a sound scientific basis and the authority will provide this. The authority is designed to be Europe's automatic first port of call on scientific matters relating to the safety of our food supply.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are taking an important step towards the establishment of the authority, towards giving the European consumer the safest food supply in the world, which is our ultimate goal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mr Whitehead, his team and Parliamentary colleagues who have worked closely with him on the amendments at second reading, and also Mr Bowis, Mrs Paulsen and Mr Staes. I want to thank you for the close working relationship that existed between all of us – not just between our two great institutions, but also on a personal level between myself and all four of you. I discussed these issues with each of you at some stage over the last few months. In addition, I would like to thank the Council, both the Swedish and Belgian presidencies, and also the Minister Magda Aelvoet, who put her own shoulder to the wheel on this issue on a number of occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">I also thank the people in my own Commission who worked with me so assiduously, so carefully and so hard.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only do I appreciate the excellent work that has been done, but I would like to thank all those involved for the speed with which this complex proposal has been dealt with. The spirit of collaboration with which the three great institutions have approached this file has been admirable. It is clear from the amendments on which Parliament will vote that compromises have been sought which should enable the regulation to be adopted without a time-wasting conciliation process. This will facilitate the establishment of the European Food Safety Authority early next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
