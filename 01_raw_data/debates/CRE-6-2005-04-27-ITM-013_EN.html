<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Franco Frattini,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, allow me first of all to thank the rapporteur for his report and for his overall support for the Commission’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The origins of this proposal relate to a two-fold observation. On the one hand, reciprocity is an essential principle when considering visas. On the other hand, the mechanism laid down in Regulation 539/2001 to ensure respect for reciprocity is unsuitable, essentially on account of its inflexible and automatic nature. As a result, the mechanism has not been used in more than three years, in fact not since the Regulation entered into force, even though situations of non-reciprocity continued with regard to old Member States and the number of cases of non-reciprocity increased at a remarkable rate with the arrival of the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has therefore proposed a more flexible and more realistic mechanism, which is more credible and effective as a consequence. Every situation of non-reciprocity will be the subject of notification. The Commission will play an active role with regard to third countries that enforce visa requirements. It will draft a report to Council on the situation of non-reciprocity thus created and, if necessary, it will propose the reintroduction of the visa requirement for citizens of the third countries concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments proposed by Mr Lax pursue three different objectives. The first objective is to extend the mechanism to a set of situations that do not exclusively relate to visa exemptions, but also to the conditions for issuing visas. This extension stumbles at the obstacle of the Regulation’s legal basis. Furthermore, in seeking to incorporate a whole series of issues which are in reality of lesser importance, it runs the risk of weakening the reciprocity mechanism, which must remain focused on an essential issue, identified as such by the citizens, namely the continued visa requirement by third countries that are themselves exempt from this requirement by our Member States. The Hague Programme confirms that therein lies an issue to be resolved as a matter of priority.</p>
<p class="contents">The second objective is to prevent situations of non-reciprocity from continuing indefinitely, and to include the possibility of reacting by means of measures in the field of external relations. I am anxious to point out to the rapporteur that I share the general approach of this amendment and I must also tell you that the political orientation that emerged at the JAI Council of 24 February takes the same line. I cannot, however, accept the binding of the Commission’s power of initiative as far as proposing provisional measures is concerned, nor, for reasons of legal basis, the extending of the Commission’s right of initiative within the present contexts to proposals for measures relating to areas other than that of visa policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally comes the third objective: to include the European Parliament in every stage of the process. The necessary transparency must of course be ensured, but the reciprocity mechanism must remain a flexible instrument which can be accessed quickly, and which – and this is the key point – must allow provisional measures. The temporary restoration of the visa requirement for third countries is, in actual fact, situated in a plan other than the transfer of a third country to a list of countries subject to the visa requirement, which is annexed to Regulation 539/2001. A transfer of this type consists of an amendment to the Regulation and as such, it is of course decided by the Council, upon consultation of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with a strengthened reciprocity mechanism, the Commission will be equipped to respond to the formal invitation of the European Council of 4-5 November: to continue with our efforts to ensure that, as soon as possible, citizens of every Member State can travel without a visa, for short journeys, to all of the countries whose citizens undertake visa-free travel within the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As we have just heard, enlargement of the European Union has highlighted the issue of the EU’s visa policy in a new way. Citizens of quite a few of the new Member States require visas to travel to the United States, in spite of the fact that American citizens do not need visas to travel to the new Member States. In these cases, there is a breach of reciprocity between the countries. It is easy to understand why people assume that the EU should make vigorous efforts to promote freedom of movement, especially since visa policy is harmonised and falls completely within the Commission’s area of competence. The Commission should therefore act as an ice-breaker.</p>
<p class="contents">A few months ago, Poland’s former President, Lech Walesa, spent the night in a tent outside the White House in Washington in protest against the American visa requirement – a good example of just how loaded the issue is. The EU has a weapon for cases such as this, namely the reciprocity mechanism. For example, Poland and Greece can issue a notification to the Commission to the effect that, in their cases, reciprocity is not being respected by the United States. Finland can do the same in connection with Venezuela, etc. A notification should lead to the whole of the EU introducing a visa requirement for citizens of the third country concerned, but the mechanism has not been used even once because the consequences have been regarded as too far-reaching and difficult to deal with.</p>
<p class="contents">My report, which has been approved by the committee responsible, proposes that the Commission should have a wider range of tools at its disposal. The EU should have recourse to other sanctions and not just automatically introduce a visa requirement. The report gives the individual Member States three months – a longer period than that proposed by the Commission – in which to negotiate with the third country. Moreover, I propose more stringency once the Commission has taken over the matter. It must not be possible to delay decisions concerning sanctions. Citizens of the Member State concerned must have a guarantee that their cases will be referred to the highest level and that this will result in a decision. A very broad majority of the committee was in favour of this policy. A number of MEPs preferred the present mechanism, however, and considered that it would make for a better result. I myself believe that the report’s recommendations will lead to greater efficiency and better results, strengthen the Commission’s negotiating position in respect of third countries and, through the European Parliament’s involvement, give people more insight into the process.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also has a new element, and one that I believe the Commission and the Council should ponder carefully. There are countless cases, mainly at the EU’s eastern border, in which a third country has, with very little warning, tightened up the conditions for issuing visas. There are examples of travellers being required to have travel insurances with only Russian insurance companies. Lithuanian motorists have been required to have special motor insurances in order to be able to drive over to Kaliningrad, and they have had to register with the local authorities within three days. In the same week that a shipping company was to begin operating ferries to Saint Petersburg, the visa rules were altered, with the result that the shipping company had to withdraw the service. Our students at Russian universities are not automatically given a visa for a year, and anyone who has his or her visa stolen ends up on an exorbitantly expensive bureaucratic merry-go-round. To give just one example: even small children have to present the results of an HIV test in order to obtain a Russian long-term visa.</p>
<p class="contents">From a Brussels perspective, these issues may appear trivial, but they cause a lot of inconvenience and financial losses for those affected. A very large majority of the committee believed that the Member States should be able to refer such cases to the Commission if the requirements introduced led to substantial limitations upon people’s opportunities to travel. In actual fact, these cases almost always involve a lack of reciprocity. Because the EU has to operate in the interests of our citizens, it is, as Commissioner Frattini asserts, extremely important that these problems be taken seriously, even though they may appear less serious than the main issue of whether or not there is a visa requirement.</p>
<p class="contents">When Parliament – presumably with a clear majority – now approves the report, this will be a clear signal to the Commission and the Council of Ministers to begin outlining a mechanism that takes account of people’s everyday needs when there are visa requirements. My report contains a proposal that may serve as a point of departure. If this matter had been brought to our attention at the beginning of the year, the codecision procedure would have applied. In spite of the fact that the consultation procedure is now being applied, the Council and the Commission have cause to ponder the significance of the fact that account is being taken of Parliament’s amendment. What is also important is that the Commission quickly initiate a review of the consular instructions so that the common visa rules are applied in the same way in all the Member States. The furore surrounding Germany’s Foreign Minister, Joschka Fischer, emphasises the need for this.</p>
<p class="contents">In saying that, I still wish to thank all those who have helped with the work, including my fellow MEPs and the Commission’s and Parliament’s officials. I am looking forward to the debate that is now to follow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barbara Kudrycka, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE-DE Group</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(PL)</span> Mr President, the reciprocity mechanism that has applied to date under the European Union’s visa policy meant that extremely harsh sanctions could be imposed on third countries if a country reported that the mandatory use of visas was placing them at a disadvantage. On 7 July 2004, after the ten new Member States had joined the EU, the Commission relaxed the rules contained in this regulation in such a way as to do away with the reciprocity mechanism that had featured in the draft regulation. This resulted in an absurd situation whereby 9 of the 10 new Member States were forced to accept citizens of third countries, for example the USA, without visas, whilst citizens of the Member States in question needed visas to travel to these third countries. I believe that Mr Lax has drafted what is, on the whole, an excellent report, but although this report introduces a number of additional procedures and deadlines that can be enforced by diplomatic means, it does not oblige the Council or the Commission to impose more stringent sanctions. The report leaves it up to the Commission to decide whether to introduce mandatory visas for the citizens of a third country or to impose other, much less effective, measures. In my opinion, allowing the Commission to decide in this way shows a lack of resolve, and would mean inadequate protection for the citizens of the new Member States. Such an approach would send out a clear signal that mutual solidarity between EU Member States and towards third countries has been thin on the ground since the accession of the new Member States. Since the latter joined the EU, dual standards have been applied, with one mechanism for the 15 old Member States and another, in which solidarity is rather less apparent, for the EU of 25. The end result of this is that the difference in status between the citizens of the new and the old EU has become even more pronounced, as citizens of the new Member States are subject to additional restrictions when travelling outside the EU. In view of all this, I find it astonishing that people can talk of a new concept of European citizenship, when some of the EU’s citizens will enjoy entirely different rights and duties to the rest, who are regarded as less worthy.</p>
<p class="contents">Seen from the new Member States’ point of view, the costs of enlargement have outweighed the benefits by far. We were obliged to bring our legislation into line with the EU’s visa policy, which proved extremely expensive, and to introduce visas for our eastern neighbours. The benefits we have derived, however, have been few and far between. We are still unable to issue Schengen visas, and we cannot count on the EU’s help as far as visa reciprocity is concerned. Furthermore, the EU Member States demanding that we implement the common visa policy are the very ones that are experiencing problems with the implementation of this policy, for example Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Frattini, I should like to make it known that if the amended mechanism comes into force, we will insist on the Commission discharging the duties incumbent upon it. I should also like to receive a clear answer to the question of whether we can expect the Commission to present an action plan setting out clearly defined deadlines for the achievement of objectives relating to the abolition of visas for travel into the USA, and using the Schengen assessments of the new Member States as a frame of reference. This would be in the vital interests of all the citizens of the new Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Parliament is about to establish its position on a crucial issue: the reciprocity mechanism on visas. Behind the dryness of technical terms lies, in fact, a very vital reality: that of giving substance to, and advancing, in a tangible and positive way, cooperation between Member States, in the face of the complex relations of an enlarged Union with third countries on the subject of visas.</p>
<p class="contents">We are dealing here with something that lies at the heart of what constitutes the richness of Europe, namely respect for the law in all its forms in rediscovered peace and harmony. We are attempting to build a harmonious space between Europe and the rest of the world, where borders are not walls rising up between one party and another, dividing people and nations. We must ensure that Europe is a recognised space, where it is possible to come and go without interference, on good terms with third countries near or far. It is also an act of confidence towards our 420 million citizens. It has, furthermore, become necessary, in moving in this direction, to completely review a method that favours a too inflexible approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the report that I call upon you to approve takes a fresh look at the amendments required for inclusion in the Regulation in force since 2001. In this context, I express my full interest in the principle of pushing aside the systematisation of sanctions currently implemented in the event of a lapse from one side or the other, between the European Union and the third countries in question. These reprisals often arise, either from a technical, or even an administrative, issue, or from inappropriate political decisions, which diplomatic efforts must crucially seek to resolve in the first instance. In its current state, reciprocity of sanctions is neither desirable nor appropriate as a response to often complex issues occurring on a day-to-day basis. In the last resort, in fact, it is our citizens who pay a high price for it by not being allowed to travel freely, not to mention the very costly inconvenience that that causes. That is why, in accordance with a sensibly drafted plan, a forum for discussion corner needs to be created, where Parliament has its full place.</p>
<p class="contents">Our legitimacy as elected representatives of the citizens is also at the heart of this report that, in the course of the work in committee, has attracted a very large consensus on the new method for consideration. In particular, we must succeed in guaranteeing all European citizens free, unimpeded movement outside the borders of the Union. Parliament must, as a consequence, be closely involved in this process, as it is clearly the legitimate guarantor of transparency in assuming the rightful democratic responsibility it has been accorded by its electorate. This in no way reduces the prerogatives of the Commission, whose role emerges very noticeably strengthened so that it may appear a credible negotiator to the third countries concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, that is why I call upon you to vote in favour of this text tomorrow. It represents a successful combination of the roles of the European legislative and executive powers, which are united in the service of the citizens and the project we hold dear: that of building a solid European Union upon the values of freedom, security and justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This alone prompts us to consider renewing and amending it. On the one hand, the system was too rigid; on the other hand, it has not been used, because it has not substantively violated any Member State’s interest. However, things have considerably changed with the enlargement. The reciprocity mechanism is not applied in the case of nineteen countries. My colleagues have mentioned the United States, but there are other countries as well, including Canada, Australia and New Zealand, among others, where reciprocity is not applied.</p>
<p class="contents">Discrimination between EU citizens is simply unacceptable. The basis for this mechanism – as well as the whole of the EU – is solidarity, but this solidarity has not worked so far. We hope that adopting the new regulation will contribute to a more efficient application of solidarity. If you talk to citizens of the new Member States, and I do not mean politicians, as they are not really the ones affected by this problem, but ordinary citizens, you will learn what an administrative and financial burden it is and how much time and energy is wasted in the process of obtaining a US visa – and that is if the applicant is lucky. There are thousands of cases when people are turned down without any substantive reason, their cases are simply rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">It is high time the Commission acted firmly in the name of the Community on the basis of solidarity between the Member States and I hope that Mr Frattini will seize this opportunity and take appropriate measures. This report serves as a timely basis for it. I would like to congratulate Mr Lax on his excellent report and I would like to highlight three of its essential proposals that must be adopted. It proposes an increase in the notification period from 10 to 90 days to allow for direct negotiations between the individual Member States, but after 90 days, the reciprocity mechanism must come into effect. It is also important that it draws Parliament into this process not only because it emphasises the authority and importance of Parliament, but it also improves democratic transparency. Another important point is that it not only talks about visa obligations, but also of any kind of procedure that becomes an obstacle to free movement. We hope that with the adoption of the new mechanism and its amendments, the Commission will use its full authority in cases where the fundamental interests of the Member States are violated and today, the basic interests of the nine new Member States are violated, and we hope that the Commission will complete successful negotiations with regard to this new resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is needed is a mechanism designed to ensure that European citizens do not have to obtain a visa in order to enter those third countries whose nationals do not require a visa to enter EU territory. A number of third countries, however, require visas from EU citizens, and this runs counter to the principle of reciprocity. The existing mechanism has not been invoked since it was set up in 2001 and Mr Frattini has rightly acknowledged that it suffers from being too rigid and unworkable. Apart from the fact that the mechanism can only be invoked if requested by a victim Member State, the almost automatic nature of reinstating the visa requirement has had a discouraging effect; externally, because of the high risk of causing a crisis in relations with third countries, and, internally, because of the lack of solidarity if the Council blocks the process. Victim Member States, such as my country, Portugal, have always held back from using it.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation has deteriorated since the enlargement. It has already been mentioned that, for example, the United States requires a visa of nine of the ten new Member States and Canada seven. Consequently, we agree that there needs to be a more flexible mechanism in order to ensure greater interoperability and more effective implementation, thereby enhancing solidarity between the Member States. The Commission will also have a crucial role based on its competence in the area of visas.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence my support for this proposal and for the proposals made by the rapporteur, Mr Lax, whom I congratulate on his excellent work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should merely like to draw the House’s attention to an issue addressed by Mrs Kudrycka, and which Mr Lax in fact also mentioned a short while ago. There is a risk that the various Member States and their citizens will not be treated equally, particularly with regard to the granting of visas to enter the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">In principle, proposals to award the Commission and the Council powers in this field are an eminently good idea. At the same time, however, the Member States’ competences should also be extended somewhat, as otherwise they are likely to feel hard done by. I should like to reiterate a point made by a number of other speakers, namely that this is one of the many instances, and indeed perhaps the most important, where we should invoke a founding principle of the European Union. I refer to the principle of solidarity and equal treatment for all Member States and their citizens. After all, the latter are all citizens of the European Union, and as such on an equal footing with each other. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has its roots in the tradition of mutual respect and equal treatment for citizens of different countries. Until 1 May 2004, this was an obvious principle for the old Member States and was not open to question. After the 10 new Member States joined the EU, however, people’s attitudes towards this principle suddenly began to change. They began to practice <span class="italic">realpolitik</span>, which essentially means watering down one’s principles so that they correspond to reality, rather than changing reality so that it fits one’s principles. In my opinion, the proposal for a Council Regulation amending the Regulation on the reciprocity mechanism is a further example of <span class="italic">realpolitik</span>. These amendments are unacceptable to Polish citizens for a number of reasons. Firstly, Poles have always regarded the lack of reciprocity in visa arrangements with certain countries, in particular the United States, as unfair. Secondly, they had every right to expect that when we joined the European Union, which is a community of nations, this community would take on some of the responsibility for defending Poland’s interests, in line with the principle of subsidiarity in its broadest sense. Once again, however, their expectations were dashed, and the musketeers’ magnificent cry of ‘one for all and all for one’, something I am sure we have all heard before, was consigned to the realms of fiction. This is another reason why I cannot vote in favour of this report, even though, or perhaps precisely because, I hold both Polish and American citizenship. On a loosely related note, I cannot help but wonder what has happened to the integrity of the European Union’s policy. I would ask the Commissioner and the President how the international European Community can be expected to wield any power on the international scene if we make such far-reaching concessions in a matter such as this, which appears to be quite straightforward.</p>

<p class="contents">The Commission is fully aware that the issue faced today is a real issue for citizens, and that it is an issue leading to wasted time, expense and, above all, a sense of injustice. It is a political matter that we take very seriously and the Commission will certainly take into account the decisions made by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We are convinced that what is needed is speed and effectiveness. You are aware that if this initiative is approved, as I hope it will be, and after the Member States have been notified, the matter will pass automatically to the Commission for negotiation, with greater speed and effectiveness than at present. The principle of solidarity will be implemented and this too is an important political point. As Mr Coelho has so ably stated, political and diplomatic responses are needed, and that is the road that the Commission intends to follow.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that we have already established relations and contacts at a political level precisely with the non-EU countries that you have mentioned – the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand – in order to arrive at a system that will guarantee all Member States, whether old or new, free movement without a visa. We will propose concrete action, as has been requested, in addition to firm deadlines. Furthermore, we are making efforts for every new Member State to join the Schengen area by 2007. You are aware that evaluation on a case-by-case basis will be necessary, but we are striving to help all the new Member States to be in a position by then to join a European area without internal borders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
