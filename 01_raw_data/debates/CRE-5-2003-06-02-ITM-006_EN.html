The attempt has been made to persuade us that this statute was about nothing more than reforming the reimbursement of travel costs, that it was about money and nothing else. A statute dealing only with money, with its reimbursement, and with costs, is not, though, the sort of statute that the European Parliament needs at the present time.</p>
<p class="contents">We were told that primary legislation would run aground on the cliffs of the Council, and that our ideas on tax law would drag us down to the depths of the ocean. Now, if I may pick out these as examples, I think that we have good arguments on our side. The two problems that remain to be resolved are taxes and primary law, and – as far as taxes are concerned – the Council thinks it can leave it to each individual Member State to decide whether or not it wants to levy an additional national tax. It so happens that, in 2000, the three legal services – those of Parliament, the Council, and the Commission – met to discuss this issue. The minutes of their deliberations record their conclusion that they could find no justification for a derogation for a Member State, and then they continue in the following terms: </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is obvious that we cannot go along with this!</p>
<p class="contents">There is a similar situation as regards primary law. Why is it that this House is in this difficult position? It is because, in 1976, when the Act concerning the election of the Members of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage was introduced, the Council fought shy of harmonising the general conditions applicable to the exercise of the mandate. It found that too much of a hot potato. That is why the European Parliament retained the structure of a parliamentary assembly even after it started to be directly elected, a structure it retains to this day. The object of this statute is to break down this parliamentary assembly-style structure and for us to become a real Parliament. That is what the Statute is for!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The fundamental issue is of whether this European Community is a real community or an international organisation. If it were merely an international organisation, then the Council would indeed have the prerogative as regards Members’ privileges and immunities. The question as to whether or not we should now regulate MEPs’ privileges and immunities boils down to the question of whether this European Community is a community or an international organisation, of whether we are a parliamentary assembly or a parliament worthy of the name. That is what it is about!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The rules we have now date back to 1965, when the Protocol was introduced. In that year, Charles de Gaulle beat Mitterrand to win the French presidential elections, and it was in that year that the first contraceptive pill was put on the market.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">And now the Council – it is apparently the Council, although I am unsure, as it used to be only the Permanent Representatives who dealt with these matters – is trying to tell us that it is these rules by which Parliament should continue to be governed in the future, almost a quarter of a century after it was first directly elected.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not get to grips with this issue now, then when is it going to be dealt with? After all, it is not as if the Council thought that the system of privileges and immunities had to be reformed. It expressly confirmed that only last year, when the uniform right to vote was introduced. It is clear that the Council sees this as a long-term solution, and of course Parliament cannot accept that.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said, the Council has not previously given this issue its serious consideration. The governments are showing themselves to be something less than interested in it. That is why it is no bad idea to say that the Statute should enter into force at the same time as the European Union’s new constitution. We would then have a guarantee that both the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference would do intensive and serious work on this topic, and also that the issues of taxation and of primary law would be discussed at intergovernmental level in an appropriate way.</p>
<p class="contents">If we now dispense with these rules – which we do not want to come into effect, something they can of course do only after those provisions in the Protocol that are contrary to them have been suspended – then we will remain, for an unforeseeable period of time, in the Council’s Babylonian captivity. That is what this Statute is about!</p>
<p class="contents">I am very grateful to the Bureau for coming up with rules on the reimbursement of costs, general expenses, the daily subsistence allowance, and the lump sum for staff. That was very helpful and a step in the right direction. I am very grateful to you, Mr President, generally, for having taken more trouble over this Statute than any previous President. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the PPE-DE Group’s Mr Lehne,</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>

I would like to say that this is a complex issue. Clearly we are talking about an issue which has not changed since 1965, despite the spectacular progress which has been made in the institutional elements of European integration and particularly with regard to the capacities and duties of Parliament, such as its means of election. Nevertheless, we have been unable to adapt the Statute for Members of the European Parliament to today’s circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">As a former Member of this and other parliaments, I understand the importance and the implications of the Statute for Members and of the report presented to us today by Mr Rothley. I would like to congratulate him on his work and, on behalf of the Commission, wish him the best possible results. We hope that tomorrow there will be a concrete response so that we can vote on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Our objective is to cooperate actively so that, ultimately, we achieve an agreement that might be accepted by the Council, because otherwise we all know that it will serve little purpose. We hope to be able to achieve this agreement once and for all.</p>

If the Statute for Members is to be implemented, an agreement as to the rules applicable between Parliament and the Council is not enough. What is also required, of course, is for the budgetary authority to make the necessary financial resources available. Those of us in the Committee on Budgets have therefore gone through the proposal for a new Statute and tried to analyse the budgetary consequences. Unlike at present, the draft budget would mean future expenditure having to be taken out of the EU budget. In view of this, we have now also created a budgetary structure for this purpose, a new Chapter l02 (’Reserve for the Statute for Members’).</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has until now kept its expenditure within the self-imposed ceiling of 20% of heading 5 ('Administrative expenditure') of the financial perspective. We have also said, however, that, if more is required in order to cover expenditure related to the Statute, enlargement or other important objectives, we do not necessarily need to respect this 20% ceiling for ever. It now remains for us to see how high the costs of enlargement, buildings policy etc. will be.</p>
<p class="contents">Until now, of course, the idea has been already to begin entering the appropriations for the Statute in the 2004 budget in order at least to cover expenditure for a second half-year. That still applies inasmuch as the rapporteur’s idea is not taken up of postponing adoption of the budget until we are able to accept the Constitution. If the idea were, in fact, taken up, appropriations in the 2004 budget would not of course be appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">All that has really caused us concern up until now is the point concerning everyone’s right to direct interpretation which, strictly construed, could have entailed unreasonable costs. I appreciate, however, that a compromise with the rapporteur is on the way, meaning that the proposal is now in accordance with the estimates for the European Parliament’s budget. The conclusion of the Committee on Budgets is therefore that the possible consequences of the aforementioned decision for the budget are compatible with the ceiling of heading 5 ('Administrative expenditure') of the financial perspective, without this needing to entail any restrictions on other contributions to the policy under heading 5. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I also think that, without him, this tanker would have ended up on the rocks more than once. Mr Rothley, in his speech earlier on, addressed in a few words the important issues, some of them of a constitutional nature, that this statute raises. I would like to say something about some rather more down-to-earth problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that the statute, as it has emerged, is a very balanced piece of work. In the Committee on Legal Affairs, we were, essentially, guided by the instructions that we had been given by the experts and wise men that Parliament had mandated. The fifty per cent of a judge’s salary that is at issue here corresponds, more or less, to what an Austrian, French, German or British MEP currently receives, after health insurance and old age pension contributions have been taken into account. It is less than what our Italian Members currently get, and so I would like to express my thanks to them for their understanding and for their willingness to accept a reduction in income, as it were on behalf of future Italian MEPs and in the interests of common European rules.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I would like to thank MEPs from the Greens, the European United Left and the Liberals, who have not, in this part-session, submitted any amendments aimed at reducing the 50% or resubmitted the amendments put to the Legal Affairs Committee, as I believe there to be no objective argument against what it has produced. This has been unequivocally confirmed by the wise men, from whom we received clear guidance.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, one amendment tabled by a number of Members who basically want future MEPs’ salaries to be based on those of their national counterparts. I regard that amendment as nonsensical, to put it mildly. The fact is that the whole point of the statute is to create equal conditions for this country’s parliamentarians in accordance with Article 190 (5). It follows that those who submit such amendments must, in order to be consistent, be opposed to the statute as a whole, in that they in fact seek to retain the legal <span class="italic">status quo</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn now to the issues of primary law. A number of Members have tabled amendments – Amendment No 28 is one example – aimed at adding to the Statute the old protocol on privileges and immunities. That, though, makes no sense. For example, Amendment No 28, which I have just mentioned, refers to MEPs’ customs privileges, which, as we are living in an internal market, no longer exist. That shows how old this law is. This issue calls for new law. I might add that it is also the case that the way is now at last clear for us to have transparent rights to indemnification. This is something on which the Bureau will decide.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude with an appeal to the Council, which now has a real opportunity to ensure that we get a forward-looking Statute for Members of the European Parliament. Putting it simply, it must act swiftly to approve what this House has decided, and it should not block a decision by using flimsy and superficial arguments on tax law that have all been conjured up from nowhere. What I expect of the Council is that it should, as soon as possible – by which I mean before the elections – decide in favour of what Parliament demands. Once we have taken our decision tomorrow, the next move will be for the Council.</p>

<p class="contents">As Mr Lehne has said, Mr Rothley’s proposal is balanced and received the support of a broad majority of the Parliamentary Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. I believe it should be adopted in plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">A total of 36 amendments have been tabled in plenary. Mr Lehne has referred to them. There are not too many for a subject such as this, but the Group of the Party of European Socialists has decided to support the rapporteur’s direction as a whole, with some of the amendments which the rapporteur has also suggested to us in plenary today, so that we might remedy some of the flaws that were still present in the final version of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur has said, the aim here is essentially to create a Statute that allows Members of the European Parliament to be recognised, not as an extension of the various national parliaments, but as representatives of the peoples of the European Union as a whole. Mr Rothley said that the European Union is more than simply an international organisation and that, consequently, the Statute for Members of the European Parliament should be based within a Community framework rather than a national framework.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what we are currently addressing. It is not a simple decision on remuneration. Our current, somewhat flawed, system supplements the flaws in national legislation with Community legislation on allowances, which has been the subject of a great deal of criticism. I believe that if we adopt the rapporteur’s proposal, if the Commission also adopts it and, in particular, as Mr Lehne has said, if the Council adopts Parliament’s proposal, we could soon have a Statute which would effectively allow Members of the European Parliament to be differentiated from members of national parliaments, with their own status, which would be appropriate for the kind of European Union that we are currently trying to create. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When I looked at the UK press over the weekend I could not recognise myself or indeed any of my colleagues in the lurid descriptions of our supposed lifestyles and endless perks. Many journalists have telephoned me with the opening line 'Oh, so you are about to vote yourself a 25% pay rise.' When I explain the whys and wherefores, they suddenly lose interest, it is not an interesting story any more. Surely this is the point. Our conditions of employment and our expenses should not be the story, they should be transparent, a matter of public record: proper recompense for a job well done and reimbursement for monies paid out in doing that.</p>
<p class="contents">Colleagues, I believe this is our last chance to reach the stage where we are no longer the story, but our work is. We have a package before us that in most ways represents a compromise for all of us. It is a package that should get through the Council if we are reasonable regarding items of primary law, but the Council too must compromise over tax.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Members of this House may be uncomfortable about the level of salary: for some it is too much, for some too little, but finally we seem to have a figure that we can all just about live with. Then the expenses: again at last we seem, thanks to your work, Mr President, to have a proposed system that is much more transparent than hitherto. For some it may not go far enough, but it is a vast improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">There will have to be some compromise and understanding on all sides. What we will have finally established, the big prize, is a single statute for MEPs. This is our last chance. It was hard enough to get here, and the circumstances will not arise again. We have a chance for interest in this House to focus on our work and not our pockets. I hope sufficient numbers of us will have the courage to bend a little and vote for this package and the amendments by the ELDR and other groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite frankly, colleagues, although I pay absolute tribute to the work of our rapporteur, I do not want to listen to him in committee meetings on this subject for another five years. His very considerable talents and our time could be much better employed on other legislative work which directly benefits all Europe's citizens.</p>

For others, however, it is a farce of almost surrealistic dimensions.</p>
<p class="contents">Behind the democratic principles of parliamentary self-determination, we in fact find another agenda, one as prosaic as MEPs’ personal financial interests. It is difficult to make democratic principles credible when the real agenda is MEPs’ own money.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament has no impressive, democratic legitimacy to begin with. The turnout in every single election has been low. In a democracy as rich in tradition as Sweden’s, turnout at the most recent election was less than 35%, and in the UK was less than 24%. I can assure you that this shaky legitimacy would be further undermined through the adoption of the proposed Statute. At least in the Nordic countries, people find it completely baffling that the Members of this Parliament are to be paid significantly more than national parliamentarians, especially when we are also safeguarding the possibility of maintaining or reintroducing the absurd expense systems which, in the Nordic countries, have been central subjects of criticism. Certainly, the Praesidium decided last week that travel expenses would be reimbursed as per account rendered, but Article 29 states clearly that the current absurd systems can be reintroduced.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also observe that the issue of the national taxation of remuneration has now entered its final phase. At least for the Nordic governments, that is a crucial issue. The point is, of course, that national taxation would possibly be in conflict with EU law, and so the problem has not been solved.</p>

I agree with him in the sense that there is a democratic crisis. This Parliament is in a crisis because we come under permanent attack by many of the public media in all the Member States for the indefensible state in which we are made to work at the moment. We all know that people in this House doing exactly the same job are paid a huge range of different salaries for it. There is only one thing which has made this tolerable. That has been an expenses regime which would otherwise be totally indefensible because it is absolutely untransparent.</p>
<p class="contents">We are greatly indebted to Mr Rothley for bringing us so far down the road. We must take the step that will make it possible for this Parliament to stand tall and stand legitimate with a proper scheme on a common salary and a common, defensible and transparent expenses regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Putting it quite simply, I would like to see to it that we have a system that can be understood, that pays people the costs they incur and that pays us all a fair day's wage for a fair day's work. It should be slightly smaller but it would just have been gesture politics to retable the amendment we put in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market since it was obviously not going to be carried.</p>
<p class="contents">I respectfully disagree with Mr Rothley on the issue of privileges and immunities. I would like to see it in the Statute in something like the way he suggests, but frankly the provisions there strike me as much too sweeping, covering far too much. Immunity in these Berlusconi days is a difficult concept and we should not challenge our electorate. It is better to stick with the regime that we have, with the primary law that we currently have. Most of the amendments that we, the liberals and others have put forward seek to keep that basis for immunities. With these crucial amendments, the resolution can be carried.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with great respect to everybody here, I do not regard myself here as an employee of the European Union: I am a representative of my constituents. I do not ever wish to pay tax on my income at a different level or on a different basis from my constituents. The permissive Belgian compromise that would let Member States bring a Member's taxation liability to the level of his constituents is a good one. I hope that we can find a way of making it legally valid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Before the European Parliament elections in 1999, Parliament and Council seemed unable to agree. In a year’s time the elections are coming around again. Will there be unambiguous rules in place regarding the legal position of Members then? I fear that that will possibly not be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">The Rothley report still contains elements which are controversial as far as the Council is concerned, but, even worse, there are amendments which would postpone entry into force until 2009. Does the European Parliament really think that this is the way to seek the confidence of the electorate in May and June of next year? The rapporteur has shown himself to be a tough negotiator over all these years. Why is he putting the matter on the line, however, by describing not only the position regarding primary and secondary law, but also the privileges and immunities, because the latter constitute primary law. It would be a good thing if a majority tomorrow supported the series of amendments by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and others to abolish these.</p>
<p class="contents">What is really important is that all Members receive equal remuneration. As far as we are concerned, reimbursing travel costs on the basis of the costs actually incurred is even more important. The latter is essential if we are to be able to face the electorate, and therefore we must do something about this quickly. What do we see, however, but amendments proposing waiting for a new Treaty, or until 2009. With all due respect, this does not make any sense. 25 years after the first direct elections, it is high time we cut the Gordian knot on this issue; it is high time we put the interests of Parliament’s work above our personal interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We Radicals have consistently maintained – and continue to do so – that, with the Members’ Statute, we need to look beyond the scope of Mr Rothley’s report, to look beyond the administrative, bureaucratic<span class="bold"> </span>status of European Union employees, to use Mr MacCormick’s expression, and consider the rights of MEPs, first and foremost. It is intolerable, for instance, that, after 25 years of direct election, MEPs should still be forced to bear the consequences of the decision on the location of Parliament’s seat. It is intolerable that they continue to be denied the same rights as national members of parliament, such as the right to visit prisons and other rights related to the electoral mandate to represent the European people.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, pending the outcome of the European Convention, the Rothley report will spur us on to launch a wider debate on the need for the MEPs of the 25-Member State Europe to be granted, in addition to administrative status, rights which make them genuine elected representatives of the European people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am genuinely pleased because we have been working on this project for years. In actual fact, when I had the honour of taking on the chairmanship of the committee, I found areas of strong disagreement which it has only been possible to resolve through debate.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see from the speeches, we have worked together harmoniously, never losing sight of two important things: on the one hand, our desire to support the constituent process which is to give shape to a Parliament, its rights, responsibilities and privileges, and, on the other, the fact that the provisions of the Treaty are antiquated and obsolete, as Mr Rothley explained clearly, dating from the sixties, when Parliament was just a consultative assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rothley’s draft, which we are about to adopt, seeks to lay down a new legal framework for the European Parliament and rules governing the exercising of its mandate. I too want to stress that it really is a Statute for a genuine Parliament, which covers not just the financial side of things and, if I may be so bold as to mention it, remuneration, which were fairly minor issues on which the debate in committee had reached an <span class="italic">impasse</span>, but the structure and organisation of Parliament’s function, role, characteristics and mandate as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to be able to quote a major point of a report dating from 1986, which was tabled by Mr Georges Donnès, a great liberal. As far back as 15 years ago, this report stressed that the European Parliament was an institution destined to play a crucial role in the Community’s activity and in the process of producing Community documents, and that there could therefore be no opposition to changes deemed to be necessary for the Community bodies. Even then, it was clear that some bodies would have to undergo a process of change.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the possibility of genuinely equal conditions of immunity for all the Members of Parliament, the author of the report wondered whether it would not be possible to define a position of genuine autonomy and immunity for Members of the European Parliament as such, for as long as the current distinction made in Article 10 of the Protocol – which we are now attempting to amend – was preserved.</p>
<p class="contents">It can be inferred from the report I have just mentioned that such equal treatment is necessary not just to avoid the negative psychological effects of there being first and second class MEPs, but also because it is the fulfilment, a good sixteen years later, of a dream, a plan: making the Parliamentary institutions independent of other powers through the protection of the individual Members. This protection concerns our work and the image we want to give Europe of MEPs who, after many years, first and foremost after this Parliamentary term, through and under your presidency, are establishing a firm point of reference, which, not least, can only benefit enlargement by giving MEPs the effective role they should have. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should not forget that this is only the halfway stage, because when this report leaves here it has to be approved by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle behind this report is good: equal pay for equal work. However, I have to ask whether we are all equal. According to some of the amendments tabled, I do not think we are. One of the amendments talks about the considerable economic differences which exist between the existing Member States and the accession countries. Is it not the case that there are considerable economic differences even within the 15 Member States? So when we set out the principle of equal pay for equal work, the 10 accession countries do not fit into that principle. So we have got this wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">The big issue for me is the whole question of the expenses. I congratulate the working group on coming up with a formula. Transparency in expenses is essential. We must stick to the principle of travel at cost. That is an issue which is in our hands and we can approve it without going to the Council.

Ladies and gentlemen, I therefore appeal to you not now to permit the use of legal quibbles, hair-splitting and primary laws to prevent what in this case is most important, namely that everyone who votes in the European election in 2004 should do so with pride and that our work should be easy to understand and our rules transparent. That is what is most important. Even though we all believe there are details that are not quite perfect, we must adopt a global perspective and take the opportunity that now exists and that many previous speakers have said will not perhaps be there again.</p>

That is the right course to follow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I cannot do other than agree with the rapporteur when he says that, politically speaking, the core issue is whether we are a parliamentary assembly or a Parliament. If we consider how it is that the European Convention is discussing the Constitution, while we have for decades been unable to sort out the issue of the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, then the public will have every right to ask just what is actually going on here.</p>
<p class="contents">It has often been my experience that the public are quite amazed by the differing salaries paid to MEPs for their work, and, above all, by how large the differences are. I am certainly in favour of this one House, by way of a Members’ Statute, adhering to the principle of ‘equal pay for equal work’. It goes without saying that I also expect the Council to take up this issue and very speedily take the decisions that will enable the Members’ Statute to enter into force with the minimum of delay.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to associate myself with those speakers who have made reference to the issue of reimbursement. The fact that, in future, it will be our actual travel costs that are reimbursed is something that I see as being a core issue in terms of the credibility of the work done by this House and by us ourselves. I want briefly to discuss Article 20 of the Statute, which deals with old-age pensions. Our group has very lively discussions around this issue, as we, of course, cannot do other than note that discussions are going on in many Member States about raising the retirement age, and by a substantial margin. This goes hand in hand with an attack on social security systems. The proposal for the Statute, however, provides for us to have a retirement age of 60, which is low indeed. I believe this to be a contradiction, and one that we will be unable to explain to the public, and I see the application of differing standards to the pensionable ages of Members of this House and members of the public as amounting to privileged treatment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is now about taking the negotiations with the Council a step further, and I am starting to despair of this. The Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio, said that spectacular progress had been made in other fields, but that that was not the case here. In my opinion, that is very true. Why was the Belgian Government’s compromise involving a supplementary national tax rejected? Why do the major groups persist in wanting to regulate the new immunity and rules in this Statute? Why must the language regime, too, come up for discussion in this Statute? This contamination makes the negotiations too difficult. Objections of principle are all very well, Mr Rothley, but an acceptable agreement is even better; not only for the sake of principle, that is to say, a European rule for Members of the European Parliament, but also in order to put an end to the current questionable expenses practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, the Bureau adopted a new rule which will enter into force when the Statute does. My group grades the present rule an emphatic ‘unsatisfactory’, but gives the new one a good seven out of ten. It is true that we find the tiredness surcharges absurd and regrettable, but we welcome the fact that travel costs would be reimbursed only on the basis of the costs actually incurred. That is a considerable step forward. If an agreement on the Statute is rendered impossible, we are back to square one as regards the travel costs, too. That cannot be the intention ... can it? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This Parliament has been directly elected for twenty-four years. In a year’s time, these direct elections to Europe’s citizens’ chamber will involve the citizens of twenty-five Member States of the European Union. In a few weeks’ time, the Convention on the Future of Europe will be presenting a draft treaty for a European Constitution, and the next Intergovernmental Conference will be getting underway.</p>
<p class="contents">There are important roles to be played by parties – including European parties – by the European Parliament as the only EU institution directly elected by the European public, by the citizens’ representatives, all of which are an important part of the European project. To this day, nevertheless, there is no Statute for European Political Parties; despite that fact, there is to this day no Statute for Members of the European Parliament. The time for them has come; indeed, the resolution is overdue, and I tell you that today’s debate is important, because it is not only the Council that needs to do its homework on many issues – we do too, transparently, determinedly, comprehensibly, and in full awareness of our responsibilities, and, if the game of ping-pong is to be brought to an end, then it has to be spelled out that we decided that seven hundred MEPs were sufficient; it was the Council, in Nice, who arbitrarily increased our number. We are enacting the Statute for Members of the European Parliament on the basis of a report produced by outside experts. So far, the Council has not made the choice as to whether to go for a uniform European Statute or twenty-five differing assessments of the same work, and so, to put it briefly, our development from a parliamentary assembly into a European Parliament has not yet been completed.</p>
<p class="contents">The public nature of this debate also means that we have to openly address the point that no member of a national parliament – exceptions prove the rule – travels as much as we do. No national parliament has more democratic freedoms than we do. No national parliament is as consistent as we are in increasing the amount of work it does. Although nobody can say that he does not need to improve, to become more efficient and more professional, most of us in this House do good work, work that has a value of its own and requires framework conditions specific to itself. In the coming weeks, the new European order will come into being. This will also involve a new role for the European Parliament and the revaluation of its freely elected members. All these things justify a transparent and uniform statute for the Members of the European Parliament. There is nothing to be said in favour of deficient self-confidence or of populist self-laceration, nor indeed of superciliousness or arrogance. It is important and right that the fundamental issue that Mr Rothley and I have raised should be decided rather than continuing to be postponed. Ladies and gentlemen, let us, with all the representatives of the Member States, not be afraid of making decisions or of the decisions that may be taken.</p>

<p class="contents">It goes without saying that the text proposed by the rapporteur, Mr Rothley, whom I congratulate most sincerely, is a balanced text and naturally we are going to give it our full support. This fact, however, does not prevent me from making a few comments.</p>
<p class="contents">In my country we say that military justice is to justice in general what military music is to music. There are times when I think that this Parliament is to a parliament what military music is to music. Tell me, ladies and gentlemen, if in any parliament of any Member State you are subject to the rules to which we are subject in this Parliament or whether it would be acceptable for any parliament to be subject to the degree of control and monitoring – for example in areas as important as drawing up its own rules – to which we are subject with the intervention of the Council. This, therefore, is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that there is cause for debate here, such as the subject of tax, and I believe we could debate this within this House. What I would like, however, is for the result of this debate to be the final decision, rather than, regardless of what we decide here, always having to be subject to the will of a body, the Council, which, ultimately, is only partially legislative, and to the will of the governments of the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is that the terms and conditions of Members of this House are not satisfactory, either from a Member's or from the public's point of view. Not only should MEPs receive a fair day's wage for a fair day's work, we should be taxed on the same basis as those who send us here. As a number of speakers have already said, we are not civil servants – we represent the citizens of the four corners of the European Union, here at its centre. The arrangements put in place should be appropriately drawn up and transparent, and the expenses regime which is back-to-back with them should not be disguised remuneration, and in particular travel should be reimbursed on a cost basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Although politically, expenses and remuneration are two sides of the same coin, their legal bases are distinct. We must not be pompous, hypocritical or self-serving about this. For obvious overriding political reasons the Council and Parliament must reach a political agreement about the two together. If either steps back from this it is breaking faith with the electorate and is culpable of wrecking the process.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Member, I am sick and tired of cheap jokes about the 'gravy train': let us recall that the basic salary we, the UK Members, receive is, so I am told, about the same as that of a decent-sized supermarket manager in a provincial town. Such jibes degrade Parliament as an institution and the European Union as a political process. Quite simply, I say, let us stop the talk and sort it out, because if we do not, we demean ourselves and degrade the process of which we are part.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the contents of the Rothley report are concerned, we British Conservatives have deep reservations about some of them. The only way to break this impasse is to vote for the report as a whole, to take the process a step forward. We shall continue to work for a final outcome which will meet with our stated policy requirements. The immediate priority is to stop talking incessantly about the Statute and take some steps to do something about creating it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is good news, and is also largely thanks to you. There is a fly in the ointment, however. The new rules will only enter into force when the Statute does. The chance of that ever happening is very small. The draft Statute provides for a common salary for all MEPs, but the proposal also stipulates that MEPs will pay European income tax from now on. That is unacceptable to many Members, myself included. I live in the Netherlands, I was elected by Dutch people, I use Dutch public services, and I therefore wish to pay Dutch taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">Two years ago, there was a consensus on that point between the Council and Parliament. Member States would be given the freedom to supplement European taxes with national taxation. The rapporteur has swept that compromise off the table, however. Thus, the proposal does not stand a ghost of a chance, and everyone in this Chamber knows that. Last week’s decision by the Bureau will not enter into force, therefore, and we will be back to square one.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time in which budgets are under pressure and citizens are having to tighten their belts, we are opting to live it up, with outdated expenses rules. Although it may have been naïve of me to think that it would indeed be possible and that the political will existed, I sincerely hoped that within my own group, of all groups, a majority would opt in favour of the public interest and against self-interest. Unfortunately, that is not the case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What, above all, have been stumbling blocks for us, as Swedish Social Democrats, are the cut-and-dried travel allowances, the salary level, the Community tax and the lack of transparency. We have set down a number of absolute requirements as conditions of our supporting a new Statute for Members: firstly, that we can continue to pay tax in Sweden; secondly, that there be reformed travel allowance systems based upon actual expenses; and, thirdly, that we obtain a system that is open, that can be monitored and that our electorate can scrutinise.</p>

<p class="contents">The success of the enlargement process renders the adoption of this report even more urgent.

The transparency of the system through which Members are paid must be increased: citizens are far from unconcerned about this issue. They demand answers from us.</p>
<p class="contents">We should, moreover, apply the principle of equal pay for all Members as rigorously as possible. In order to put this principle into practice intelligently, allowances need to be adapted to reflect differences in living standards among the Member States.
