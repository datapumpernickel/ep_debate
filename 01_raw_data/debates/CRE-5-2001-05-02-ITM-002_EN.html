<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the left)</span></p>
<p class="contents">When I wrote to you on 25 April, you were, in fact, in favour of this yourself. I believe I am right in saying that all the political groups were also in favour of this. At that time, 17 prisoners had died. Since then, there have been a further two deaths. A further 160 prisoners are in a critical condition. I think that the Council’s response to postpone this debate to some other later date is an unacceptable, bureaucratic answer. We cannot allow the number of victims of the hunger strike to increase with each passing day, nor can we shirk our responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">If, as I understand it, the Swedish Minister for Justice will be present at this sitting to talk about the Cashman report, one cannot imagine that he would refuse to respond to our request, in other words, to send the Turkish government an urgent request to resume negotiations with the prisoners’ representatives so that this dreadful slaughter can be brought to an end.</p>

We are very well aware that the request for the Council to be represented here was made at very short notice. For that reason I do not mean to criticise the Swedish Presidency as such, but I would like to make a point about the future, Madam President.

<p class="contents">At the last meeting of the Conference of Presidents on 5 April this matter was referred to the Constitutional Affairs Committee and Madame Garaud was invited to represent us vis-à-vis the Spanish authorities. I understand that Madame Garaud cannot for the time being undertake that mission for personal reasons, which are fully understandable and have my deepest sympathy.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the matter has become all the more urgent because of three new developments: first, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, using the same procedures as us to waive parliamentary immunity, appears to be moving much faster within a deadline of only two months, and the European Parliament could find itself in the unfortunate situation of being left well behind.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Spanish Government has transmitted a new request to the Italian authorities without waiting for the opinion of the Council of State of Spain, which is ostensibly the reason why it has not yet replied to the European Parliament. Thirdly, again according to the press, the Spanish anti-corruption prosecutor, Carlos Castresana, has written asking you to investigate the delay.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances, do you agree that it is all the more urgent to proceed rapidly? Do you intend to ensure that the mission to Spain takes place as soon as possible, if necessary with a different envoy? Would you give us a deadline for this – would it be a matter of weeks, months or years? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">President.</span></span>   – Mr Corbett, I would like to thank you for raising this issue as a point of order, as this gives me the opportunity to give the House some extremely important information. As a rule, I do not respond to controversial press stories with further controversy. I have a deep respect for the dignity of this Parliament and so I am only too happy to be able to clarify matters for its Members.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the current situation? As you said, there was a meeting of the Conference of Presidents. Three decisions were reached, following a first decision that we had taken at Mr Barón Crespo’s request. Mr Barón Crespo had asked that we draw up an exhaustive document of all previous requests for waivers of parliamentary immunity, in other words, all the requests received since the European Parliament was elected by universal suffrage. I thought that this very comprehensive document would be of great use. I would like to thank the Secretary-General for having diligently drawn up this document, which is extremely interesting. It confirms that all requests, apart from those made by Portugal and one request made by Spain where there is some doubt, have always passed through the governments of the relevant Member State. You have access to this document. I am sure that it will have been sent to you through the appropriate channels.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Conference of Presidents, three decisions were taken. The first decision was to ask the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to draw up a substantive document on how requests for waivers of immunity should be dealt with in general. There would therefore be grounds for wondering whether there is a need to amend Parliament's Rules of Procedure. In these circumstances, as in others – I am thinking of the procedures for requests to withdraw a fellow Member’s mandate, or for other things – you realise that Rule 6 does, in actual fact, seem rather inadequate. Mr Napolitano, the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, has accepted to undertake this task on behalf of his committee and I would like to thank him for doing so. I believe that the coordinators of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs are meeting tomorrow to appoint a rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">I would repeat that this is an extremely important and serious matter which affects both this institution and the guarantee that every Member must be able to legitimately enjoy. It was then decided that I should again write to the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, reiterating my desire to see this issue investigated as soon as possible. This letter was drafted, I believe, directly after the meeting of the Conference of Presidents. I believe that it is available to you, again, through the appropriate channels. If you do not have access to this letter, we shall, of course, put the matter right.</p>
<p class="contents">The Conference of Presidents then asked me to appoint a Member of Parliament who would, more or less, be responsible for monitoring this issue. I appointed Mrs Garaud, who is a member of the French Council of State, a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and a member of the Conference of Presidents; she does not belong to any political group, is therefore someone with an excellent profile and is acknowledged by all to be an excellent jurist. I believe, Mr Corbett, that you are aware that Mrs Garaud has been through an extremely painful experience. I do not know if she is present, but I would like to pass on my deepest condolences to her. I do not think that we really could have blamed her for not being able to go to Spain during the period following her appointment to this position. I think that you are aware of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I have some very important information and I would like to thank Mr Corbett for mentioning the Council of Europe. The Spanish Supreme Court sent a request for the waiver of parliamentary immunity of the same Italian MEPs to the Council of Europe. However, you seem to be unaware that this request was sent to the Council of Europe via the Spanish government.</p>
<p class="contents">I am saying to you in all sincerity that this only adds to my doubts. Who are they trying to embarrass here? A request was made directly to the President of the European Parliament, the Supreme Court then passed this on to the European Parliament’s information office in Madrid and, a few months later, the same Supreme Court involved the government, through the Spanish government’s mission to the Council of Europe. If I had not acted in the way I did, Mr Corbett, I would have had deep regrets. I certainly would have acted in the wrong way and if I had taken a hasty decision to refer this to the Committee on Legal Affairs and to announce it to Parliament, this decision would have been subject to an appeal, a perfectly legitimate appeal, by those concerned. I repeat, in order to respect the dignity of this Parliament, I think that we must treat this situation with all seriousness.</p>
<p class="contents">Referring this matter to the Council of Europe, therefore, fully endorses the approach that I took when this matter first arose. I sincerely hope that the Supreme Court informs me why there are two different ways of dealing with this, one way for this Parliament and another way for the Council of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the first time that floods have hit our <span class="italic">département</span>. I shall inform you of the extent of the disaster, which is a very difficult task for me. In total, 125 municipalities are under water – in other words, approximately 1 500 houses are flooded and more than 2 000 people have been evacuated. Substantial damage has been caused, and the people of the area are suffering untold misery and despair. The situation is particularly worrying, because as well as the natural disaster, experts are predicting that water levels will take a very long time to subside and it could take several months. We have gone beyond the stage of a localised disaster and we are looking for ways to drain the huge amounts of water. People are showing great solidarity at local and regional level and help is being mobilised at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union should also take part in this solidarity, in other words, by providing considerable financial aid, bearing in mind that the cost of the damage will amount to several billion French francs. This area of France, which is already badly affected by economic and social problems, has been devastated. Admittedly, the media are saying that the water levels were yesterday beginning to subside. However, first of all, this is not happening everywhere and, secondly, the most difficult work still lies ahead of us, as we will now have to face the problems of restoration due to subsidence and pollution problems, which are already a threat.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would again appeal, if I may, for European solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, I would like to say that the President of this Parliament has behaved quite properly in this matter, and to express our full support for you on this, Madam President.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is amazing that the Socialist Group has raised this subject in debate during every part-session, either here in Brussels or else in Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Corbett, you say you are concerned about the reputation of the European Parliament. What you are really worried about is the election campaign in Italy, and you want to influence that campaign by enabling your political friends to benefit from a debate here in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">However, unlike the President, I am free to express my own opinion, because things are being insinuated here, and to comment on the fact that Mrs Garaud, for whom I have great respect, has so far not been able to travel to Madrid. The President made a discreet reference to the reason. Why is it that Mrs Garaud has been unable to undertake the mission? It is because her husband has died. We offer her our sincere sympathy. I am saying this so that there can be no more insinuations here.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to the question of how this was dealt with in the Conference of Presidents. I am one of those people who not only always wants debates to be held here, but also believes that we should make decisions. However, we need to recognise that the Conference of Presidents reached a unanimous decision. It was unanimously agreed that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs chaired by our esteemed colleague Mr Napolitano, who is not a member of my group, should now draft a report on how we deal with the procedures for waiving immunity. That was a unanimous decision. That is why I was very surprised, after the Conference of Presidents, to hear about a letter from the chairman of the Socialist Group to the President of Parliament, in which the very decision we had agreed upon was once again called into question.</p>
<p class="contents">If this were about another person, if this did not involve a country in the middle of an election campaign, then I am sure that the Socialist Group would not keep raising this issue in this House. That is why we very firmly reject these attempts to influence the election campaign in Italy and the democratic process of forming a new government in that country.</p>

<p class="contents">I think it is very important that Parliament should comply with the rules on the waiver of parliamentary immunity in a way that is completely fair and consistent. Having familiarised myself with these precedents, I could not help but come to the conclusion that there were two suitable precedents for concluding that the request to waive Mr Berlusconi’s parliamentary immunity should have been made in plenary immediately after last summer’s recess, and referred to the Committee on Legal Affairs for deliberation.</p>
<p class="contents">I had the impression that the last argument you put forward, Madam President, was that the requests in question had come from the Spanish Supreme Court through Parliament’s Information Office. My opinion is that this is not a very plausible reason for postponing the issue and delaying discussions on it.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, I can only state that it is the opinion of my group that there was every justification for announcing this request to waive parliamentary immunity in plenary without delay, and referring it to the Committee on Legal Affairs for deliberation. The committee could then have discovered if there were any problems associated with this competent authority. I believe the committee would have been very happy to do that.</p>

You may, of course, make a statement on behalf of your group. I must, however, just pick up on two points that were inaccurate. There were three requests to waive the parliamentary immunity of Spanish MEPs. Two requests were sent directly through the intermediary of the Spanish governmental authorities. There is only one request where there is some doubt. The Official Journal reports that it was sent by the Spanish government. In the report by the MEP at the time, which is the report on the request for the waiver of immunity, it says ‘given the request made by the Spanish Minister for Justice’, but when you look into the case, the letter from the minister cannot be found. Therefore, there are obviously two requests from the Minister of Justice, submitted by the Spanish governmental authorities, and one request where there is some doubt, in spite of the Official Journal, which, however, in principle, is deemed to be authentic.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the latest information that I have just provided, I have the impression that you might not have fully understood – perhaps there was a problem with the translation – this does not relate to the Council of State, this relates to a request for a waiver that was submitted by the Supreme Court at the Council of Europe, not long ago, and I clarified that this request was sent by the Spanish government’s mission, and this happened very recently. This information that I have given you is new and extremely important information. That is why my colleague at the Council of Europe was able to send it to the appropriate committee, since there was no doubt that the request came from the Spanish authorities. I do understand that all these facts might be cause for regret for some Members, but unfortunately for them, these are the facts, and we cannot change them, as they certainly are objective and beyond question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The response to the case of Mr Berlusconi does not ensure equal treatment: indeed, if Mrs Frassoni – myself, that is – had been the person concerned in this case, I am sure that the President would have acted differently. There is no doubt about it. Therefore, Mr Poettering, the matter in hand is that of the equality of Members. That is the issue we must tackle and that is why Mr Corbett's question must be resolved by referring the question of the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of Mr Berlusconi without delay to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, precisely in order to preserve equality between all the 626 Members. We cannot continue to beat about the bush. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In connection with it, I would first of all like to point out that you commissioned a study, at my request, in which two things were clear: firstly, that there were different types of treatment, and secondly, and I would like to stress this, that no request had ever remained in the drawers of the Bureau of Parliament for nine months. This is important. I would also like to say, with the utmost respect, that the President of Parliament has to submit to the Rules of Procedure, which means giving the responsibility to the corresponding committee. I have said this to you in public and in private. Out of respect for you and for the position that you hold I have tried to maintain a constructive attitude throughout this process and I would like to point out that the three proposals that you mentioned as agreements of the Conference of Presidents came from me. Specifically, the nomination of Mrs Garaud, and I add my condolences for her situation, was your proposal, but the proposal to send an emissary was mine. This therefore justifies the letter that I sent to you with the agreement of my Group. My Group still considers that this issue should be announced in public. The truth is that we are faced with a very paradoxical situation because a matter that has not been announced is taking up a large proportion of our plenary sittings, but in the end, that is how it is. We also think that it should be the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that should deal with the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, if you will allow me, Madam President, I am going to answer the allegations made by Mr Poettering who, with his usual elegance, has launched a torrent of abuse at the Socialist Group. First of all, the problem could have been avoided. This comes from August of last year, when the Italian elections had not yet been called. If it had been dealt with at the time, we would not have had anything to say about it. But also, Madam President, although the Secretary-General of the PPE insists that the Socialist International is behind everything, they are not going to tell me that we control media such as <span class="italic">The Economist, El Mundo, Le Monde, Handesblat </span>and even the <span class="italic">Los Angeles Times</span>. Unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, we do not have these powers and what is more, even if we had them, we would not use them. Therefore, there is a very simple solution to the matter under consideration. You belong to the same political group as Mr Berlusconi, who was enthroned as the rising star of the PPE at the Berlin Congress, and who is of the same political group as the President of the Government of my country. And you are of the same political group as the President of Parliament and the chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. I did not wish to use these arguments. So be careful what you say because everything has an answer.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I would like to ask Mr Poettering a question in order to confirm what he said on Friday. Do you think that, in your country, a person with a conflict of interests such as Mr Berlusconi has could stand for the German elections? Because your colleague, Mr Brok, says that the answer is no. Please do me the favour of answering the House.</p>

However, I should like to return to the subject of the law. You said that respecting the Rules of Procedure meant referral to the committee responsible. Mr Barón Crespo, several years ago, we had an MEP in this House who was held in great esteem by all Members of this Parliament. This MEP was Mrs Marie-Claude Vayssade, Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.</p>
<p class="contents">Here is what Mrs Vayssade wrote in a letter dated 8 March 1985. She said that she would like to point out straight away that, pursuant to Rule 5(1) of the Rules of Procedure, a request for the waiver of immunity can only be referred once it has been established that the request is from the appropriate authority. Therefore, I believe that this condition must be fulfilled before this is done, as well as the announcement to Parliament and the referral to committee, a point also laid down in the Rule 5(1) of the Rules of Procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, Mr Barón Crespo, there really is no getting away from the facts and you have my sympathy but everything points to this. I am slightly weary of these groundless accusations and we know exactly what lies at the root of them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whilst I have the utmost respect for Mr Barón Crespo, he said something that, as with so many things that are being said in this House today, he left unclear. We are compatriots, yes, we are all aware of that, and it is a great honour, may I add.</p>
<p class="contents">I am surprised at the tone of this debate. I am surprised because you pointed out that we are discussing an issue that is essentially legal in nature, and we need to keep it within the boundaries that you, Madam President – and I would like to highlight this – have kept it within, come hell or high water, thus demonstrating conviction and legal certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Frassoni started by making an accusation that I think discredits itself. That is not all, however, as Mr Corbett, Mrs Hautala and Mr Barón Crespo also seem to be telling us that the important thing for an institution is who gets there first, and to be saying that we need to move faster, that we are going very slowly. That is not the point of the issue, as you so rightly pointed out. Here there are major doubts, doubts that are justified, as to whether the procedure was formally correct, and therefore time does not matter. We have to wait until the necessary legal steps have been taken in order to dispel that doubt.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unfortunate that we were not able to obtain an answer before, but what is most unfortunate is that it was not sent through the usual channels according to the Rules of Procedure. I would also like to make a couple of points to Mrs Hautala, with all the admiration that she knows that I have for her.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Hautala, in the case that you mentioned and which you have consulted, there is a fact, aside from the two that the President gave to you. In the Official Journal it shows that the request came from the Minister of Justice, as it also shows in the report, but there is a letter from President Kleps, by which the President of Parliament notified the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, in which the Ministry is also mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Are we perhaps to think that in this Parliament, which drew up that letter, the official who drew it up is not able to tell whether something comes from the Ministry of Justice or not? Therefore, an assumption has been made, despite the fact that there is no documentary evidence, but assumptions have been made, and very strong ones, that in one way or another the letter was sent through the Ministry of Justice, because I cannot believe that the person responsible for drawing up that letter for the President at the time was not able to tell and would say explicitly in the letter that it came from the Ministry of Justice if that was not the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President I think that, as the Conference of Presidents very wisely decided, we should wait for Mrs Garaud to deal with this matter and to take the steps that she deems appropriate as the person mandated by the Conference of Presidents. We need to give it that time.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the delay, I would like to say that this case is taking a long time, but that people should take a look in the files of the Committee on Legal Affairs. At the moment, for example, we have a request for the German Government that has not been answered for nine months. That is how it is, and it is there for all of you to look at.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Madam President what is the problem that we are faced with? It is a problem, if you will allow me, associated with the happy event of the growth of Europe in the context of a Europe of justice, the area of justice, because here the Supreme Court is arguing that appeals can be made to the European Parliament just as they can to national parliaments. In my opinion, with the law as it stands, this is still not possible. Let us hope that it will be in the future. Personally I hope so, but for the moment let us be content with respecting the law that is in force. We do not want voluntarism, which, as you so rightly said, Madam President, would only lead us to the Court of Justice.</p>

That is very important. On the other side, always when issues of immunity arise, the contemporary unpopularity of politicians becomes an issue and people say "politicians hide behind membership of legislative houses in order to get away with things that ordinary people are punished for doing". It is equally important and vital to avoid giving that impression. That is why it is so important in these cases that the House becomes seized as quickly as possible of the question whether what is before us is an abuse of the legal process <span class="italic">in</span> <span class="italic">terrorem democratiae</span> or whether on the other hand this is a case where something is being done which ought to be tried in the ordinary courts in the case of any ordinary citizen, for we are all ordinary citizens as well as legislators. It is very regrettable that this issue has become a matter of long drawn-out deliberation in the executive branch of a Member State because that is exactly the wrong place for these vital issues to be debated. We should get them into Parliament as quickly as possible.</p>

The reason is quite obvious. The situation in my country is very delicate. The question is very complex. We are but a few weeks, or even a few days, away from Italian national elections. But with due respect to the high functions and duties and role you are discharging, and after listening to all my honourable colleagues, particularly Richard Corbett, and to you, let me say that the situation is perceived outside this House as becoming more unbearable, more unacceptable by the day.</p>
<p class="contents">I am raising my voice therefore not as an Italian politician, but as a European Member of this House, to urge you to put an end to all the ambiguities and delays and specious protocol formalities, and to communicate to all of us, as Mr Corbett has suggested, a precise date, a deadline immediately after May 13, the national election day in my country, by which we intend to pursue a definite legal and procedural solution of the affair.

Please be a little more patient! You can tell me what you thought of what I am about to say in a moment. You may even be slightly troubled by this. Madam President, since the outset, the Members in my group believed that this was a matter involving a string of events that are all the more worrying and harmful since they evidently relate to a political issue, the scope of which is clear to all to see. I am clear at least about one thing – and that is the political responsibilities used quite openly in this matter – namely, the prolonged silence, and then the delaying tactics used by the Spanish government for more than eight months since the matter was referred to it by your office, Madam President.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we cannot help but associate this attitude with political collusion with Mr Berlusconi. That is what is unacceptable. We must not accept it. As for everything else, the more we have out into the open, the better it is for our institution, and, in my view, and I want to state this personally and very clearly, I do not question the integrity of the President of this Parliament, even though I do not approve the course of action she chose to follow in this sensitive matter. I know only too well what courage you have shown in other circumstances, Madam President, and therefore I will not go accusing you of anything underhand today. On the other hand, we have asked for complete transparency from the outset and you helped to provide this earlier by giving the details of this matter. It was just so that the whole truth could be known by all, and possible misunderstandings avoided, and most importantly so that we could finally make up some lost time to look into this request for the waiver of parliamentary immunity. I hope that the precedent of the Council of Europe that you mentioned – the Council of Europe to which the Spanish government felt it could turn – will enable you to persuade the Spanish government to treat the European Parliament in the same way as soon as possible, so that we will finally be able to look into this issue and turn the page on this chapter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cox (ELDR).</span></span>   – Madam President, I too had not intended to take the floor, but this issue has now occupied our attention for three-quarters of an hour. In the meeting of the Conference of Presidents, all of the group leaders present made a very great effort to try to understand the precedents, to try to understand the complexity and to try to arrive at a reasoned and fair decision. I believe the decision that was arrived at at the Conference of Presidents reflected a consensus view, which was a collective wisdom, and you have enunciated that view here today.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone who has studied this dossier in great detail and who has discussed it free from polemics, but not free from their political preferences, has a view on these issues; no one made any personal accusation or imputation against you. I want to say, on behalf of my own group, that although you find yourself in an extremely difficult personal position, you have behaved with honour personally, as President of this House, from the very first moment this issue was placed before you.</p>
<p class="contents">On 28 August last, you requested the assistance of the Spanish authorities on the issue of the competent authority to transmit this document. I believe that the delay, for which you are now being reproached in debates like this, is totally undignified and unwarranted, and that you and this Parliament find themselves becoming the victim as bystander of a process of an Executive outside this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I intend, on behalf of my own group, notwithstanding the mission you have conferred on Madame Garaud, to whom again, on behalf of my group, I wish to express our profound sympathy, to take direct personal contact with the Spanish authorities, because we have a right to have an early and urgent answer. The delay has been unwarranted and undignified and it has cast you in a light and in a role where you do not properly belong. I defend what you have done. I hope and believe you would similarly defend any Member.</p>
<p class="contents">If Madame Garaud is not in a position, for perfectly understandable reasons, to undertake the mission that you have conferred on her, it could be advisable to see if, in such circumstances, an alternative may be found, if only because it is important for the Presidency of this House to be able to assure Members, as I believe we were assured at a prolonged debate of the Conference of Presidents, that you have acted with concern for due process and with propriety at all times.</p>
<p class="contents">We discussed the matter of precedents at length and the two precedents were rather interesting. One was an Italian case which came as a direct reference from a court. This is not a good precedent in this case because the Italian Constitution had changed between the earlier format of transmission and the most recent, and consequently the law itself had changed. Therefore, because the constitution was a different constitution, it is not a precedent with regard to the issue of a competent authority to transmit such a request. The second was one of three cases to lift the immunity of a Member, as it happened I think from Spain. Two of them clearly came through the transmission mechanism where there was no argument on competent authority. But the third came with the thumbprint of Government on it, unlike this request, so it is an inadequate precedent, even if it is a modest step in that direction.</p>
<p class="contents">All this has left you in a very difficult and delicate position, Madam President. I believe the undignified delay is the primary cause of all this concern and therefore, if we have political anger, while we are entitled to feel and express that anger, we should direct it at those who have caused the delay: that is most certainly not you and it is not the office of the Presidency of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would just like to inform Chairman Barón Crespo that, in 1994, when Silvio Berlusconi was Prime Minister with a centre-right coalition, a bill was presented to Parliament, intended to resolve the issue of the conflict of interests – it is right for this House to be aware of this as well – and the proposal was adopted by a section of Parliament. However, when the political situation changed, the law was not adopted by the other part of Parliament. On several public occasions, Silvio Berlusconi and the parties supporting his candidacy for Prime Minister announced that, under the new legislature, a government bill would be tabled once again, with the aim of resolving the conflict of interests, and that, as a citizen, Mr Berlusconi would strictly observe this new law once it had been adopted by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by reminding Mr Manisco that the law is not a protocol formality. It may be in some countries with which he is particularly concerned but, in Europe and in civilised countries, the law is not a protocol formality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have reached the end of this debate. I would quickly like to add one last thought, just a short comment, for the benefit of Mrs Frassoni. I would just like to confirm to her that if the request had concerned Mrs Frassoni, I would have acted in exactly the same way. However, where there would have been a difference, and I do not think that this will annoy you, is that there would not have been any comments about or contention surrounding my behaviour. I think that this is precisely the problem, Mrs Frassoni.</p>

It is about my constituent, Mark Forrester, who was arrested on alleged football hooliganism during the EURO 2000 championships. He was subjected, and I say subjected with good reason, to the fast-track trial procedure last year, and was convicted: it was then deemed to be unfair and he went for retrial last month. The conviction was upheld last week.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this fast track trial and the conviction being upheld is contrary to Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. It is contrary to Articles 47 and 48, of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which you, Madam President, signed. Every EU citizen has the right to a fair trial and should be deemed innocent until proven guilty.</p>
<p class="contents">The video evidence that we saw in Court showed that my constituent, Mark Forrester, was not involved in any way, shape or form with any violence. A further video was offered to the Belgian authorities by the UK police. The Belgian police refused to take that further evidence. I believe the decision by the Court was more about propping up the fast-track trial procedure than about justice. Mark Forrester is innocent and we will carry on that fight to prove that he is innocent and to clear his name. I hope, Madam President, you will help us in that endeavour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
