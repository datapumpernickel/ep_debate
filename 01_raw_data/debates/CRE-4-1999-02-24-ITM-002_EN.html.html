Indeed, the latest avalanche in western Tyrol was the worst for the last 50 years. Five people lost their lives and 33 more are still unaccounted for.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure I speak for the whole House in expressing our condolences to the authorities and to the victims" families, as is our custom after disasters of this nature. I am quite certain that you all share in the sadness following these events within our Union, in France, Italy and Austria.</p>

Let me also make a point of order. As you said, this was the worst avalanche disaster in Austria since the second world war, although of course other Alpine regions have also been hit, in Italy and France and in a non‐Member State, Switzerland. In Austria, the National Assembly observed one minute"s silence for the victims. I think it would be fitting for the European Parliament also to observe one minute"s silence in memory of the victims of the Galtür avalanche.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add the further request – addressed to the Commission representatives – for funds to be allocated from the 1999 budget, from budget line B4‐330 for protection against environmental and other disasters, to help the regions concerned. Aid that is given rapidly is doubly useful. Thank you.</p>

I am sure the Commission will have taken note. It is not Parliament"s custom to observe a minute"s silence following disasters of this nature, for the simple reason that we would have to do so frequently since they are, unfortunately, all too common in Europe, and Europe is so large. Nevertheless, I am quite prepared to agree to your request. I invite Members to observe a minute"s silence if they feel this to be appropriate.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">President</span> <span class="bold">.</span> – In the past few days, I have also received a number of complaints from certain Members concerning the decision to cancel the meetings planned for last Monday. I should like to take this opportunity to explain the precise impact of this decision and the reasons for it.</p>
<p class="contents">I must first emphasise that the European Parliament did not close its doors. It remained open throughout the whole of Monday, and the minimum services required to support Members and any visitors were provided. For example, Vice‐President Imbeni was able to meet a delegation of Italian farmers on Parliament"s premises.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is worth pointing out that the European Parliament is not empowered to guarantee public order in the immediate vicinity outside its buildings. That falls to the Belgian authorities, who were responsible for the decision to seal off the area surrounding the Community"s institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, in view of the fact that due to the arrangements put in place by the Belgian authorities, it was impossible to guarantee the presence of the staff needed to ensure the smooth running of the parliamentary committee meetings – which, as you know better than I, require the attendance of a whole range of officials, interpreters and so on – the wisest course of action seemed to be to cancel the meetings. That decision was taken by the Secretary‐General, who had been in constant contact with me. It was taken on my express authority, following consultations with the Quaestor responsible for security.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it should be made quite clear that at no time did the demonstration"s organisers request a meeting with any European Parliament body. However, the farmers who took part in the demonstration held in Strasbourg during the last part‐session did request a meeting, and I myself met them together with President Santer, Mr Colino, the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, and Commissioner Fischler. The meeting lasted approximately one hour.</p>
<p class="contents">On this last occasion, the demonstrators were targeting the Council, not Parliament, which is why no meeting was requested. Had such a meeting been requested, the necessary arrangements would certainly have been made. Naturally, any delegation would have been officially received if it had been possible to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision taken may or may not have been the right one, but I can assure you that it was based on the practical difficulties of gaining access to the premises and on the perceived need for caution. It should not be interpreted as a slight, nor as an attack on the right to demonstrate or to put political positions to Parliament. Parliament always welcomes citizens" political views.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Nassauer, you have the floor.</p>

<p class="contents">Secondly, where does it say in the Rules of Procedure that with the agreement of the President the Secretary‐General can cancel duly convened parliamentary sittings or other meetings? Is that not a matter for the Bureau or the responsible bodies?</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, do you really think it fitting for the European Parliament to abandon its sittings under pressure of an announced demonstration and to bring its political activities to a halt? Would it not have been more appropriate for Parliament as such to have spoken to the demonstrators, rather than simply closing its gates?</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">President</span> <span class="bold">.</span> – I shall certainly reply to your three questions, Mr Nassauer.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to your first question, the Belgian authorities did not tell us whether or not we could hold meetings. What they did say was that they intended to seal off the area, that public transport – the underground, trains and buses – would be unable to reach it, and that there would be three access routes for cars. It did not seem possible to guarantee that committee meetings could go ahead in the light of these plans, as the presence of the officials and interpreters required to support the meetings could not be relied on. I should point out that this was the only parliamentary business cancelled.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning your second question, this decision was made public by the Secretary‐General but authorised by me. In taking it, I was merely exercising the powers granted to me under Rule 19 of the Rules of Procedure, according to which I am empowered to ensure that parliamentary business, and therefore committee business, is properly conducted. If I am unable to do so, because I cannot guarantee interpretation and the support of the relevant officials, it is my duty to request the Secretary‐General to cancel the meetings in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to your third question, business was not cancelled as a result of the demonstration, but because the Belgian authorities had decided to seal off the area in which the European institutions are located. This affected not only Parliament, but also the Commission and the Council. The measures that were planned hindered access to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of Members have asked for the floor. I have no wish to deny the floor to anyone, but I would point out that as Mr Verheugen is unable to be present through illness, the Council will be represented today by Mr Volmer. Mr Volmer also has commitments in the <span class="italic">Bundestag</span> . The more time we spend discussing this matter now, the less there will be to discuss the items on the agenda.</p>

A huge banner was being raised – it does not matter to what end. I have in the past written to you, Mr President, and I have received a reply from the College of Quaestors to say that demonstations of that nature at the door of this Chamber will not be allowed. This afternoon such a demonstration took place. Can I be assured that if we cannot keep order in the streets of Brussels, we can at least keep order inside the Parliament building?</p>
