I say that not because it is in my name, but because of its content and the great deal of hard work that has gone into it. I thank those from the Court, the Commission, those Member States with which I have had dealings and also the secretariat of the Committee on Budgetary Control. Without them this report would not be the document that it is, and I give them heartfelt thanks.</p>
<p class="contents">If its recommendations are implemented by the institutions, then the Holy Grail of a positive Statement of Assurance – DAS – will be in sight. However, to get to that point we will need some real commitment and cooperation from the Commission, the Court of Auditors and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">From paragraph 25 onwards, the report outlines the lack of perfection within the DAS methodology. It makes the point that the money within our accounts can be totally legal and regular but that, at the same time, it can be absolutely wasted. That is one of the main failings of the DAS and why the report’s recommendations encourage the Court to improve upon the changes it has already made.</p>
<p class="contents">From the Commission’s point of view, whatever the DAS methodology improvements may be, the Commission and the Member States still need to make changes. The Commissioner must do several things. As with every report this Parliament votes on, we always ask the Commission to do extra things. And apart from such items as implementing a Community internal control framework, we are asking that. Here, however, a contentious matter in certain areas, certainly within the Commission itself, is an issue raised in paragraph 8 and Amendment 4. I would wholeheartedly call on Members to support this amendment, which calls on the Accounting Officer to sign off the Commission accounts. It must be said that until that is agreed, the Commission will always be attacked, and Amendment 4 spells that out quite clearly. I have a lot of respect and regard for Commissioner Kallas and I am encouraged by his positive attitude. I call on him not to let the battle of hierarchies within the directorates-general prevent this from being implemented. It is a key part of these recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">However, whatever we ask the Court and the Commission to do, the positive DAS will not be attainable unless the Member States accept their responsibilities, which include their political responsibilities in the control and management of European Union funds. Paragraph 16 outlines the problems quite clearly. The Disclosure Statement, as described in paragraph 19, shows how the problems can be solved.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is trying to anchor the Member States’ responsibilities not only at administrative level but also at a political level. This is, after all, a shared management process. It is about time that the other half of this shared management began taking its responsibilities more seriously. In that context, the report states – near the end of my section – that progress is not possible without Member States’ active participation. That is why the committee and the report, if it is adopted, proposes to invite you, Mr President, in your speech to the next European Council, to address the need to improve Member States’ financial management of funds from the European Union. I hope you can do that.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, this report has been a fascinating exercise. It is the culmination of ten years of trying to see a positive Statement of Assurance. Ten years ago I said that there would never be a positive DAS with the systems that were in place, and these included the DAS methodology. Today I can say that if this report is adopted, then I am confident that a positive DAS, that Holy Grail I mentioned before, is certainly within reach.</p>

<p class="contents">Today with our vote on the approval of the European Parliament's 2003 budget we shall give our position. A position as to whether our institution, the European Parliament, is using funds, money given by all the citizens of Europe, our electors, correctly and transparently. I would also like to thank my colleagues who have actively contributed to the preparation of this report with their advice and efforts. They presented their proposals and amendments and participated in discussions. There were discussions in the Committee on Budgetary Control and lively debate in my own political group, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. Liberals and democrats have always defended and will continue to defend people's right to truthful information, to openness and transparency, as this is the basis of democracy. We know that openness and transparency are not ends in themselves. They are means of ensuring the efficiency of the institution and, most importantly, its accountability to the people. To those people for whom this institution works. The citizens of Europe are becoming increasingly intolerant of ignorance and a lack of information, and are becoming more demanding of those who they entrusted with their votes, those who they elected to this House. They want the money they have paid to bring surplus value, that is to be used purposefully and effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me briefly present my report that is the report approved by the Committee on Budgetary Control. This report differs from previous reports in that 2003 saw the introduction of a new finance management system together with the establishment in the European Parliament of an internal audit system. This is a giant step towards more sound and more transparent budget planning and utilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus we would like to congratulate you, Mr President, and the services of the Bureau. Another new development is that from this year onwards the task of approving budget implementation shall be given to the President of the European Parliament, not the Secretariat of the Bureau, as was done previously. In the report attention is mainly devoted to four topics.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, management, how the main decision makers report, that is the Bureau and Quaestors. Here the rotation principle is proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">The second topic is the utilisation of money allocated to political groups. It should be pointed out that certain progress has been achieved in this regard, that is transparency in the utilisation of funds, by publishing information on the web. Areas for improvement, however, are also indicated: in the report it is proposed that political groups should draw up standard annual accounts and declare the utilisation of funds publicly.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, payments to Members of Parliament. This is a long-standing debate. Then there are the arguments between institutions and, most importantly, various interpretations and suspicions as regards the non-transparent system. The news that following the accession of the new countries, some Members' salaries are 12 times higher than others’ is an unpleasant fact. I believe this is unfair – we all work in the same European institution and we should be paid the same for doing the same job.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is wrong not to account for funds used for general expenditure. Those funds must also be calculated.</p>
<p class="contents">Another sensitive topic is our working place in Brussels and Strasbourg. This and how you will vote are matters for your wisdom. I believe that the Constitution is right to state that there are two places for the European Parliament to work. As early as 1952 Jean Monnet said that we want to unite people, not states. The European Parliament is the House in which we work and through which the citizens of Europe may be united. They will only be united if we are open to one another, if we work transparently and ensure the correct utilisation and planning of the European budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stubb (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I would like to start, much like Mr Wynn, by thanking the secretariats of the Committee on Budgetary Control, the PPE-DE Group and my colleagues for helping to push through this report. I would now like to raise five points in five minutes.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point is that the aim of all these reports we are pushing through in the Committee on Budgetary Control is to improve the control environment. Having worked in a national administration myself, I can honestly say that I do not think that the control environment in any national administration is as strict and as tough as that which we have in the European Parliament or in the European Union in general. For example, I could easily find out what kind of wine Commissioner Kallas was drinking at a luncheon on 12 December: that is how much detail we can go into! I therefore find it a little sad that some people in this House are trying to use this report for populist means and are trying to dig up all the dirt. We tried to dig up all the dirt we possibly could and fortunately we did not find very much.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that the report that I was pushing through dealt with six other ‘institutions’: the Council, the European Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions and the Ombudsman. They all passed with flying colours. I would nevertheless like to make two remarks, the first concerning the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time, we had a structured dialogue with the Council in an informal setting and it worked out quite well. We obtained the information we needed and we can be thankful for that. However, I have a slight word of warning for the future: we are getting to a stage in European integration where external relations, especially the common foreign and security policy, are getting more important. This means that, in future, the CFSP budget of the Council will not only be administrative but also executive. It will be particularly important for us to have a very close look at that when we start building the external relations service, to see how we can control it a little bit better.</p>
<p class="contents">My other comment about the institutions relates to the Court of Auditors. A specific personnel case was dealt with there. My approach, and I think the approach of all the major groupings in the House, was not to humiliate the person in question and we wanted, therefore, to keep a low profile on it. We had a very good dialogue with the institution in question and the compromise we have put on the table hopefully satisfies all parties involved.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is that we had a very good dialogue with all the institutions. We obtained the information we needed and it worked out in many ways, but there is one thing I would particularly like to improve on and that is the timing of the report. The Court of Auditors came out with the report five minutes before our committee meeting and then we were supposed to have a discussion on it. It simply does not work. The President of the Court of Auditors comes and gives a 45-minute written statement and it is not necessarily the best way to start the dialogue, so perhaps we could improve on that just a little bit.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming to my final two points, the first is that the discussion we had in committee was very constructive and the report as such passed with flying colours. There are not many amendments to the particular report I presented, only three in fact. As rapporteur, I would like to reject them. I do not think that they reflect the discussion we had in the group.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there should be a fairly good agreement amongst the biggest groups in Parliament on adopting this report. Once again, I would like to thank all those involved in pushing it through. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have had immense communication, both with the Commission and, in particular, with the directors of the agencies, who have provided us with all the necessary information throughout the procedure, and also with the Court of Auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of the agencies, which right now are carrying out a series of important actions, such as the regulation or implementation of certain actions or promotion, lead us to ask the question whether there are too many of them or whether there are too many different models for them and whether they are all necessary, although Parliament has been involved in many of them, particularly in terms of demand.</p>
<p class="contents">In some ways, this decentralisation of Community actions via its agencies is extremely positive, in that it gives the European Union accessibility, proximity and visibility in the Member States, and also, therefore, better knowledge of its citizens and, in this regard, we propose that the global communication strategy for these agencies be enhanced, and there is also greater speed and capacity for manoeuvre. But we must also acknowledge that there are enormous risks, in the sense that decentralisation may lead to a reduction in the control of budgetary execution or an overlapping of activities with those of the Commission or times when there is a lack of coordination or when national interests are put before the Community interest.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why our report calls for specific and in-depth reports from the Commission and a series of proposals and common guidelines to prevent these risks. And we would like these common guidelines to be reflected in the Interinstitutional Agreement and not just to refer to the mechanisms for strengthening control and budgetary responsibility in the execution of budgets, but also to everything affecting the harmonisation of its staff and the application of all the Community rules relating to its staff.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also like the Commission to carry out an examination and assessment of the structure in particular, since the regulations are already being reviewed, particularly in view of the European added value of these agencies, in other words essentially their need for European action.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Court of Auditors, we have also raised the need for greater coordination to increase transparency in the contradictory procedure prior to its report, because we have found that in the application of the timetable there had been problems at certain times which prevented Parliament from knowing exactly whether or not – and in this case at what point – the problems that had been noted had been improved and whether, in the relationship between the Court and the agencies or the Commission, a positive conclusion had been reached. All of this, of course, depends on a positive statement of assurance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Discharge is not only an issue concerning the correct use of money. It is also about the way in which the objectives of the programmes are achieved and about the way in which efficiency in general is to be obtained. I therefore wish to emphasise the aspect of gender equality. We have an obligation to achieve the goals we have set in terms of equality. I have to say that it is a scandal that only half of the agencies have plans regarding equality. That is something they must correct before next year. Otherwise, I shall not be giving them discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">The reforms will proceed more quickly if we introduce thoroughgoing gender equality. Old hierarchical and patriarchal decision-making systems and working methods will be broken down. In the case of almost all organisations, four fifths of the people at the top are at present men and four fifths or more in the lowest positions are women. I have to say that we in the European Parliament are no better. What is more, we now have a situation in many countries in which more women than men embark upon university studies. There needs to be a sound recruiting basis for the purpose of changing the employment situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue I wish to address is that of the European Agency for Reconstruction. As is well known, it was one of this agency’s officials that was suspected of helping a company purchase energy infrastructure. This is an example of how a scandal should, in actual fact, be dealt with. The director immediately suspended the official and lost no time in passing the document concerned on to OLAF, which began its investigation quickly and had completed it within ten months. The legal authorities were given the information, and it was possible for the proceedings to begin quickly. Now, we are also waiting for the Commission to complete the disciplinary procedure. If we could deal with scandals in this way and stop keeping things secret or trying to conceal them, our institutions would operate better. This shows how important public scrutiny is. However efficient the Court of Auditors may be, it can never discover everything. If, however, we were to have a principle of transparency, we should have 450 million inhabitants able to monitor what everyone did. That is the best method of preventing fraud and corruption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Development policy is an essential component of the European Union's external action. It is a policy which we all hope will efficiently target the eradication of poverty and the bolstering of social infrastructures, education, health and the local development of the countries which we want to support in their efforts to achieve progress and social prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Development Fund is an important tool for carrying out this policy in the ACP countries. However, it needs to be made more effective through a greater focus on actions aimed at poverty eradication and through better and faster implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Court of Auditors' statement of assurance, the accounts reliably reflect the revenue and expenditure relating to the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth European Development Funds, which is what we are examining today. The Court of Auditors points out certain problems, mainly in relation to use of the Stabex funds, the funds transferred to the European Investment Bank and not utilised and the amounts payable to the European Development Funds and not included in the balance sheet at 31 December 2003. The European Commission should step up its efforts to address the weaknesses identified in supervisory systems and controls.</p>
<p class="contents">One issue which also attracted a great deal of our attention was the responsibilities of the Commissioners and, more importantly, the confusion between the responsibilities of the Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, who is responsible for the policy of the European Development Fund, and the Commissioner for External Relations, who is responsible for the functioning of EuropeAide. During discussions with Commissioner Michel, who also wrote to us and we thank him for that, he assured us that there would be coordinated cooperation in the Commission on this issue. We thank him for their efforts but, as the Committee on Budgetary Control and as the European Parliament, we shall continue to monitor this issue, so that there are no problems in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue to which particular attention needs to be paid concerns the RAL. A detailed study is needed on the part of the European Commission into the origin of this high level of unspent resources, together with a method to speed up the implementation of these resources, which will also result in the improved implementation of the European Development Fund overall.</p>
<p class="contents">The decentralisation of resources to the Commission's representations, which was an ambitious plan and is at the completion stage, is moving in a positive direction and we are optimistic. However, we want an assurance that this procedure, which is under way, will also be accompanied by commensurate controls. This is another issue that we shall continue to monitor with a great deal of interest in the immediate future.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as far as the integration of the European Development Fund into the Community budget is concerned, the European Parliament has also discussed this issue in the past. The view taken by Parliament is that budgetisation will remove the complications which we presently encounter with the implementation of the European Development Fund and will contribute to better financial management and transparency. However, as the issue of the budgetisation of the EDF is a broader issue which touches on the debate on the new financial perspectives, we reserve Parliament's right to take a final stand on this issue when we take a stand on the new financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">With these general comments and taking account of the Court of Auditors' report, I should like to recommend that you give discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth European Development Funds for the financial year 2003. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My fellow Commissioners and I were very happy to participate and I warmly thank the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mr Fazakas, for the kind and efficient way he led the proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the resolution adopted in the Committee on Budgetary Control, its broad support for the Commission’s efforts and achievements and its very constructive approach. It deals with the core political issue of the Statement of Assurance – DAS.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Commission, I congratulate you once more, Mr Wynn, for having contributed so well to bringing so much progress on the Statement of Assurance in so short a time. You, and the Court of Auditors with its opinion on the ‘Single Audit’, have served an excellent first service. The ball is now in our court and, together with the Council, we will try to return it with both speed and precision. Fortunately, contrary to tennis, this is a game where everybody wins. Indeed, we all win if the four relevant institutions – the Commission, the Council, the Court of Auditors and the European Parliament – are able to agree on a roadmap towards a positive DAS in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">The key element in the roadmap, as in the resolution you are adopting today, will be how Member States can provide reasonable assurance to the Commission that adequate supervisory and control systems are in place. The Commission will present a proposal for a roadmap to a positive DAS before July 2005. I hope and expect that the United Kingdom’s presidency will pick up the proposals and lead trialogue negotiations towards an Interinstitutional Agreement in the autumn. Time presses, as legal changes may be needed, both in the legislative package of the new Financial Perspective and in the Financial Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mobilising and motivating the Member States will not be easy and the Commission continues to need your support. We can demonstrate that we are doing our part and are prepared to do it better. For instance, the Commission’s accounting system has been successfully converted and is now fully operational. In addition to this, the previous Commission achieved a great deal through its administrative reform and the Committee on Budgetary Control’s resolution is a welcome recognition of this. However, our roadmap will announce further steps the Commission will take to strengthen the Community control framework.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy to inform you that our roadmap has strong links with another initiative, the ‘transparency’ initiative, the purpose of which is to make more data about EU finances available to a wider section of the Union’s population.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not comment on the sectoral sections of the Committee on Budgetary Control’s resolution, although I am prepared to respond to any particular questions you may wish to raise. Nonetheless, I would like to add a few words on the four amendments to the Committee on Budgetary Control’s resolution to be put to your vote.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I would welcome your support for the amendments proposed by Mr Casaca to paragraphs 1, 2 and 3. Indeed, the Court of Auditors’ statement that outstanding commitments for the Structural Funds represented ‘five years’ worth’ of spending is misleading, since the Court included commitments to be made until 2006 under the seven-year programming of the Structural Funds. The outstanding commitments were, in fact, less than two and a half years’ spending. This is normal, as spending is intended to continue up to the end of 2008 and the final payment is due in 2010. It is therefore incorrect to conclude that the programme was not well managed or that funds will remain unused. I hope you will be able to correct this important point today.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to comment briefly on the amendment relating to the role of the accounting officer. What is my answer today? Firstly, that we will take this very seriously. I have had numerous meetings at different levels and with various well-known critics of the Commission’s accounting system. We consider this a very important issue and one of the key elements in our roadmap.</p>
<p class="contents">We are studying the implication of the proposal for the accountant to sign off the accounts. We welcome the fact that Parliament has raised this issue and we will come back with specific proposals. You are right: there are supporters and opponents of the views presented in Parliament’s amendment. In my view, there are many questions of this kind where we can say that the matter lies in the details or beyond the details. The main question, in my view, is how to guarantee the right balance between policy-making and financial or fiscal management. Contradictions arise here between the view that the units and directorates-general are responsible for policy-making and the concern that this approach should be balanced so that the financial management will support this policy-making and not interfere with it. It is clear to me, therefore, that this would be one of the most important points and I promise that we do not underestimate this issue but take it very seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to add a few words on the specific discharges related to the European Development Fund – EDF – and the Agencies. As regards the EDF, I would like first of all to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Xenogiannakopoulou, for a good report and for her open and constructive attitude during the discharge procedure. The Commission was, of course, pleased that the Court was able to give a positive DAS for the EDF.</p>
<p class="contents">The report contains recommendations on many important issues. The Commission will follow up these recommendations in the months to come, but I can say already that we are in agreement on the main issues. We will, of course, keep Parliament informed on developments relating to the new accounting system, budgetary support and devolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me thank Parliament once more for its support for the Commission’s proposal to budgetise the EDF. We believe this is a one-off opportunity to achieve better, simpler and more efficient implementation of the EDF, which will be of great benefit for the ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Agencies, I would also like to congratulate Mrs Ayala Sender and Mr Schlyter. The Agencies are autonomous bodies and it is the directors of the Agencies, not the Commission, that receive discharge from the European Parliament. However, since all the 14 Agencies concerned by the 2003 discharge receive grants charged to the general budget, the Commission notes with satisfaction that Parliament proposes to give discharge to the directors of all 14 Agencies for the financial year 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to do its utmost to provide all necessary assistance to the Agencies in the future, in particular as regards budgetary, financial and accounting issues. Moreover, within its area of responsibility, the Commission will follow up the requests addressed to it by Parliament in the discharge resolutions for the Agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by encouraging Parliament to support the Committee on Budgetary Control’s proposals. I can assure you that the Commission will forward the recommendations upon which you will decide. Finally, it is a unique opportunity for all institutions to go ahead with creating more trust in European institutions. We must escape from under the shadow of suspicions, the shadow of the collapse of a certain Commission several years ago, and reassure citizens that we deal with all matters, including wrongdoing, in the proper way, so that we can create for the European institutions a reputation for reliability.</p>

In evaluating the utilisation of the general budget for 2003, it can be said that much effort has been made in terms of the implementation of development policy, in particular in striving for the Millennium Development Goals. The European Commission has improved its accounting system and has established ten basic indicators to evaluate the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals. We believe, however, that the Commission is not giving enough attention or support to the European Union candidate countries, which became Members ill-prepared to implement the European Union's development policy. This shortfall must be eliminated, by devoting attention and resources to education about development in the new Member States and by encouraging old and new Members to exchange experiences.</p>
<p class="contents">As the next stage of expansion nears with Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia preparing to become EU Members, it is necessary to pay proper attention to development policy obligations. When evaluating the implementation of the budget of the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth European Development Funds for 2003, it must be stressed that the Commission did not manage to introduce suitable procedures for evaluating Community aid. The decentralisation of the Commission's representatives in Western countries is not supported by organisational means, it remains necessary to improve management and decision-making efficiency control. The way budget aid is rendered facilitates the work of the Commission, but in the absence of a suitable control mechanism, does not realistically encourage the governments of the countries receiving aid to be accountable to their citizens and this allows the implementation of an uncoordinated development policy. For example, the exhaustion of natural resources through deforestation driven by consumer demand.</p>

However I would like to inform the Commissioner from the start, that this year we are perhaps being too soft in his regard also because this is his first year in office and it is difficult to blame him for something which was done by his predecessors. In the general budget report, we are making a favourable recommendation. This does not mean that we are satisfied about everything. On the contrary. We think that there is still much more to do in order to have stricter controls in the budget of the European Union. After all, here, we are not talking about funds which have fallen down from the sky but about funds which come from people's taxes. In this year’s general report we are saying that the DAS system should be reformed so that it would no longer remain a frustrating target that can never be reached. But we are also making a strong emphasis on the controls being made not so much at a European level but at a national level.</p>
<p class="contents">There is the need for national authorities to give a more detailed account of how the funds of the European Union are being spent, when these are spent in different countries or in different regions. I am much afraid that when making use of the European Union’s funds, the governments are not being serious enough in the controls that they are carrying out. It is not right that while the national authorities take great care when spending national financial resources, they do not take equally great care when they spend money passed on to them by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">National authorities should therefore realise that if they will not introduce the necessary controls they will be risking losing the funds. On our part we are making a series of clear and detailed recommendations in our report to ensure that the money which is spent at national level is spent in a serious way and with all the necessary controls. We are also reminding the Commission that even when European funds are spent by national authorities, it still cannot shirk all responsibility. After all, it is the Commission that is still responsible for the budget. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The present discharge procedure differs from earlier ones in two respects. On the one hand this is the first occasion where representatives of the new Member States were able to participate actively in the work and were thus able to get firsthand experience in one of the European Parliament’s most important activities. I mean this not only from an accounting point of view, but also in terms of the politics affecting Europe’s current and future operation. The other, even more important change, is that this year, building on the experience and renown of the rapporteur Terence Wynn, we reformed the procedure itself, doing away with the earlier written question-and-response format and instead generating direct dialogue with the Commission, the relevant institutions and the European Court of Auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">We were pleased to find that this reform was positively received by all parties concerned. We both came to the conclusion that through such a reform, the discharge procedure would no longer be viewed as something of a nightmare, but as a joint task for Parliament, the Commission and the Court of Auditors with the aim of ensuring that the EU operates better, more efficiently and more transparently in the eyes of the public. I would especially like to thank Commissioner Siim Kallas, who is here today, and Mr Hubert Weber, President of the European Court of Auditors, for their contribution to our work, and I look forward to working with them again in the future in this important field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it must have been a particular delight for Mr Wynn to be a rapporteur for the discharge after having been on the Committee on Budgets for so many years.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we have a new Commission and we cannot hold this Commission responsible for the events in 2003, we still need to learn from everything that has happened during that year. Given that the most striking thing is that there is once again no positive Statement of Assurance (DAS), I welcome the Commissioner’s statement this morning that he intends to present us, by July this year, with a proposal for a roadmap of some kind towards a positive DAS, which is of crucial importance. It is also essential to have in-depth discussions with the Court of Auditors in order to establish in what way we can get one, because it is unacceptable for the Court of Auditors to keep changing the rules of the game throughout the whole period. We have to know how a positive DAS can be achieved. Public opinion demands that we join with this new Commission and this new Commissioner in order finally to achieve a positive DAS.</p>
<p class="contents">The responsibility lies with the Member States. One of the paragraphs in the resolution stipulating that in the Member States, the person with the highest political responsibility must stand surety for European money being spent wisely, represents an important new departure in the entire discussion with the Member States. As the Council of Finance Ministers set great store, in any case, by economic policy and related matters, I hope they will adopt it.</p>
<p class="contents">One final word for my colleague, Mrs Juknevičienė. It is very admirable that someone from a new Member State should draft such a thorough report. I hope that the amendments will be adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should be able to say it here too: Parliament’s budget is in good shape. Enormous efforts are being made by our Administration under the leadership of Secretary-General Priestley to manage Parliament’s budget correctly, and they deserve our appreciation.</p>
<p class="contents">I should nevertheless like to mention two bottlenecks, namely the fact that we are operating from three locations and the voluntary pension fund. Our working from three locations, namely Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg, is in fact required of us by the EU Treaty. That is already costing us, as taxpayers, more than EUR 200 million a year. Apart from the money aspect, there is also the time factor, which we can no longer justify to our electorate. During previous discharge procedures, we asked the Convention to delete this article in the Treaty from the Constitution, but without success. We, the new Parliament, should therefore make it quite clear that we disapprove of this situation and can no longer accept it.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to draw your attention to the paragraphs in the report on the European Parliament’s discharge relating to the voluntary pension fund. There is obviously ambiguity surrounding the responsibility of this House and the participants in this voluntary pension fund. As long as nearly ten years ago, Parliament made up a shortfall of EUR 9 million. Although it was decided then that a clear line should be drawn between this voluntary pension fund and the European Parliament’s official bodies, a twilight area continued to exist. This pension fund is going from bad to worse. There is already a shortage to the tune of EUR 42 million. We should therefore stress that the European budget, this Parliament’s budget, should not under any circumstances be used to plug this hole. It would be unethical and irresponsible. Taxpayers’ money may not be used to fill a deficit of EUR 42 million in a voluntary pension fund. I thank you for your attention and hope, above all, that we can, when we vote, ensure that these arrangements are in place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our parliamentary monitoring system is inadequate, however. The EU has very little standing and legitimacy in the eyes of Europeans, and understandably so. The key words that come to mind in the case of an ordinary European are control from the top, Establishment thinking, waste and corruption. Why are things that way? Evidently, institutional control via the Court of Auditors, OLAF and the Committee on Budgetary Control is not enough. It is not working. Our system continues to be full of irregularities and corruption. Nor, evidently, do freedom of expression, democratic debate, investigative journalism and other such external controls operate. They are not enough. What is required? What, also, are required are what we usually call whistle blowers. Throughout the EU’s machinery and in all bodies and at all levels, officials are required who are loyal not to their superiors but to European citizens and taxpayers.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had well-known whistle blowers, discussed all over the world: van Buitenen, Mart Andreasen, Hans-Peter Martin etc. The list is long. What has happened to those who have revealed fraud in the system and directed attention to it? Normally, they have lost their jobs. Now, we have another example of a case like this in the Committee of the Regions. I would therefore request Parliament to support our Amendment 2 to Title VII, paragraph 12, tabled by Mr Titford, Mr Bonde and myself. All this must be put a stop to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I must emphasise that it is not of course Mr Kallas’s fault. We are talking about something that happened in the past, before this Commission. The fact that we are holding others responsible for the past actually distances us somewhat from the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Wynn writes that he finds it disappointing that the Court of Auditors ‘has no reasonable assurance that the supervisory systems and controls of significant areas of the budget are effectively implemented so as to manage the risks concerning the legality and regularity of the underlying operations’. In other words, we again have no positive Statement of Assurance. We have discussed this problem time and time again over the years. We know all too well that there are many different countries with different administrative cultures, but, when it comes down to it, the problems are due to the fact that the legislation drawn up is inappropriate and often does not even achieve the specified aims. On the contrary, the procedure is based on a method that encourages fraud and evasion, and the failure to comply with the budget is in many areas an expression of the fact that the intended policy is not being implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we still do not have a modern, acceptable accounting system in a number of areas – that was what Mrs Andreasen was fired for pointing out some time ago – and the conditions for this are still not in place.</p>
<p class="contents">When I read the report, I could not help but think of the libretto of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s opera Evita, which is about Evita Peron, wife of the deceased Argentinean president, General Peron. Talking about a charitable foundation she had established, the lyrics say: ‘A little of the cash has gone astray’. It is a bit like that in the EU. The opera’s lyrics also include the words: ‘When the money keeps rolling out, you don’t keep books’. That was in Argentina in the 1950s, but now it is the EU in 2005. It would never be acceptable in the national states, and it ought not to be acceptable here, either. That is why I am going to vote against the budgetary discharge in certain cases, but in favour of a number of the very sensible amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is apparent when we look back at 2003, but particularly so when we look into the future. I find it very regrettable that Mrs Juknevičienė’s report was further diluted in committee; we have less control over travel expenses than we otherwise might, and we are being presented with new openings as regards pension provision and the gold-plated supplementary pensions for MEPs. In the form of the Liberal Group’s important amendments, an attempt is now being made to curb that, but these deal only with the formalities involved in paying these pensions rather than with the scandal that the system represents.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather than at last learning something from the situation in which we find ourselves, we again, yesterday, had the spooky experience of the Committee on Budgets discussing what we are going to do with the EUR 90 million to which this House will have access in 2006, with nobody being quite sure what the money is going to be spent on. Although someone resurrected the idea of setting up a television channel for broadcasting this House’s debates, the best way of investing these EUR 90 million in an information campaign would be to give it all back to the taxpayers. That way, we would be sure of favourable coverage, and no more of these resources would need to be wasted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has demonstrated his experience and he has used it to ensure that our Committee could work much better this time than in previous years. I agree with him that it is scandalous to hear once again from the Court of Auditors that the accounts of our institution, of the European Union, are not reliable. This is a procedural problem and all of us here agree that the system must be changed so that we may finally see the Holy Grail; a positive discharge of our accounts. There is a fundamental problem: the immense number of controls that make spending inefficient.</p>
<p class="contents">As Alexander Stubb, who has had control responsibilities in Finland, as I have in Spain, has said, there are greater controls in the European Union than there are in the Member States or in other institutions. And inevitably ever greater controls only mean that spending is less efficient, that opportunities are missed, that officials do not want to take any responsibility and efficiency is reduced. We shall have to see how much control we want. The public interest does not necessarily benefit because cars travel at 20 km per hour in order to prevent accidents. We shall therefore have to see how we can promote initiative and put more thought into efficiency than into controls.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the report on the accounts of the European Parliament, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work and I would like to say that we Members of the European Parliament effectively have hardly any say over our Statute. We cannot decide where we want to meet nor where we do not want to meet. We are hostages to the decisions of the Council, and it is now time for it to take them. But there is no question that, until it does so, it is better not to touch anything and to leave things as they are.</p>

The rapporteur pointed out that the report has been the subject of lively debate in the ALDE Group. I can say that the same applies to my own Group. If these discussions prove anything it is the need for a single Members’ Statute, which would solve many of the problems discussed in this discharge. Therefore I call on the Council to reach a compromise. Parliament has already done so.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to focus attention on two separate issues. Firstly, the amendments concerning the voluntary pension fund and in particular the estimated deficit have led to much discussion among my colleagues. The majority of my Group has decided not to support the extra amendments put forward, but instead to support the critical text already in the report. I, however, support these amendments, as will the rest of my delegation. Again, I ask my colleagues to do the same.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is the need for a single working place for this House. In my view this issue reaches to the core of Parliament’s credibility. The amount of public funds spent annually on this dispersion to multiple working places is immense and the general public neither understands nor supports this inefficient way of working. I believe that we need a single seat. I also believe that Brussels would be the most logical choice as the other institutions are already based there. However, I recognise the historic value of Strasbourg and I understand the value of this Parliament to the city. Therefore I call on the Council and the Commission to offer the city a high-level alternative for the future, on which I have some ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">Commission President Barroso has expressed ideas on the need for a European institute for technology as a part of the Lisbon Agenda. I support that idea and this building would be perfect for a high-level university and technological research centre where Europe’s best and brightest could be assembled for the ambitious future of this Union, instead of its troubled past. Therefore I call on this House to support the amendments. I call on the Council to take them seriously and solve this issue once and for all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I recognise that some of the problems in securing reform come from the unjust arrangements for the payment of Members’ salaries, but that cannot excuse the fact that at this time there are no arrangements in place for the auditing of Members’ general expenditure allowances. As things stand, it is possible for those who belong to the voluntary pension funds to allow their private contributions to be met out of public funds, without making reimbursement.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a practice, if it occurs, would be wholly indefensible. It would amount to embezzlement of public funds. All of us are tarnished by the suggestion – and perhaps the reality – of such practices. We should today take the opportunity to vote for reform and transparency. We should take the initiative and ensure that this House sets high standards for the whole of Europe.

The accounting system does not automatically include all the facts and figures. The Internal Auditor’s department literally says that interested parties do not know whether the Commission’s figures reflect reality. Parliament has not gained any access to the important information required if it is to give discharge; there was only a summary of the original report by the former Internal Auditor, Jules Muis. Mr Muis left the Commission on 1 April 2004. His recommendations fell on deaf ears. Even the <span class="italic">chef de cabinet</span> warned Mr Muis, telling him: ‘We know how to break people like you’. The final report by the Internal Audit Service on Eurostat was made available to only three Members of this House for their inspection; as only one of them was re-elected, only one Member has access now.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgetary Control does not accept this revenue and expenditure account, because the figures have not been signed off by the person responsible for doing so. In any other business, this would mean that this revenue and expenditure account could not be used as a basis for a discharge. Mr Wynn was right in identifying this shortcoming and we, as representatives of the people, now have the duty to postpone the grant of discharge until such time as the person responsible has summoned up the nerve to add his signature. The person responsible for this in 2002, Mrs Andreasen, has just filed a petition to Parliament on this very subject. Although her petition is admissible, Parliament has so far refused to hear her. The Court of Auditors is equally doubtful of the effect of the controls within the Commission’s accounting system and of the legitimacy of expenditure for each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">My endorsement of Mr Stubb’s report will depend on whether the amendments of the Independence and Democracy Group with regard to the Committee on the Regions are adopted. The former Internal Auditor and now unfortunately whistleblower, Robert McCoy, did his duty as auditor, but was destroyed. He did not fall to his knees before Parliament, which was a condition for discharge. In addition, in one of the amendments tabled by the Independence and Democracy Group, it is stated, and rightly, that OLAF failed to submit its enquiry report to the Belgian courts. Once again, the whistleblower was prevented from giving his side of the story in the Committee on Budgetary Control. In view of how Mrs Andreasen, Mr Muis and Mr McCoy, and all the others I have not mentioned, have been treated, can we grant discharge on behalf of the citizens as a matter of course? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It beggars belief that Mr Stubb could have drawn up any report, let alone one of such a sensitive nature, without making sure he interviewed all the key players. Yet it seems he could not, or would not, see the Committee of the Regions’ former Internal Auditor.</p>
<p class="contents">On the back of this shocking disregard, it is little surprise that Mr Stubb’s report contains so many howlers. The original draft claimed that the then Internal Auditor had not been subject to an internal inquiry, when the Committee of the Regions’ Secretary-General had admitted in writing that he had been. Mr Stubb claims that: ‘... none of the officials who were the subject of the administrative inquiry has been promoted since the completion of the report’. However, he omits to mention that several of them were allegedly put forward for promotion. Most nauseatingly, the report states that the former Internal Auditor was assured that he had ‘the full support and cooperation of both CoR members and staff’. That man has since been locked out of his office and hounded out of his job for telling the truth. Mr Stubb’s report is rotten to the core, just like the EU institutions it represents. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no means of stopping this flood of cash and no means of returning it either. If this were an elected government as opposed to a bureaucracy, the very use of this vast sum of money, let alone its distribution, would be far more critically analysed, and accountable democracy demands that surpluses be refunded by the reduction in taxation.</p>

The competent parliamentary committee therefore proposes discharge for all the agencies. However, the comments it has formulated require examination, because they will be useful for the policy of the European Commission in respect of these agencies and to the agencies themselves in their daily management.</p>
<p class="contents">We all agree that the agencies must have suitable financial resources, so that they can function, and that their objective must be transparency, efficiency and added value to the work of the central institutions of the European Union. That is why the Committee on Budgetary Control, apart from specific comments on certain agencies, expressed its views on a framework of management rules based on common, harmonised guidelines, which will emerge following substantive dialogue with the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that it would be exceptionally useful if a more careful study were carried out of synergies between the actions of certain agencies and the action of certain sections or directorates of the European Commission. We believe there should be better communication and cooperation, so that, instead of overlapping objectives and work, we have complementarity and enhanced European added value.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with the rapporteurs' views that, in certain agencies, there needs to be better utilisation of human resources, together with systematic information on the need to apply equality in the agencies. They must set an example for our action and policies on gender equality.</p>

<p class="contents">It is therefore important for us to get our benefits in order. Travel allowances are emphatically not there for the purpose of adjusting incomes. Rather, they are straightforward travel expenses that should be paid out on the basis of actual costs. If we want to adjust salaries, we need an extra budgetary item which is publicly accounted for. My colleague, Mr Staes, explained the problems involving the pension fund or supplementary pension. It should be self-funded, with the deficits covered by those who are in the scheme. It is unfair that taxpayers should shoulder the loss when share speculation goes wrong and that those who are in the scheme should take the profit in the event of successful speculation.</p>
<p class="contents">Our ordinary travel allowances are generous. People wishing to claim the full amount should account for how they have used it. Those who cannot do so should receive a lower refund. Certainly, it takes time to account for expenses, but it is time well spent if it leads to increased credibility for Parliament. In the election campaign, I discovered that the publicly available web site no longer contained information about the rules governing our benefits. Since it is not secret, this information should be published there immediately. This is an area subject to voters’ most frequent questions.

This includes shortcomings in the accounting system, the Member States’ unwillingness to claim back funds paid out in error, the European Development Fund and excessive travel allowances paid to MEPs. In view of the limited time I have to speak, I wish, however, to focus upon a smaller but, in terms of principle, important part of the EU budget, and one that is quite incomprehensible from our citizens’ point of view: the subsidies for tobacco cultivation.</p>
<p class="contents">Every year, European taxpayers are forced to pay out close to SEK 10 billion in subsidies for tobacco cultivation. That is a terrible waste and a quite disgusting way of dealing with people’s tax money. To cap it all, the tobacco subsidised by the EU is of such very poor quality that no European manufacturers want to use it. Instead, this very same tobacco is used to drive tobacco manufacturers in poor countries out of business.</p>
<p class="contents">The subsidies for tobacco cultivation are no less bizarre in view of the fact that the Commission has now launched an anti-smoking campaign estimated to cost SEK 700 million. May I say that this is the height of hypocrisy. In debating the Commission’s discharge, Parliament can make it clear that tobacco subsidies must be abolished. With his casting vote in the Committee on Budgetary Control, the June List’s Mr Lundgren has, unfortunately, ensured that we now have a parliamentary situation in which the European Parliament is supposed to defend the most shameful agricultural subsidies. I appreciate the fact that Mr Lundgren stated publicly yesterday that he had made a mistake. The only problem is that the damage has already been done. It remains the case that, despite the fact that, before the elections for the European Parliament, the June List promised to work towards phasing out tobacco subsidies, the most abiding result to date of that self-same June List having been elected to Parliament is its having contributed to ensuring the very survival of the tobacco subsidies.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope and believe that, in plenary, Parliament will do everything it can to correct Mr Lundgren’s gaffe and vote in favour of an opinion stating that Parliament wants to see tobacco subsidies abolished. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know that, of the funds in the European Budget, some 80% flow out via the Member States. Another aspect I want to touch on here is one that has come to light in a report just published by the Court of Auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">Between 1971 and September 2004, irregularities in the agricultural sector totalled some EUR 3.1 billion; 30 years on, some 20.2% have been collected from the recipients of funding, while 5% had to be borne by EAGGF, and EUR 144 million by the Member States. EUR 2.2 billion, equivalent to 70%, are still outstanding and will not be recovered. It follows from this that the Member States are quite simply paying too little attention to the European Budget and to the money that flows back to them via Europe. I am not entirely sure whether a statement by the finance ministers is the most appropriate way to deal with this.</p>

I very much want to thank Mr Wynn, who has come up with a range of workable proposals, and I can do no other than urge you, Commissioner, to act on them. Your predecessor was a great one for announcing things, but when I see what she promised to implement as long ago as 2000 and set it against what you have to get through, Commissioner Kallas, what becomes clear to me is that there is still room for improvement here.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may take a very practical example, something had to be done about the accounting system even before Commissioner Schreyer took office, and it is to you that the honour now falls of actually doing it. I hope you will waste no time in doing so. The report gives good guidance as to how to go about it.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the discharge reports is not, however, to make statements on every conceivable problem. I am also addressing my fellow-Members in this group when I say that, where the Tobacco Regulation is concerned, our job is not to examine the legality or otherwise of paying bonuses, but rather whether they have all been paid in a lawful manner. Those are the ground rules, whether we like them or not.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the discharge of this House, I do not know whether it is the greatest problem in the world whether people do or do not smoke in individual offices. It does not affect the Budget and must therefore be sorted out elsewhere, so let us concentrate on things that really do have to do with the budget and with money and its disappearance, things about which Mr Bösch has had something to say and where there is much to be done. The President is about to cut me off, so I will now finish by saying ‘thank you’ to the rapporteurs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My second comment concerns own resources. I also agree with the observation made in Mr Wynn’s report on this matter, namely that the Commission should be concerned with the benchmarking criteria and national accounting calculations of each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">My third and final observation concerns the issue of how to disclose any technical irregularities to the general public, thereby giving people the idea that irregularities and fraud do take place in the implementation of Community funds.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like to make one final point.

I remember that the first one Mr Wynn produced in 1994, and my own in 1996, produced a different type of debate on discharges than the one we are having today.</p>
<p class="contents">Undoubtedly, as Mr Wynn has indicated to us, should the recommendations of his report be accepted and implemented then we would see a significant step towards getting the Statement of Assurance – DAS – which most of us in this House want. This would give greater credibility to management of funds by European institutions. This means greater responsibilities will have to be taken by all concerned, including responsibilities for the Chief Accounting Officer to sign off the accounts. The Commissioner has shown that he wants to go that way, but I strongly urge that Amendment 4 be adopted. We need Commissioners to take individual responsibility for ensuring directorates-general effectively manage the funds under their responsibilities. We also need to ensure that whistleblowers are properly protected should they wish to come forward with information about the operation of Community policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, we need implementation with regard to the issue of shared management that Marta Andreasen mentioned. Shared management is no management unless there is a proper internal control framework to ensure that monies are properly accounted for in Member States. That is why we as Conservatives strongly support the move towards the greater involvement of Member States in the way in which things should be done.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we welcome very strongly the idea of having proposals by July, with a view to having an interinstitutional agreement by the end of this year. However, they are still just intentions and, therefore, Conservatives will be voting against discharge because, for the tenth year running, we note that there is no positive Statement of Assurance available. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A discharge must allow us to say that the European budget has been properly implemented and to guarantee the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the transactions. A discharge must also allow us to assess the progress made in implementing the recommendations contained in the previous discharge.</p>
<p class="contents">I must therefore express my surprise as to the substance and form of this report, especially the European Parliament section. I do not understand the highly disagreeable tone taken by the rapporteur and the authors of certain amendments concerning all the Members of this Institution. The list of criticisms in fact implies a kind of dishonesty, and I absolutely will not endorse it. I do not think you can heap opprobrium on the Members of the European Parliament in this way. I would like to add that it is inconceivable that we should change the current rules on allowances until we have a single Statute for Members of the European Parliament. Incidentally, is this discharge the right place to talk about the use of tobacco and cigarettes on our premises? It is totally off-subject, though I grant it is a real problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and in particular, what can I say about the calling into question, once again, of the European Parliament’s seat in Strasbourg? May I first of all remind you that, contrary to what the report before us today says about it, Parliament is not competent in the matter. Apart from the 1992 Edinburgh European Council, which decided by unanimous vote of the Heads of State or Government that the European Parliament’s seat should be in Strasbourg for political reasons, that decision was also set forth in Protocol No 12 to the Treaty of Amsterdam so that it could be guaranteed by the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">A year ago, a similar proposal was made to abolish Parliament’s seat in Strasbourg and transfer completely to Brussels, and the Members of the European Parliament in their great wisdom rejected that proposal in plenary session; moreover, the members of the Convention pointed this out when discussing the Constitutional Treaty. The opponents of Strasbourg must not be allowed to use the 2003 discharge to make a renewed attempt to change Parliament’s seat. This question is off-subject and outside our legal competence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Court of Auditors gave a relatively clean bill of health to the internal organisation administration of the structural funds, but that was not the case in relation to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the fundamental problems we have with the whole system is that of shared responsibility. When the Member States fail, the Commission gets the blame. Until we sort out that issue we will not get very far. Therefore I suggested that we should not agree to sign the interinstitutional agreement until the Member States agree to sign annual statements of assurance. I am sorry that some of the other parties did not agree to pre-empt that situation in this report. I hope they will show more backbone when it comes to the interinstitutional agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that we have more preventive measures in order to stop fraud and mismanagement. It is essential that the Commission use the Court of Auditors a bit more in terms of giving opinion on the development of policy. Will the Commissioner give a commitment to ensure that, in future, there is a systematic policy of asking the Court of Auditors for its advice during the development of policy? There is a real opportunity now, in particular with the new seven-year programmes coming up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These issues become more unattractive when something is going wrong, and so if we can approach this work in a positive way then we will have a quiet and calm attitude.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that we have a unique momentum. We have had good discussions with the Council. The Council has expressed its readiness to discuss these issues of shared responsibility, although it is too early to set out the details. We also had good discussions with the Court of Auditors. It too is ready to discuss all the methodology questions and the question of the reliability of ‘audit evidence’. The point is that if we propose some ideas by the summer, that does not mean that we will necessarily get a positive Statement of Assurance – DAS – this year, but at least we will manage do so within a short period of time. So the momentum is unique and I hope that we can propose adequate details and solutions to meet these expectations. I fully agree with what Mr Elles said. This is a very good approach today, a good attitude, but the details must also be expanded upon in an adequate manner.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also find responses to certain demands for simplification, because, being extremely concerned about serious financial control and about surveillance mechanisms, we have introduced enormous amounts of rules, documents and applications. As one honourable Member said, these enormous amounts of rules still do not mean we can fulfil the requirements of all documents in an absolutely legal and correct way. We still waste money and this serious control is still not there.</p>
<p class="contents">We must fulfil programmes. We must implement decisions and we must not have long delays due to the enormous amount of documents and to the need to follow bureaucratic rules. So in parallel with the clear need – especially with regard to the discharge issue – to strengthen and clarify the control and surveillance systems, we must also seriously address the question of dynamism in decision-making, so as not to have a system in which control is impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we will meet soon to discuss possible proposals on how to achieve a more reliable and more transparent control and discharge system for the Community budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
