<p class="contents">I promised, on that occasion, that the Commission would publish a White Paper in 2001, before the summer break. We have kept our promise, and I am particularly happy to be making the first official presentation of the White Paper before the European Parliament. This is not just for reasons of protocol but because the central theme of the White Paper – bringing Europe closer to its citizens – is, in fact, one of the primary concerns of both Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">As the representatives of Europe's citizens, you are, by definition, the legitimate link between the Union and its peoples. Your specific proposals in response to and in addition to the White Paper will therefore be of enormous help to us in drawing up a "road map" for the years ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall be delighted to begin discussing your proposals in detail at Parliament’s next part-session, two weeks from now in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">From the very start of my Presidency, I have stated my firm conviction that we need to rethink the way we are integrating Europe, to establish an exemplary new relationship between Europe's citizens and its political institutions in a historic period in which transparency and accountability are becoming the new rules of governance. However, the Nice summit altered the political landscape in which we have to develop this project. Following the adoption of the Nice Declaration on the Future of Europe by the Intergovernmental Conference, a lively debate on the European Union's future and its ultimate goals has already taken off.</p>
<p class="contents">Both political leaders and European citizens have voiced their opinions. The Europeans expect much of Europe. They want their citizenship of the Union to be meaningful in both symbolic and practical terms, as we saw clearly from the debate about the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, let me say once again that I hope the Charter will be fully integrated into the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has at last begun the great debate on how to achieve a more complete democracy. Our fellow citizens are disenchanted with the present system, they are staying away from elections and their faith in the ability of the political parties to convey the will of the people is fading.</p>
<p class="contents">These are worrying signs and they can be seen everywhere. They concern not just the European institutions but all relations between the people and their representatives, whatever the level.</p>
<p class="contents">The European citizens are concerned because they can see the scale of the radical changes which are transforming our democracies. The effects of globalisation and social change, both of which have been progressing rapidly and uncompromisingly, are profoundly affecting the daily lives of everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">For many years, the European Union project was seen as a beacon of hope and today it is the only concrete, practical, democratic response to the challenges of globalisation. Our European model of democracy, competitiveness and social solidarity, is the only one that can offer our citizens the stable future they are looking for. They can see that no individual Member State can, on its own, withstand the powerful external forces that threaten to break up our societies.</p>
<p class="contents">Many events have cast doubt on our ability to deliver in this great undertaking. The situation has not been improved by some of the opportunities we missed at Nice. It is therefore our prime duty, and a matter of urgency, to publicly rethink and rewrite our rules of governance.</p>
<p class="contents">When we speak of "governance" we are, in fact, discussing democracy: European democracy, how it works, where the problems lie and also what its prospects are.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has therefore chosen to proceed in three stages. In this first stage, the White Paper discusses how we can improve European governance without changing the founding treaties. We are convinced that a great deal can be done simply by changing the way the institutions and the Member States work – applying the existing rules better and more consistently.</p>
<p class="contents">During the second stage, the Commission will state its position on the Laeken process.</p>
<p class="contents">In the third and final stage, the Commission will say what substantive amendments it believes should be made to the founding Treaties as priorities. In preparing its proposals, the Commission will take the fullest possible account of the opinions expressed in the debate triggered by this White Paper and, first and foremost, the criticisms and suggestions made by Parliament, by this House.</p>
<p class="contents">In drawing up its White Paper, the Commission maintained a realistic, practical approach. We therefore concentrated on two aspects of European governance: firstly, the relationships between the citizens, organised civil society, central and local governments and the European institutions; and secondly, how the European institutions operate and interinstitutional relationships.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor could we tell our fellow citizens, yet again, that the only way to solve the outstanding problems of European governance is to amend the founding Treaties. I, for one, do not believe this. It is an over-simplistic solution. We therefore decided that we have to put our own house in order before discussing how to rebuild the city.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Commission chose to focus its White Paper on ways of improving the present system, making better use of the options already open to us under the present Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Many issues can be resolved by courageously applying the prevailing rules already agreed upon and abandoning practices that have caused the European project to deviate from its original objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">What exactly have we done, then, during this first stage?</p>
<p class="contents">The White Paper's analysis and proposals are based on five essential principles: openness, participation, accountability, effectiveness and coherence. These principles complement and reinforce the two fundamental principles already enshrined in our Treaties – subsidiarity and proportionality.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals contained in the White Paper aim to improve the way the Community method works in three ways: by getting the citizens more closely involved in defining the Union's policies, by implementing those policies effectively and by clearly distinguishing between the roles and responsibilities of the European institutions, recognising that each needs to concentrate on doing its own core job.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me explain all this in greater detail.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, we need to get the citizens more closely involved in defining EU policies. This does not mean changing the institutional balance or asking bodies who have not been democratically elected to represent the citizens. That would not be appropriate. You know my views on this: Parliament, this House, is the place where the peoples of the Union are democratically represented.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it does mean taking on a new challenge: the citizens' growing call to be able to make their voices heard not just indirectly through the constitutional organs but more directly via their local governments and citizens' associations as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Our task must not be to oppose this expression of the people's voice and of the complex nature of our societies but rather to channel it, finding new, appropriate ways of entering into dialogue with local authorities and civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">The underlying problem is a lack of communication. If we want to bring the European Union closer to its citizens and make Brussels less remote, we must explain the Union's policies in clear and simple language and open them up to public discussion. We must encourage the emergence of a European network, where all levels of government are involved in shaping, implementing and monitoring EU policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The White Paper proposes a systematic approach to creating this network. It will require better contacts with national, regional and local organisations and bodies in order to shape and implement EU decisions while fully respecting the constitutional organisation of each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also ensure that civil society is fully consulted. I do not, of course, believe that bodies such as NGOs can represent public opinion in the same way as the European Parliament, or in the way that employers' associations and trade unions represent the views of their members.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we have to ensure that the internal organisation of NGOs is based on democratic principles. However, the European Commission does want to draw on their energy and commitment, and the White Paper explores ways of doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the White Paper proposes minimum consultation standards with a two-fold aim: to make it quite clear whom we have consulted, who has given us what advice and whether and how we intend to act on it. Parliament will thus be able to monitor both the quality and the impartiality of the consultation process when taking its decisions in the course of the legislative process.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to the second question of how we can make European Union action more effective:</p>
<p class="contents">Community legislation is often criticised as being too heavy-handed. It is also sometimes perceived as failing to keep pace with rapid technological progress and social change.</p>
<p class="contents">There is some truth in both these criticisms, and we must take it into consideration. Moreover, we can do so, for the existing Treaties provide us with a wide range of instruments enabling us to take action at the appropriate levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, now that the internal market is largely complete, there is much less need for new legislation in this area. The Union should therefore concentrate first and foremost on ensuring that its existing laws are properly and effectively implemented so that the internal market functions as smoothly as possible and that as little distortion of competition occurs as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">What can the Commission do to ensure that European law is of the highest quality? Let me briefly mention five courses of action outlined in our White Paper. Firstly, we intend to take action to restore public confidence in our scientific advice and, more generally, in the way we consult experts. Secondly, in law making, we need a better way of assessing what type of legislation is needed. Thirdly, we need a clearer definition of the circumstances under which Community legislation should be supplemented by other forms of action such as self-regulation or the open method of co-ordination. Fourthly, the Commission intends to concentrate its efforts on those areas that really do require it to assume political responsibility. Other work should be entrusted to EU agencies, whose tasks and responsibilities we must discuss later in detail. Fifthly, we propose that the Commission should consolidate its task of ensuring that Community law is properly applied in the Member States. This is a matter of grave concern, for the present standard of implementation of Community law is disappointing.</p>
<p class="contents">The direct responsibility for the ineffectiveness and unpopularity of European legislation lies primarily with the Member States. To remedy this, the White Paper recommends using regulations in many cases where they would be more appropriate than directives.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, however, the clarity of our primary legislation depends largely on the quality of the work done by the Council and, in the case of co-decision, by this House.</p>
<p class="contents">On the eve of enlargement, we must therefore ensure that European law is of the highest quality and that it is properly and effectively applied.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has clearly set out in its White Paper the action we are going to take to set our own house in order. We hope this will prompt the other institutions and the Member States to do likewise without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">The third and final type of change is aimed at clarifying the different roles and responsibilities of the European institutions so that they can refocus on their core political tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the institutions, practices not intended by the Treaty have developed that have distorted the original Community idea conceived by Europe's founding fathers. If correctly applied, the existing Treaty would separate clearly the roles of Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the Court of Justice and the other institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In practice, however, Europe's citizens find themselves confused by types of action that blur this clear distinction of roles. People no longer understand who proposes, who decides and who monitors. Still less do they understand which institution is responsible for which action, whether responsibility lies with the European institutions or with the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to rectify this situation swiftly and resolutely and, to achieve this, we do not, in the short term, need to amend the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Refocusing on our core political tasks, as recommended in the White Paper, means reformulating our European Union policies and therefore reorganising the way our three institutions – the Council, Parliament and the Commission – operate and cooperate.</p>
<p class="contents">The most glaring example of how the system has been distorted is our comitology. The Council, which is supposed to be a legislative body, is taking on an executive role, while Parliament, also a legislative institution, is excluded from this part of the procedure. The Commission, which is supposed to be the executive, has to negotiate details with the legislator, but the Council assumes none of the consequent political responsibility because, in reality, it is officials from the national authorities – that is the Member States directly – that take part in the meetings of experts.</p>
<p class="contents">We need simple mechanisms allowing the Council and the European Parliament to work on an equal footing, monitoring the Commission’s work and thereby ensuring that it adheres to the principles and political guidelines adopted by the legislator.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union's overall political priorities must be expressed and discussed in formal, regular policy debates such as the European Council meetings, the Commission President's annual State of the Union address to Parliament and other formal, political debates.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the question of how we can improve the way the Commission, the Council and Parliament work together. The greatest obstacle to clear policymaking is the opaque way in which the Council of Ministers operates and its increasing inability, especially at meetings of the General Affairs Council, to reconcile sectoral conflicts of interest before the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">There is much that can, and should, be done to improve European governance in this respect, without it being necessary to amend the Treaties. The purpose of our White Paper proposals is this, just this, but the change will be far-reaching.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I feel that this House too needs to refocus on its core tasks, concentrating on Parliament's decision-making role, on monitoring the implementation of policy and on its great budgetary responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Respectfully but firmly, the White Paper suggests that the European Parliament should "depart from the present emphasis on detailed accounting" and move towards "more policy-oriented control based on political objectives". As guardian of the Treaty, it is my duty to point in this direction, but it is not for me to say how the change should be brought about. That is for you to decide.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, changes must be made to the way in which the three institutions work together. The refocusing must be an inter-institutional process. We need to make it clearer who is responsible for what legislative and executive tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has long since ceased to be a mere common market: it has become a political entity and the citizens of Europe know this. We shall all have very tangible proof of this when euro coins and notes are in our pockets in few weeks’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of Europe want this Union to be theirs. That means building a climate of trust between the citizens and the institutions and a climate of trust between the Member States themselves and between the institutions and the Member States too. Rebuilding trust between Europe and its citizens also means giving them a clear understanding of its objectives and of the powers of the different institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The time has come to make these ambitious goals a reality. Our White Paper is the initial contribution which will allow us to launch a complex process forthwith. Together, we have the chance to revitalise the European project, the chance to secure it on the firm foundations of mature, transparent, genuine democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I appeal to you not to let this opportunity pass us by.</p>

<p class="contents">It seems to me that the forty pages of this White Paper are forty dense pages, full of reflection and proposals. But I also believe that your comments were splendid, succinct, full of ideas and vision, and I would like to congratulate you on behalf of my group.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I believe that your manner of presenting the White Paper has been correct. You have done so modestly, and that is to your credit. The White Paper is a departure point. It is just a text which leads to reflection and now we have to ask our co-citizens to participate in this reflection, to offer ideas and to send projects.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that all of us in this Parliament agree on the analysis of the situation, that we all wonder what is happening to the European Union and why our co-citizens sometimes show a lack of confidence. I believe that the White Paper explains this well: the benefits of the European Union are general and they often pass unnoticed; however, the disadvantages are specific. I remember the effect in my country when lorries of strawberries were overturned by French farmers. This always happened at the same time of year, one week, and it was just a very isolated incident. That created enormous anti-European feeling: ‘Why does the European Union not worry about us, the European Union does not care for us’. That ended as a result of the efforts of the European Commission, amongst others. Surely the Spanish, or many of them, do not realise that.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that our main problem is that we are European without knowing it and without doubt this White Paper has a good role to play in this pedagogical zeal to explain what Europe is and what the European Union is for.</p>
<p class="contents">The second idea that I would like to highlight on behalf of my group is that this White Paper stresses the originality of the system which has operated over the last fifty years. Furthermore, it supports the continuation of this system which we call the ‘Community method’, yet nobody questions this. Today I have been very glad to hear President Prodi talk about maintaining the balance between the institutions: this seems to me essential.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party, which has always tenaciously supported the European Commission having a monopoly on the exercise of legislative initiative, believes that it is very positive that that legislative initiative, when it comes about, should count on the participation of many more players: of what we call civil society, of local and regional authorities; above all especially if we do so, as Mr Prodi said, without in any way altering the balance between the institutions or the constitutional status of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, this Parliament is also going to cooperate in this task of contributing ideas. And it is doing so by means of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs whose rapporteur on this issue will be Mrs Kaufmann, and it is also doing so on all those issues which are eventually going to be combined with the reflection of the Commission which President Prodi called the third reflection, which is going to come together in the debate of the IGC 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">This White Paper is very important because we are at a moment of the historic constituent process of the European Union, and that process opened with declaration 23 at Nice. I am sure that the presence of Commissioner Barnier is in response to this. Therefore, this will be a further element of this process, which is important, and visionary, and which is necessary when Europe is preparing for the euro, for enlargement and for the debate on what we Europeans want. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Swoboda (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen. I can agree on behalf of my group with much of what has been said today, Mr President. I just wonder why it was not set out this clearly in the White Paper which you submitted, unfortunately at a time at which we were unable to discuss it directly. A White Paper on European governance really should have been submitted to Parliament first.</p>
<p class="contents">You said, Mr President, that Parliament represents the people of the Union. Correct. But if you look at the White Paper, this premise is hardly anywhere to be found, at least not in the prominent and leading place in which it belongs. I do not say this just to blow our own trumpet but because we should not spread the illusion harboured by many a non-governmental organisation that the parliamentary and democratic process could, to a certain extent, be replaced by dialogue with civil society. It cannot replace it but it can and it must complement it. That is one important aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to my second point. Yes, our group is in favour of strengthening consultation with civil society, whatever your interpretation of that concept may be. I just wonder, Mr President, if the Commission has the staff it needs in order to do so to the extent claimed here? At least, you say nothing about how you intend to bring this off. Secondly, you barely mention how you intend to liaise with Parliament here. Yes, you say that Parliament has already started this process. Quite right. But we need to strengthen it. We need to approach things jointly, as you said today, because our citizens react to the European Union, rather than to individual institutions. That is why I call on you to table proposals based on your concept of how a joint, efficient, feasible dialogue can be conducted because what is depicted here will result in a plethora of consultation processes and that contradicts the very principle of efficiency which you stand for. But we are prepared to discuss this with you.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, delegating decisions. You are quite right, Mr President; a parliament which wants to pass every detailed decision and regulation is a very stupid parliament. But what is the position on the call back or fall back position which Parliament keeps calling for? You say nothing about it in your White Paper. Are you for or against it? You surely do not entertain the notion that Parliament will agree to delegate regulatory powers and jurisdiction without the facility to call them back if things go wrong? We have already had our fingers burned once with the Lamfalussy report. Some Commissioner or other – I do not want to name names – did not approve of this process of cooperation, even in the case of delegation, hence our scepticism and suspicion. Not because we reject it, but because we still cannot condone the practice of the Commission at this point in time.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, you refer several times in your White Paper to getting back to basics, on focusing on basics once more. But you do not define them – basics since when? Basics for the Commission and the European Union are not the same today as they were 20 years ago and they will be different in the future. I do wonder, with many of the Commission’s proposals, if these really are the basics for the European Union. In other areas – just think of asylum, immigration and so on, you are faced with new basics. To think backwards and say, we must get back to yesterday’s basics is hardly the right policy for the European Union. But I admit that you are right and I hope that the Commission will define what it sees as basics for the future, for the next ten years because that is an ongoing decision which we want to discuss with the Council and the Commission. Agenda setting, defining political priorities year on year, is not just the job of the Council and the Commission, it is also the job of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">So much for the critical points and now there is no time left for the other points. But I think that it is more use to you if we voice our criticism and then offer to hold a dialogue with you over the coming months so that we can bring about a joint result.</p>

President Prodi has drawn attention to the paradox that people want the Union to be doing more in several fields but they still distrust the system of government. The Commission is therefore quite right to focus on improving the Commission's representative capacity, especially at the pre-legislative stage. I would also want a strong emphasis on improving the post-legislative phase, monitoring far more closely the way European policies are put into effect on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">My group welcomes the Commission's emphasis on decentralised management and on a reinforced role for the regions. The European region plays a vital part as the intermediary between the citizen and the supranational authorities. We also note the kind suggestion that Parliament feeds into the European system the views of its own electors. What else we are up to, I am not quite sure. But the place that we intend to do this is in the new convention that we trust will be set up at Laeken, a concept that strangely receives not a single mention throughout the entire White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">Would Mr Prodi agree that the White Paper will be a most sensible contribution to the work of that convention? Would he say exactly the way he sees the furtherance of the work on the White Paper fitting in with that of the convention? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is difficult to find any specific detail in the current reform of the Commission, in the fundamental declarations in Nice on the future of the Union or in the new IGC. We are therefore searching for the meaning. Could it perhaps be the case that differences of opinion in the board of Commissioners and pressure from some Member States have combined to reduce the scope of this White Paper?</p>
<p class="contents">We also support greater involvement of mainstream society. That is positive. However, as Democrats, we are concerned about the sections on better policy and better legislation, and on the orientation of policy initiatives and institutions. We attach special importance to institutional equilibrium. Other speakers have already made that point, for example as regards the impact on the powers and role of the European Parliament of a greater use of “soft law” instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we wonder whether the new regulatory bodies we are promised and the proposed external executive bodies can be adequately monitored. We have not forgotten the whole chapter involving the BTB. Neither have you, I hope.</p>
<p class="contents">We are positively disposed towards the proposal that the Council and the European Parliament should play an equal role in supervising the way in which the Commission fulfils its executive task.</p>
<p class="contents">But I have other concerns. As a regionalist, I feel bound to say that the importance of the region has actually declined. There is virtually no trace here of ‘bottom-up governance’. We cannot find the ‘multi-level governance’ in which all administrative strata are involved – which was also asked for by Mr Duff. The differences of opinion in the board of Commissioners have obviously actually led to regional involvement on the final decision-making being scrapped. The Commission limits itself to a more systematic dialogue with European and national associations of regional and local authorities at an early stage in decision-making.</p>
<p class="contents">In contrast to the draft White Paper and the report of the Commission’s preparatory working party 4 C, provision is no longer made for a differentiation in regional involvement depending on the type of Member State: unitary, decentralised, regionalised or federal. As a result, we are now going backwards compared to the present constitutional powers already enjoyed by some regions in certain Member States, for example Belgium. You can imagine that this will not excite much enthusiasm in our regions for the governance outlined here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is to your honour that, like earlier Commission presidents, you want to leave your personal mark on the Commission. Your concern to take measures which will at last close the gap between the Union and its citizens is one which I wholeheartedly support. As does the overwhelming majority of the House. We want to do something, at long last, to turn a citizens’ Europe from a slogan into a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">With all due respect for your concern, Mr President of the Commission, I must say to you in all honesty that I am disappointed in what now lies before us. I have handed out this White Paper and asked our citizens what they think of it. Do you know what the immediate problem was? They had no idea what the 40 odd pages were about. It is all pure Eurospeak, was the reply. How, I wonder, can we possibly close this gap if the language is incomprehensible to its target audience?</p>
<p class="contents">The White Paper contains positive ideas, such as strengthening the role of the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions or stepping up consultation with organisations in civil society, it is true. Nonetheless, I should like briefly to address a few crucial questions.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic political problem of the White Paper is obvious, I think, right from the start. It says that people think the Union is incapable of acting where action is needed, for example, on unemployment. This reading of the problem is simply not true. The citizens do not think the Union is incapable; on the contrary, their experience on a daily basis is that the Union and its Member States have proven they are incapable. Mr Prodi, you quite rightly said in your speech that, when we speak of governance, we are really talking about democracy. You quite rightly addressed the problem of the democratisation of the European Union here today, but why can I only find trace elements of it in the White Paper itself?</p>
<p class="contents">One last word on the question of revising the Treaty. The White Paper makes provision for a consultation stage up to March 2002. The final proposals are then due to be submitted a further six months later. Surely it is absurd to present proposals geared to the current Treaties in the autumn of this year, when we will already have been working flat out, hopefully in a convention, on revising the Treaties. Dispensing with amendments to the Treaty, as you have posited, is not, in my view, a viable proposition, quite apart from the fact that you suggest a revision in the White Paper itself.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, Mr President of the Commission, even after what my fellow members have said, I see a need for extensive discussion and I offer you Parliament's and my personal assistance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It could be said that it is revealing – and not just because of the linguistic wrangle which took place this summer – that, despite its best efforts at external openness, transparency and accountability towards the public, the Commission chose, right in the middle of the summer, to adopt a document with an untranslatable title.</p>
<p class="contents">There were other terms available which would have been translatable and, most importantly, comprehensible, both linguistically and otherwise: the rule of law, the separation of powers, thorough guidelines for Community mechanisms, democratisation of the Treaties, a European Constitution, legal certainty and so on and so forth. You decided to ignore almost all these pillars of our national States even though, as you know, they are greatly lacking in our European Union system. I hope that “governance” is not going to become a kind of <span class="italic">de facto</span>, free-trade Italian-style Constitution which favours partisan ideals, which, as we are quite aware, is the case with the current Italian Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Civil society, for example, Mr President, is what exposed Israel at Durban, prompting countries to walk out of that conference. Those countries had a sense of responsibility which I did not see in our Union. I do not know whether that is the civil society to which you are referring, but I am somewhat fearful because, as Mr Swoboda said, although, today, you have delivered a very pro-Parliament speech, the text itself contains very few references to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely because I want a strong, authoritative Commission that I am saying this. I do not want it to be reduced to a think tank or, at best, a supervisory body for a couple of industry sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Mr President, be bold! In my opinion, this text does not go far enough. This operation will not suffice as it stands: if the rule of law and the legal certainties are to make proper headway in this Union, they must be defined now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In some places, the report is so critical that I might have written it myself. What I do not see, however, is an attendant list of practical, precise and binding proposals which would open the legislative process to the people.</p>
<p class="contents">In Italy, Mr Prodi has a good proposal about naming those who have been consulted. We are concerned here with a list, which ought to accompany any bill, of who has been consulted, and all the answers given in consultations should be available on the Internet. Mr Prodi also has another proposal about preferring regulations to directives. That runs directly counter to our era’s demand for decentralisation. On the contrary, countries require greater freedom in implementing directives. Strawberries need not be of the same size in Italy as in Finland.</p>
<p class="contents">The paper talks a lot about more consultation, but it looks as though the aim is to create more support for the Commission’s ‘top-down’ proposal. What I do not see is a proper concept of democracy that involves starting from the bottom. Which issues cross borders? Which can we not manage for ourselves? In which areas do we want the Commission to produce proposals? Mr Prodi always has fine things to say about transparency, but he also has a department for refusing the right of access to documents. Could the Commission not merge that department with the department for fine words about transparency, leaving just the one department? For example, I have still not received a complete list of the people consulted in the 1,500 committees and working parties that exist today. Those who support Mr Prodi are not delivering the goods. It looks as though he too has been imprisoned in his own fortress. Might I suggest that Mr Prodi issue his promises about transparency as a regulation, binding his supporters in every respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are losing the citizens’ confidence, as the no vote in the Irish referendum showed. However your solutions are extremely weak. Better governance would be more transparency, increased consultation, increased communication, increased participation and a more open method of communication, for example. To be brief, Mr Prodi, these are the changes that would certainly be desirable for the European institutions to make to the way they work, but they will only have a marginal effect if they are not combined with deep-rooted changes in the balance of institutional powers. The people think, and we also think, that certain problems would be better resolved by better European cooperation, but, at the same time, they resolutely and constantly attaches most legitimacy to the national framework. That said, the conclusion is very simple: to strengthen the legitimacy of European cooperation, to make contact once more with the citizens, great influence and a much more visible role need to be given to the nation states within the European decision-making process. This is the basic condition for a true democracy, a word that is scarcely mentioned, moreover, Mr President, in your White Paper. All the rest is just idle chit-chat. For example, how can it be that, in your White Paper, we find developments in the involvement of regional and local structures in European politics, developments in decentralised management, in coregulation with various – non-identified – organisations, and how can it be that there is absolutely no mention of the essential role of national Parliaments in the European decision-making process? I imagine, Mr President, that, in your position, you were not able to resolve this issue, but the White Paper could at least have raised it. The best communication you could hope for is useless if European policies do not revolve around the crucial role of national democracies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, I would like to start by thanking all the speakers, for they have made extremely useful contributions to this debate, which will serve as the foundation for more detailed analysis. I would, however, like to touch on a few basic points, a few of the points underlying this document, so that we will then be able to work together to improve and add to it.</p>
<p class="contents">We have indeed set out a road map in this document, but this is the just the initial proposal: debates will continue to be held and it is only during the next stage that the final document will be produced. I have therefore taken note (and will continue to do so) of your comments because this is an initial proposal which needs everyone to contribute to it before the final version can be established.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is the issue of the language and title etc.<span class="bold"> </span>of the White Paper. You are indeed right but, in all honesty, I have to say that I have read countless national laws and I have also endeavoured to make a great many. Mention just one which is written in language that the ordinary citizen can understand. They are all written in specialised language. We have done absolutely everything possible to use appropriate language but it is the concepts themselves whose technical nature is ultimately a problem for the ordinary citizen. Our task is precisely that of explaining, of bridging the gap, but we cannot allow proposals to be less precisely worded.</p>
<p class="contents">An example is the discussion on the term “governance”. I understand perfectly what Mr dell’Alba is saying, but the problem is that we do not use one single language: we are fortunate and proud to be able to use 11, and there will soon be 20. Therefore, we must endeavour to adapt. The title we have selected is not a title I like much, precisely because there is never a single term which translates appropriately into all the languages. We have a duty to understand each other as well as possible, even though we do not always manage to do so with the precision we would like.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, relations with Parliament. My aim in delivering this speech today was not to please Parliament. What I have said to you today regarding Parliament’s role and relations with NGOs and civil society and their different functions are things I often say, things I have repeated a thousand times and things which I have attempted to put into practice transparently during the last 18 months in relations with this House. The fact that our relations are certainly more effective, more functional, smoother and more open than they were previously is precisely because I consider that the basis of the new Europe must be a fundamental role for Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I have been criticised for many omissions, including the debate on the definition of the role of local authorities. As I recall, we imposed a limit on ourselves in this White Paper: we will not amend the Treaties. Therefore, it is not the purpose of the White Paper to change the delegation of powers. We must make this enormous effort to best adapt our way of working to our tasks but without amending the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Then in the second phase, which is separate from the first phase, we will present the proposals for Laeken, and then, in the third phase, we will make an active contribution and we will have to work on the institutional reforms together.</p>
<p class="contents">After the Nice decisions had been taken, we had to take note of this and use a methodology which respected the necessary changes. However, remember that democracy is made of practices as well as rules. In my opinion, as we have seen from my speech and your debates, it is possible to improve the way we work without amending any legislation. I therefore believe that we must work together to that end.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of specific points emerged in the debate which I feel are particularly important. The issue of the delegation of powers to the Commission was mentioned. The Commission, consistently with what I said regarding not modifying legislation, is not asking for more powers but wants to organise its work more transparently and efficiently, getting back to the definitions in the founding Treaties of the Union, which, in laying down the organisation of the institutions, state that the Council and Parliament make decisions, the Commission executes policy (although not the technical detail) and Parliament monitors. When we have finished, the Commission will probably have less to do than it does at present, but the confusing part of the comitology practice, which extends processes and does not make the difference between our and your roles completely clear, will be avoided. In this case, Parliament and the Commission are equally involved because we are both mixed up in this comitology practice and we are both dissatisfied. Therefore, let us now say what we tell each other in our private conversations regarding the inadequacy of this process, here in this Chamber, for that way we can do something about it.</p>
<p class="contents">An objection was raised regarding the direct responsibility of local authorities in the decision-making process. We must remember that, although the basis for this is the decentralisation, the subsidiarity debate, the objective is to take into account, in an organised and transparent way, the opinions of the end users and executors of the common policies while respecting the institutional structures of each Member State. We cannot interfere with the sacrosanct organisation of the Member States. They define the role of the meetings, they define their institutional system and, if we were to interfere, we would be committing an act of violation and, most importantly, we would be going against the principle of subsidiarity by which we are absolutely and closely bound.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to focus very briefly on some of Mr Swoboda’s objections because he has touched on points which must be dealt with. One of them is a point which might appear banal: consultation, civil society and resources. I do not think we are talking about huge resources, but it is clearly the European Parliament itself which will have to describe to us in the debate, agree upon and give us the resources we need. In my opinion, although we have not done any calculations during this phase, the amount will be a modest sum, but this is one of the areas that we must discuss together for Parliament is the budgetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">A further point is the delegation of competences and agencies. I am talking about the delegation of practical and technical activities, not political delegation, for no delegation is permitted in these areas. They are subjects which must be dealt with by the institutional authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr Swoboda raised another, extremely important point: discussing what the Commission’s core tasks are, namely its political priorities. I would repeat that the Commission has undertaken – and it is no coincidence that I listed it among the annual commitments – to define its political priorities before Parliament each year. This is the practice we have presented, we have proposed and we believe we must follow closely so that, each year, as happens in the most democratic and transparent government structures, the political priorities are presented to Parliament and debated in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why this White Paper, would appear, on the one hand, to be a genuinely innovative, substantial move towards democracy and transparency; on the other, some areas of it are still vague but this is because it is a proposal which we could not present as a finished product today: we need to work together to refine and develop it. It is the framework, an outline, and I would like to thank you for your criticism today which, I am sure, will be a great help to us in our future work.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by thanking you and by saying simply that we must view all this precisely in the context of the three stages of the major European reform which we have outlined and which will be implemented over the next three years: firstly, reorganisation of the way we work internally; secondly, working together to plan how we should organise the major process of reforming the institutions, therefore Laeken; and thirdly, how to carry out the process of reforming the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that today’s debate is good preparation for the other two stages. I would like to thank you because, in debating this issue today, we have initiated cooperation which will last for almost a year, until we present the final version of this White Paper and it becomes our self-regulation instrument, as Mr dell’Alba would call it. That is, it will become the code, the rule which will enable us to work effectively and get back to the true spirit and meaning of the Treaties, to get back to the core working role of each institution.</p>
