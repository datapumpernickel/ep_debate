<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Berthu </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the action plan on an area of freedom, security and justice, presented by the Austrian Presidency and adopted by the Vienna European Council in December 1998, is quite a rigorous text. Its clear aim is to ensure that the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty are implemented in a realistic way. The same cannot be said for the European Parliament report on this subject which has just been adopted by the House today. As usual, it seeks to put the federalist obsession before the real needs of the people.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, the European Council"s action plan declares from the outset that although freedom of movement is a fundamental objective of the Treaty, this must generally be assessed bearing in mind the security requirements. According to this text, freedom involves more than the free movement of people as ‘it is also freedom to live in a law‐abiding environment". On the subject of immigration and asylum policies, the Council text then adds that ‘particular priority needs to be attached to combating illegal immigration".</p>
<p class="contents">However, the tone changes completely in the European Parliament report. The main priority becomes, and I quote, ‘a more positive definition of fundamental rights and European citizenship". It is as if the Member States used to be part of a semi‐barbaric state where the rights of the individual were constantly being violated and where we had waited for centuries for the Eurocrats to appear and finally impose the rule of law. Clearly, we are all being taken for half‐wits.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these conditions, it is no surprise to see that, on matters involving the movement of people, the European Parliament regards freedom of movement as the primary Community right, whereas combating illegal immigration is buried in the middle of a list of other objectives. Our position is obviously closer to the Council"s although we would stipulate that each Member State must retain sovereign control over its territory.</p>

However, we believe that the proposals it contains to give Europol operational powers and to establish a European public prosecutor are incompatible with what has already been laid down in this area. Europol should merely complement and assist national police forces and not be able to take direct action against our citizens. As regards the establishment of a European public prosecutor, we are opposed to such a move because there is no supranational cooperation on matters of criminal law. Cooperation in this area should continue to be intergovernmental.</p>

The report is a broad survey of the various instruments aimed at ensuring the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice. The Danish Social Democrats are in favour of ensuring the basic rights for people living in the EU. However, there are several demands in the report which we oppose. These include the introduction of a ‘Corpus Juris', harmonising the basic provisions of procedural law in the Member States and operational powers for Europol.

It provides a fair analysis of the action plan of the Council and Commission on implementing an area of freedom, security and justice. This plan responds to the demand of the Cardiff European Council and is part of a clear and ambitious approach to engage the Union in reforms which will bring it closer to the people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">An area of this kind clearly can only be constructed gradually. The Schengen Agreement, the Maastricht Treaty and, of course, the Amsterdam Treaty have been important steps in this construction process. I am also pleased to see that a new Title headed ‘Visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to free movement of persons" has been inserted in the Treaty establishing the European Community. This will allow consistency to be increased in the key areas directly affecting the people of Europe. However, I must indicate my disagreement with the retention of the exemption clause benefiting the United Kingdom, Denmark and Ireland. Everyone is well aware of the exorbitant cost in terms of consistency of an overly flexible Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenges of creating such an area are extremely great. The rapporteur rightly asserts that this area must be one of the Union"s priorities. I support this idea because we must meet the expectations of our people who aspire to live securely within the borders of the European Union. The response to this legitimate demand requires improved border controls and the prevention of crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Being secure also implies knowing that you can assert your rights by having recourse to justice. We all know, myself in particular, that cross‐border disputes sometime pose inextricable problems. We must therefore act to simplify access to the courts and to facilitate cooperation between the judicial authorities of each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, one of the basic points is to draw up a Charter of fundamental rights. Such a text will clearly identify the rights which the people may assert within the European Union. This will ensure that the famous concept of European citizenship, which for many remains an empty shell, will finally take shape. The level of these rights must be as high as possible. The Court of Justice of the European Communities must act as guarantor of these rights. It is absolutely unacceptable that the latter"s jurisdiction is limited on such matters.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the debate which will take place on this subject in October 1999 in Finland will be productive because there are still gaps despite the positive advances. The role of the European Parliament must go beyond simple consultation and the unanimity rule must be replaced by the qualified majority rule.</p>

<p class="contents">The report emphasises its support for the so‐called ‘Corpus Juris' proposal, which is aimed at introducing a European public prosecutor who would be in charge of legal proceedings. At the same time, it stresses that minimum rules should be established for what constitutes a criminal offence and what penalties should be applied. If these efforts come to fruition, it would mean the establishment not only of a political area but also a judicial area in the EU, where Member States would be obliged to harmonise their different legal traditions and different moral views about what constitutes a criminal offence. In doing so, we believe that EU cooperation is taking a major step towards the establishment of a federal state. No one knows what implications the proposals in the report carry with them, but it is clear that the proposed encroachment on national sovereignty is in conflict with the derogations provided for individual Member States with regard to the police and the judiciary, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU's efforts to establish an area of freedom, security and justice are aimed at safeguarding the legal rights of individuals. We do not believe that legal rights and public confidence in the judicial and political systems will be strengthened by undermining the various judicial cultures of individual Member States and by transferring competence to a system which does not have substantial support among the peoples of the Member States. The provisions in the field of justice and home affairs should therefore be a matter for national governments.</p>

<p class="contents">According to the rapporteur, the combating of crime should be addressed at EU level and Europol should be given operational powers. First and foremost, we believe it is unnecessary to set up another organisation when Interpol, incorporating as it does some 150 member countries, exists and functions very well. Moreover, the structure of Europol is undemocratic and it is our firm belief that, as a result, people's personal integrity will be threatened and their right to legal security replaced by a lack of judicial protection.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, harmonisation of the Member States' policies in the area of visa, immigration and asylum policy is undesirable. Furthermore, as long as people actually seek asylum in specific countries, any such harmonisation is very hard to justify.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur would like to see a harmonisation of international private law. That would be undesirable, since judgments, particularly in family law, currently vary so widely in the individual Member States. Moreover, it is unnecessary when the most important aspect from a commercial point of view, namely the provisions of international private law which govern contracts, are already regulated by the Rome Convention. The same also applies to the report's stated aim of facilitating recognition by the courts. Many of the points are already regulated by the Brussels and Lugano Conventions respectively, as well as another convention on family law that is in the process of being drawn up. We have come to the conclusion that the rapporteur seems to favour harmonisation purely for its own sake.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the harmonisation of legal procedures, the functioning of the courts is an important part of the national legal culture which also differs markedly from one Member State to another.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of criminal law, it is worth noting that the crimes which are to be targeted for harmonisation are very broadly defined. It is worth recalling that in Germany and France, for example, it is an offence to deny so‐called historical truths, something which is in direct conflict with Sweden's right to freedom of expression. Criminal law is the State's ultimate instrument of enforcement, and it is most important that decisions on what it should include and how it should be practised are genuinely democratic. It is not worth taking the risk of forcing countries to redefine criminal law solely on the grounds that it will be possible to punish some types of crime more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is an express wish to abolish the dual criminality requirement for extradition, in other words that extradition can only take place if the offence committed is punishable in both countries. This requirement exists in order to guard against a particular view being taken of what actually constitutes an offence. In view of the major differences that exist between the Member States in this respect, the requirement should remain.</p>

The fight against crime on the Internet is transnational by nature, and there is therefore a need for international and European cooperation in this area.

<p class="contents">Although Internet users and service providers clearly have a role to play in this fight for human dignity, we cannot rely on them alone. I therefore believe that certain individual or collective initiatives must be welcomed. Thanks to this cooperation with the competent authorities, many examples of these abhorrent dealings have been stopped from causing harm.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in my opinion it is essential to pool our human and material resources through Europol in order to make the fight against these crimes more effective.</p>

<p class="contents">However, although the European Union is taking an important step in this fight, it is essential that we establish a strong initiative with regard to third countries so that these networks cannot gain a foothold in any other countries.</p>

We regret that the important issues of asylum seekers and refugees from civil war are linked time and again to various ideological demands: see Amendment No 12 on voting rights and so forth. This makes it more difficult for us to help in real emergencies. The hypocrisy of those who vote in favour of amendments of this kind is intolerable, since it is precisely they who are then not prepared in cases such as that of the Kosovo refugees and displaced persons to take in their share of displaced persons. Take France, for example: Mr Jospin has not taken in anyone from Kosovo. In Bavaria, we have already created the capacity for 7 000 people.</p>
<p class="contents">This is about us providing real and practical help and not continuing to overburden this important subject with our own ideological and unrealistic desires. If this continues to happen and there is a real emergency, we will remain inflexible, we will not be able to help, and we will provoke unwelcome public opinion. That is why I call on the left of the House finally to reach a consensus on these issues.</p>

It states that ‘Neither the potential will to emigrate nor actual emigration from the main regions of origin has decreased in the past five years (rather the opposite). Furthermore, neither the control activities at the external borders of Schengen and the Union nor the Member States" laws on aliens and asylum stop illegal migration." The paper also very rightly notes the changes which have occurred in the types of migratory movement. In previous decades, these movements largely resulted from the bipolarity between the Western and Communist worlds whereas they are now mainly caused by conflicts between ethnic groups, which are followed by exoduses, or the precarious living conditions in many countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, the Council"s strategy paper calls for a review of objectives and the ‘Europeanisation" of instruments. In particular it makes the following proposals: reduction of migratory pressure at source by intervening in the main countries of origin of immigrants; reduction of illegal immigration by reinforcing controls and stepping up the fight against illegal immigration networks; definition of an overall concept of control of legal entry to the Member States, specifically in the country of departure, in the transit states and in the country of final destination, and finally, greater recourse to quantitative control methods (quotas) for new immigration, including the reunification of families.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of these objectives, we can only be concerned about the proposal for a new refugee protection system which in many cases risks forming an additional magnet.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, in the Reding report the European Parliament has tried to reduce or completely alter the force of these proposals. This clearly demonstrates the problems which we would face if an attempt was made to establish a somewhat restrictive immigration policy in codecision with Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">It is specifically in the second chapter, involving the institutional instruments of the policies to be conducted, that the Austrian Presidency"s document seems most lacking. It goes without saying that the migration problem is affecting all the European countries and that it would be preferable to define a European response. However, this response would only make sense if it was more stringent than the current policy. Specifically, the European institutional system, as provided for by the Amsterdam Treaty, with the Commission"s monopoly on initiative and the codecision of the European Parliament, risks producing a laxer response. We are therefore overwhelmed with contradictions.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the definition of a European policy should not mean abolishing all national independence in decision‐making. Otherwise, we risk removing responsibility from the Member States and once again achieving a result which is contrary to that intended. The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations therefore believes that this policy must be maintained in a context where decisions are taken unanimously, with a safeguard clause to be used at the discretion of the Member States thus allowing rapid corrections if necessary.</p>

In normal circumstances it is only criminals or suspected criminals that are fingerprinted. The idea that people as young as 14 are to be fingerprinted is completely unacceptable. It just goes to show the attitude that the EU has towards asylum seekers and refugees: automatically the first thing they are classified as is criminals. This whole thing has been pushed through in the guise of protecting asylum seekers and refugees, but it clearly is not. It is just going to endanger them, threaten them much further and put them in an extremely vulnerable situation. At the end of the day, they are being treated like criminals. We cannot accept that. We have to look at how we treat asylum seekers and refugees, especially in the current situation where there is a lot of anxiety about what is happening in the former Yugoslavia and the number of refugees there.</p>
<p class="contents">Are we going to treat people who are unfortunate enough to be seeking asylum or fleeing persecution as criminals? I do not think we should.</p>

Even as I am speaking, thousands of Kosovars are being brutally deported from their country, having been hounded from their homes, and are now packed into emergency refugee camps waiting to possibly return to their country. Some of them, particularly those in Macedonia, are being forced to board planes for unknown destinations. We, the Member States of the European Union, must welcome these refugees as required. This means that we must allow them every dignity and subsequently do everything in our power to ensure that they can quickly return to their country.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this context that we are discussing the proposed Joint Action today. I fully support its objectives which are to improve reception conditions for displaced persons and asylum seekers and to facilitate the voluntary return of refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">We must improve the reception conditions in material terms but also in human terms because these people are more often than not in a state of utter psychological turmoil.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not need to say any more for you have all seen the terrible pictures broadcast constantly on television screens around the world, except on Serbian television of course!</p>
<p class="contents">Reception is only the first stage. We must also facilitate the return of these people to their country and ensure their reintegration.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I must point out a shortcoming, the gravity of which is underlined by the events in the Balkans. The Commission has omitted to include an essential aspect which the European Parliament put forward, namely emergency aid in cases of sudden influxes of refugees from a region affected by a severe crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must highlight Parliament"s commitment to refugees and its ability to anticipate events. For the 1999 financial year, this House proposed creating a European Refugee Fund. From the year 2000 this Fund should finance the whole refugee policy.

However, I must reiterate the concerns expressed previously and incorporated into the amendments for which I was jointly responsible. The rejection of these amendments is the reason why I and my group voted against this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Regardless of the fact that a tax which alters the production functions cannot be regarded as neutral, it is important in terms of this neutrality to ask whether this is just one attainable objective or the ultimate objective to be attained. It is actually more important to achieve a more prosperous economy offering employment opportunities. This is a priority objective and we must determine whether this will be damaged by excessive taxation of energy.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, as one of the primary concerns must be not to distort competition between production sectors and means of transport, we must avoid unjustifiably penalising some and not others. The labour costs of each one must of course be taken into account but this cannot be the only circumstance considered, in case we unfairly let off other sectors and methods of transport which are equally noisy and polluting.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, you will understand if I again express unanswered concerns about social justice and economic cohesion. It is not acceptable to aggravate the situations of families with more modest resources who must spend higher percentages of their incomes on energy. Also, the situation of peripheral countries must not be worsened by forcing these to incur higher transport costs, particularly where this involves means of transport which are necessarily large energy consumers – as in the case of road transport – for which realistic alternatives cannot immediately be found.</p>

They are also a result of the Council"s request, following the deadlock in negotiations on the CO<span class="sub">2</span> /energy tax, to put forward new proposals in the field of taxation of energy products.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of any tax should be that it is simple to understand, easy to collect, predictable and difficult to evade. This is why we are in favour of the polluter pays principle.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations shares with all sectors of economic activity a deep concern at the introduction of new taxes on energy products or the increase of the present taxes. We consider that the establishment of a Community framework for the taxation of energy products, with the Member States having the opportunity to act in a flexible manner in their application of indirect taxes, may provide an appropriate escape route from the dilemma into which the failure of the CO<span class="sub">2</span> /energy tax has led the Union. This may also be a way of achieving the internal energy market and may provide a necessary response to the undertakings given in Kyoto.</p>
<p class="contents">Taxation actually partly determines the price of energy products. It may therefore act as an incentive to optimise energy consumption by increasing energy efficiency and by reducing the emission of pollutants into the air and the overall generation of waste.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider that a comprehensive ecologically‐based tax reform may provide a real weapon for combating unemployment in the Member States, provided that an environmental clause is introduced into the WTO rules as we expressly requested during the last GATT negotiations. Otherwise, we will end up creating discriminatory measures which penalise our own companies. The increase in tax yield from energy consumption, if correctly compensated for by a reduction in labour costs on companies, may have a positive effect on employment. This of course depends on production tools in the industrial energy‐consuming sectors not being relocated, as was seen for example in France during the 1970s in the horticulture sector.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why our group voted in favour of the amendments promoting simple taxation, including the various dispensation principles, but rejected all the amendments which would systematically increase the taxation of energy products. Some amendments actually envisaged introducing a systematic coefficient of increase for all energy products, without taking into account the international constraints applicable within the WTO.</p>

<p class="contents">. renewables should be exempted from the scope of the legislation; <br />. instead of the minimum levels of taxation being increased in three stages, they should be increased continually (annually) in the coming years by 2 % plus the rate of inflation; <br />. exemptions for companies which are major energy consumers may be granted by the Member States, provided the companies can demonstrate a decline in their competitiveness.</p>

However, a majority of Parliament rejected the Greens" amendments providing for the minimum levels of taxation to be increased in accordance with a steeper index (an annual increase in the minimum level of taxation of 4 % for energy products and 6 % for electricity, plus the rate of inflation in each case) and seeking to remove the tax privileges for generating energy from the incineration of waste.</p>
<p class="contents">By rejecting the report, the Conservative parties and those on the right in Europe have shown once again that they do not take protecting the environment seriously as an across‐the‐board task of European politics; indeed, they are even pursuing a policy to block the transition to the use of renewables. That is not the way to win the public over to the European cause.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we do specifically recognise the efforts made by the current President of the Environment Council, the German Environment Minister, Jürgen Trittin, to work actively towards overcoming the reservations on energy taxation in various Member States. These efforts need to be continued and intensified to prevent a good European initiative from being ruined, once again, by individual ‘brakemen" in the Council because of the principle of unanimity, which still applies on fiscal matters. There is an old saying which states that a journey of 10 000 miles begins with the first step. Even though we regret that this has taken so long and that progress is still so slow, this is one such first step in the right direction!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Berthu </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the European Police Office or Europol was set up with a purely intergovernmental status and under the control of the national parliaments. Its purpose is to gather information on international crime and exchange this between the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an extremely important task which deserves to be pursued very energetically, with the sole concern being its effectiveness in practice. However, the European Parliament is clearly not satisfied with this. As is apparent from the Nassauer report which we have just discussed, this House wants to take Europol and make it into an example of a supranational administration. This House is essentially asking for Europol to be converted into a European police unit with operational powers in the Member States and powers of command over the national police forces.</p>
<p class="contents">Would this federal super‐police force actually contribute anything more to the fight against crime? The Nassauer report does not demonstrate this and indeed does not even consider this question. You would almost think that this was of no importance. The report"s main objective is instead to advance the federalist cause. We therefore gradually learn that the supranational Europol should take orders from a European public prosecutor"s office, itself under the responsibility of the European Commission, which would be accountable in this respect only to the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all very well in theory. However, in practice it is clear that once again serious work and the progress which really could be achieved will be sacrificed to totally futile ideological quarrels. These will end up blocking all progress as the countries and parties square up to each other. We witnessed this during the many years of preparation of the Europol Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations prefers serious work. We want Europol to develop within the intergovernmental framework because it will be more effective to rely on the national authorities to improve the exchange of information. We also want to really make the system democratic by placing it under the control of an interparliamentary monitoring committee. This would consist of representatives from the national parliaments who would be responsible for reporting to their respective houses.</p>

<p class="contents">In view of the development of criminal networks, we must rapidly adapt our weapons against these. This is why Europol must be able to adapt accordingly. However, it has a credibility problem with the people.</p>

There are many cases which should prompt us to consider and accelerate this development in order to establish a unit which is capable of actively combating this scourge.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the European Union must have jurisdiction in order to conduct the investigations needed to combat crime. This House has already given its opinion on these matters on many occasions. It is now up to the Commission and our governments to take steps to ensure that crime is fought effectively.

Turning Europol into a European police unit with operational powers goes altogether too far along the road towards a supranational EU police force. Cross‐border police cooperation should take place through collaboration and the exchange of information between national police authorities, as well as through Interpol.

There have been no public discussions on it; there have been no discussions in national parliaments. This has all taken place in secret, behind closed doors. What is most amazing is the silence of the British Members of this House. For Britain and Ireland the whole legal system is under serious threat. The proposal is to harmonise the EU criminal legal system on the continental inquisitorial model.</p>
<p class="contents">The British and Irish systems are very different. I cannot understand why no British Member in this House has raised the question of what is going on here. The British and Irish systems are very much based on the presumption of innocence, trial by one's peers, as in the <span class="italic">Magna Carta</span> . The issue of <span class="italic">habeas corpus</span> is also in danger here – the guarantee of safety while somebody is in custody.</p>
<p class="contents">My main point is the whole lack of debate on this issue, the fact that all this is taking place in secret. It has been pushed through behind closed doors so that Members of this Parliament are not even aware of what are the real consequences of <span class="italic">corpus juris</span> . They should look at what is going on. The British Members should look at whether they want to get rid of their own system and bring in this EU criminal legal system which will be based on the continental inquisitorial model. I do not think the British or Irish public want this kind of system. If they do, at the very least people should have the right to discuss what kind of system is being brought in.</p>
<p class="contents">Going back to what the last speaker said, there is a major rush on here to harmonise everything within Europe, to actually set up a European police force. The next thing will be a European army. We are harmonising the legal systems, whether for better or worse, without proper public debate, without public accountability. This whole institution lacks any kind of democratic control or democratic accountability. The people of Europe have had no say whatsoever in the direction Europe is taking. Something has to be done about it. People in the Member States have to know the decisions that have been taken on their behalf which may not, in the long‐term, be in their interests.</p>

<p class="contents">However, I certainly cannot endorse Mrs d'Ancona's habitual pragmatic approach to the problem of drugs. This pragmatic approach consists of resigning oneself to the fact that drug abuse is a social phenomenon which is virtually impossible to eradicate: according to the rapporteur, it can be contained and fought only by means of a damage‐limitation exercise; in plain language, through the legalisation of soft drugs and the controlled administration of hard drugs. To the rapporteur, this is the only way of de‐ideologising the drugs debate.</p>

However, all the texts which she has presented through a unanimous Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs have had an inexorable tendency to be devoid of any proposals. They are simply mediums for general requests.</p>
<p class="contents">However, by their very existence and the enterprise of those supporting them, these reports are still a constant means of pressure in favour of more libertarian measures. Mrs d"Ancona would like to ensure ‘a de‐ideologising of the drugs debate in Europe". But what is the ideology of those who maintain that respect for human dignity requires us to ban anything which may harm us or of those who believe it is enough to control the use of drugs to limit their potential risks to health?</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly essential to allow and develop cooperation between all those who, in one way or another, through either prevention or repression, are involved in the fight against this scourge of our societies. However, cooperation must also especially be encouraged with those who are victims of drugs and with their families. In this general context, it is not right to trivialise drug addiction as an insignificant activity of no consequence. At a time when restrictions on smoking are rightly increasing and when authorised alcohol levels for driving are being reduced, is it appropriate to provide a contrary example of irresponsible liberalisation, particularly when drug addiction causes greater harm to people?</p>
