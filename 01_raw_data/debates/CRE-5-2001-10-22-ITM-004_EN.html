<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, at the previous plenary session of the European Parliament, a debate was held on the steps to take in the fight against terrorism in the wake of the attacks of 11 September. On behalf of my colleague, Mrs De Palacio, I would today like to discuss the consequences of these events for the safety of air transport, and also the implications that such events could have for some industrial installations, particularly nuclear power plants. I shall therefore begin with the issue of air transport safety.</p>
<p class="contents">As I am sure you know, the European Council of 21 September 2001 requested that measures be taken in order to strengthen air transport security. The Commission showed a dynamic approach and immediately reacted by formulating an appropriate Community response to the attacks carried out in the United States of America. Without further delay – following a request made by the European Council – the Commission proposed that Member States put in place a ‘dual review’ mutual inspection system. This reciprocal monitoring system will enable experts of one Member State to be sent to inspect security measures in airports of another Member State. We must point out, however, that Member States are reluctant to give inspectors this task. So far, only two Member States have submitted to the Commission proposals on the representatives that they wish to appoint.</p>
<p class="contents">On 10 October, the Commission proposed a draft regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council to approximate air transport security and safety standards within the European Union, and also to give the Commission the power of execution and inspection in order to ensure that the standards are being applied.</p>
<p class="contents">This text specifically mentions access control to sensitive areas of airports and aircraft, control of passengers and their hand luggage, control and monitoring of hold luggage, control of cargo and mail and, lastly, the training of ground staff.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs De Palacio presented this proposal to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism the same day that it was adopted, and we hope that Parliament will be able to examine it as a matter of urgency in order to enable an agreement to be reached at the Council in December, with the hope that the co-decision procedure can take place at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, an ad-hoc multidisciplinary group, made up of experts in air safety and combating terrorism, was set up immediately. Unfortunately, the work of the group of experts has been inconclusive and the preliminary report submitted to the Transport Council on 16 October merely stresses, firstly, that much remains to be done in order to ensure that safety measures are being applied effectively in all airports and, secondly, identifies the need for new measures to prevent the dangerous behaviour of some individuals in aircraft, such as banning access to cockpits or enhancing cooperation between civil monitoring of air traffic and the use of military air defence methods.</p>
<p class="contents">We are convinced that we must make headway on the proposals that we have submitted to you. Not only because of a lack of specific recommendations from the above mentioned group, but also because international bodies appear to be having difficulties in reacting swiftly. Therefore, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which held its assembly meeting in September, has limited itself to the single principle of organising a conference, the date of which has not yet been arranged. We hope that, at the European Union’s initiative, the ICAO will take on the responsibility of ensuring the adoption of the recommendations that it received with a view to strengthening international safety standards that apply to airports and air transport. Nevertheless, given the situation, the United States naturally decided to move forward themselves on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that we must enhance cooperation so that preventative measures are implemented in a coordinated manner on both sides of the Atlantic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> In this spirit, we organised a meeting with our American counterparts, which is to be held on 6 and 7 November 2001, to set up a working group that brings together the American authorities and the Commission with a view to coordinating efforts so that the highest possible level of security is ensured, whilst avoiding a situation where airline companies are subjected to excessive measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now move on to the possible consequences of terrorist activities, such as those committed on 11 September 2001, had they been carried out on an industrial or power installation.</p>
<p class="contents">The nuclear industry is one of the sectors of industry that has the most stringent security and safety standards, particularly because of the requirements of non-proliferation and radiation protection.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also mention, however, that other installations, that are less well protected, may be vulnerable, and a fatal accident of considerable proportions could happen at one of these plants, whether they belong to the chemical industry, which was the case at Bhopal, Seveso and recently at Toulouse – or at other power installations, such as natural gas infrastructures, which are not without risks. Some of us still recall the time when hydroelectric dams burst.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 11 September, Member States’ authorities have strengthened existing protective systems and physical protection measures that were already in force for at-risk installations and more specifically for nuclear installations.</p>
<p class="contents">These physical protection measures are particularly for access control to the installations and include a ban on flying over the installations.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the design of existing installations is concerned, it must be noted that the risks are taken into consideration, either wholly or according to the probability of an accident taking place. Therefore, the risk of a primary cooling system bursting, to which terrorists could have access, is taken wholly into account and a security system is put in place to avoid this risk.</p>
<p class="contents">Comparative assessments are carried out on other risks. This is what happens for seismic risks, which are taken into consideration in a number of ways, according to the geographical location of the installation itself.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the Commission would like to reiterate that the design and construction of electro-nuclear power stations fall within the sole competence of Member States. In addition to conventional nuclear installations, however, we must also take into account the risks related to transporting nuclear materials. In reality, the transportation of highly radioactive materials is only a very small part of activities involving nuclear materials and is carried out in accordance with the most stringent provisions of international and national regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">As a general rule, to use nuclear materials for the purposes of terrorism, perpetrators require, beyond simply holding the nuclear materials, the technical capability to store, process and launch the materials, which would be very difficult to achieve without alerting the authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything has been implemented at Community level, by applying Chapter VII of the Euratom Treaty, which requires a strict registration of nuclear materials in order to prevent them being used for non-peaceful purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the events in New York show that we must assess the vulnerability of nuclear installations. The Commission services are carrying out an evaluation, in collaboration with the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, particularly in terms of security at nuclear installations.</p>
<p class="contents">Our assessment should show how worthwhile it would be to publish the recommendations and to supplement existing legislation at Community and/or international level. In particular, we must assess the conventions established under the International Atomic Energy Agency, such as the convention on physical protection, which mainly covers the transportation of nuclear materials.</p>

In recognising the determination of the European Union and its Member States to safeguard its citizens from acts of terrorism, we stress the need to reassure the public by striking the right balance between vigilance and enabling everyday life to continue.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider that each Member State must carry out a complete reassessment of its approach to the security of infrastructure and installations, particularly the most risk-sensitive such as nuclear installations. We recognise there is genuine public concern about these issues but would like to emphasise the need to keep these matters in perspective. I would like to emphasise that the safety of nuclear plants and other such industrial installations is primarily a national competence and responsibility. In that context we look, for example, to the United Kingdom government to take all necessary short-term protective measures as well as to face up to the necessary longer-term decisions with regard to the disposal of radioactive waste.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the events of 11 September 2001 in the United States call for a reassessment of the risk of attack on installations that we have previously regarded as secure and I welcome the statement from the Commissioner. I only regret that it was not possible for Commissioner Loyola de Palacio to be able to speak to us – it had been our wish to hold this debate at the next part-session. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Thank you, Commissioner, for your statement. I welcome the cooperation you have outlined and the special attention which will be given to nuclear installations. I hope that Member States will cooperate with the Commission in this work.</p>
<p class="contents">Our reaction must be to do all that we can to prevent the sort of widespread slaughter, injury and chaos we saw in the United States. Air travel, nuclear power stations, chemical works and oil depots, are all obvious targets for terrorists. They are designed, built and protected accordingly at very considerable cost to the public. The French government now protects the reprocessing centre at La Hague with fighter planes and missiles. No doubt the United Kingdom does likewise in Sellafield.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot inhabit the weird minds of terrorists, but we can pay the high cost of protection. We can work together and we can be very careful when we consider building, or indeed retaining, a potential target.</p>
<p class="contents">Things will not be the same after 11 September, as many others have said. No one had conceived of using a fully loaded, large passenger plane as a weapon. We have to factor that into our calculations. Please keep reporting to Parliament. We want the citizens of Europe to know that everything possible has been done to keep them safe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The worst-case scenario of terrorist air attacks on nuclear power stations, long condemned by the Greens and anti-nuclear citizens, is becoming, through force of circumstance, a valid hypothesis. The fact that France has called on its armed forces in an attempt to protect its reactors is evidence that air attacks on nuclear plants are plausible. The French authorities, which have always dismissed the possibility of terrorist attacks, are now forced to admit that their nuclear temples are indeed vulnerable. And will the ground-to-air missiles deployed around the re-processing plant in The Hague be effective against a suicide attack? The German authorities and the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna recognise that even the sturdiest nuclear power station would not survive a crash. Throughout Europe and elsewhere in the world, the danger is certainly present, and it is made all the more acute because of the overwhelming number of nuclear reactors. We cannot currently guarantee the safety of our citizens. They are concerned and quite rightly so. Has the Commission taken these disaster scenarios seriously? How will it ensure the safety of our citizens? And does the Commission intend to launch a study into the safety of nuclear power stations, as Germany has?

It is also being considered in terms of longer-term measures regarding security standards in aircraft and at boarding.</p>
<p class="contents">We have duly noted the Commission statements, particularly on the various measures taken regarding checks on passengers, on hand luggage, as well as on flights from third countries. In my view, these are wise comments.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also accelerate the completion of security programmes relating to checks on hold luggage and ensure that our decisions have been implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not go back over what was said earlier regarding the scandalous situation involving the AZF factory, only a few weeks after we held debates in this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as safety on aircraft and at boarding are concerned, the events of 11 September show that two measures must be taken in aircraft design: cockpits must be sealed off and video monitors must be installed to enable the pilot to see anyone nearing the cockpit. Secondly, there is the issue of transponders. Transponders transmit the aircraft’s code and position to the air traffic control tower. Transponders must be secure and it must no longer be possible to disconnect them during flights, as was the case during the attacks on the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to draw Parliament’s attention to the issue of aid to the European airline industry. To be honest, I think that it is extremely tactless, even provocative, for the Commission to open the debate on concentration within the airline industry at this point in time. In addition to the economic battering that companies are taking, to confirm that Europe only has enough room for four or five airlines amounts to inviting mergers, restructuring and therefore redundancy plans.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, several sources are predicting a 15 to 30% decrease in air traffic and the European Association of Air Carriers states that overall traffic levels will have decreased by more than 7% by 2002, incurring losses estimated to be over three billion euro.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the regulations on state aid to airlines must be extended in order to take into full consideration all the consequences of 11 September.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to say one final word to point out that these public funds are intended to help companies to continue to be viable. I believe, therefore, that it is our duty to ensure that they are used and to avoid any redundancies in the sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Terrorists are now willing to engage in suicide missions. This simply means that the international community must now fully re-evaluate how best it can put in place security measures to defeat these acts of blatant and premeditated terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">From an Irish perspective, we are deeply concerned about the safety and security arrangements at the Sellafield nuclear plant in Cumbria. At a time when one would expect a scaling-down of nuclear enterprises in Britain, the British government has announced that the MOX nuclear facility can go ahead at Sellafield. Instead of closing the Sellafield nuclear plant on safety, environmental and economic grounds, the British governments has agreed to the expansion of operations there. This is not only a problem for the Irish people: it is also a problem for the British people and for the wider European Union. For instance, how do the British people like the idea of trains carrying nuclear materials continuing to run through London and other cities in Britain? While the American government has halted the movement of potentially dangerous nuclear materials, BNFL is insisting that it will run its nuclear trains from reactors to its controversial Sellafield reprocessing plant.</p>
<p class="contents">In this growing atmosphere of international terrorism, surely it is grossly irresponsible to continue this transportation. Equally, the transportation of nuclear materials via the Irish Sea sends shivers down the spine of many people living in Ireland. As a representative of the East coast of Ireland, I have always resented the Irish Sea being used as a rubbish tip for the activities of British Nuclear Fuels. The decision of the British government to expand the operations of the Sellafield nuclear plant is a contentious one by any stretch of the imagination. The timing of this decision, however, is a highly cynical one, considering that it was made as a smokescreen at the same time as war was declared on terrorism. This is a clear case of the British government using the war on terrorism to distract attention from awkward and contentious decisions. In this climate this is simply not good enough.</p>
<p class="contents">The safety and security at the Sellafield plant is as much a matter of concern for the European Union as it is for the Irish and British governments. The British government should make the honourable decision to close this nuclear white elephant once and for all. But over the next few weeks the Commission should and must carry out a full and independent evaluation of all the environmental public health risks of all operations of BNFL at the Sellafield nuclear plant. The people of Ireland are fed up with pious assurances from BNFL and the British government about safety standards at Sellafield. We were all horrified recently when BNFL had to bring back nuclear materials from Japan, because it had falsified documents. After this incident alone, how can any reasonable person believe for one moment anything that is written in a press release by BNFL?</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure all Members of this House that we in Ireland will vigorously pursue every political, legal and diplomatic option open to us to force the British government to close the Sellafield nuclear plant. This Sellafield nuclear plant has achieved nothing, except to heap environmental misery on us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to act as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">When we attended the ICAO assembly in Montreal recently with the European Parliament delegation, we clearly stated the European position that international measures should be taken at ministerial level by the end of the year. And, of course, if, our hopes notwithstanding, there are delays, I think that the European Union should proceed unilaterally in order to establish a climate of safety in air transport.</p>
<p class="contents">As you all know, the Commission recently proposed an initial package of measures, referred to as ECAC document 30. The parliamentary Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has promised to examine it as quickly as possible so that these measures can be turned into Community law by the end of the year, which is also in keeping with the Council's wishes. For the same reason, the other three legislative proposals relating to safety will also be examined as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also another package of measures relating to safety in the cockpit, video cameras, ground/air communications etc., that is, the measures to which the Commissioner referred. As far as this matter is concerned, my point is that we are worried about the delay and about how the Member States' experts have worked up to now. We trust that they will take the hint and improve their working methods from now on.</p>
<p class="contents">We are witnessing serious economic losses not just in air transport but in trade, tourism and other sectors of the economy. We would be failing in our duty if we did not do our utmost to deal with this crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No reactor could withstand the impact of a Boeing 747. It would simply be wrong to assert anything else. What is true of nuclear installations, though, is also true of other technological systems. Mr Vitorino rightly pointed out that even a dam can be destroyed, and the Second World War shows that the consequences can be devastating.</p>
<p class="contents">An attack on a gasometer, such as can be found in the heart of our towns, could be positively appalling. I might mention that some pressurised gasometers already operate at a lower pressure for safety reasons. If methane were to escape from a high-pressure holder – a heavy machine-gun would suffice to bring that about – and spread over the town, then once it mixed to a certain degree with the surrounding air, the town would simply burn to the ground. Accidents of this sort have occurred in the past; thank God we have managed to avoid them in the past ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to the water supply. It is relatively straightforward to poison water. We can all imagine how immense the consequences of that would be.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, I accept that many in our countries are opposed to nuclear energy, and that, in some countries, they may well be in the majority. Although it is not an opinion that I share, it is one that I respect. This argument, based on the risk of terrorist attacks, could lead us to get rid of the gas industry or stop drinking water, and I find that absurd.</p>
<p class="contents">My conclusion simply follows the line taken by the Commission. I admit it is not likely to make very good press copy, but it does have the advantage of being sensible. We should identify the dangerous sites and improve the protection of targets. Perhaps we should also take other security measures, but these must be implemented without delay. Studies are something we do not need.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, please allow me a final word. We should not give the impression of total security. That can be had only at the price of total surveillance, which cannot be reconciled with a free state under the rule of law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our group has already talked about the consequences of recent events for nuclear power plants and mentioned, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, a package of measures which is already being discussed in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. We endorse the quest for common security regulations, such as those formulated in document 30 of the E.C.A.C. What we are mainly concerned with here, in addition to issues of supervision, is adopting a special approach to vulnerable areas. We, of course, are of the opinion that such a debate must in any case be genuine, certainly when it comes to protecting privacy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to bring one aspect to your attention, for we are concerned here with an extension of the threat to include not only additional targets but also additional modes of transport. I would like to draw your attention to the use of other means of transport – something which we have already noted – such as tankers containing chemicals, and ask the Commissioner for his thoughts on the matter. In shipping too, it is relatively simple to force a ship in a port such as Rotterdam to take a different course and to direct it towards very explosive installations. In other words, not only aviation but also other means of transport should be discussed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why we must ensure that the number of installations which can threaten the life of human communities and of our environment is reduced to a minimum. Instead of subsidising airline companies with tax money, enabling them to continue pulling off stunts involving low prices, it would be preferable to completely close vulnerable regions to air traffic. Moreover, vulnerable airports near cities or with insufficient security provisions in place, as in the recent case of Linate near Milan – an airport that should have been closed down years ago – should not have a future.</p>
<p class="contents">The unbalanced pursuit of economic growth, freedom for airline companies and the rolling back of government has, in connection with the sad events of 11 September, led to too little attention being paid, on the one hand, to the risk of industrial buildings collapsing and, on the other hand, to government supervision of access to airports by people with malicious intentions.

<p class="contents">I wish, first of all, to express my solidarity with the victims of these cowardly and barbaric attacks and with the government of the United States and also to unreservedly, roundly and unambiguously condemn terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Improving the security of transport users and transported goods was and must continue to be one of the Union’s priorities for action in coming years. I am delighted that this is the view adopted in the White Paper on transport policy presented by the Commission only a few months ago. We must not forget that a safe journey is the most important right of any passenger.</p>
<p class="contents">The ongoing safety and competitiveness of this sector require the rapid adoption of the latest Commission proposals on air safety and the ‘single sky’ package. We must also take account of other measures that were already on the table, such as the JAR-OPS Regulation, the draft directive on occurrence reporting in civil aviation and the proposal on the professional competence of cabin crew. All of these texts, Commissioner, must be approved as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would say that the disastrous action taken on the air transport sector in recent weeks has shown the extent to which the European Union has a pivotal role in responding to the need for regulation at both Community and world-wide level. Only a European vision will enable us to confront new challenges such as international terrorism, for which international intergovernmental forums can no longer provide a sufficiently rapid or effective response.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has a duty to support the Commission on these proposals to restore the public confidence and safety that have been lost. It is at times like this that we must make Europe’s presence felt.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I also wish to address the Council, which must now find the ability and the courage to support and take decisions that ensure that civil aviation will continue to be safe, reliable and sustainable from every point of view. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the fact that the Commissioner has announced that the European Union is going to meet with the US authorities to discuss unfair competition, but that is a grossly inadequate response to the current crisis in the aviation industry. I would like some clarity about what precisely the Commission is doing. There is a report in Irish newspapers today that the Commission is insisting that the rescue and aid package the Irish government will provide for Aer Lingus must be privately funded. Now, that is a gross distortion of the treaties which are neutral as regards where aid or money should come from to assist the aviation industry. I want clarity on this. Is that what the Commission is demanding or is the Irish government playing its own privatisation game under cover of the present crisis?</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I wish to make is in relation to the nuclear and chemical industries in Europe. The report which is coming before STOA this week makes for worrying reading. It will hopefully be made public very soon, but the reality is that Sellafield and Cap de la Hague were a risk even before 11 September 2001; the chemical plants in our midst were a risk even before Toulouse. It seems to me that we need commitments from the Commission that we are going to have an independent European inspectorate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Acts of malice and not just accidents are the focus of our concern.</p>
<p class="contents">No-fly zones should be established immediately around the two reprocessing plants in the EU: Sellafield and Cap de la Hague. Power plants generally are a ticking time-bomb in our midst. The only logical response is to close them all down and end this terrible threat.</p>
<p class="contents">The French government has already moved to strengthen anti-terrorist precautions at Cap de la Hague. These include ground-to-air missiles. The German government has concluded that nuclear reactors could not withstand a collision with a targeted passenger jet. It has undertaken an emergency risk assessment. Government ministers oppose anti-aircraft defences and have made it clear that plants that lie in the flight paths of large airports can be shut down if they are rated as serious risk.</p>
<p class="contents">The US government has halted the transport of nuclear materials, and the EU government should also immediately halt the transport of nuclear materials, including MOX fuels. I do not believe that the response we have had so far from the Commission is at all adequate. The IAEA has confirmed that 75% of the notifications of incidents involving nuclear material in the last year were illegal activities. Nuclear materials are currently clearly not secure and not safe.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither Sellafield nor la Hague was designed to withstand the impact of a commercial jet. They contain tens of thousands of tonnes of spent nuclear fuel and over 100 tonnes of separated plutonium between them. A new report, which is both timely and in terms of content deeply worrying, has been prepared for the European Parliament. I understand it will be circulated tomorrow by the STOA committee. I expect it to be circulated. I wonder why it has not already been circulated to Members, as I believe it has already been circulated to the industry?</p>
<p class="contents">The report states that an act of malice – and this was presented to us before September – could initiate a sequence of events that release radioactive material in the liquid high-level waste tanks, in Sellafield in particular, with effects much greater and more devastating than Chernobyl. This is very serious. I need an adequate response from the Commission, and so far we have not had it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Successive Irish governments have voiced their concern about the operation of the Sellafield plant, formerly known as Windscale, and in particular the innumerable security breaches by the BNFL and the arrogance of the British authorities towards the legitimate concerns of a sovereign and friendly neighbour. The commissioning of the MOX plant when the eyes of the international media were firmly focused elsewhere in the wake of the tragedy of September 11, 2001 is but the latest example, and is particularly serious, given the heightened concerns now of terrorist attacks.</p>
<p class="contents">Could the Commission confirm that the same security standards that are now deemed necessary in Cap de la Hague – that is protection with fighter planes and ground-to-air missiles and a no-fly zone – are in place in Sellafield? Does the Commission agree that there is an urgent need for common security standards for all nuclear installations, not just in the EU-15, but in accession countries as well? Could the Commission also comment on the lack of effectiveness of the present inspectorate in this regard? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berger (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I am very grateful to the Commission for using today's statement to take up a theme that currently causes a great deal of concern to the people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the way the Commission deals explicitly with all the areas at especial risk, and, in particular, its inclusion of industrial plant and nuclear power stations, which was demanded on Austria's initiative in Parliament's resolution on the events of 11 September.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that precautions were taken at several nuclear power stations in Europe to enable them to survive the impact of smaller aircraft at least. Does the Commission have an overview showing which nuclear power stations did not do this, and what is planned at a European level to reinforce protection measures overall, at least at these stations but also at all others?</p>
<p class="contents">We know that no nuclear power station is completely safe, and that some are not technically up to date in other respects of relevance to safety. It would be all the more surprising if there really were a letter from Commissioner Verheugen, confirming that the Temelin plant is completely safe. As such a statement would contradict everything international experts have found out about Temelin, I cannot believe that this statement about its safety was actually made by Mr Verheugen. I therefore ask the Commission to show this document, addressed to the Czech and Austrian governments, to Parliament. We have been very committed to this issue, and I think Parliament deserves, even if the Commission takes an opposing view….</p>

I told her so, and the Irish government so when I was the Northern Ireland Minister responsible for Energy and I reiterate that view now. I applaud the British government's decision on the MOX plant, a long overdue decision which is going to ensure the economic and employment future of my constituents. So my message on that is to keep your hands off Sellafield.</p>
<p class="contents">Briefly, about aviation. I congratulate Commissioner Palacio on the actions that she has already taken but there are three things we need to emphasise: firstly we must protect the aircraft on the ground; once someone is on the aircraft they can do more damage. Secondly we must renew and reinvigorate security screening at airports and thirdly we must assist with the costs of security and war-risk insurance. We must restore public confidence in aviation and the sooner the better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To sum up, I will add that we have drawn up an intervention programme, which strictly observes competences – not simply Community competences, but Member States’ competences as well. That is why I can assure you that, as regards matters for which the Commission has direct responsibility under the Treaties, we have taken all the necessary measures to deal with the new situation created by the terrorist attacks on the United States. We shall continue to put pressure on the Member States so that they also shoulder their responsibilities and adopt the necessary measures that are part of their competences. This applies to the examples given regarding the security of the Sellafield and Cap de La Hague re-processing plants. I would like to stress that this is part of national competences and that it is the national authorities that inform us that the necessary measures have been taken.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission recognises the need to begin an assessment of nuclear security and the security of transporting nuclear materials. I mentioned this in my presentation and I hope that the assessment that the Commission is currently preparing will soon be completed.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as air safety and security are concerned, I am pleased that several Members of Parliament have welcomed our legislative initiative with open arms and I hope that the regulation that we have proposed can be examined by Parliament as a matter of urgency. I would also like to stress that we must improve how we follow up on measures taken at national level, just as the ad hoc group is doing, which is responsible for assessing specific administrative measures that need to be taken to improve air security.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to make a final comment. I referred to the conditions relating to competition and to the strategy implemented by the Commission to avoid distorting competition within the context of the Euro-American dialogue on security. This was the context in which I dealt with the issue of competition. We believe that the solutions we are seeking must be international and must take into consideration the need to avoid imposing measures that are excessive and which may distort competition globally. This was the background to what I said. I did not mention other measures concerning competition policy related to the effects of the terrorist attacks on the commercial strategy of airlines. I did not deal with specific questions, such as those that some Members of Parliament wanted to bring up during the debate. All I can do is refer Members to the conclusions of the meeting that my colleague, Mrs Loyola De Palacio, held with the representatives of the airline companies’ association. I have taken careful note of the fact that some of you thought that the Commission proposals were insufficient or too ideological. I have taken careful note of your comments. I shall pass them on to Mrs De Palacio, but I repeat that, for the time being, this is the official position of the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
