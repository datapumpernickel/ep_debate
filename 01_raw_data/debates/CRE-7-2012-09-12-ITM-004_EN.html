<p class="contents">Before we start the debate, it is definitely appropriate to mention that today can and will be a decisive day for Europe. I am not exaggerating when I say to you that people throughout the world are watching the European Union today. This morning they will undoubtedly be watching Germany, where the German constitutional court is making a decision which will be important for all of us. They will also be watching the elections in the Netherlands, where our fellow citizens will be electing a new parliament this morning, with far-reaching effects on the European Union as a whole, and I believe you share my view of this. People all over the world will be watching this Parliament, where the President of the Commission will be giving his State of the Union address.</p>
<p class="contents">Before he does that, I would like to make one comment as President of this Chamber. Developments over the last few months have given cause for concern, in particular with regard to the tendency towards deparliamentarisation in Europe. At this point and before Mr Barroso gives his speech, I would like to make it quite clear that anyone who thinks that the parliamentary process is too slow, who says that parliaments are an obstacle to the development of new and necessary structures and who believes that European bodies with European powers can be established without involving the European Parliament will, I am sure, encounter determined opposition from this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In Mr Barroso’s speech this morning, we will hear proposals for the creation of a new instrument in Europe: the banking union. One thing is absolutely clear. Regardless of which new structures are introduced in Europe, the euro is the currency of the Union. This is the Parliament of the Union. On the basis of this logic, the European Parliament is the Parliament of the euro.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who has different ideas will meet with powerful resistance from this Parliament. I have said powerful resistance, because the European Parliament is a powerful institution.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Manuel Barroso, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">− </span>Mr President, President of the Council, honourable Members, it is an honour to stand before you today to deliver this third State of the Union address, although at a time when the European Union continues to be in crisis – a financial and economic crisis, a social crisis, but also a political crisis, a crisis of confidence. At its root, the crisis results from irresponsible practices in the financial sector, unsustainable public debt, and also a lack of competitiveness in some Member States. On top of that, the euro faces structural problems of its own. Its architecture has not been up to the job. Imbalances have built up.</p>
<p class="contents">This is now being corrected but it is a painful and difficult effort. Citizens are frustrated. They are anxious. They feel their way of life is at risk. The sense of fairness and equity between Member States is sometimes being eroded. Without equity between Member States, how can there be equity between European citizens?</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last four years, we have made bold decisions to tackle the systemic crisis. But despite all these efforts, our responses have not yet convinced citizens, markets or our international partners. Why? Because, time and again, we have allowed doubts to spread – doubts over whether some countries are really ready to reform and regain competitiveness, doubts over whether other countries are really willing to stand by each other so that the euro and the European project are irreversible.</p>
<p class="contents">On too many occasions, we have seen a vicious spiral. First, very important decisions for our future are taken at European summits. But then, the next day, we see some of those very same people who took those decisions undermining them, saying either that they go too far or that they do not go far enough. Then we get a problem of credibility and a problem of confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not acceptable to present these European meetings as if they were boxing events, claiming a knockout victory over a rival. We cannot belong to the same union and behave as if we do not. We cannot put at risk nine good decisions with one action or statement that raises doubts about all we have achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">This reveals the essence of Europe’s political crisis of confidence. If Europe’s political actors do not abide by the rules and the decisions they have set themselves, how can they possibly convince others that they are determined to solve this crisis together?</p>
<p class="contents">A crisis of confidence is a political crisis. The good thing is that in a democracy there is no political problem for which we cannot find a political solution. That is why, here today, I want to debate with you the fundamental political questions – where we are now and how we must move forward. I want to focus on the political direction and the vision that will inspire our policy decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course I will not list all these individual decisions. You are receiving the letter I addressed to the President of the European Parliament, and that sets out the Commission’s immediate priorities. We will discuss them with you before adopting the Commission work programme later in the autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">My message to you today is this: Europe needs a new direction. And that direction cannot be based on old ideas. Europe needs a new way of thinking.</p>
<p class="contents">When we speak about the crisis – and we are all speaking about the crisis – have we really drawn all the consequences for our action? When we speak about globalisation – and we all speak a lot about globalisation – have we really considered its impact on the role of each of our Member States?</p>
<p class="contents">The starting point for new thinking for Europe is to really draw all the consequences of the challenges that we are facing and that are fundamentally changing our world. The starting point is to stop trying to answer the questions of the future with the tools of the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the start of the crisis, we have seen time and again that interconnected global markets are quicker and therefore more powerful than fragmented national political systems. This undermines the trust of citizens in political decision-making and it is fuelling populism and extremism in Europe and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">The reality is that, in an interconnected world, Europe’s Member States on their own are no longer able to effectively steer the course of events.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">But, at the same time, they have not yet equipped their Union – our Union –with the instruments needed to cope with this new reality. We are now in a transition, in a defining moment. This moment requires decision and leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, globalisation demands more European unity. More unity demands more integration. More integration demands more democracy – European democracy. In Europe, this means, first and foremost, accepting that we are all in the same boat. It means recognising the commonality of our European interests. It means embracing the interdependence of our destinies and it means demanding a true sense of common responsibility and solidarity because, when you are on a boat in the middle of the storm, absolute loyalty is the minimum you demand from your fellow crew members.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the only way we will keep up with the pace of change. It is the only way we will get the scale and efficiency we need to be a global player. It is the only way to safeguard our values – because it is also a matter of values – in our changing world.</p>
<p class="contents">In the 20<span class="sup">th</span> century, a country of just 10 or 15 million people could be a global power. In the 21<span class="sup">st</span> century, even the biggest European countries run the risk of irrelevance between global giants such as the US or China. History is accelerating. It took 155 years for Britain to double its GDP per capita, 50 years for the United States, and just 15 years for China. But, if you look at some of our new Member States, the economic transformation going on is no less impressive.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has all the assets it takes – in fact much more so than previous generations faced with similar or even greater challenges. But we need to act accordingly and mobilise all these resources together. It is time to match ambitions, decisions, and actions. It is time to put a stop to piecemeal responses and muddling through. It is time to learn the lessons from history and write a better future for our Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">What I demand, and what I present to you today, is a decisive deal for Europe – a decisive deal to project our values, our freedom and our prosperity into the future of a globalised world; a deal that combines the need to keep our social market economies on the one hand and the need to reform them on the other; a deal that will stabilise the EMU, boost sustainable growth, and restore competitiveness; a deal that will establish a contract of confidence between our countries, between Member States and the European institutions, between the social partners, and between the citizens and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The decisive deal for Europe means that we must leave no doubt about the integrity of the Union or the irreversibility of the euro. The more vulnerable countries must leave no doubts about their willingness to reform and about their sense of responsibility. The stronger countries must leave no doubts about their willingness to stick together and about their sense of solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We must all leave no doubts that we are determined to reform and to reform together.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea that we can grow without reform or that we can prosper alone is simply false. We must recognise that we are in this together and we must resolve this together. This decisive deal requires the completion of a deep and genuine economic union, based on a political union.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start with Europe’s economy. Firstly, we need growth, sustainable growth. Growth is the lifeblood of the European social market model. It creates jobs and supports our standard of living. But we can only maintain growth if we are more competitive. At the national level it means undertaking structural reforms that have been postponed for decades – modernising public administration, reducing wasteful expenditure, tackling vested interests and privileges, reforming the labour market to balance security with flexibility and ensuring the sustainability of social systems.</p>
<p class="contents">At the European level, we need to be more decisive about breaking down barriers, whether physical, economic or digital. We need to complete the single market. We need to reduce our energy dependence and tap the renewable energy potential. Promoting competitiveness in sectors such as energy, transport or telecoms could open up fresh competition, promote innovation and drive down prices for consumers and businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will shortly present a Single Market Act II. To enable the single market to prosper, the Commission will continue to be firm and intransigent in the defence of its competition and trade rules. Let me tell you frankly that, if this is left to the Member States, they will not resist pressure from big corporations or large external powers.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to create a European labour market and make it as easy for people to work in another country as it is at home. We need to explore green growth and be much more efficient in the use of resources. We have to be much more ambitious about education, research, innovation and science.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is a world leader in key sectors such as aeronautics, automotives, pharmaceuticals and engineering, with global market shares above a third. Industrial productivity increased by 35% over the last decade, despite the economic slowdown. Today some 74 million jobs depend on manufacturing. Every year start-up firms in the EU create over 4 million jobs. We need to build on this by investing in our new industrial policy and creating a business environment that encourages entrepreneurship and supports small businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">This means making the taxation environment simpler for businesses and more attractive for investors. Better tax coordination would benefit all Member States. We also need a pro-active trade policy by opening up new markets. This is the potential of Europe’s economy. This is the goldmine that is yet to be fully explored. Fully implementing the Growth Compact agreed at the June European Council can take us a long way.</p>
<p class="contents">And we could go further with a realistic yet ambitious European Union budget dedicated to investment, growth and reform. Let us be clear: the European budget is the instrument for investment in Europe and growth in Europe. The Commission and this Parliament, indeed all pro-European forces – because most Member States support our proposal – must now stand together in support of the right multiannual financial framework that will take us to 2020. It will place little burden on Member States, especially with our proposed new own-resources system but it would give a great boost to their economies, their regions, their researchers, their students, their young people who seek employment, and their SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a budget for growth. It is a budget for economic, social and territorial cohesion between Member States and within Member States. It is a budget that will help complete the single market by bridging gaps in our energy, transport and telecoms infrastructure through the Connecting Europe Facility. It is a budget for a modern, growth-oriented agriculture capable of combining food security with sustainable rural development. It is a budget that will promote a research-intensive and innovative Europe through Horizon 2020 because we need this European scale for research.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we come, as a test of credibility, to many of our Member States. I want to see if the same Member States that were always speaking about the need for growth and investment for growth will now support the budget for growth at European level.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This budget is also the tool to support Europe 2020, our strategy for growth, which we need now more than ever before. Europe 2020 is indeed the way to modernise and preserve the European social market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Our agenda of structural reform requires a major adjustment effort. It will only work if it is fair and equitable because inequality is not sustainable. In some parts of Europe we are seeing a real social emergency with rising poverty and massive levels of unemployment, especially among our young people. That is why we must strengthen social cohesion. It is a feature that distinguishes European society from alternative models.</p>
<p class="contents">Some say that because of the crisis the European social model is dead. I do not agree. Yes, we need to reform our economies and modernise our social protection systems, but an effective social protection system that helps those in need is not an obstacle to prosperity. It is indeed an indispensable element of it. Indeed, it is precisely those European countries with the most effective social protection systems and with the most developed social partnerships, that are among the most successful and competitive economies in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Fairness and equity mean giving a chance to our young people. We are already doing a lot. Before the end of the year the Commission will launch a Youth Package that will establish a youth guarantee scheme and equality framework to facilitate vocational training.</p>
<p class="contents">Fairness and equity also mean creating better and fairer taxation systems. Stopping tax fraud and tax evasion could put extra billions into the public purse across Europe. This is why the Commission will fight for an agreement on the revised Savings Tax Directive and on mandates to negotiate stronger savings tax agreements with third countries. Their completion would be a major source of legitimate tax revenues.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to fight for a fair and ambitious Financial Transaction Tax that will ensure that taxpayers benefit from the financial sector, not just that the financial sector benefits from taxpayers. Now that it is clear that agreement on this can only happen through enhanced cooperation, the Commission will do all it can to move this forward rapidly and effectively with those Member States that are willing. This is about fairness. Fairness is an essential condition for making the necessary economic reforms socially and politically acceptable and, above all, because fairness is a question of social justice.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of the crisis, important decisions have been taken. Across the European Union, reform and consolidation measures are being implemented. Joint financial backstops are being put in place, and the European institutions have consistently shown that they stand by the euro. The Commission is very aware that in the Member States implementing the most intense reforms, there is hardship and there are – sometimes very painful – difficult adjustments, but it is only through these reforms that we can come to a better future. They were long overdue. Going back to the status quo ante is simply impossible. The Commission will continue to do all it can to support those Member States and to help them boost growth and employment, for instance through the re-programming of structural funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to say a word on Greece. I truly believe that we have a chance this autumn to come to the turning point. If Greece banishes all doubts about its commitment to reform – but also if all the other countries banish all doubts about their determination to keep Greece in the euro area – we can do it. I believe that if Greece stands by its commitments it should stay in the euro area as a member of the European family.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Securing the stability of the euro area is our most urgent challenge. This is the joint responsibility of the Member States and the Community Institutions. The ECB cannot, and will not, finance governments. But, when monetary policy channels are not working properly, the Commission believes that it is within the mandate of the ECB to take the necessary actions, for instance in the secondary markets of sovereign debt.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, the ECB has not only the right but also the duty to restore the integrity of monetary policy. It is of course for the ECB, as an independent institution, to determine what actions to carry out and under what conditions. But all actors – and I really mean all actors – should respect the ECB’s independence.</p>
<p class="contents">I have spoken about the economic policy measures that we must implement as a matter of urgency. This is indispensable. But it is not sufficient. We must go further. We must complete the economic and monetary union. We must create a banking union and a fiscal union and the corresponding institutional and political mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the Commission is presenting legislative proposals for a single European supervisory mechanism for the euro zone. This is a stepping stone to banking union. The crisis has shown that, while banks became transnational, rules and oversight remained national. When things went wrong, it was the taxpayers who had to pick up the bill.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past four years the EU has overhauled the rulebook for banks, leading the world in implementing the G20 commitments. But mere coordination is no longer adequate – we need to move to common supervisory decisions, namely within the euro area. The single supervisory mechanism proposed today will create a reinforced architecture, with a core role for the European Central Bank, and appropriate articulation with the European Banking Authority, which will restore confidence in the supervision of the banks in the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be a supervision for all euro area banks. Supervision must be able to look everywhere because systemic risks can be anywhere, not just in so-called systemically relevant banks. Of course, this is in a system that fully engages the national supervisors.</p>
<p class="contents">The package comprises two legal texts – one on the ECB and the other on the EBA – which go together. It is clear that Parliament will have a crucial role to play in the adoption of the new mechanism, and after that in its democratic oversight.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a crucial first step towards the banking union I proposed before this House in June. Getting the European supervisor in place is the top priority for now because it is the precondition for the better management of banking crises, from banking resolution to deposit insurance.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel the Commission will continue to work on the reform of the banking sector, to make sure it plays its role in the responsible financing of the real economy. That means improving long-term financing for SMEs and other companies. It means rules on reference indices, so that we do not again see the manipulation of bank interest rates affecting companies and mortgage holders alike. It means legislation to ensure that banks give a fair deal to consumers and another look at the structure of banking activities to eliminate inherent risks.</p>
<p class="contents">In all of this, the role of this Parliament is essential. The Commission endeavours to work in close partnership with you.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is a second element of a deeper economic union. It is the move towards a fiscal union. The case for it is clear: the economic decisions of one Member State impact on the others, so we need stronger economic policy coordination. We need a stronger and more binding framework for the national decision-making for key economic policies, as the only way to prevent imbalances. While much has been done here – for instance through the six pack and through the country-specific recommendations – further steps are crucial to combine specific conditions with specific incentives and to really make the economic and monetary union sustainable.</p>
<p class="contents">To deliver lasting results, we need to develop a fully equipped Community economic governance, together with a genuine, credible Community fiscal capacity. We do not need separate institutions or to create new institutions for that, quite the contrary. For this to be effective and quick, the best way is to work with and through the existing institutions: the European Commission as the independent European authority, overseen by the European Parliament as the parliamentary representation at European level. It is in such a framework that, over time, steps for genuine mutualisation of debt redemption and debt issuance can take their place.</p>
<p class="contents">So economic reform coupled with a genuine economic and monetary union are the engines to get our boat moving forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will publish a blueprint for deepening the economic and monetary union, already this autumn. This blueprint will be presented to this House because these questions must be discussed with and by the representatives of the people. At the same time, it will inform the debate at the December European Council that will be prepared by the report that the President of the European Council, I myself and the Presidents of the European Central Bank and the Euro Group have been asked to present.</p>
<p class="contents">Our blueprint will identify the tools and instruments and present options for legal drafting that will give effect to them, from policy coordination to fiscal capacity to debt redemption. Where necessary – as in the case of jointly and severally guaranteed public debt – it will identify the Treaty changes necessary because some of these changes require modifications in the Treaty. It will present a blueprint for what we need to accomplish, not only in the next few weeks and months but also in the next years.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, the credibility and sustainability of economic and monetary union – the credibility of our currency, the euro – depends on the institutions and the political construct behind it. This is why the economic and monetary union raises the question of a political union and the European democracy that must underpin it.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want economic and monetary union to succeed, we need to combine ambition and proper sequencing. We need to take concrete steps now, but with a political union as the horizon. I would like to see the development of a European public space, where European issues are discussed and debated from a European standpoint. We cannot continue trying to solve European problems just with national solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate has to take place in our societies and among our citizens. But today I would also like to make an appeal to European thinkers, to men and women of culture, to join this debate on the future of Europe. We need them. I also make this appeal to you. This is the house of European democracy. We must strengthen the role of the European Parliament at European level. We need to promote genuine complementarity and cooperation between the European and national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">This also cannot be done without strengthened European political parties. Indeed, we very often have a real disconnect between political parties in the capitals and the European political parties here in Strasbourg. This is why we have to recognise that the political debate is cast all too often as if it were just between national parties. Even in the European elections we do not see the name of the European political parties in the ballot box. We see a national discussion between national parties. This is why we need a better statute for European political parties. I am proud to announce that the Commission has adopted a proposal for this today.</p>
<p class="contents">An important means to deepen the pan-European political debate would be the presentation by European political parties of their candidate for the post of Commission President at the European Parliament elections in 2014. This can be done without a Treaty change and would be a decisive step to make the possibility of a European choice offered by these elections even clearer. I call on the political parties to commit to this step and thus to further Europeanise the European elections.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">A true political European Union means we must concentrate European action on the real issues that matter and must be dealt with at European level. Let us be frank about this. Not everything can be a priority at the same time. We need to be more selective and here some self-criticism will probably apply.</p>
<p class="contents">Proper integration is about taking a fresh look at where the most appropriate level of action is. Subsidiarity is an essential democratic concept and should be practised. A political union also means that we must strengthen the foundations on which our Union is built: respect for our fundamental values, for the rule of law and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent months we have seen threats to the legal and democratic fabric in some of our European states. The European Parliament and the Commission were the first to raise the alarm and played the decisive role in seeing these worrying developments brought into check. But these situations also revealed the limits of our institutional arrangements. We need a better developed set of instruments – not just the alternative between the ‘soft power’ of political persuasion and the ‘nuclear option’ of Article 7 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Our commitment to upholding the rule of law is also behind our intention to establish a European Public Prosecutor’s Office, as foreseen by the treaties. We will make a proposal soon.</p>
<p class="contents">A political union also means doing more to fulfil our global role. Sharing sovereignty in Europe means being more sovereign in a global world. In today’s world, size matters and values make the difference. That is why Europe’s message must be one of freedom, of democracy, of the rule of law and of solidarity. In short, our values, the European values.</p>
<p class="contents">More than ever our citizens and the new world order need an active and influential Europe, not just for us here in Europe. It is important for the rest of the world that we succeed. A Europe that stands by its values and a Europe that stands up for its belief that human rights are not a luxury for the developed world but should be seen as universal values.</p>
<p class="contents">The appalling situation in Syria reminds us that we cannot afford to be bystanders. A new and democratic Syria must emerge. We have a joint responsibility to make this happen and to work with those in the global order who also need to give their cooperation towards that goal.</p>
<p class="contents">The world also needs an EU that keeps its leadership of development and humanitarian assistance, that stands by open economies and fights protectionism and that leads the fight against climate change. The world needs a Europe that is capable of deploying military missions to help stabilise the situation in crisis areas. We need to launch a comprehensive review of European capabilities and begin truly collective defence planning. Yes, we need to enforce our Common Foreign and Security Policy and to have a common approach to defence matters because together we have the power and the scale to shape the world into a fairer, rules-based and human-rights-abiding place.</p>
<p class="contents">A deep and genuine economic and monetary union, a political union with a coherent foreign and defence policy, means ultimately that the present European Union must evolve. Let us not be afraid of the word: we will need to move towards a federation of nation states. This is our political horizon. This is what must guide our work in the years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I call for a federation of nation states. Not a superstate. A democratic federation of nation states that can tackle our common problems, through the sharing of sovereignty in such a way that each country and its citizens are better equipped to control their own destiny. This is about union with the Member States, not against the Member States. In the age of globalisation pooled sovereignty means more power, not less.</p>
<p class="contents">I said a federation of nation states on purpose because I think that, in these turbulent times, in these times of uncertainty, it would be a real mistake to leave the defence of the nation just to the nationalists and populists. I believe in a Europe where people are proud of their nations but also proud to be European and proud of our European values.</p>
<p class="contents">Creating this federation of nation states will ultimately require a new Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not say this lightly. We are all aware how difficult Treaty change has become. It has to be well prepared. Discussions on Treaty change must not distract or delay us from doing what can and must already be done today.</p>
<p class="contents">A deep and genuine economic and monetary union can be started under the current treaties, but can only be completed with changes in the treaties. So let us start it now but let us have the horizon for this future present in our decisions of today.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not begin with Treaty change. We must identify the policies we need and the instruments to implement them. Only then can we decide on the tools that we lack and the ways to remedy this.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there must be a broad debate all over Europe. A debate that must take place before a convention and an IGC are called. A debate of a truly European dimension. The times of European integration by implicit consent of citizens are over. Europe cannot be technocratic, bureaucratic or even diplomatic. Europe has to be ever more democratic and the role of the European Parliament for this is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the European elections in 2014 can be so decisive. Before the next European Parliament elections in 2014, the Commission will present its outline for the shape of the future European Union. We will put forward explicit ideas for Treaty change in time for a true European debate. We will set out the objectives to be pursued, the way in which the institutions that can make the European Union more open and democratic, the powers and instruments to make it more effective, and the model to make it a union for the peoples of Europe. I believe we need a real debate and in democracy the best way to debate is to debate our future and our goals in the elections at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not just a debate for the euro area in its present membership. Let me be very clear. In Europe we need no more walls dividing us because the European Union is stronger as a whole in keeping the integrity of its single market, its membership and in its institutions. No one will be forced to come along and no one will be forced to stay out but the speed will not be dictated by the slowest or the most reluctant.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why our proposals will be based on the existing Union and its institutions – on the Community method. Let us be clear – there is only one European Union, one European Commission, one European Parliament. More democracy, more transparency, more accountability, is not created by a proliferation of institutions that would render the European Union more complicated, more difficult to read, less coherent and less capable of acting.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the magnitude of the decisions that we will need to make over time. That is why I believe we need a serious discussion between the citizens of Europe about the way forward – and also about the possible consequences of fragmentation, because sometimes through unintended consequences we get fragmentation that we do not want – but also about what we could achieve if leaders avoid national provincialism: what we can achieve together.</p>
<p class="contents">We must use the 2014 election to mobilise all pro-European forces. We must not allow the populists and the nationalists to set a negative agenda. I expect all those who call themselves Europeans to stand up and to take the initiative in this debate. Because even more dangerous than the scepticism of the anti-Europeans is the indifference or the pessimism of the pro-Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, what we need is a decisive deal to complete the EMU, based on a political commitment to a stronger European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The sequence I put before you is clear. We should start by doing all we can to stabilise the euro and accelerate growth in the EU as a whole. The Commission will present all the necessary proposals – we have started today with the single supervisor – to create a banking union, in line with current treaty provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we will present our blueprint on a deep and genuine economic and monetary union, including the political instruments. This will be done this autumn. We will present here again all proposals in line with the current treaty provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, where we cannot move forward under the existing treaties, we will present explicit proposals for the necessary Treaty changes ahead of the next European parliamentary election in 2014, including elements for reinforced democracy and accountability. This is our project, a project that is step by step but with a big ambition for the future, with a federation as the horizon for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that many will say that this is too ambitious and that it is not realistic. But I want to leave you with some questions. Let me ask you – is it realistic to go on as we have been doing? Is it realistic to see what we are seeing today in many European countries? Is it realistic to see taxpayers paying banks and afterwards being forced to give banks back the houses they have paid for because they cannot pay their mortgages? Is it realistic to see more than 50% of our young people without jobs in some of our Member States? Is it realistic to go on trying to muddle through, just trying to accommodate mistakes with unconvincing responses? Is it realistic to think that we can win the confidence of markets when sometimes we show so little confidence in each other?</p>
<p class="contents">To me, it is this reality that is not realistic. This reality cannot go on.</p>
<p class="contents">The realistic way forward is the way that makes us stronger and more united. Realism is to put our ambition at the level of our challenges. Realism is to tell our youth that, yes, there is hope if we stick together. If there is a bias in our analysis, let it be a bias for hope. We should be proud to be Europeans, proud of our rich and diverse culture. In spite of our current problems, our societies are among the most human and free in the world. We do not have to apologise for our democracy or for our social market economy or for our values.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">With high levels of social cohesion, respect for human rights and human dignity, equality between men and women, respect for our environment – these European societies, with all their problems, are among the most decent societies in human history. I think we should be proud of them.</p>
<p class="contents">In our countries two or three girls do not go to prison because they sing songs criticising the leader of their country. In our countries people are free and proud of that freedom and people understand what it means to live in freedom. In many of our countries, namely the most recent Member States, there is a recent memory of what was dictatorship and totalitarianism.</p>
<p class="contents">Previous generations have overcome much bigger challenges. Now it is for this generation to show they are up to the task. Now is the moment for all Europeans to leave business as usual behind and to embrace the business of the future. The European Union was built to guarantee peace but today this means making our Union fit to meet the challenges of globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we need a new thinking for Europe, a decisive deal for Europe. That is why we need to guide ourselves by the values that are at the heart of the European Union. I believe that Europe has a soul and this soul can give us the strength and the determination to do what we must do.</p>
<p class="contents">You can count on the European Commission. I count on you, the European Parliament, because together, as Community institutions, we will build a better, stronger and a more united Europe, a citizens’ union for the future of Europe and also for the future of the world.</p>

<p class="contents">We are back after summer break and, as is the case each year, we have two things to do: take stock of the past twelve months and discuss the future of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we are heading in the right direction now. What I mean is that we need to continue along the road towards greater European integration We also need more specific reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we have been talking about the crisis for three years now. We know that we were living beyond our means for too long, we know that we need greater discipline and a return to balanced budgets. Only then will we be able to invest in our future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">We know the ways out of the crisis. In economic terms, what we have done over the last three years, we have done too slowly, and that has cost us billions. As for the economic governance package, the Euro Plus Pact, the European Semester, the Single Market Act, and in some sectors, for example, the banks, the need for European solutions is evident. Banks are no longer national, but transnational. A failing bank can bring down the entire banking system. This is why my group supports your proposal to establish a single supervisory mechanism in the banking sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we know that our solutions are positive and we have examples to back this up. Although, I have not written it down on my sheet here, you have made me realise that there are also some positive examples. I think that the governments that have made the most reforms in Europe also belong to our political family. I am thinking about our friend Mr Dombrovskis. Although his is a small country deep in crisis, he got it out of crisis and there is now meaningful growth. Here too, as I see it, is an example, and he did it without having to rely too much on European solidarity. In his speeches, he stressed that in this deep crisis the only money he had to invest, was money he received from the EU budget. I think this needs to be given some thought because, unlike some, we realised how serious the situation was.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that our economies are in bad shape and that the only way to get them better is a complete cure. To kick start this, we need a change of habits. We need large-scale rather than small-scale reforms. Yes, it is hard, but what choice do we have? For these reforms to succeed, we must also promote competitiveness and growth. My group supports those governments that are going down this route.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to make another point. European solidarity should not be confused with charity. That is why I support the European Central Bank’s proposal to buy bonds because any State that benefits from this solidarity must act responsibly. Without a programme of reforms offering credible proposals, a State cannot receive this aid. This is the right approach. It is a European approach and, by bolstering States in difficulty, it is Europe, as a whole, that we are strengthening.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I will say it again, 20 years after it was introduced, we have still not completed the single market. Mr Barroso, I am appealing to you again. We must, as a matter of urgency, develop an action plan with precise deadlines to finish the job we started. The rules on the single market should be simple, consistently applied and implemented as a single package. For example, because of red tape, 23 million European SMEs still have no access to all 27 markets. Let me tell you that one job created in each of these 23 million small- and medium-sized enterprises – if you tot it up - is a significant number. That is why my group has called for a reduction in red tape by 2015. At least 50% less paper: think of the trees saved for the environment. By doing this, we are giving European companies the chance to create jobs. The Commission must play a full part and have no hesitation in enforcing the law. Publish lists of States that have still not implemented the directives and force them to do so. Use your powers! Governments are frequently challenging us Europeans. Everything is always our fault. Let them, then, take some responsibility too.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on you, Mr President, to define new, concrete fields in which the European institutions should intervene. I am convinced that there is a very simple remedy for the current crisis: it is more Europe, yet more Europe and more Europe again.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need is fiscal and social harmonisation. Our joint actions and policies are successful. Let me give you one example that will surely surprise you: agricultural policy. This truly is a joint policy which has ensured food security – as you mentioned – during periods of significant fluctuations. It has also got entire regions out of poverty. This policy must remain European. Above all, we must not do what many are now calling for and renationalise it. That would be a disaster. This is a European policy that been successful and must remain European.</p>
<p class="contents">To take another example, unemployment, and in particular youth unemployment. No country can solve this problem on its own. Even if this comes under national jurisdiction, again, it is time to find a European solution. Again, I am thinking about this extra job in each of the 23 million SMEs. It might make you all smile, but not me: twenty-three million extra jobs with a European policy for youth employment; that should make you think.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, as you said, Mr President, we are in the throes of an unprecedented storm. There are those in Europe and elsewhere, who would be only too pleased to see the euro collapse. Personally, I do not want to give them that pleasure and nor do you, José Manuel. Besides, why do the credit rating agencies prefer to attack the euro, rather than judge the country they know best where their head office is? They are not making the same analyses. I know why but, all the same, it is not right. We must face this storm, not by plastering up the cracks, but by strengthening our foundations. We must not repeat past mistakes. Creating an economic union without an accompanying political union is inconceivable. Our credibility is at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, let us show some European ambition. Europe makes decisions that affect 500 million Europeans. These decisions should be taken under democratic control, by the only institution elected by direct universal suffrage. The place of democratic legitimacy is here in Parliament, and I thank President Schulz for having refocused matters. We are elected democratically. I therefore think we should be recognised democratically. The so-called ‘four presidents’’ proposal aiming at real economic and monetary union is ambitious but it needs to be more so and Parliament should also be involved in this. Concentrating only on economic reforms is the wrong way to go because the economic crisis has become a political crisis, a crisis of confidence – as you rightly pointed out at the end. Now, I agree on a Treaty change in the medium and long term, but this is not the solution we need in the immediate future. Because I am French, all we need is for some Rules of Procedure to be applied to fiscal and social policies, and to be included in the Treaty when we have time to think. Now is the time for action.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest Eurobarometer struck me. It reveals that a majority of Europeans think that Europe is indeed a good thing. But in many Member States, more and more of our citizens do not feel European. It is our duty - as you said - to explain the added value, but it is also the duty of all national leaders. For me, a good, responsible politician is like a good doctor. Both have to explain things, both have to tell the truth, both have to convince you, even if you do not want to hear it. We need to discuss the next steps of our integration with this reality in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I am calling for more Europe, not more power for the sake of having power. We must build a Europe that can meet the challenges of the 21st century. This is why we want the 2014-2020 EU budget to have a credible, solid and ambitious framework, as it has been prepared by the Commission and Parliament. Here too, the Heads of State or Government are being held to political account and it will show our citizens whether or not we want more Europe. The European budget is not a budget of spending, but a budget of investing. It is a forward-looking budget, a budget for growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be serious and ambitious. I call on all those responsible to find a solution before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, judges will today rule on the democratic legitimacy of EU decisions. Here in Parliament, we champion democratic control at European level. We also need to have the courage to appeal to the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg when we think that our rights are not being respected. We must go before the Court frequently, as others do, and I am sure that will also strengthen Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also why we need a real political Europe. A Europe where Parliament is the only direct representative of the citizens of Europe. If we do not do this, we will fail. Political union is legitimacy, it is more democratic control, more citizen participation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the Europe that I believe in. These are the values that our group supports.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hannes Swoboda, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the S&amp;D Group</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, you have given a good speech, Mr Barroso, parts of which could even be described as very good. In some areas I would like to see things being taken further and I will also be explaining where we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament would go further. You have declared your support for the European social model and rightly so. I would have liked to have seen more support for the social model from those on the right, because it is very much at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">You have assured us of your commitment to Europe’s role in the world, which must be a strong role. That is also the right thing to do. Yesterday, Mr Goebbels reported on a meeting in Asia. The Asian representative began his speech with the words: ‘we from the emerging countries and you Europeans from the submerging countries’. That is the image that Europe, at least in part, is presenting today. We all agree that we want Europe to continue to belong to the emerging countries and regions. However, if we do not change our economic policy, this will not happen. If we see the economic crisis only as a crisis in state spending – you presented it in more differentiated terms, but many others on the right see it in this way – and, therefore, if we believe that it is simply about cutting services, then we will not emerge from the crisis. In fact, we will end up in an even deeper recession. The Portuguese Prime Minister made this quite clear. If you start with an extreme austerity policy, you end up having to reach even deeper into people’s pockets. We do not want that. We do not want the poorest people in Europe to become even poorer. That is not a policy that we in the S&amp;D Group can support.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, I have said to you on many occasions that the troika is unfortunately contributing to this recessionary policy. The troika should instead be focusing on fundamental reforms of decrepit structures, which is what we need. However, if the troika believes that we can get out of this mess simply by making cuts, I would like to know where all its successes have been. Every forecast based on measures recommended by the troika has had to be corrected.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In Spain – and the foreign minister and the minister for Europe are sitting here, our former colleagues, even if they are chatting to one another – unemployment has risen from 11% to 24%, a world record for comparable countries, and sovereign debt has increased from 40% to 81%. Is that supposed to be a success? The troika is unsuccessful, because it has the wrong solutions, because it is not investing in growth and because it is not familiar with the concept of ‘demand’ as a stimulus for growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Daul, you mentioned Mr Dombrovskis. Has Mr Dombrovskis told you how many well-trained people have left Latvia, the other Baltic states and the countries in the south because they cannot find jobs? This is what is called success, when unemployment levels are high and those who are affected are exported. Where are the people of Europe supposed to emigrate to if we all end up in a recession? Mozambique, Angola, Brazil and other countries will not be big enough.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Let us be honest. The policy has failed. The only institution that has stepped into the breach at the moment is the European Central Bank (ECB). Not that I am happy with all its measures. However, if we did not have the ECB, we would be in a much deeper mess. If we did not have a man like Mr Draghi at its head, but instead had a man like Mr Weidmann, the catastrophe in Europe would be much more serious.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We politicians are facing a challenge. There is an alternative which, most importantly, must lead to investment. Mr Barroso, in the US public investment is increasing. In China public investment is increasing. In Japan public investment is increasing. What is happening in Europe? How can we go on talking about competitiveness, if we are no longer investing? You are on our side when it comes to the question of tax increases and tax evasion. If we only received a quarter of the tax revenue which we lose every year in Europe through tax evasion, by means of transfers to Switzerland and other tax havens, we could increase public investment in Europe by 40%. That is our problem.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we agree with you. To ensure that the financial markets do not react as dramatically as they have done, we need stronger regulation which is targeted in particular at high-frequency trading. We definitely need measures to combat tax avoidance and tax evasion. I am calling once again on Austria and Luxembourg finally to give the Commission a mandate for negotiations with Switzerland. We also need the financial transaction tax. A motion has still not been submitted to the Commission. I agree with you about the banking union and the supervision of the banks. We must not prop them up again using taxpayers’ money. We need a budget that stimulates growth. We are on your side. I want to be very clear about one thing. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament will not vote in favour of a European budget that makes no contribution to growth. We are strongly opposed to attempts to cut the budget even further for populist reasons. It is already small enough and many regions need this budget.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">However, what we are particularly concerned about is the disregard for the social question. This does not just affect the poor countries. If we look at youth unemployment and how fast it is growing, it is clearly not only a problem for the countries on the periphery. Do the ladies and gentlemen in this House know that one in every five workers in Germany, good old wealthy Germany, is a low-paid worker? Are the ladies and gentlemen on the right who do not belong to the German Christian Democratic Union (CDU) aware that Ms von der Leyen, their minister, wanted to take extensive measures to combat old-age poverty, but was prevented from doing so by her own party and has now had to go to the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and ask for help? That is the reality: poverty, old-age poverty and youth unemployment are all things which are extremely serious problems in the peripheral countries in the south, but which are gradually also reaching the wealthy countries like Germany. Germany is also sliding into recession. One third of Germans are worried about social exclusion. That is today’s Europe. If we want to defend Europe, it should not be a Europe like this.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a scandal that the paper produced by Mr Van Rompuy contains nothing about the social issues. You will probably agree with this, Mr Barroso, but I am calling on you to take action. The questions which concern most people in Europe today, in other words, unemployment, poverty and social exclusion, are not even mentioned in Mr Van Rompuy’s paper. Therefore, I am calling for a chapter in the paper on social issues. On behalf of my group, I am also calling for a social pact, because the ladies and gentlemen on the right of this House are very keen on having a fiscal compact. I agree. With great difficulty and only as a result of pressure from the new French Government, we have a growth pact, a weak one, but a growth pact all the same. However, a social pact is apparently not important to you at all. We need a social pact to combat the decline in solidarity in Europe, youth unemployment and old-age poverty and to promote the integration of our foreign and immigrant fellow citizens. There are many social questions in Europe and, therefore, my group would like to have a social pact at last, not only a weak growth pact and not only a stringent fiscal pact.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, the President of Parliament has also touched on the issue of democracy which has been put at risk by the mismanagement of the many financial markets. Sovereignty is in jeopardy, but national sovereignty is not threatened by Europe. However, democracy is definitely also at risk, because we are seeing antidemocratic tendencies developing. As the Council takes on more and more responsibility, in particular for budget issues, I would like to know who the Council is accountable to for its actions. At a national level it is the individual Heads of State or Government. Mr Van Rompuy is notable for his absence from this House. We rarely see him and generally only after the event, when he explains what has happened or more often what has not happened. This is an unacceptable trend. We want the Council to be fully accountable, particularly to this House, because parliamentary democracy at a European level is part of democracy as a whole. It is an essential component of democracy. The Council should not take upon itself responsibilities and powers which it is not entitled to. That is a violation of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Some journalists in the German and Austrian media rightly regard the Council as a bastion of nationalism. I understand your concept of a federation of nation states. However, Mr Barroso, it must be clear that we are fighting together to ensure that the individual countries hand over to Europe the powers needed to allow us to defend our sovereignty jointly in today’s and tomorrow’s world.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that we also need a new treaty. However, if we tell the people who are currently unemployed that we have no jobs for them and, at the same time, begin discussing a new EU treaty, at best, they will fail to understand us and, at worst, they will resort to violence. Therefore, we need to proceed with caution. First of all, we must have a European debate. We discussed this yesterday with some of the foreign ministers, who are working on a paper. We need a European debate on the goals of the future Europe. We have a great deal in common in this area. Then after the next elections we can organise a convention. When we know where we want to go, this convention can also, and I would like to make this quite clear, decide on a new constitution and not on an amendment to the treaty. We finally need a European constitution, but only after we have solved our current problems. That is vital.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr Barroso, I would like to offer you the opportunity to work closely together with us. If we fight side-by-side to achieve a Europe of employment, of social cohesion and of democracy, then we will be on the right track. We do not have a lot of time until the next elections. We need to make changes in Europe. We must join together to combat the decline in solidarity and to fight against nationalism, which represents a threat to us. We can all be proud of our national flags, but if the European flag does not fly next to the British flag, then it is wrong to fly the British flag. If the European flag is there, then the British one can be as well, because it is the concept of a shared Europe that links us together.</p>

<p class="contents">But what we are seeing today is more of a deep political crisis. Everybody is talking about public finances, about interest rates, about economics. In my opinion it is not about Greece, it is not about the public finances, it is not even about economics as being the fallout of the crisis. The real nature of this crisis is a political one and that is the political incapacity today to make the jump forward to a federal union and, more precisely, the incapacity of the national elites of Europe to make this jump to a more federal union in Europe. That is the real crisis we are going through today.</p>
<p class="contents">I am saying that, Mr Barroso, because you have made a whole speech, but at the end of the speech you come up with a concept and that concept we cannot accept: a federation of nation states. No, no federation of nation states, that is more of the same, we have that already – that is the European Council, which is a federation of nation states where the Heads of Government and the Heads of State were trying to solve and are incapable of solving this crisis. We do not want more of the same – we do not need a nationalistic or a national future for Europe. We need a post-national future for Europe. That is what we need. What we need for Europe is not a federation of nation states: it is a federal union of European citizens. It is about citizens and it is not about nation states in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Maybe Mr Barroso is going to tell us that he is in fact going to turn the federation of nation states into a federal union. Then we will certainly have unanimity in the Chamber today. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, even after the decision of the Constitutional Court – I am always a little bit critical when we talk about the Constitutional Court, as if there were no constitutional courts in other EU countries for the moment, but maybe in the future we can give them as much attention as we have given to Karlsruhe – there are still three remarks to be made.</p>
<p class="contents">First, it is not the European Central Bank that will solve the crisis. The European Central Bank can help; the European Bank has done the unavoidable in that for the third time already – after Trichet with SMP, after the LTRO – Draghi has bought us time again. But this is a stop-gap solution; this is not a structural solution to this crisis and it is a mistake to think in this House that, if the ECB comes in, then our problems are over. No, our problems are only over if we have the courage to create the federal union that is so desperately needed. Do not think that this new measure of Draghi can work for more than five or six months. The crisis will come back if we do not assume responsibility – that is my second remark today, dear colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />We all know what the solution is. We all know – besides a number of individuals on the other side of the plenary – that we need an economic union, we need a political union, we need a fiscal union. We all know that is the solution. I find it unthinkable that we are still waiting to come forward with proposals and what are we doing, in fact? Waiting for the outcome of the German elections or something like that, because that is the political reality for the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I stress that I think it is very good, Mr Barroso, that today you have introduced a proposal for a single financial supervisor, which is one of the three building blocks for a banking union. But what I do not understand is why the Commission is not also taking the initiative on the other building blocks that are needed to solve this crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">We desperately need a resolution mechanism for the banks. The establishment of an economic government and a treasury in Europe: we need it desperately, if we want to solve the crisis. The mutualisation of debt by the establishment of redemption funds: even the chief of the German <span class="italic">Sparkasse</span> last week said – and he is the former Minister of Finance in Bavaria, a good member of the CSU – that it is absolutely necessary that we have a redemption fund if we want to solve this crisis. Furthermore he, the chief of the whole <span class="italic">Sparkasse</span> in Germany, has asked the European Commission to take the initiative in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />So my question to you, Mr Barroso, is why these two standards? If the European Council in June was asking you to come forward with a proposal for a banking union within two months – and that is a good thing – why is Mr Barnier not putting forward a proposal for a banking union? If this Parliament has already asked the Commission four times, in the Two-Pack and in the resolutions, to come forward with a redemption fund, which is a real structural solution to this crisis, why do we receive nothing at all? Why is the European Council more important than the European Parliament when you come forward with your own initiatives? Why?</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we are in a balanced Union. You have the Council and you have Parliament. If Parliament requests that you come forward with a package of legislative proposals to end this crisis, it is your obligation and duty to do that. We are still waiting. We are still waiting for, I do not know what, perhaps the green light from Berlin or from of Paris before you take action in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me finally to my third point, the proposal that we have on the table today, which is the creation, the establishment of a single financial supervisory authority by giving more powers to the European Central Bank. I have to tell you, Mr Barroso, I think it is a good idea that we have that, because we need a single supervisor. But I have some question marks on the model that we are choosing today because, let us be honest, what we are doing is mainly copying the <span class="italic">Banque de France</span>. In most of our countries – in Britain it is the case, in Belgium, in the Netherlands and in Germany too – you have a split between a monetary authority on the one hand and financial supervision of banks on the other. I cannot understand why we cannot merge the three institutions that we have today into what we call a financial supervisory agency or authority, so that we do not mix a financial supervision task with a monetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">I see a number of possible conflicts today: euro zone banks versus non-euro zone banks; banks versus other financial institutions. I see a problem between the ECB and the EBA. The EBA is creating the roadmap and the ECB is applying the roadmap.</p>
<p class="contents">I also see a problem on democratic accountability, because democratic accountability is not compatible with the independence of the Bank. So my proposal to you, Mr Barroso, is to look further into that question and also to change the legal basis. My proposal and suggestion to you and Mr Barnier is not only to use Article 127 as a legal base, but also Article 114, so that we have full codecision with Parliament on such an important matter in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">So I conclude, Mr President, but I have a little more time as you interrupted me in the beginning of my speech – with good news, so there is no criticism from my side. I think it is absolutely necessary now, Mr Barroso, that not only do we hear a good speech from you but that you put forward a whole package of legislative proposals in the way Parliament wants. Because do not forget that your legitimacy comes from this House, from this Parliament, and it is also this House that can take it back.</p>

Maybe it is because you were Prime Minister of a Member State for ten years that you know all about the unscrupulous behaviour of national governments, but do you really think - and I have been a federalist for as long as you have - that there will be a federation in Europe against Member States which, may I remind you, have governments that have been democratically elected?

Mr Barroso, when you talk of crisis, do not forget the ecological crisis, the environmental constraints, which you failed to mention in your description of the crisis today. We are facing a poly-crisis, a number of crises, and the ecological crisis is one of the most important crises, along with the financial and economic crisis and the democratic crisis. If you were to rework this speech, be sure to add this in.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Mr Barroso, you said: ‘Europe needs a new way of thinking, it needs a new direction’. Yes, but if we want to take a new direction, we will need a compass. In what direction do we want to go? This is where the debate between Mr Lamberts and Mr Verhofstadt is interesting, because we do need to be honest. I agree with Mr Verhofstadt when he says that the Council and governments have been unable to come up with responses to the crisis. They have been hedging their bets. We are going to help Greece, a little, a lot, passionately, madly, not all … We never knew what the true position of governments was. Even today, we do not know. It is true, then, that the Council is incapable. Yet, Mr Verhofstadt, Parliament is also incapable, the European institutions are also incapable. When Parliament was not capable of voting for the development of transnational lists for the next elections, it clearly showed us that it is not up to the debate that we need.</p>
<p class="contents">Back to the compass, then. I am absolutely convinced that Europe now needs to be federalised. I do not agree with what you have picked up from Jacques Delors, a federation of nation-States. Yes, we need a post-national Europe which is not just a federation of states. That is what we need in Europe. Obviously, in a Senate, a second chamber, the States will play an important role in European legislation, but what is unacceptable today is that we have a Council that acts as executive and legislator at the same time. That is no longer possible. Montesquieu would be turning in his grave. A legislator cannot be an executive and an executive cannot be a legislator. We must denounce this for the sake of progress.</p>
<p class="contents">You spoke about the budget, Mr Barroso. You are right, but, come on, be honest. We must use our compass to stay on the course towards federalisation. I would like to give those of you, here, that do not know it, some information. When the US federal budget was set up by Roosevelt, in 1932, it was 1% of US GDP. In 1945, it was 7% of GDP. In 2012, it is 23% of GDP. As long as the EU budget represents only 1% of European GDP, well, we cannot have meaningful European social policy. It will definitely not work.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that in the next five years, the EU budget should rise from 1% to 5% of the European gross domestic product. That is the real debate that needs to be had with the nation States. This increase must be achieved using our own resources. It is not through national contributions, the very embodiment of national self-interests, that we will manage to build Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me put this simply. Mr Barroso, you spoke of flexicurity. Having a flexible labour market with secure working conditions is obviously right. Take a country like Greece, where unemployment has reached astounding levels. Do you believe that, if we were to now organise a flexible labour market, like the one you want, this country can pay for the security? If we now want flexicurity for some poor countries, whether that is Greece, Spain Italy or any other country with a serious unemployment crisis, they will need support for that security, and that will have to come from the EU budget. Otherwise, we will not succeed and nor will they. If you want there to be a genuine social pact, for Europe to have the means to help those States who are not able to provide security, like the United States can do with their budget, well, we will not achieve this with 1%, and not even with the amount proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">If we grab the compass today and steer Europe into the right direction of federalisation, we can give Greece the social redemption fund immediately. We need to ultimately tell Greece the truth. The truth is that you can still have an adjustment policy, but that is it. We need to be honest and open. Greece obviously needs more time; we will obviously need to give money to Greece. A woman working part-time in a supermarket in Greece earns EUR 150. This cannot be the case anymore. Let me tell you something, ladies and gentlemen: the Greek right-wing are now going door-to-door giving families EUR 20, EUR 30 When you earn EUR 150, 20 or 30 is a lot. The extreme right in Greece is doing what the Islamists are doing in other countries. Is European Union therefore not able, in this crisis situation, to provide a social redemption fund to help crisis-hit countries like Greece so that Greek citizens turn back to Europe and not to the extreme right? You can see fascism spreading in Greek society.</p>
<p class="contents">I have said what I want to say. The notion of a compass is very straightforward: more opportunities for the European Union to intervene, a meaningful European budget, a social redemption fund for crisis-hit countries in Europe With this and the proposals made by Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Daul, we can bring back the majority of European citizens towards Europe.</p>

<p class="contents">I wish to say to President Barroso: my group supported you for a second term. We wanted you to succeed in shaping a positive agenda for reform of the EU. In some areas, such as international trade or the single market, your Commission has made some progress which we welcome, and we welcome your further announcements today of progress on the single market. But overall I have to say we are very disappointed. Rather than seeing European renewal, as you yet again promised last year, all we have seen is the same old tired approach: more Europe rather than better Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Exactly two years ago the main initiative to emerge from your State of the Union speech was project bonds. Two years on, nothing has happened, they are merely at a pilot phase. Last year your big idea was an EU-wide financial transactions tax, and today thankfully that idea is dead in the water. This year we have a banking union, we have more Treaty change – the knee-jerk reflex of the European elite to every crisis. You told us today that we have the power to shape the world. Mr Barroso, can I suggest that first of all you concentrate on solving the problems of Europe before you worry about shaping the rest of the world?</p>
<p class="contents">And so far, the response to the euro zone crisis has been characterised by seeking short-term, sticking-plaster solutions and long-term institutional navel-gazing. Listening to you today it looks as though that is going to continue. Bail-outs – ECB Ponzi schemes – have enabled you to kick the infamous can even further down the road, and last week’s ECB decision to buy up bonds may be, as some Members have said, a useful stop-gap, but it is in no sense a solution. Risks have simply been transferred from one balance sheet to another.</p>
<p class="contents">The essential nonsense of this current approach was for me brilliantly illustrated over the summer. If you remember, Greece had to repay a EUR 5 billion loan to the ECB, so to do this they issued new short-term bonds. All of these bonds were bought by Greek banks. Those Greek banks are, of course, all technically bust. So where did they get the money from? They borrowed it from the ECB to pay the Greek state who then gave it back to the ECB again.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this is exactly the kind of financial chicanery which caused the economic crisis in the first place, and now you want us to have another long drawn-out academic debate about more Treaty change, about a banking union. We will scrutinise your proposals very carefully to make sure that they respect the rights of those Member States that thankfully chose not to join the euro. We wish to maintain the integrity of the single market and ensure that your proposals do not damage that market.</p>
<p class="contents">The euro was, of course, a political project from the start. I well remember the many debates in this House we had about it, where the political symbolism was much more important than the economic reality. I bet many of you are regretting that now. Well, President, we are now in an economic crisis and it will be solved with economic solutions, by confronting some fairly stark economic truths.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a reality – and Members have referred to this, Mr Barroso referred to this – that some euro zone countries are less competitive than others. For them, the euro is acting like a straitjacket, preventing the currency devaluation that would give them time to put in place longer-term reforms. And to illustrate how urgent the problem is, I agree with Mr Swoboda, a new report from the ILO shows that Spain now has the highest documented unemployment rate in the world. Greece unfortunately comes second. This is misery on an epic scale in those countries, and we really should do something about it. So let us be honest about it. Let us be honest with ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The only way that the euro can be made to work with 17 members is if the people of Germany, the people of the Netherlands, the people of Finland, are prepared to transfer cash – not loans, cash – from their taxpayers’ pockets in order to bridge the competitiveness gap. Now I do not think that is ever going to happen and the people of those countries deserve our understanding of why that is not possible.</p>
<p class="contents">So surely the only other alternative is for some countries to leave the euro, to devalue their currencies and for us to support them as they find the right policies that will return them to sustainable public spending and growth in the long-term. The euro area needs to be restructured, and I do not say that with delight, Mr Barroso. I say it because I think it is the only realistic course of action that will deliver for people who are desperate for a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU faces a crisis of leadership. Mr Barroso told us so himself last year in the State of the Union address, and I agree with him in that particular case. The EU does face a crisis of leadership. It needs a leadership that faces the economic reality of the euro crisis and does not keep avoiding the problem. We need new leadership that respects our nation states as building blocks of democracy which should be supported and not undermined.</p>
<p class="contents">We take away people’s right to control their destiny through the ballot box at our peril. Already frustrated, angry and fearful people are toying with extremist forces and the alarm bells should be ringing. On that point, and on that point alone, I agree with Mr Cohn-Bendit.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a new leadership which will tackle Europe’s fundamental competitiveness crisis in the wider global economy and which will pursue a new direction to relaunch growth along the lines outlined by 12 EU prime ministers in their letter in February.</p>
<p class="contents">In America, Governor Romney has set out a plan for how he would renew America by returning it to a land of personal ambition, enterprise and freedom. In the EU we come from the same traditions and we are at our best when government is small, when markets are free and when the people exercise control over their government.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, I still hope that, as you prepare your work programme for next year, it is not too late for you to shake off the policies of the past and to champion genuine reform of the EU so that it can become relevant to today’s reality and help us to succeed in facing the difficult years ahead.</p>

It was a great liberation for us and, of course, once having been bitten we did not join the euro project, thank goodness. Sadly, the same is not true for much of the rest of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I thought, through the last 18 months or so, that the economic logic of why Britain left the ERM would apply, particularly to those Mediterranean countries, and I foresaw that actually those countries would leave the euro zone, probably with Greece leaving this year. But I now have to accept that I have been wrong about that, because I had totally underestimated the complete fanaticism of you, Mr Barroso, your college of Commissioners, and the European Central Bank. You have come out fighting on all fronts. Today you announced that there is going to be a banking union, yet more centralised control, yet more regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">You make it clear that whilst you think the nation state should continue to exist, it must not have any democratic powers. All democracy is to be vested here under what you call the ‘Community method’ which of course means that your unelected Commission has the sole right to present that legislation, so I do not believe you when you say that and I find the tone of much of what has been said and done over the last few days really very worrying.</p>
<p class="contents">Mario Draghi, now known by some that believe in the euro as Super Mario, showed us his big bazooka the other day. He upped the stakes and he told us – and to me it is an odd concept – that he had unlimited money. Now, I do not think money grows on trees and I think that money is limited to what the German, Dutch and Finnish taxpayers are prepared to put in, but he has made clear his intention: he will fight to the last German taxpayer to keep the Mediterranean countries that should never have joined the euro in there. And now you have of course the Prime Minister of Italy – perhaps we ought to call him Monstrous Mario – who made it clear last week that he feared that nation state democracy could bring down the European Union and therefore we have to by-pass nation state democracy and pass all the powers here.</p>
<p class="contents">Your henchman Olli Rehn, who is here today, dares to tell countries when they should and should not have general elections. He is urging Spain to accept a full bailout so that they too are trapped in the euro prison. I have to accept that you now have the whip hand over the citizens of Europe and I now think that this euro crisis will go on for a whole miserable decade.</p>
<p class="contents">In the end, you will have to face the reality that even France and Germany cannot survive together in the same economic and monetary union and certainly with President Hollande reducing retirement ages, upping minimum wages and bringing in a hate tax for the successful, which will see all the entrepreneurs leave France, I am afraid that gap will get bigger. I wonder where the hope comes for those who believe in nation state democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard that the German court this morning has decided that the ESM is OK. Maybe the Finns will say they have had enough. Maybe the Germans as a country will say they are no longer going to go on feeling ashamed and guilty for what their grandparents’ generation did and will start to stand up for their own economic interest.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know, but I suspect that the best hope we have actually comes from the United Kingdom, where the demand for a referendum is stronger than it has ever been, where our Conservative Prime Minister is in very deep trouble. I think today, Mr Barroso, the British people hearing you calling for the European Union to become a global power, making it absolutely clear that Member States must obey what you tell them, whether they are in the relatively wealthy north or the poorer south, I think those comments, this emerging, creeping, Euro-dictatorship is something that will repulse millions of British people. The only good news I take from today is that you have helped to bring that referendum just a little bit closer.</p>

I would like to say to you, Mr Barroso, that you have explained your idea of the route which the European Union will take towards becoming a banking union and a political union and you have highlighted the model of a democratic federation of nation states. There is obviously a lot to say about this. However, I believe that the decisive point, which forms the basis of all the discussions about developing the European Union’s future and working together to shape it, is: What is the people’s opinion of this, how will they become involved and whose interest does a future model of this kind ultimately serve? If we can answer this question, it will probably be easier for us to discuss the sort of Europe that we need in the future. Many others have recently been talking in the same way as you about fundamental changes of course that now need to be made.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to explain to you that, in my view, at least three premises have not been met which are needed to prevent us from ending up in a blind alley. This also applies to what you have said today, at least in the case of the first two. It is clear from your answer that you are afraid, along with other representatives of the European institutions and the governments, of the threat of losing economic and political influence in the world, of the shrinking proportion of the population and the dwindling share of resources, to put it briefly, of sacrificing economic power and strength.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, you are willing to combat the crisis in the EU, but not its causes. The focus is moving away from the interests of the people, who urgently need a functioning, social and green Union based on the principle of solidarity. We need to hold the discussion now and not to paint a picture which may apply at some point in the future, but is not relevant to their interests and their current difficulties. You are putting the emphasis on greater regulation by the institutions, because this is what the financial elite needs. This is how you intend to bring an end to the functional deficits in the EU economy and, in particular, in the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point, and here I will leave you out to a certain extent, is that you, in other words, the institutions and, most importantly, those in government, are assuming that this route will be accompanied by a serious threat to Europe’s democratic fabric. I am very grateful to you for one thing, which is that you have made it clear that the European Parliament is needed, because without Parliament and its elected Members the discussion on reshaping Europe is not possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would have welcomed many of the Commission proposals, including a banking union and Eurobonds, if they had not focused primarily on making profits in a competitive global environment. I want to be quite clear about this. I am in favour of more regulation of the markets and the banks, the removal of functional deficits in the economic and monetary union and even the banking union and Eurobonds. However, I am opposed to these objectives, to the way in which they will be achieved, to the conditions that have been put in place and to undermining democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We must focus on the people in the European Union, in particular in the hard-hit crisis countries, and, most importantly, young people, old people, the unemployed and women. An earlier speaker mentioned, for example, the question of the Commission withdrawing its proposal for quotas for women and I would like to know why this is being done. In the light of the fact that most of the proposals for bringing an end to the crisis and developing the future European Union have been made by men, and in this context the presence of Ms Merkel by no means constitutes equality, and that women have been hardest hit by the crisis, I find it incomprehensible that we are prepared to sacrifice a fundamental value and a part of the European Parliament’s and the EU’s concept of themselves and, without making any protests, withdraw a call for women’s equality now and allow it to be taken away from us. I cannot accept that and my group will also not support it.</p>
<p class="contents">The so-called reforms which have been adopted in the memorandum with regard to the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the Euro Plus Pact, the fiscal compact and so on, represent an attack on people’s fundamental social rights. Mr Barroso, you cannot explain here how important the people and their social situation in the European Union are to you, while at the same time the Commission, which is part of the troika, is largely responsible for imposing conditions on Greece which will have an impact on the social situation of the very weakest members of society. As a member of the troika, the Commission simply cannot allow calls for working hours to be extended from five to six days, for the minimum wage to be drastically reduced and for strikes to be banned. That is totally unacceptable. It is your job to protect precisely these European Union values in times of crisis. The Commission is the guardian of the European Union’s values and standards.</p>
<p class="contents">In my group’s view, one example of what we are currently experiencing is the fiscal compact. We are still questioning whether it complies with EU law. In the meantime, we have had the treaty evaluated by an expert and it is correct that the compact lies outside the EU’s legal framework. It falls back on EU institutions for its implementation, but excludes the European Parliament. In the near future my group will be evaluating how we can take political action against this and what rights we have in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">On the path that the European Union is taking, and previous speakers have already discussed this, those in power are increasingly having recourse to the German model. However, the German model is not suitable for use as a model for the future European Union. We cannot accept it in this form.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again I would like to ask you specifically to reformulate your ideas, and you have already been called on to do this, about how we can emerge from the crisis and where the European Union should go. You should focus on the social progress clause and the social pact. You should stop all attempts to privatise social goods, social services, social security systems and pensions and put an end to any pressure on the Member States to do so. These are the reasons why many people have lost their faith in the European Union. We need to restore that faith and we can only do this by finally taking on the task of creating a social, green and democratic Europe based on the principle of solidarity, a democratic Union which also fulfils its obligation as a global player to show solidarity with others. I would like to distance myself totally from what has just been said by those on the right. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know that the decision made in Karlsruhe today will in reality only buy us a little more time. We know that all the measures that have been taken so far, whether these are liquidity injections from the European Central Bank (ECB), aid for Greece or the latest decision to buy bonds, are just a roundabout way of financing the banks. It is no coincidence that bank shares rose dramatically last Thursday. This is, of course, bitterly ironic, because the City of London has benefited from these bank redistributions out of the euro area and involving the euro. There is a group in this Parliament which spends its time defending the City of London – you could also call them the most effective lobbyists – and those are the members of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), who are constantly saying the same thing, which is very dangerous for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, you have been speaking about the irresponsible actions of the banks which triggered the crisis. However, we are also aware that we politicians have failed, because we have not kept the banks under control. You asked whether it was realistic for us to expect to regain the confidence of the markets, but that is not really the right question. The question is: Why are you not finally tackling the issue of bank regulation, as your mentor Ms Merkel has already done? Every player, every financial institution and every market place must be controlled. Why do we no longer talk about the fact that possibly the most important financial act of the 20th century, the US Glass-Steagall Act of 1932, could be a suitable model for Europe? If we were to implement it, we would finally be rid of the problem of banks that are too big to fail. It is clear that many banks are not only too big to fail, but also much too big to be managed effectively. We do not even need to mention the word LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate). I would like to know why you are not bold enough to take the necessary effective action. The Glass-Steagall Act has only 37 pages. Our previous confused attempts to bring the financial world under control amount to thousands of pages. This results in a lack of understanding and reinforces the crisis of confidence which you rightly referred to.</p>
<p class="contents">If you were already in the process of tackling the banking system, then you would, of course, also need to look at the shadow banks, which worldwide have a volume of almost EUR 46 billion, amounting to a quarter of the entire financial market. The members of the Commission do not even know how much money is being used where and in what way. We do not know how many naked credit default swaps there are on government bonds. That is one of the main reasons why all the measures now being taken are being taken in this way. We can intervene here and we can introduce regulations. This also applies to the rating agencies, which politicians and legislators have elevated to their current position, and to the lobby groups. How can it be that there are 700 financial lobbyists with a budget of EUR 350 million in Brussels and the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs almost have to beg to get hold of the information they need? The situation is totally unbalanced.</p>
<p class="contents">You referred to the crisis of confidence and that is, of course, entirely appropriate. However, if you do not succeed in getting the monster that is the financial markets under control, you will not have a majority anywhere in Europe for what is presumably a sensible objective, in other words, a strong Europe in a globalised world. You are well aware that you will not be able to avoid holding referendums, at least in Germany and in my home country of Austria, on a new project. However, if there are to be referendums, then the necessary steps must be taken first.</p>
<p class="contents">Much of what has already been said on this subject is, of course, true. However, I would like to repeat that you should be concentrating solely on regulating the financial markets. It is clear from conversations with people all over Europe that this is a very important issue. A new conspiracy theory is now going the rounds which claims that Europe is really governed by Goldman Sachs, because Mr Draghi, Mr Monti and many of the events in Greece have direct links with Goldman Sachs. These are dangerous trends. However, if you manage to get the financial sector under control, then you will no longer have to be concerned about sovereign power. I am convinced that we can win the referendums, but the key word is, of course, not ‘banking union’, but ‘citizens union’ or to put it briefly ‘citizens not banks’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am very proud to mention that the Council is not only represented here today by the Presidency but also by some distinguished colleagues, members of the Council on behalf of their countries, and this is in itself a very strong signal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to welcome the opportunity to hear the reactions from the different political groups within this House. It is a privilege for all of us to be able to debate these issues and discuss the challenges which we face in Europe today. I have heard a range of views from different speakers, but I sense that – whatever their different views – the vast majority in this House are committed to making sure that from the current crisis we build a better and more solid Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">From the outset the founders of the European Union aspired to create an ever closer Union, a Europe which is ‘solidly united and constructed around a strong framework’. Schuman’s words remain particularly relevant to us today.</p>
<p class="contents">More than ever Europe needs to be united. We need to safeguard the strong institutional framework within which we work. And we must continue to ensure smooth and efficient cooperation between us. The Cyprus Presidency is committed to ensuring this, and committed in particular to working constructively, both within the Council and in osmosis with the European Council and President Van Rompuy, but also – importantly – with both the Commission and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately all our decisions have to be about making Europe a better place for its citizens. That means defending values of equality, pluralism, freedom and justice which lie at the heart of our unique Union. That means social cohesion and solidarity. President Barroso mentioned also fairness and equity, indeed fundamental values that must be the basis for all our decisions in order to deliver a better future.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to use the opportunities presented by the current difficulties to realise the true potential of the EU. We must in particular seize the opportunity to take the steps which are essential if we are to build a better Europe. What does that mean in practice? I will mention just a few key examples.</p>
<p class="contents">We must firstly secure an agreement on the MFF, our main investment tool – not any agreement, but an agreement which shows that the Union’s resources are being invested for the benefit of its citizens and in particular for its younger generation. It must focus on innovation and competitiveness, so providing the momentum for increased growth and the creation of jobs. A prompt agreement will send a strong signal that the EU is serious about growth and that it is ready to take decisive steps to invest in its future.</p>
<p class="contents">President Barroso referred this morning to the report on the development of the EMU. This will be another vital step in strengthening the Union. We must seize the initiative presented by this report and take the opportunity to create a stronger and more mature economic and monetary union, making institutional changes if needed and at the appropriate moment, in order to be better able to withstand the challenges from both within and outside.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also establish the Common European Asylum System which will contribute to the building of a common area of protection, on the basis of solidarity and fair burden-sharing – a safe area for all citizens of the EU and fully in line with universal values.</p>
<p class="contents">Through warranted reforms and decisions as underlined by President Barroso, we should restore credibility and confidence. The wise words of John Kennedy more than fifty years ago are just as relevant to the EU today: ‘in a crisis, be aware of the danger – but recognise the opportunity’.</p>
<p class="contents">We owe it to our younger generations in particular to create a prosperous Europe, in which they can dream and aspire to fulfil those dreams. Europe has never simply been about economic growth and indicators. We must also create a place where everyone in society is included, where our environment is allowed to flourish without the threat of pollution and climate change, where agriculture is the friend of the land and where human activity, in all its expressions, is allowed to flourish. Our Union is above all a place of respect, dignity and tolerance, of values and ideals. That is something which we should be proud of and protect.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to close by thanking again President Barroso for his inspirational presentation of the State of the Union, and for his leadership and vision. He can count firmly on the support of the Council in this Herculean task lying ahead.</p>

<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, I would like to use this occasion to draw your attention to the proposal for a directive on improving gender balance in corporate boardrooms that has recently been presented by Vice-President Reding to the College. Its objective of increasing women’s representation in corporate governance to 40% by 2020 has been supported by Parliament through different resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I firmly believe that such a proposal would be a clear signal that the European Union still considers gender equality as a priority of its agenda. This would require binding legislation as well as additional supporting measures to accompany the quota system. However, in the past weeks we have heard reports of growing attempts to block such a proposal by some Member States and also the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Ensuring gender-balanced representation in the public as well as in the private sector is not only a matter of fairness and democracy but also of economic effectiveness. Therefore I would strongly encourage you to openly reaffirm your support and, through it, the support of the Commission as a whole for such a proposal. We are very eager to discuss it within the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">But we also need to take into account the long-term perspective on the banking union, and we must do it now. So yes, the banking union certainly must be designed in such a way that it works towards deepening the integration of the single market, because the euro area cannot be sustainable if the disintegration of the single market continues.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is a second long-term perspective here and an even more considerable risk for a sustainable euro area, and here I am thinking of the way the opt-in mechanism for non-euro Member States is designed.

So my question is, as this must not be allowed: how do you want to protect us from this risk of fragmentation? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, under the budgetary discipline now being imposed, GDP has fallen, we are becoming poorer and unemployment is rising, exacerbated by technological progress.

We should monitor the implementation of directives and ensure that structural reforms are put into effect in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Swoboda has just made some very negative remarks about Germany and expressed his criticism of structural reforms. I would like to give him a small hint. The most effective structural reform in Germany was definitely the one which took place under a Social Democratic government and which led to today’s economic growth. What can we do specifically to promote competitiveness? Some time ago, Mr Tajani made a clever proposal that we should consider all the legislation that we enact here in the light of its effect on competitiveness. We do not always need a constant stream of new ideas, we just need concrete action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We were told that it would be inflationary and that unemployment would rise. In fact, our recovery began the day we left and carried on for 15 years before Gordon Brown came along to mess it up, but that is another story.</p>
<p class="contents">We had the same thing in Denmark. We were told that if they voted not to join the euro, inflation would go up, interest rates would go up.

<p class="contents">I suspect that even you in your bones know that the best option now for the peripheral countries is to default, devalue, decouple. To price their way into the markets, to start exporting their way back to growth. It would not solve everything, but it would be an alternative to this downward spiral of deflation, poverty and emigration and that is really what you are afraid of.

But I must respond to Mr Farage’s rather patronising reference to little Ireland being bullied into voting twice on the Lisbon Treaty. We were not bullied. It was the decision of the Irish Parliament to hold a referendum and of the Irish people to accept it. Secondly, there was a fundamental difference between Lisbon I and Lisbon II.

Your message will not reach the European citizens, because as long as the Hungarian Prime Minister can declare before the Hungarian Parliament this week that the European Union is the problem rather than the solution, these profound speeches will not reach the European citizens.

I think we all agree on that, but I would like to add something else. Growth will not work without justice. As long as the large fortunes of wealthy people in the European Union continue getting bigger and bigger and as long as the people who have to do the hard work are paid less and less, there will be no justice and, of course, no growth, because there will be no mass purchasing power. Therefore, we need to make some changes to our systems. We need a fairer tax system, in which large companies start to pay tax again. We need fairer wages, which allow working people to benefit from the immense wealth that they create. Most importantly, we need a fair market economy, which does not involve the shareholders being paid and, at the same time, the workers being made redundant. If those changes are made, we will have a Europe for the people. Otherwise, nothing will happen.</p>

You are assuming that you have been managing the crisis correctly for three years. Unfortunately the situation is much, much more subtle than that. We are already far behind schedule.

In truth, this banking union excludes ten countries from any meaningful work from the outset. These countries may of course join, but joining will give them no benefit whatsoever. Whereas if they stay outside, they will of course enjoy all the disadvantages. In your speech you spoke of an interconnected world in which there should be no building of walls. I have to ask, President Barroso, what is this if not a wall? What is this if not a wall, if we are not talking about uniform rules, and the EU is not functioning according to uniform rules?

I was very surprised, because we have had to introduce a different structure. I propose to give you the floor now, so that you can respond both to the group chairs and to the catch-the-eye speakers. After that, the group chairs, as agreed, can take the floor again to make brief speeches. If you want to speak again after these brief speeches, I will definitely give you the floor again at the end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Manuel Barroso, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">− </span>Mr President, I wanted first of all to listen to all the Members of this Parliament before having the possibility to respond – and I will also be more than happy to hold more specific discussions afterwards with the Group leaders – but I think it was important to hear the contributions from all the Members of Parliament who wanted to take the floor at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me first underline that I saw, of course, different positions in this debate – some criticisms, some comments – but I think I can see, at least from the most relevant pro-European forces, strong support for the agenda I have put forward: an agenda which combines ambition with realism.</p>
<p class="contents">Ambition is very important but so is the way we deliver on that ambition. Ambitions without results are simply good intentions, and sometimes I have the impression that in Europe we are full of good intentions but with not enough results. This is why we need to have this vision, the vision of a medium-term, longer-term, European Union that is a federal path – and I hope that we will not engage now in semantic discussions about how exactly to qualify it. It is a federal path and it is ambitious, but at the same time we need to respond to issues which are extremely serious and urgent now, even before we get the – in some cases necessary – revision of the current treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">So this is our way and this is the way the Commission will pursue with determination. This is the only realistic way to achieve progress in Europe, and those people who pretend that the status quo is enough or those people who pretend that everything will change tomorrow are not in fact serious about what has to be done for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot resist recalling something that a predecessor of mine, Jacques Delors, once said in French – it was good advice : </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> ‘Beware of the over-excited!’ </p>
<p class="contents">‘Beware of the over-excited’. We need to have ambition but at the same time every step must be taken with our feet firmly on the ground – and not forgetting one thing: that we are accountable to the European citizens of Europe and we have to have them with us.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why one of the most important messages that I believe I brought you today was: How can we complete European democracy? What can we do? Not against our countries, because our countries are still the most important political reference for most of our citizens, but what can we do with our countries to show that they will only count in the world if they accept a much stronger Union; that on their own they will not have the leverage or the capacity to talk on an equal footing with the Americans or the Chinese or other powers; but that yes, together in Europe, we can do this and we can make a difference. That, precisely, is the message I brought you today.</p>
<p class="contents">A message where we work with our countries, not for the sake of nationalism, but in fact to win the battle against the nationalists or the extreme populists, to have a democratic federation of countries, a federation of citizens naturally, a union for the citizens of Europe. This is the message I brought you today and this is the only way to go forward if we want to achieve results.</p>
<p class="contents">If you read my speech last year, at that time some of the ideas were not given much consideration, but one year later we have seen that the governments – and I believe most political forces – have finally agreed. I proposed the redirection of central funds. I proposed the refinancing of the EIB, I proposed the creation of project funds – there was no consensus for all these ideas at that time, now they are agreed on.</p>
<p class="contents">It was also the Commission that proposed some time ago the creation of a strong backstop. At that time we proposed EUR 440 billion. It was rejected by some. It was not considered realistic; now we have it and today – it was about time – we have had the decision of the Constitutional Court of Germany. This shows that what is not agreed to today will become a consensus tomorrow, and our duty here as European institutions is precisely to build on this consensus, to show ambition but at the same time to do so with realism. This is the way to achieve those steps.</p>
<p class="contents">I was asked some specific questions, particularly on the banking union, which I think are very important. One was about doing this or not with the Central Bank. Fourteen out of the 17 national supervisors in the euro area today are already the central banks, and the UK is now in fact moving to place these tasks with the Bank of England, so there is not one single model in the European Union and the euro area. What matters is the quality and credibility of the supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">But let us be frank. Do we want to delay or do we want a solution? We have agreed, and it was a Commission proposal, to do this around the European Central Bank because this is a well-established European institution, a federal institution in the euro area. Of course we will do this ensuring a separation between the monetary functions and the future supervisory function. Our model offers all the guarantees that one could ask for – the independence of monetary policy – but what we need is a credible supervisor that can break free from the national capture of national supervisors and do so quickly. That is why the ECB is by far the best placed for this. Once again, if we now start to change this, there will be delay. Delaying the solutions is probably in the interests of some people, but it is certainly not in the interest of the European Commission. We want to have a single supervisor for the euro area as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we have put forward a proposal that, in fact, also addresses other matters like the relationship between euro and non-euro area members. The single supervisory mechanism will strengthen the single market. The proposal is designed so as not to create any walls in the single market. The ECB will apply the single rule book, the substantive rules on bank capital requirements and so on which are agreed by all 27 Member States. More effective and consistent application is good for the stability and safety of all.</p>
<p class="contents">The non-euro area Member States should be able to take part. The proposal is as open as possible. Those outside the euro area can take part through a close cooperation arrangement. We have gone as far as possible within, of course, the current Treaty legal limits and there are lots of other safeguards. The decisions on supervision of cross-border banks will continue to be made in colleges of supervisors in which host Member States will still have their full say even where the ECB is the home supervisor, and the European Banking Authority will keep all its powers to solve disputes and uphold single market rules including vis-à-vis the ECB.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all to show you that no-one is more committed than the Commission to the idea of a Union, to the integrity of the European Union, and yes, to the principle of non-discrimination between Member States, Article 4. When Prime Minister I was one of those fighting for the principle of equality between all our Member States to be recognised. Of course there are different economic dimensions, different demographic dimensions, but as regards the law all the Member States have exactly the same dignity and we should strive for a unity based on these principles.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the points made concerned growth and social matters. First of all, growth. We have to be very honest about this. The biggest problem we have with growth in Europe is the lack of competitiveness that has been accumulated in some of our Member States and we need to bring in reforms for that competitiveness. There are difficult, more urgent, problems, such as the lack of financing for the economy. Some of our countries in fact are making impressive – impressive – efforts of adjustment.</p>
<p class="contents">What Greece has achieved is sometimes not sufficiently recognised – or Ireland or Portugal. An impressive adjustment, but what is their problem? They also have a problem in financing the economy precisely because the sovereign debt problems contaminated the banks’ problems. So we should not forget what lay at the origin of this crisis and the origin of this crisis, I have to say to the Eurosceptics: No, it was not the euro. Britain has put in more taxpayers’ money to save the banks than any country in Europe. Iceland is not a member of the euro or the European Union, so it was not the euro which created the problem; it was the irresponsible behaviour of the financial sectors in many areas of the world, including the United States.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This was the crux of the problem, and let me tell you that sadly we can see that some people in the financial sector have learnt nothing. After what happened we continued to receive reports of rigging with Libor, manipulating the interest rates. We have seen banks in the United States that are financing Iran contrary to all the legislation of the United States. We have seen banks from Britain financing drug smuggling in Mexico. We continue to see some intolerable practices in the financial sector. This was part of the problem and that is why we need to regulate and to have credible supervision in the financial sector as well.</p>
<p class="contents">But this was not the whole cause of the problem. There was also unsustainable debt created by our governments; this is the reality. I am sorry, some people prefer to hear just some part of the reality, but we have to look at the reality in full. That is why we need to see how we came here. We came to this situation because the financial markets did not behave properly and that was the responsibility not of the European Union but of the national supervisors. The European Union at that time had no responsibility at all in terms of national supervision. We are now creating, we are now establishing, the first elements of this European supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems of the debt were also created because some Member States did not respect the Stability and Growth Pact which they themselves had signed. When there is no respect for the rules, naturally there are problems of credibility. So I think it is fair to say that Europe’s current problems were not created by the European Union for the Member States, they were much more created by the Member States for the European Union and this is the reality of what we have today.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">But now of course we have to see how to get out of this situation, and to get out of this situation requires proper financial supervision and regulation. Addressing the problems of deficit is also required, and so Member States which are under this pressure should continue with consultation measures and also with stricter reforms because there is an underlying problem of lack of comparison in some of our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not easy; there will not be a magic solution; it will require time, determination, persistence, coherence. I know that populists manipulate feelings and anger; they can offer a very simple solution. The solution is ‘No’. Saying ‘No’ is easy; saying ‘No’ to Europe is easy. What is difficult, and that requires leadership, is to say ‘Yes’ but while saying ‘How can we move forward?’ And that is why I am asking you to bring about the conditions for a true European debate with a true European democracy. And I am giving the signal for the next European elections because I believe in democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I was elected to my Parliament in Portugal when I was just twenty-nine years old. Mr Farage, do not look at me like that because in fact I really have a great admiration for the wisdom of the British people. Every time you have tried to be elected in Britain you were rejected; that is why you came here. It shows that the British people know that it is much better to keep you away from your own system.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Every time I ran for election in my country I was elected. I was leader of the opposition, I was Prime Minister and to be President of the Commission I received the support of this European Parliament. But I think we have to go forward. I think we need to go for the next elections with all the relevant political parties – not you, frankly – but with all the relevant political parties to present a candidate for the Commission President and to have a truly political debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we adopted formally a new regulation for European political parties and I am calling not only on citizens, not only on you, but also on the best forces in Europe to engage in this debate on what we can do. Then I want to appeal to my pro-European, including federalist, friends. Frankly, sometimes I believe we waste too much time and energy criticising secondary issues. I think we have to unite the pro-European forces with regard to the future of Europe. A future that, yes, is to keep the social market economy. The social market economy is in the Treaty of Lisbon, it is not an invention. But at the same time to prepare the European consensus to reform those economies that will become more competitive. That is why European democracy is important.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some people who say democracy cannot be transnational and can only be national because it is based on national parliaments. I am sorry, but those who say that have not understood that we are already in the 21<span class="sup">st</span> century. In the 21<span class="sup">st</span> century we have transnational phenomena like the financial markets, and if we do not have transnational mechanisms to deal with them, the peoples, the citizens, will not have the leverage to regulate them and to have their say. That is why we also need at European level a European democracy, and a European democracy that is not built against our national democracies but to complement them, to coordinate, and that basis for European democracy is precisely this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what I am telling you. I am telling you that the Commission is ready to engage in this Parliament and that we are going to put proposals forward before the next European elections so that we can have a real European debate, one where the political forces that are for Europe can say why they are for Europe and those who are against should also say why they are against Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">What annoys me today, to be very honest with you, and which we have to recognise, is that in many of our countries those who are taking the lead in the European debate are the anti-Europeans, the Eurosceptics, the populists, the extreme nationalists. That is why we have to provoke the pro-European forces, if necessary by making a positive, constructive clean break with them, to ask them to come and say what the consequences of not having this Europe will be. Because many of the young people around Europe do not remember when a great part of Europe was under totalitarian Communism or when there was no democracy in the south of Europe. They do not remember the times of non-freedom of movement – so we need to make the case for Europe, and to do that we need the pro-European forces from the Left, the Right and the Centre to come and fight for that ideal: to explain it, to take the initiative and not be always on the defensive.</p>
<p class="contents">I think this is what we can do for the next European elections and that is why the European Commission will come with proposals which will enable us to leave our comfort zone and sometimes see some of the governments of Europe giving up to those extremist forces because they believe that in that way they will keep some of the votes.</p>
<p class="contents">That is a very important point I want to make to you because some of us, instead of trying to attack each other, would be making a much better use of our time if we could try to convince not only the parties here in Strasbourg, but also the parties back home in the capitals, to say the same thing they say here in Strasbourg. The reality is that very often we hear the parties saying one thing here and we know very well that when the same parties are in the governments back home, they say a very different, if not a completely contradictory, thing. This is why we need to build a true public space in Europe with a true European democracy, with true European parties and true European institutions, not working against our Member States but working for a Union that goes beyond the Member States and that gives each Member State and our citizens the capacity to defend our interests and our values in the global world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, I would like to make it very clear that I believe that the judgment of the German Federal Constitutional Court is a good one. For the second time in just a few days, the almost hysterical opponents of Europe have been defeated, firstly by the decision of the European Central Bank and now by the decision of the German Federal Constitutional Court. This shows that given courage and clear decision-making, it is possible to strengthen Europe, even though certain limits have been set.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to strongly support what was said by Ms Gurmai and other speakers on the question of women. I spoke yesterday with Ms Reding. It is important, particularly in the world of business and also with regard to appointments made by European institutions, that the many excellent women candidates receive support. Just like the men, they must have the opportunity to take up certain positions.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I would like to thank the Commission for its draft document on political parties. It is very good that we now have a new draft which will allow us to move forwards. I support the principles relating to the political parties. I visit all the Member States and I have said there exactly what you, Mr Barroso, have said here.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, just so that everything is not quite so harmonious, Mr Barroso, you have declared your support for the European social model. This is a good thing and I am in favour of it. However, given the situation in Greece, I have made it quite clear, including when I visited Greece, that stringent and often painful structural forms are needed. Not everyone in Greece wanted to hear that, even my friends there, but that is what is needed. If the troika, including the Commission, now calls for the reintroduction of the six-day week and the 13-hour day and removes other social rights, we will be seeing the destruction of the social state. Mr Barroso, we cannot support the social state and the social model in Parliament while at the same time allowing the Commission officials in the troikas to dismantle and destroy the social state. We in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament cannot accept that. It is not a basis for consensus. I would very much like to come to a consensus with you and the Commission about the social model and the social state, but then the Commission officials in the troikas must ensure that the social state is not dismantled and that at least its core structures remain in place. That is the principle that we in the S&amp;D Group stand for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would see that as a positive development in this Plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now come back to the main discussion we had an hour ago. I think – and my group thinks – that the Commission should make more use of its right of initiative on a number of topics and on a number of issues. I would advise the Commission not to wait for the green light – or red light – from Paris, Berlin or other capitals. The red light is always there but not the green light. It needs to do what is necessary and put its legislative proposals on the table. The effect on the market would be so positive that it would be far more difficult for these countries to react negatively.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point concerns banking union. Mr Barroso has said that he does not want a delay. I do not want a delay either. But that does not mean that, if he does not agree with a proposal that has the support of the Council – and mainly of Germany in this instance – that we cannot discuss it. Just because Germany considers that the ECB should do a given job we do not have to agree with it. I am sorry, but that is not codecision, is it? Codecision means that for a short period – and you can be sure that our coordinators will respect that and will examine the proposal – you can suggest other, better possibilities, rather than creating double standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in Germany they need to be serious. They cannot at the same time give tasks other than monetary functions to the ECB and criticise Mr Draghi for the interventions he is currently making in the markets. It is one or the other: either it is independent – in which case we have no financial supervision – or it is not, in which case they can continue to criticise Mr Draghi, as they have been doing in recent weeks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the subject of the model of the European social state, I would like to make it clear that there is no social state in Greece. It does not currently exist. If we want to have a model of a social state, then the European Union must set up a social fund to relaunch the social state in Greece. That is simply how it is. We cannot always continue making progress. If someone living in Greece today does not have a job, then he has absolutely no means of support. Does that make sense? The model of the European social state can only be developed further if we help it to be reborn in the countries where it no longer exists. People must finally understand that.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Ms Reding, we support your initiative, as I hope the Commission and all the men there do, to bring about a gender balance in companies. If you would write a letter to Mr Juncker and to the board of the European Central Bank explaining the initiative, that would be a really good message to send out.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that this is not a dispute about the future prospects for Europe. In the case of decisions on the European Stability Mechanism and the problems that it would bring, I sometimes hope that Europe will not look to Karlsruhe but to the Court of Justice of the European Union, which is where the decision should be made. Also, someone has said, Mr Daul I think, that we should have more courage in appealing to the court. I strongly disagree. Politics is a matter for parliaments. If we take cases before the court more often, it will become a matter for technocrats. That, of course, is not a good thing. The judicialisation of politics will also be the swan song of politics. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, many of them were playing Barroso buzzword bingo during its delivery. I wonder if anybody can guess what the winning line was. What did he say the most? You said ‘let us be frank’ five or six times during your speech. That was the winning line.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, let us be frank with you. You really offered us nothing new today, did you? You offered us the same old tired solutions, that the answer to all of our problems is more Europe. Not better Europe, not more efficient Europe, just more Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">And I say that I welcome the debate. Table your proposals. Let us have the debate about whether we want more Europe or whether we want less Europe, whether we want more power to the centre or more back to Member States. And I will tell you something even more radical. Let us have that debate, let us reach the conclusions and then let us ask the people in our Member States, in referenda, what they think of the solutions offered.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">And then let us do something even more radical and let us take notice this time of what they say if, in fact, they reject your solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you another quote from a dear Member of the EPP Group, from Mr Daul’s party, from José María Aznar, who said over the weekend that the drive for full fiscal and political union is ‘deeply misguided’. He said that ‘a United States of Europe is an impossible idea. It is a very serious mistake to try to destroy nation states. You cannot go against the cultural beliefs of the people and the forces of history’, and I think he was right in what he said there.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people in this Chamber, many of the leaders that have spoken, are stuck in the 1950s, in the old mantra of what should be done – all except Mr Cohn-Bendit, of course. He is still stuck on the barricades in 1968. But they offer the tired solutions of the past. We need to reform the EU, we need to look forward to what the EU should offer us in the 21<span class="sup">st</span> century, and that should be less Europe and more competitive Europe and more competitive economies.</p>

My group expects the Commission to fulfil its responsibilities in the relevant bodies such as the troika, in order to make it entirely clear that the Commission as a European institution wants to ensure that people are no longer pushed into poverty, that working hours are not increased and that environmental and social standards are not ignored. That is your job. If we succeed in making that clear, then we will be sending out a signal to the people who in recent days have gone out onto the streets in their thousands and hundreds of thousands to protest. Our group is in solidarity with these people, whether they are in Thessaloniki or Barcelona.</p>

How bad has the situation become when people who are in the midst of a serious social and personal crisis are not receiving any more help and support, because the health system has collapsed?

<p class="contents">Many people in positions of responsibility believe that people in Greece and in other states have been living beyond their means. They must now be punished for this and have sanctions imposed on them. This is not an appropriate way of strengthening the European community, which is based on solidarity. I am not implying that you are one of these people, Mr Barroso, but this is a theme which is being constantly repeated in the media in many countries and, unfortunately, also in mine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, once again you failed to mention the very serious problem of the banks that are too big to fail. Many citizens in Europe are firmly convinced, and I include myself among them, that if this problem is not resolved, if we do not bring the banks back down to a reasonable size and separate the investment banks from the commercial banks along the lines of the US model, then we will find that the European Union is by no means too big to fail. I am calling on you once again to deal with the problem of the banks that are too big to fail. By downsizing the banks, you can upgrade Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Manuel Barroso, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">− </span>Mr President, I will give very concrete answers to very concrete questions.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, to Mr Martin – because he was accusing me of giving too much attention to other Members of the Parliament – we are currently discussing in the Commission what we can do in terms of this issue of the risks inherent in different kinds of activities between banks.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, Commissioner Barnier has asked Mr Liikanen to put forward a report. Based on that report we will take decisions about what we can do to prevent risks associated with big banks, namely the possibility of addressing the issue of different activities they may pursue.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding other concrete issues, such as Romania and Bulgaria, we have already said that we believe that Romania and Bulgaria meet the necessary conditions to become members of the Schengen area. I want to reiterate that here today. That, of course, does not mean that we do not have the right to act when we believe decisions taken by any of our Member States may call into question some of the principles of the rule of law that all Member States accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you insisted on the issue of social cohesion. Indeed it is a very important matter. The reality is that we are doing what we can at European level, but there are differences here between the instruments available at national and European level. As you may be aware, one of the concerns we now have in terms of the discussion for the next MFF is the opposition that some of our governments are signalling, not only about the reinforcement of the Social Fund, but also the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which is so important for workers who may feel the impact and be considered redundant because of some structural transformations in Europe, and even the Solidarity Fund, because there are some governments that are simply proposing the elimination of this fund.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank those of you who have referred to the European programme of aid for deprived persons. I would like to confirm that the Commission will put forward a proposal for a new programme to help poor people in Europe because there is now rising poverty in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">So that is why we have to be absolutely sincere and frank. Yes, I say those words once again. You cannot withdraw from the European institutions the instruments for showing solidarity and afterwards criticise Europe because Europe does not have enough solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to act at European level in the social area. This is critically important, not only because it is just, but because we need a social dimension at European level so that we can keep support for our social market economy and for our European project. When we speak about more Europe, it is not just more Europe for the sake of Europe or for the European institutions. The crisis in the euro area has shown that the credibility of the euro as a single currency is also dependent on the coherence and integration of the decisions taken for the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">When people ask me why we need more Europe, we need more Europe if we want to keep and sustain a common currency. We need more integration of the institutions, but also more harmonisation of norms to avoid behaviours that are against the common norms and also we need more coherence of policies. This is indispensable for a common currency. Of course, we want to make those proposals not just for the euro area but for the European Union because we want this to be united and open for all. If some Members do not want to join us, of course they have that right, but they should not have the right to prevent those who want to have a stronger Union from building that stronger Union, not only for the currency but also for our common goals of a united Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me thank you for this debate. I believe in democracy. I believe in national democracy, but also in European democracy. I want to reiterate that today, in the 21<span class="sup">st</span> century, with national democracy alone our citizens will not be able to control their future and their countries will become irrelevant. We are living in fundamentally new times. That is why we need to complete our national democracies with a strong European democracy. This Parliament is the basis for that future stronger European democracy.</p>

The establishment of a European banking union was mentioned today, which in future will allow this sector to be monitored more effectively. I welcome this decision but it is regrettable that there has hitherto been a lack of resolve to take action, which, if it had been taken in time, would have enabled the Union and its Member states to combat the crisis more successfully. I am talking about the establishment of a European credit rating agency, which would have enabled us to evaluate the Member States’ economies more fairly and objectively. I would also like to remind you about the call for a gas purchasing group to be established at EU level which would ensure fair and competitive gas prices for all Member States which in turn would increase the competitiveness of our industry and reduce consumers’ bills. For a long time we have been convinced that the crisis is coming to an end and that in order to exit it as soon as possible we need to take the toughest austerity measures. Now we can see that such austerity measures have reduced consumption and budget revenue collection, have significantly increased unemployment and have halted economic growth in the Member States in the long term. The majority of economists recognise that tough austerity measures have not provided the anticipated benefits but simply further hampered the EU’s economic and social recovery. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The agreed measures for boosting the economy and reducing unemployment must be implemented as soon and as efficiently as possible. In this regard, I think we must continue to focus on encouraging entrepreneurs and creating jobs in the EU. Topics such as fiscal and budgetary discipline and economic growth should continue to be on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the view that the EU must be strengthened; however, the decisions adopted so far require time in order for them to have visible effects. At the same time, reforms should be based on the principle of equality and on a better coordination. We have been witnessing lately an ever-growing need to deepen integration. President Barroso reiterated a very important topic, that of the federalisation of the European Union. Romania has been a constant supporter of this idea, including the importance of progressing towards a political union. The specific needs of each Member State must be taken into account in order to narrow the gaps in competitiveness and productivity. Only this way will we be able to achieve a coherent economic policy and an internationally relevant external policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its existence should restore confidence in banks and in the single currency of the euro. It would also be part of the long-term plan for the economic and fiscal integration of the EU. The main elements of banking union include banking rules that are applicable throughout the EU – including the common but flexible requirements for the level of capital that banks must maintain, and unified EU banking supervision with direct monitoring of banks operating in many countries and of large banking houses, which would allow enforcement of the rules and greater oversight concerning the control of risks. It also includes common rules to prevent bank failures and allow greater intervention when a bank gets into difficulties – so that it will not be necessary to rescue the bank with taxpayers' money - and a unified system of deposit insurance providing protection to savers, regardless of which EU state they put their money in or invest in. The aim is to strengthen confidence in the banking system as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this way, by forcing savings, although we can of course improve the general state of public finances temporarily, we are also restricting opportunities for growth, thus threatening the continent with a deepening crisis and large-scale recession.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Member States are also pushing for an ideology of reduced public spending at the level of the EU budget in the period up to 2020. It is difficult to understand such a policy in the current economic situation since we know that EU funds play a major part in stimulating the economy, and not only on the demand side, but also through the mechanisms for their acquisition, such as co-financing and the need for job creation, that is to say by an emphasis on new ventures.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, instead of a genuine strategy for growth and jobs, we still only have proposals for deepening integration and depriving Member States of further areas of sovereignty. I therefore look unfavourably upon the idea of creating a single supervisory mechanism over banks or a banking union. In this context, the idea of a new European treaty, under which the EU institutions would take full control of national budgets, finally depriving Member States of the tools to manage their own economies, is annoying and quite unrealistic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the face of the deepening of the crisis within the EU and the euro area, and the widespread discrediting of the EU and its institutions, Mr Barroso has proposed a new federalist, neoliberal and militarist plunge into the process of economic and political integration. The announced measures do not solve any of the problems that the workers and people of Europe are facing. The deep crisis in which the EU is mired is the result of the policies and directions that have been pursued for years. These policies have promoted divergence and growing inequality among Member States, as well as the transfer of wealth from the workers to big economic and financial business. There will be no end to the crisis as long as these policies continue. Instead of thinking again and opting for a change in direction and policies, Mr Barroso is now proposing amendments to the institutional architecture of the EU. These amendments are aimed primarily at creating new and more favourable conditions for pursuing those same policies that have brought about disaster and social regression, and which have been brutally imposed on workers and people, with well-known consequences. New institutional shifts are being announced, giving new and greater expression to the growing confrontation between the EU and democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to take concrete steps to boost growth and employment. We should adopt the measures needed to reverse the impending collapse of the EU’s global competitiveness. We should take action to revive our single market. We must strengthen fiscal, economic and political integration. We need a specific plan for creating a banking union.

<p class="contents">We are now seeing that it is not enough for the ECB to monitor only the systematically important banks in order to ensure the system’s stability. Many financial institutions operate across borders within the Union, which is why measures at European level are needed to effectively and efficiently monitor and control this sector. The European Commission’s legislative proposals on a European supervision mechanism aiming to create a banking union within the EU will further strengthen the European Central Bank’s role.</p>

However, the possibilities afforded by the current treaties should be used before starting to draft new ones. The second wave of crisis stems from a lack of credibility on the part of the Union and its Member States, and a few months of disputes over institutional solutions will not help to restore that credibility. We need to act now, and make decisions now.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now in the fifth year of the crisis, and we can safely say that the remedial action taken in Europe has not worked. The measures taken by Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy are not working, and in addition the associated social costs are enormous. The announcement made last week by the President of the ECB regarding indirect support of these countries might have been reason for optimism. However, unless the credibility of the Union and its Member States is recovered, the crisis will not be overcome. I would like to ask President Barroso two questions. Firstly, what measures is the Commission planning in support of the European Central Bank’s actions? Secondly, how does he view Berlin’s proposals, in particular the proposal regarding a departure from the increased 95% share of EU funds in realised projects? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Further EU integration is possible and desirable, provided, however, that we are able to assure citizens that the foundations underpinning the integration process will be protected. I refer to peace and security, the protection of important values and increased prosperity. It is worth remembering that the most important and inalienable EU values stem from Christianity. The EU stands for dignity, freedom and solidarity. The proposal to develop the EU as a federation of nation states has been criticised amongst others by radical federalists. ‘Real’ federalists do not want a federation of nation states. What they want, as they have indeed explicitly stated, a post-national EU. In this context, President Barroso’s proposal is moderate, and, for many MEPs, even conservative.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, there are a number of reasons why a post-national federation is impossible at present. Many European nations simply do not want and cannot imagine a post-national Europe. Additionally, the economic situation of the EU Member States means it is impossible to introduce the harmonisation that would be required in many areas across the federation, such as the minimum wage, minimum pension, minimum income entitlement to social support, the retirement age or the medical services basket. Regardless of the ideology preferred, the harmonisation of standards required to form a federation seems unachievable in the foreseeable future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is particularly important to carry out the plan of establishing a European banking union and the single supervisory mechanism. The fact that banks operate transnationally but are guided by national laws has caused serious economic difficulties for us. I hope the implementation of this plan will not get stuck in the Council once again in verbose Member State discussions, and that the necessary decisions will be taken in the nearest future, allowing for swift establishment of an efficient banking supervisory mechanism. The activity in the financial markets over the past 24 hours shows that the euro has regained trust, and that gives us the time necessary to restore economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the European Union institutions and the governments of the Member States must understand that decisive action is required. At the same time, I am doubtful whether all of the political forces elected into this august house understand the seriousness of the situation. Member States must take difficult and unpopular decisions that will lead to economic growth in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">Sustainable growth cannot be achieved without reforming the labour market and improving productivity in the Member States. These issues must be discussed and resolutely addressed; ignoring the problems only makes the situation worse. The reforms implemented by the Latvian government under the leadership of Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis set a great example for the other European countries. Mr Dombrovskis took the helm of the government at the deepest point of the crisis, implemented reforms, and today Latvia is experiencing the fastest economic growth in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In view of the results, you will need to come up with much more convincing arguments and projects to try and establish any democratic legitimacy. Your only message, despite being put to the test, boils down to the ultra-liberal and globalist approach of ‘still more Europe', while continuing to subject us to an increasingly speculative and reckless international financial caste. Furthermore we have destroyed the social progress that our people fought so hard for over the centuries, the euro and federalism form a sacrificial religion that stifles farmers, artisans, small and medium-sized enterprises and industries, who are the movers and shakers in our society, in other words, the real and living economic force. Instead, together we should be introducing a mechanism, as soon as possible, enabling an effective exit from the euro rather than suffering the catastrophic consequences of its impending collapse. For this reason, I call for the introduction of referenda in France and in Europe on these crucial issues. Lastly, I call for early European elections to be held given the rapid decline of our respective countries, which are being dragged down precisely because of the ‘state of the European Union’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More than one third of persons aged between 15 and 24 are not in education or employment. One quarter of the population under 25 are unemployed, and in Greece and Spain almost half of this age group are unemployed. Over 25% of unemployed young persons have been unable to find a job for a year or more. National labour markets mainly offer them poorly paid temporary work which does not match their education or skills. They could look for work abroad, but are often afraid to take advantage of this opportunity. Their fear could be alleviated if they travelled abroad during their studies, but for most of them this means using their own financial resources. It is mainly only the residents of large urban centres who are in a position to do so. How, then, can all young people believe in our common European project?

Taking into account the fact that the Latvian Parliament and ruling coalition contain the pro-Nazi political forces of Latvia, there is nothing new in the statement of Parliament’s Speaker. But for the first time in the history of modern Latvia it is precisely the Speaker of the Saeima who so cynically neglects the opinion of European Union. Last year already, when Knut Vollebæk, the OSCE High Commissioner, mistakenly praised the Latvian Government for ‘successes’ in the integration, the Speaker of the Parliament, Mrs Aboltina, and the Prime Minister of Latvia, Mr Dombrovskis, admired him. Today, when Vollebæk ‘has had his eyes opened’ on the situation in Latvia, his recommendations are not needed. All that gives the right to assert that the Latvian Republic lives by double standards, supporting legislation where features of nationalism and racism are openly displayed! It is necessary to evaluate the statements and actions of members of the ruling coalitions and the Prime Minister of the Latvian Republic, which are leading to national conflict.

Countries which for years have lived above their means are to be rewarded and those which have applied budgetary discipline are to be punished. Furthermore, Slovenia is a demonstration of what happens after the praise for an alleged star pupil has died down. A few years ago, Ljubljana was a model candidate and the threat of insolvency was ignored. However, instead of facing up to reality, they are obviously cheating and making the situation seem better than it is. The question also arises as to who should pay for the whole euro disaster. We cannot continue asking the economically successful euro countries, such as Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, to come up with the cash. This simply will not work. They have already reached the limits of their ability to pay and if Spain requires more money than is currently expected and if Italy also turns out to need the euro rescue package, they will be the last dominos to fall.

We are now at a point where we can no longer blunder around in the fog. Our actions to date have not led to the desired results. Economists are sounding the alarm as the risk that the crisis will expand and intensify is increasing. Fortunately, Europeans have not lost faith in the EU project. The Eurobarometer results of last week show that 40% of respondents have a positive opinion of the EU. Most respondents thought the European Parliament was a recognisable and trustworthy institution of the EU. As in previous polls, citizens expect the European Parliament to fight poverty, social exclusion and unemployment effectively. This is why Parliament must be fully involved in the implementation and monitoring of the Compact for Growth and Jobs. In particular, we must deal with the issue of increasing employment as soon as possible. I therefore urge the Council to carry out an efficient analysis of the Commission’s employment package, so that new jobs can be created. I welcome the adoption at the last Council meeting of the EU Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy. This should provide guidance to the Special Representative for Human Rights, and will allow the EU to speak with one voice in the field of human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some countries are spending considerable amounts of resources on reaching goals that are long obsolete. There are, for example, Member States that do not view the national minorities living in their territories as an asset, but instead impede their legitimate efforts and continue to seek their assimilation. They spend more on their outdated centralised administration, secret service and armed forces than on education, infrastructure or social affairs.

I also believe that it is vital that the austerity measures adopted by the Member States be reconciled with new measures to promote growth and employment. Concrete actions aimed at stimulating economic recovery and job creation should be set out, along with a new industrial policy, the strengthening of research and innovation, and incentives for entrepreneurship. At a time of great economic and social difficulty, I believe that the EU should take particular care of the most vulnerable, strengthening the prevailing sense of solidarity among its peoples. Finally, I would draw the attention of the Commission and the respective Member States to the fact that it is crucial to strengthen the EU budget for 2014-2020, adapting it to the development needs of the various economies and regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although he used the term ̔̔federation of nation states’, what he has in mind is to further strengthen the EU institutions and deprive nation states of their powers. The theory of optimum currency areas explains very well when a single currency creates economic benefit. However, the introduction of the euro was not based on rational assumptions, but rather on political hopes – the hope that a single currency would pave the way for a single European state. We can see now that the euro project does not work and – like a condemned man – it is waiting for the execution of its sentence. As long as there are distinctive nations, cultures, languages and societies in Europe, it cannot succeed. The euro crisis is therefore not only an economic crisis. It symbolises the crisis of the entire concept of a federal Europe. So, is further integration the right way forward? No. We should take a step back. If we are already thinking about a new treaty, then we should go back to the Treaty of Nice. We should restrict the powers of the EU and delegate responsibility to national governments. We need cooperation between states in Europe, and not one state managed from Brussels. Further federalisation of Europe will strengthen the strong centres and marginalise the weak, creating a two-speed Europe, a continent of losers and winners. If we consider the shape of the crisis, we can easily identify the losers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
