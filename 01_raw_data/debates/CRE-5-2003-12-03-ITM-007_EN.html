<p class="contents">Allow me to begin by going over the events which led up to the Eurogroup and Ecofin meeting of 24 and 25 November.</p>
<p class="contents">During the first half of 2003, at the Commission’s proposal, the Council sent two recommendations in respect of excessive deficits to Germany and France on 21 January and 3 June respectively, calling for the deficits to be reduced below the reference threshold of 3% by the end of 2004. It should be noted that the recommendations were adopted on the basis of assumed progressive economic growth during the year brought about by the elimination of negative factors due to the end of the war in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">In subsequent months, however, it became clear that the actual progress of the European economy was different, being more negative than expected. Economic growth, lower than that forecast by approximately one percentage point, led to a greater increase in public deficits than expected. The upshot of this was that it was impossible for Germany and France to reduce their deficits below 3% in 2004, as initially requested.</p>
<p class="contents">In the second half of 2003, between October and November, the Commission fully and formally acknowledged this new situation and accordingly proposed two new recommendations seeking to defer the deficit reduction to below 3% until 2005. Essentially, it is reasonable to assume that, had it been known at the start of 2003 that the progress of the Euro area economy would not be positive, the recommendations would have stipulated 2005 at the outset as the year during which the deficits had to be brought back into line.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis, both Germany and France took measures to incorporate the substance of the recommendations. As regards Germany, the recommendations have been directly incorporated into the budgetary legislation: for 2004 provision has been made for a structural adjustment of 0.6% of GDP and for 2005 an adjustment of 0.5%, that is to say 1.1% of GDP in total, which is close to that initially requested by the Commission, without prejudice to the reduction below 3% in 2005. As regards France, the recommendations were incorporated first into the budgetary legislation and subsequently by means of other measures: for 2004 provision has been made for an adjustment of 0.8% of GDP and for 2005 an adjustment of 0.6%, that is to say 1.4% of GDP in total, which is close to that requested by the Commission, without prejudice to the reduction below 3% in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, France and Germany have given undertakings to channel any effects of greater growth into deficit reduction, as requested by the Commission. In addition to this, it should be borne in mind that, in 2003, France and Germany set in motion an intense programme of welfare state reforms, which had a decisive, positive impact on the sustainability of public finances. Within the context of the political economy, this is an issue of more than minor importance surrounding the discussion of the Pact which has taken place over the course of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">In essence, first in the work carried out during October and November, subsequently within the Eurogroup and, lastly, within Ecofin, a broad consensus has been achieved on the substance of the recommendations formulated by the Commission and on the substance of the adjustments introduced by France and Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us move on to procedural matters. The Commission proposed the two recommendations pursuant to Article 104(9) on the basis that Germany and France had persistently failed to put into practice the Council’s recommendations. Germany and France, whilst accepting the substance of the recommendations, for political reasons requested a different format, that is to say that a second series of recommendations be reformulated pursuant to Article 104(7). The Council’s Legal Service, when consulted on the matter, said that the Commission could also have taken – and I emphasise the word ‘also’ – this second route. The Commission excluded it. At this point a deadlock developed: there was a risk that the most important thing, namely the substance, would be lost for reasons of form. In order to overcome the deadlock without exacerbating matters, the Eurogroup, on the basis of a broad consensus, incorporated the substance of the recommendations into draft conclusions. The validity of this procedure was again confirmed by the Council’s Legal Service. Subsequently, when Ecofin started its work, the Commission explicitly registered its disagreement, calling for an express vote on the second series of recommendations for Germany and France. The necessary majority was not obtained. It should be noted that the vote of the Ecofin Council on the Commission’s recommendations is explicitly provided for by the rules currently in force and is therefore perfectly compatible with such rules. After the failure to approve the Commission’s recommendations, the Council voted on the conclusions drawn up earlier in the Eurogroup. The conclusions were approved and the discussion resulted in the unanimous adoption of the Council statement.</p>
<p class="contents">The contents of the statement may be summarised as follows: stability and growth are the fundamental objectives of European economic policy. The Pact constitutes an essential means of implementing that policy. The Pact has been called ‘stupid’. We have shown the opposite, we have shown that the Pact can be interpreted in a flexible, discerning manner. The Pact can be implemented by adapting budgetary discipline in an even more rational manner to positive or negative economic cycles and by encouraging structural reforms aimed at developing growth potential. In these terms, the letter and the spirit of the Pact are not dead; quite the opposite, we have worked in the past, are working now and will continue to work within the framework of the Pact and with the Commission’s support in a cooperative and consensual manner.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we have thus far talked a lot about procedure and said little about the economy. In the growth strategy, as has been said, it is necessary for the Pact to take into account economic cycles and structural reforms: this is necessary, but it is not sufficient. Six months ago, at the start of this six-month presidency, we presented an Action Plan for Growth to this House. The support given to this Plan by Parliament was decisive and now the Plan must be implemented. Other, new development initiatives must follow. The Commission, the governments and the markets have a role to play in the growth strategy, but the European Parliament must also play a role as a decisive driving force: indeed, economic policy is either a policy or it is not. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These events are clear proof that we need to strengthen economic governance in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The difficulties stem from the fact that Germany and France are experiencing serious tax problems which can be summarised as follows: excessive deficits, not only due to cyclical factors; the high deficits could prove harmful in the longer term because they threaten the sustainability of public financing by triggering increased debt levels; in addition, there are negative repercussions for potential growth due to the change in economic prospects.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this backdrop and with a view to both countries reducing their deficits, applying the rules laid down in the Treaty, the Council first sent a series of recommendations to Germany and France at the start of the year asking them to adopt measures designed to correct the excessive deficit levels by the end of 2004 at the latest.</p>
<p class="contents">In the second half of this year, however, it became clear that the measures adopted by the two countries would not be enough to correct the high deficits in 2004. The Commission therefore implemented the procedures laid down in the Treaty, submitting new recommendations which take the current situation into account.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, a small number of Member States rejected the Commission’s proposals in the Council, and in an unprecedented move, a majority agreement was reached outside the scope of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement, formulated as ‘Council conclusions’, has very wide-reaching implications which go far beyond the simple application of the Pact in France and Germany. The Commission deeply regrets that the Council has followed neither the spirit nor the letter of the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact, both of which were unanimously approved. We feel that a rules-based system is the only way to ensure that commitments are respected and to guarantee equal treatment for all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to understand that the Council’s decisions will make it harder to apply the Treaty rigorously. Proceedings for other countries will be affected. It will now be very difficult for the Council to adopt formal decisions in line with the procedure for excessive deficits, including the possibility of sending preventative warnings.</p>
<p class="contents">The value of the reports on the stability and convergence programmes could be diminished if the Council does not accept a system of rigorous multilateral monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">It could become harder to apply the convergence criteria strictly in the new Member States, given that the euro-zone countries have been allowed to maintain deficits of over 3% for several years running and the procedures laid down in the Treaty and the Pact have not been applied.</p>
<p class="contents">The political agreement established in the Council entails using intergovernmental agreements to manage our currency and establishes a dangerous precedent for the future. The Court of Justice will probably have to clarify whether Member States’ governments have the power to create new procedures which effectively replace existing Community structures established in the Treaty for certain aspects of economic policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, however, bear in mind the fact that the Council declaration made at the end of the Ecofin Council shows that the Member States understand the need for a growth and stability agreement and also the importance of applying the standards in the same way across the board.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever happens, the Commission will continue to apply the Treaty and the provisions of the Pact. This will allow all Member States to be treated equally and will guarantee healthy public finances in Europe. The Commission will ensure that the procedures are applied appropriately and fairly.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we need to strengthen the economic governance of the Union with a view to ensuring that the single market and single currency work well together.</p>
<p class="contents">We think that the decisions taken by Ecofin prove that the real problem is the weakness of the current system of economic governance at European level. The Commission intends to tackle this problem and will draw up a programme for better economic governance in the Union after careful thought.</p>
<p class="contents">We will not, however, be starting our deliberations from zero. Instead, we will continue along the path taken by the Commission in the past. In line with the Communication of November 2002 on strengthening the coordination of budgetary policies, it seems we need to assess how to combine better discipline and flexibility to ensure greater compliance with the rules. We think that, among other things, greater emphasis should be placed on sustainability and on debt, so as to allow for the particularities of each individual country and to increase symmetry over the course of the whole cycle, in particular by being very strict in boom years.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way, the Commission will carry out the multilateral monitoring in a more effective way, using all available means to publicise its opinions on economic and budgetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to look at the budgetary discussions within the wider context of current low growth potential in the European economy. We therefore need to pay more attention to the quality of public finances without compromising long-term stability and sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">This means placing the debate on budgetary policy higher on the agenda within the context of coordinating economic policies, with a more prominent role for the economic policy guidelines and the implementation of those guidelines to ensure that the Economic and Monetary Union works well and that the Lisbon objectives are achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s active involvement will be essential to this process.</p>

It was not a good day for European law. It was not a good day for the European Monetary Union. It was not a good day for relations between the smaller countries and the larger ones, and it was not a good day for the forthcoming enlargement. Those who, in the nineties, put the case for the Stability and Growth Pact now bear responsibility for the damage done to it, as do those who helped do the damage.</p>
<p class="contents">We, in our group, are fundamentally convinced that we cannot be opportunistic in the way we use European law. So long as there is European regulation, so long as there is European law, it must be adhered to rather than bent. We do not believe that the Stability and Growth Pact is dead; it would be wrong to say that it were, for that would enable all those who break it to evade responsibility, both now and in the future. The Stability and Growth Pact has, however, been seriously damaged. Speaking very generally, what we need in politics is trust; Europe’s currency, this young European currency, needs a very special kind of trust, and that trust has been damaged.</p>
<p class="contents">To you, Commissioner Solbes, I would like to express our group’s gratitude and appreciation for the way you fought right up to the end. You may well not have got a majority for what you wanted, but we are convinced that you are right. Losing can sometimes be an honourable thing, but you have won your case.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We also give our backing to the European Central Bank, and we wish its President, Mr Trichet, every success in continuing in future to be effective in contending for the stability of the European currency. We have now heard one finance minister in particular coming out with preposterous arguments to justify why this deficit is necessary right now in order for us to achieve growth. This argument is utterly false. Today’s debts are tomorrow’s taxes. What we owe today we will take away from people tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Those who run up excessive debts today are behaving exactly like those who are today despoiling our environment, for today’s younger generation and generations yet to come will have to pay the price for it. We therefore demand sustainability not only of a moderate finance and budget policy, but also in environment policy, and these things all belong together. Debts lead to higher interest rates, and these lead to higher inflation. We therefore end up without the money for low-interest loans enabling business and small enterprises to invest, and then no jobs are created for lack of finance at reasonable rates. At the end of the day it will be those on low incomes, it will be what we always used to call the man in the street, who will end up picking up the bill, and so a policy of running up debt is, in essence, anti-social, because it affects most those who have least. Such a policy also damages relations between the countries within the European Union. We have seen how Portugal and Ireland were required to adopt stability measures – quite rightly, as it turned out – and if these countries do it and other countries do it, but some think that they are big enough not to have to take these steps, then the ones who adhere to the criteria end up paying the bill for those who do not. That is why the policy is wrong.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic"> (DE)</span> I really do ask that of you. Today, in my own country – and I am not now speaking as a German, although I am from the largest country in the European Union – many people no longer have any confidence in the ability of the European Council of Ministers to defend the stability of Europe’s currency. We want Europe’s currency to have a future; if it ends up failing, that will mark the failure of the whole project of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">I am a very frequent visitor to the candidate countries and often speak with our counterparts in their parliaments and governments. In Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, in the Czech Republic, in Slovakia, in Hungary, in Slovenia – the situation is different in Malta and Cyprus – they are asking us how it can be demanded of them, the Central Europeans who want to join the European Union, that they should pursue a policy of moderation in their budgets and work hard at reform when certain countries in the European Union give them such a bad example. That is a bad, indeed a terrible sign, not only in terms of economic policy but also more generally speaking, and my advice is that we, together, get back on the path of virtue, for it is not acceptable for some larger countries to do things that are not permitted to the smaller ones. This also has to do with European psychology and with the dignity of states, and so there must be no repetition of what happened on 25 November. I hope this is the last time that our group will be obliged to criticise this sort of action in such forthright terms.</p>

<p class="contents">Mr Tremonti, as a respected legal expert, you must acknowledge that the rules cannot be ignored in this way. When the question of form is raised, we are told we need to talk about policy. Fine, let us talk about policy, but first of all, if there is a structure, if there are rules, they have to be respected. One of the gravest problems right now is that Ecofin as a whole does not have a Community culture. It did not demonstrate any sense of Community when it acted as it did in the meeting on the Stability Pact, nor when it proposed the amendments which disturb the balance of powers between the Council and Parliament, despite having no authority to make such proposals. Consequently, I think that Ecofin’s first task should be to read the Treaties and respect them.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three fundamental issues at stake at the moment. Firstly, the present and the future of the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stability and Growth Pact was created before monetary union took place. Now that we have monetary union, we ought to revise the Pact to include the new elements. What cannot be allowed, as we have been saying for months, is for the Pact to have been breached in 2000 and a bad precedent established. What we are discussing here, although this is not a conference of forensic experts, is whether or not the Stability Pact is dead. The problem is which countries will the Pact apply to now? What about Portugal? What is happening with Ireland? Are they any different? It is therefore very important to get the Stability and Growth Pact back on the rails and to enable the Commission to make constructive proposals. The real issue is not whether the Pact is dead or not, but the fact that it is not being respected or applied, which is a much more serious matter at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question – and here I agree with Minister Tremonti who raised it with support from Parliament and with whom we successfully revived the Delors plan – is why the European economy is not a driving force even though it has the potential to be one. This is why we have been in favour of the action plan from the outset. However, in the current situation, that motor is not even starting, and that in turn is increasingly battering public confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, aside from the need to update the Stability and Growth Pact, we also need to think about a point raised by Commissioner Solbes: economic governance.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not calling for the Stability and Growth Pact to be included in the Constitution, but we must remember that in the Convention working group chaired by my colleague Mr Hänsch, all the economic representatives were playing very defensively – much like the Italian football team – and seeking to block any progress on economic governance in the Union. This is extremely serious.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is it so serious? Because at the moment we do not have any stronger instruments. Compare our situation with that of the United States: we have a central bank which only looks at inflation, and a Stability and Growth Pact which is not being respected and which does not take that element of economic governance into account. Minister Tremonti talked about factoring in economic cycles. In the United States, before making a proposal to Congress, the Federal Reserve is actually required to take into account inflation, employment and economic activity. These are factors which need to be taken seriously and now is the time to raise these issues. Now is also the time to ensure that the Stability and Growth Pact will have a future. For this reason, Mr President, I think we have a responsibility to respect the Treaties and to make sure that Ecofin follows the same rules as everyone else.</p>

What we witnessed last week was finance ministers giving the last rites to rules which were intended to guarantee the long-term stability of our currency and economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the guilty parties deny all responsibility, or claim 'the Pact is dead, long live the Pact'. But the truth is that the eurozone's two leading economies have sent a message to all the small countries in the eurozone, and to the acceding countries, which reads 'do as we say, not as we do'. And I should like to point out to Mr Tremonti that the Italian presidency has failed in its duty by acting as an associate in the endeavours of the countries concerned to flout the Pact, rather than ensuring that the rules were respected.</p>
<p class="contents">We will pay a heavy price for the cavalier disregard of finance ministers for the rules of the Stability Pact. We will pay a price in terms of damage to the trust between Member States, in terms of lost credibility in the eyes of our citizens, and, in the long run, in terms of higher interest rates, lower growth and currency instability.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless our leaders agree on a revised and workable framework for fiscal stability, and inscribe this in our basic law, then we are left with nothing but a broken gentlemen's agreement. Countries which gave up their currencies on the understanding that they would not be expected to pay for the debts of their neighbours have a right to demand more than that.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why my Group welcomes the stand taken by Commissioner Solbes and the Commission's intentions to make proposals to reshape the rules. If you kill off the Pact in its existing form, you have a responsibility to commit yourself to an agreed interpretation of a set of rules to prevent a borrowing free-for-all.</p>
<p class="contents">Liberal Democrats believe that a well-run economy and a stable currency require taxes and spending to be in balance over the course of the business cycle. The problem is not the 3% deficit limit; the problem is the failure of countries to consolidate their budgets in terms of growth.</p>
<p class="contents">My surprise at hearing the leader of the Socialist Group in this House agree with us is matched only by my delight at his conversion. The revised rules should provide sticks and carrots to ensure that we take advantage of periods of economic growth to run budgets in balance or in surplus and reduce national debt. Countries which operate a responsible policy in the good times could benefit from more flexibility in bad times to let borrowing take the strain.</p>
<p class="contents">These rules should provide for early action against countries which do not control their deficits in periods of growth, to force them to take corrective measures. A new target for the underlying budget balance could be added, and government expenditure on investment should also be taken into account. The European Commission should have greater authority to police these new rules, since national governments have shown that they cannot be trusted to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">This has been a bad week for the rule of law in the European Union. My Group hopes that at the summit in Brussels our leaders will recognise their responsibility to salvage, from the wreckage of the Stability Pact, some credibility for Europe's fiscal policy .</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Herzog (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, we very much welcome the political debate that is beginning on the Stability Pact. Mr Prodi gave the word and it was re-launched by the Ecofin Council. The Commission is very wrong to put adherence to the rules side by side with political judgment. The law is flexible when the realities so require and it is then the duty of politicians to interpret it. This Pact, which is currently being tested by the realities, signed in 1997, at which time, the Commission, the Central Bank and many states heralded an era of sustainable growth. Having first denied that there was a recession, they then declared that it would be brief and that the economy would soon recover. Those who were so wrong should not dole out lessons. Today, the improvement in the situation is fragile. It must not be compromised, particularly as we are at risk from the fall in the dollar and serious American imbalances. Some governments make a show of virtue in contrast to the large states that are deemed to be guilty. However, the behaviour of these critics often appears to be opportunistic. In fact, on many occasions their inflation rates are above the average – which reduces their debts – they play at fiscal dumping in order to attract capital and they forget about the Structural Funds, of which some of them are major beneficiaries. There are therefore several good reasons for flexibility in the Pact. It does not take account of the cycle, it maintains divisions, it seeks to impose penalties without offering encouragement, and it is incapable of responding to the nagging problem of the very poor potential for growth in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, it would not be an exaggeration if the Commission were still to be portrayed as the guardian of procedures. We need a political actor in Brussels. There is no such thing as a European economic policy and we want to create one. This is a matter of urgency. The Pact is not dead, as proved by the commitments made by France and Germany for 2005. However, if the economic recovery were not confirmed or were poor, it would be extremely difficult to fulfil these commitments. I say again: the reform is essential. To this end, the method is as important as the substance. All of the quarrels among institutions and among states highlight a blatant lack of democratic capacity and legitimacy. The assessment by peers of the discipline and quality of the national budgetary policy is undoubtedly necessary, but it is not enough, as was mentioned previously. Solidarity and greater participation are required to build an economic policy. In this respect, I believe that the interactive dialogue between the national parliaments and the European Parliament, as well as the consultation of civil societies, are vital elements.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as content is concerned, we need both rules and acts. We do not reject the principle of a pact for rules that seek to combine stability and growth. However, we have strict ideas as regards the substance. We need rules that encourage timely action and improve the quality of expenditure and revenue. How can we claim to legitimise a budget discipline when the Union shamelessly cultivates fiscal competitiveness? France and Germany are right to call for the tax harmonisation that a number of other states refuse to allow them. These rules must guarantee too the capacity to finance projects considered to be in the general interest.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need acts. There will be no successful reform of the Pact if we do not build, as a complement, a European budgetary policy, with a genuine budget to help finance the objectives of sustainable development and cohesion agreed at the Lisbon and Gothenburg summits. Is it not unfair to prevent at least the countries in the euro zone from having a joint capacity for budgetary action when they share a single monetary policy, but are deprived of a second major economic policy lever? Unfortunately, there is the risk that the IGC may not open these doors and that the reform of the Pact may be too limited. You can therefore expect an increase in tensions, to which our debates today are only a prelude.</p>

It could be regretted that it was destroyed by the European Council, in relation to the specific difficulties of two large countries, thus violating the credibility of the institutions based on a system of rules accepted by all. However, as far as its form is concerned, this Pact has always been the subject of an intergovernmental agreement rather than control by our Parliament, the only representative of the sovereignty of the people of Europe. What ‘intergovernmentality’ has done, Mr Karas, is ruin it.</p>
<p class="contents">Federalists and Greens will not lament the death of this Pact – a Pact that President Prodi himself yesterday described as stupid – particularly as since the Amsterdam summit we had criticised its content.</p>
<p class="contents">It was indeed stupid, doubly so in fact. In the current situation, it aggravates the recessions by penalising the countries that are seeking to support the actual demand on the Union’s internal market, especially in the large countries with a particular responsibility from this point of view. Instead, it would be better to penalise the countries that have deficits in periods of growth.</p>
<p class="contents">From a structural point of view, a genuine Stability Pact should shelter future investments and in particular the enormous investments required to respect the Kyoto criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no time left to dither now. A new, intelligent pact must be adopted. Only a pact of this nature will merit inclusion in the third part of the Constitution. Indeed, only an intelligent Constitution will merit the approval and respect of the citizens of Europe. The pact must be contra-cyclic and, at the same time, must not hinder the countries in difficulty. On the contrary, it must penalise the countries that abuse their facilities and in this way, through a sort of climatic golden rule, shelter future investments from the current situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is no coincidence that the Commission position is in line with that of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, I believe that we should make the effort to be imaginative as regards this sensitive and complex issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has its rules – and the Pact is a rule – but, at the moment, we do not need rules any more. I believe that Europe needs to be imaginative, courageous and dynamic and I do not feel that these issues can be tackled without understanding that, in this House, the Italian Presidency and Mr Tremonti are not to be supported for what they have said but rather a Presidency is to be supported for what it does, for taking note of serious issues affecting major countries of this Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, for the third year running, we – and I am a rapporteur on European public finances – have had to note that the European economy is stagnating. I also seem to understand from other Members’ speeches that European politics has some problems, and we were talking about this in committee yesterday with Commissioner Solbes as well. Therefore, why not make an effort to move from stability to growth, at last? I believe that this is to be done by people who, rather than being the guardians of rules, want to be politicians, which is what Plato once meant when he talked about the politician and his supremacy. From this point of view, it seems to me that we are doing exactly what is needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And why do we not start working on agreements to which we <span class="italic">do</span> want to adhere?</p>
<p class="contents">In my country at least, many people are asking these questions. Their confidence has been dealt a serious blow. Why are all countries equal, but certain large countries more equal than others? The justifiably devastating comments in the media speak volumes. All of this undermines confidence in politics, and that reflects badly on us. Why, Mr Tremonti, have you not elected to play your role as independent chairman on the side of the Stability and Growth Pact, as proposed by the Commission? Do you realise what the role of chairman entails?</p>
<p class="contents">I am also reminded of this by certain clauses of the report of the Euro Group and Ecofin Council's meeting. In that report, Commissioner Solbes indicates that the Commission has given France and Germany recommendations with comparable content, which means that these countries are on an equal footing. He notes that we have reached a critical moment in time. The wrong decisions can seriously damage the procedure. Decisions can create an important precedent and affect interest rates. This issue concerns the equal treatment of large and small Member States. Commissioner Solbes goes on to say that if the Commission's recommendations are not followed, there is a considerable risk of France and Germany remaining above the 3% mark even in 2005. The Commission has already been extremely flexible. The recommendations currently before us really are as far as we are prepared to go. Commissioner Solbes also indicates that, pursuant to Article 104(7) of the EC Treaty, returning to an excessive deficit is not an option, because sanctions would never follow otherwise. Moreover, the Treaty and the Pact do not distinguish between cooperative and uncooperative countries. As the Guardian of the Treaty, the Commission has no choice but to follow the route it has now proposed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, in doing so, they did not comply with the Treaty. I would be curious to know what the Court of Justice would think about it if it looked into the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as France is concerned, it violated its Constitution in 1997 when, in spite of our warnings, it adopted a stupid Stability Pact that is now coming back to haunt it and that it is forced to violate in turn, creating a conflict with its partners.</p>
<p class="contents">That is a good example of a bad manoeuvre. I hope that we are not going to make another blunder by approving the draft European Constitution, whose philosophy is exactly that of the Stability Pact: centralisation and rigidity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I do not wish to blame the Italian Presidency, but, Mr Tremonti, the decision by Ecofin is a real botch job. Because the European Union, Mr President, is a community of values and a community of law, and legal rules – the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact are legal rules – only mean something if there is an obligation to comply with them, and that compliance must be demanded equally from the small and the large countries.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Europe cannot be built upon the law of the largest. We cannot, Mr President, apply the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact to Portugal to the letter and then exonerate other larger countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is one thing to be flexible and apply the rules in accordance with the circumstances, but it is another matter altogether to try to change the rules when the game has already begun, when the result is not favourable or when it does not suit us; and that attitude, Mr President, will have consequences, because a market which is not able to respect its own rules creates insecurity and a lack of confidence in the credibility of the single currency and, as the Chairman of our political group, Mr Poettering, said, today's deficit is tomorrow's debt and the taxes of the day after tomorrow. And what is worse, this decision comes at a very bad time, precisely on the eve of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference which is going to discuss the European Constitution. And I wonder with what moral authority certain Member States criticise others for exercising their legitimate rights within the context of qualified majority voting, when they are blatantly defending their national interests in violation of the spirit and the letter of the Treaties, as the Commission has acknowledged.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore congratulate the Commission, Mr President, on the integrity it has demonstrated in the defence of its role as guardian of the Treaties and I would ask whether, for the sake of coherence, the Commission intends to bring a case before the Court of Justice against the Council of Ministers for violation of the Treaties.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Goebbels (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the Ecofin Council’s failure to take a decision on the German and French deficits leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. It is never wise to by-pass freely accepted rules. It is a dreadful move to give the public the impression that in the Union some states are more equal than others, that the Federal Republic of Germany and France have the right to special treatment because they are Europe’s driving force.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Socialists are concerned, stability is a public good that must be defended. However, there will be no stability without growth. For years, the Socialist Group has called for an intelligent revision of the Pact, which places all its emphasis on stability and none on growth. The Pact is too rigid. It is the prisoner of criteria which, although freely accepted, do not take account of the realities of the economic cycles. I agree with Mr Tremonti on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is the ‘one size fits all’ approach. Some states operate with a public debt of around 60% while others have debt of over 100% of their gross domestic product. The Pact does not take these substantial differences into account. Then there are sanctions that are impossible to impose. Asking a state in an economic recession to make deposits or to pay large fines is like trying to cure someone of anaemia by bleeding them.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with the German and French deficits, the Commission wanted to ensure that the rules were respected. It could do nothing else. Yet now that the rules have been smashed, the Commission cannot continue to brandish the Tables of the Law. When the real country moves ahead of the legal country, the procedures must be adapted. In any event, the economic policy cannot be limited to mere observation of the procedures. This is where I also agree with Mr Tremonti. For the same reasons, my group is opposed to an appeal before the European Court of Justice. We are dealing here with a political problem that requires a political solution. We do not need to resort to the government of judges.</p>
<p class="contents">As some of the Pact’s key provisions were clearly made obsolete by the political precedent imposed by the Ecofin Council, the Pact must be improved. It is unthinkable that if Portugal, Greece or Luxembourg had excessive budget deficits tomorrow, the Commission could put forward proposals going beyond those that were accepted by the Ecofin Council for Germany and France. The absolute rule of equal treatment of the Member States quite simply prohibits this.</p>
<p class="contents">President Prodi has just highlighted the fact that following a serious crisis innovative solutions are needed. I therefore call on Commissioner Solbes who, after having preached virtue, must now preach intelligence. After having valiantly defended the principles, now the Commission alone has the freedom to propose a Stability and Growth Pact that is both rigorous and more flexible. It must be more rigorous in requiring states to maintain a balanced budget when growth exceeds 3% for example. It must be more rigorous in requiring states to reduce their debt when growth exceeds 3%. It must be more flexible, however, in times when the situation is not as positive, in particular by enabling states to deduct investment expenditure from the calculation of the budget deficit in accordance with the British golden rule. According to the Commission, 1% of investment expenditure generates additional growth of 0.6% of GDP. For example, the United States currently invests 3% of its GDP while Europe only invests a meagre 1%.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at economic growth on both sides of the Atlantic, we see a dogmatic Europe and a pragmatic America. I am not calling here for American-style deficits …</p>

The first is that there must be a sense of shared responsibility. Remember that the problem for both Germany and France began because of the budget relaxations, the tax cuts and public spending increases introduced between 1999 and 2002. In each country that budget easing amounted to more than 1.5% of GDP. If it had not happened, both countries would today be within the 3% limit. Yet no institution, neither the Commission nor the European Central Bank, nor any Member of this House, warned those governments against such easing. The system failed and we are all duty-bound to put it right.</p>
<p class="contents">This is important, too, because the Stability and Growth Pact is not a judicial procedure, but a political procedure that relies on the support of the finance ministers for recommendations and, ultimately, sanctions. Ministers and the Commission must have a common understanding of how the Pact should be applied. There should be a clear code of conduct on the interpretation of the Pact so that it can be credible for the future. There must be a reinforcement of discipline in the good years and, in the short term, there must be an agreement on the size and speed of the adjustments necessary for the countries in breach to move back to balance.</p>
<p class="contents">The Pact itself recognises that it will not always be possible to remedy excessive deficits immediately if there are special circumstances. Those special circumstances should now be defined to include the risk of a further prolongation of the recession in Germany and in France which, together, represent half of the euro area. It is not in anyone's interest to prolong the recession, nor is it in anyone's interest to undermine the credibility of the Pact. The law must be respected. With goodwill and imagination this circle can be squared. We urge the Commission and the finance ministers to do so.</p>

In the end, they actually proved that we were right to condemn the irrationality of the criteria for nominal convergence, which have led to the well-known and disastrous consequences of economic recession, rising unemployment and poverty levels that Portugal is currently experiencing.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already said here on more than one occasion that this Stability Pact is useless. In the debate of October last year we confirmed our agreement with President Romano Prodi and Commissioner Lamy’s observations to the effect that this pact is stupid, like all rigid decisions, and that it is a crude instrument for economic governance, which must be replaced by something more intelligent, since the 3% rule is positively medieval. Unfortunately, these gentlemen were not consistent with their observations and failed to present a proposal for the pact’s revision. They were afraid of launching the excessive deficit procedure against France and Germany, as they had done against Portugal. And then the inevitable happened: Germany and France did not accept the Commission’s proposal. Of course, the Commission said it would continue to apply the Treaty and that it reserves the right to look at the consequences of the Council conclusions and to decide on any action it might take. Does anyone believe, however, that the Commission will do anything to France and Germany if the governments of those countries do not agree? As we all know, it will not. The question that remains is: why keep a Pact that is meaningless?</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the text approved by Ecofin only imposes rules previously announced by the German and French governments, thereby accepting that these countries have failed to meet the Maastricht criteria for three consecutive years. There is furthermore no doubt that if they need more time, they could stretch this to four or five years … It is now clear who controls the Stability Pact, who wields power and strength in the European Union even before the new Constitutional Treaty has entered into force. It should be noted that it was Germany that demanded the Stability Pact, with these unacceptable criteria for nominal convergence. As we now see, however, it did so in order to enforce compliance on others. Well might Commissioner Solbes Mira state that the Council’s decision respects neither the rules nor the spirit of the Stability Pact. Will he now resign, his authority having been undermined in this way? France was, of course, more realistic, stating that the Council has another way of implementing the Stability Pact, thereby justifying its non-compliance, whilst advocating changes through what it called the ‘enriching’ of the Stability Pact. This is an approach that others have also advocated here. Some, indeed, have said that the Pact is not dead; it is merely frozen until the rich and powerful countries decide it can be defrosted because their problems have been solved. We know that the Governing Council of the European Central Bank also supported adopting the Commission’s proposals. Will the Governing Council also resign for allowing itself to be ignored by the Council?</p>
<p class="contents">We, who have always been opposed to this Stability Pact have long called for it to be suspended, in order to revise its stupid criteria for nominal convergence, which fail to take account of the real situation in each country and of their different levels of socio-economic development and which confuse productive expenditure with non-productive expenditure when calculating the budget deficit. One thing is certain, however: the hypocrisy of those people – and they exist in Portugal too – who use the argument of the Stability Pact to justify anti-social policies, now becomes even more striking.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us bury this Pact! Let us seek alternative policies that give priority to employment, to high-quality public services, to sustainable development and to the well-being of the people! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That cannot be allowed to go uncontradicted, and we cannot simply move on to the next item of business. Whether one looks at it from the point of view of democratic politics, of economic policy, monetary policy, in legal terms or from the European angle, the way you have gone about things is harmful, unacceptable and deserving of condemnation.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, Commissioner Solbes told us that the Council has not kept to the spirit of the Treaty. On Monday, Mr Trichet, the President of the ECB, told the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that the European Central Bank attaches great importance to the Stability and Growth Pact remaining unchanged whatever happens, for it has proved its worth in terms of economic and monetary policy. He called on the Council, the Commission, Parliament and the Member States to take their own responsibilities seriously. It is in particular Germany and France whom I urge to refrain from blaming the EU in general, and the Stability Pact in particular, for their domestic difficulties. Apportioning blame makes no proper contribution to achieving jointly-agreed objectives. The European Union is made up of all of us. Germany and France overstepped the mark in the way they interpreted the rules, and what was a Community matter they made merely intergovernmental. By a political decision, they set the rules aside, but the Community is not an alternative to politics. The finance ministers have impaired its credibility, shattered confidence and given rise to other problems. That is not acceptable.</p>

This is very serious.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a weighty precedent, which could benefit other countries in future and which, as Mr Prodi said, is detrimental to effective coordination, to the governance of economic and social policies on the basis of transparent, binding objectives, not just in terms of stability but also, and especially at this time, in terms of growth.</p>
<p class="contents">This incident, however, only serves to highlight the shortcomings and contradictions that remain in the management of the Stability and Growth Pact, with the European Parliament still being excluded from any codecision procedure. This incident highlights the shortcomings in the actual wording of the Stability Pact, which is much more restrictive and mechanical than the text of the Treaty, not least as regards problems of flexibility. This means that the Union institutions, starting with the Commission, have to take two completely incompatible approaches in managing the two missions that the Union has given itself in the field of economic, social and environmental policy. I am referring to the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies, the latter still without binding objectives, and to the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">It is these serious shortcomings, which are also present in the Commission initiative, which explain why management which is flexible but not appropriate in terms of compliance with the objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact has been adopted, without the minimal but specific conditions being established that justify the length of time set for adjusting budgets. I am referring to the Lisbon strategy, to the binding objectives of the Lisbon strategy that need to be among the conditions to be fulfilled in the implementation of the Stability Pact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even then, I made it plain that there was no argument against limiting states’ new public indebtedness, provided that this was coupled with the requirement that growth be generated and demand stimulated. Growth and an increase in demand will not, however, be achieved by cutting wages or by longer working hours, but by taking the tax burden off the low and middle income groups, through public investment, capital-widening investment by businesses and by increasing private consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision by the eurozone finance ministers to put the Excessive Deficit Procedure against Germany and France on ice and grant these states a reprieve, allowing them until 2005 to achieve the 3% limit for new annual indebtedness is a lazy compromise, one that does not alter the false basic premise, according to which, in economically tough times, strict adherence to the 3% limit has an expansionary rather than a contractionary effect. In order to reinvigorate investment across the board, any reform of the Stability Pact must go hand in hand with more European economic, social, employment, fiscal and environmental policies. It must be possible to use loans to fund public investment, even if this does, for a period, take the deficit over the 3% limit.</p>
<p class="contents">Such would be, in my judgment, an honest and proper course of action, without which we would lose all credibility and the same problem would rear its head in more countries every year.</p>
<p class="contents">You may think otherwise, but my view is that we should correct mistakes rather than try to cover them up with new ones. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also referring to Mr Poettering: I do not think that Mr Tremonti invited the Member States to run up debts, but rather to look more at the substance than the procedures of what has happened. Nor do I agree with Mr Watson’s speech when he talks of a watered-down Pact. The Italian Presidency has taken it out of the water in which it was drowning. Even less do I feel that I can agree with those who claim that the Pact is dead.</p>
<p class="contents">If, instead, we look at the facts, we have to agree that, on the contrary, the Pact is still alive and that the Italian Presidency has succeeded in saving it, even in a situation where there were very real difficulties. The Presidency has succeeded in obtaining the unanimous adoption, including, therefore, endorsement even from the most rigorous States, of conclusions which contain important commitments on respecting the Pact, budgetary discipline and implementing structural reforms. This has not been discussed in the Member States, still less in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Commission recommendation, the issue is a simple one: the Commission presented recommendations which, while fully respecting the Treaty, were put to the vote in the Council. The Council rejected them since the majority required by the same Treaty was not reached. What should the Italian Presidency have done? Taken note of the rejection of the Commission recommendations without adopting any other act? Left France and Germany free to act? Rendered the whole process to date invalid? I believe that, in this case, there really should have been talk of a dead Pact and of the Council’s irresponsible behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead, the Italian Presidency chose the only way to save the Pact. Faced with the impossibility of adopting the Commission recommendations, it proposed to adopt the Conclusions in which France and Germany committed to updating the measures for reducing the deficit and to temporarily suspend the procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The procedures are clearly described in the Maastricht Treaty, and they are echoed in the Stability Pact. Each has its part to play – the Commission just as much as the Council of Finance Ministers. The fact that they do not absolutely have to agree in their assessments has something to do with the way in which everyone stresses the need for the Pact to be adhered to and our need for rules, without it being clear how effective a pact of this kind can be when it deals only with sanctions for when things are going badly and makes no provision for the Commission to have a role when things are going well. The Pact is defective not only in that the Commission has no role when things are going well, but also in that it highlights only the difficulties that the Member States face in times of recession. Are not, though, the effects of a three-year period of stagnation, which has shaken and battered Europe’s major national economies in particular, ultimately every bit as bad as a recession?</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I believe, we also have to emphasise that the Pact has, indeed, demonstrated its effectiveness and so we can set about reforming it without qualms. Any reform must involve the Commission abolishing its rigid procedures for cyclical adjustment and allowing itself to be judged using the methods chosen by the International Monetary Fund. If it did, perhaps our debates would be quite different, as we also have to bear in mind that the figures at issue between the Council of Finance Ministers and the Commission in the cases of France and Germany, even with the error rates in our statistics, relate only to a gap of 0.2%.</p>
<p class="contents">What we really need now, I believe, is an in-depth debate on the reform of the Stability Pact; above all else, I believe that we have to combine a genuine definition not only of monetary stability but also of financial soundness, with growth and with social stability. That, rather than austerity alone, is the challenge that Europe faces.</p>

There are passages in force that are admissions of weakness and the oxygen of confidence has become scarce in the European Union since that day.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not have sanctions, but the obligation to reduce deficits remains. Indeed, one of the Council’s conclusions highlights this. We must therefore save what may be left of the Pact today, in other words its spirit, the quest for stability and growth, using the one to achieve the other.</p>
<p class="contents">What has happened also raises the question of the Franco-German relationship. It is not a question of its necessity as regards moving Europe forward but its credibility in ensuring that the steps forward are accepted. The Franco-German relationship is a driving force, but this driving force must not turn into a detonator that would cause Europe to explode.</p>

We can see how an economic crisis is very quickly also transformed into a political crisis, given the way in which the currency union is at present constructed. We can see how, in practice, there are quite different rules for large countries such as Germany and France and for small countries such as Portugal and Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">This crisis is not only due to the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact not being fulfilled. At root, there are significantly deeper problems. Germany’s and France’s problems are basically about low growth and unduly low employment. The problem is that, in practice, the EU’s currency union and Stability and Growth Pact have nothing to offer in terms of getting growth under way and creating higher employment. In that way, the crisis is in danger of deepening.</p>
<p class="contents">We also see clearly that different countries in the eurozone are now most likely doing well for having different policies. Countries with quite different rates of growth and inflation need different interest and exchange rates. It is no coincidence that those Western European countries that are not part of the currency union enjoy, on average, very much stronger economic development than the eurozone countries. The euro is part of the problem. It must be realised that the Stability and Growth Pact no longer works, but must be altered. It must be able to allow a more expansive economic policy in times of crisis so that it is possible to escape from the economic crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">A very large majority of Swedes voted against the common currency in a referendum in September. The crisis in the Stability and Growth Pact is further proof that it was a clever decision to stay out of the EU’s currency union. It is now time to go further and, in the ongoing Intergovernmental Conference, to confirm the Swedish ‘no’ in a legally binding exemption that is at least as comprehensive as the British one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Randzio-Plath, I can only shake my head at that. If you are capable of accusing the Commission of such a thing, then which Europe, which euro zone, are you living in? We can do no other than back Commissioner Solbes to the hilt and urge him to take the Heads of State or Government to court, for such a breach of the European Stability and Growth Pact cannot be accepted without protest.</p>
<p class="contents">When this House is told that the Italian Presidency of the Council has managed to produce some tremendous conclusions, I ask myself whether this piece of paper is worth more than an international treaty such as the Stability and Growth Pact. Why should Germany and France see themselves as bound by this piece of paper when they could not keep to the rules? The leading German daily paper, the <span class="italic">Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</span>, spoke of Germany and France as a ‘<span class="italic">Duo Infernale</span>’, as digging the European Union’s grave rather than acting as examples to its other Member States of how to do things. The Pact is flexible enough as it is. It is not the case that there has to be a 3% deficit; instead, the term used in the Pact is ‘budgetary compensation’. The difference between 0% and 3% gives the Member States EUR 250 billion in reserve to deal with difficulties caused by the economic cycle, the management of international crises and natural disasters, so the problem is in fact that Germany and France already had no room for manoeuvre left when things started to get difficult. It follows, Commissioner, that it is the reforms that you have to get to grips with rather than growth alone. That is why we are firmly opposed to the Stability and Growth Pact being altered. It has to be adhered to, and the Commission must be given more powers in its dealings with the Council.</p>

The problem is not so much the Pact. The problem is that we are in a monetary union and we do not have an economic union. Some people have called the Pact stupid. I believe nonetheless that the Commission has demonstrated a certain degree of intelligence in its ability to interpret it.</p>
<p class="contents">I am surprised, however, that some people are talking about referring the matter to the Court of Justice and that no one has ever considered referring to the Court of Justice other violations of the Treaty committed on an ongoing basis by practically all of the members of the euro zone, when they did not consider their economic policy to be an issue of common interest, as the Treaty suggests. That is the root of the problem before us. The Stability Pact is only the rule at the end of the process that allows the points to be counted. The Stability Pact never describes how to play the game, and the game can only be a team game. The Stability Pact is called stupid or rigid. It is much less so than the competitive devaluations that prevailed before the transition to the euro. However, it is not enough on its own.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, I believe that we must look at three aspects. From the point of view of the economic policies, we have the strategic tool we need to ensure new growth in Europe: the Lisbon strategy. We do not have the tool for its implementation and it is certainly not the Stability Pact that will be used to implement this strategy. This is what we must consider. Some people have proposed a strategy for major work. However, the ministers for the economy and finance have yet to decide to finance it. Everyone is talking about coordination but it only comes to the forefront when it enables France and Germany to unite against the Commission. That is not <span class="italic">ex ante</span> coordination, which is the coordination that should enable the maximum benefit to be derived from the euro zone.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect relates to the dialogue with the Central Bank. When the Central Bank talks, over and over again, about structural reforms, the governments do not listen to it; another form of dialogue with the governments must be found.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must look to the work of the Convention in order to make progress in relation to the results in the IGC and consolidate the Commission’s power as regards the implementation of an economic union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to focus our attention on the following: the rules we freely accept and subscribe to, big and small, weak and strong, must be respected by everyone, whether we like it or not. Woe betide if the principles and regulations of the European Union were considered to apply <span class="italic">à la carte</span> and that, if they were in our interest we respected them and, if we did not like them, we ignored them.</p>
<p class="contents">The most fundamental principle of democracy is respect for the law by everyone. If it does not satisfy us, we change it. If the Stability Pact does not satisfy, let it be abolished or amended. However, under no circumstances is it allowed for us to consider that it applies, but is not adhered to by those who do not like it, as is happening now. When it was discovered that the terms of the pact were being infringed by small Member States of the European Union, such as Portugal, they were obliged to proceed to apply harsh measures and spending cuts in order to reduce their deficit to below 3%, and none of the big Member States now in violation asked for the pact not to be applied. Now that the problem has unexpectedly hit their economy, they have discovered that the pact is anything from unsuitable or unacceptable. Dual standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The reaction is therefore reasonable on the part of the small countries, who see that ‘some are more equal than others’, as George Orwell said. Thus their lack of faith in the new arrangements of the draft Constitution is being reinforced, with the possible danger of it not being ratified and of the European Union finding itself in a terrible impasse. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only was the Stability Pact socially unfair, it was totally unworkable, and the tragedy about breaking it is not that we did not wish it to be respected, it is that it was ever set up. That was the real tragedy. If we had stuck to the Maastricht criteria with the same severity that the Stability Pact asks us to stick to the three per cent, would there be a euro today? Would there be a euro, Commissioner? I ask everybody here to put their hand on their heart and answer that question honestly, like honest people who want rules to be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point about this is that the Commission tells us that it will continue applying the Pact. If the same case happens again, how will the Pact be applied? I hope with the same latitude that was shown to France and Germany. It would be unfair for a different standard to be applied to a small country in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">It has also been suggested that the deficits of today are the taxes of tomorrow. How very simple! The deficits of today can also be the investment of today, which will produce the higher income of tomorrow, from which higher taxes can easily be paid. So I suggest we stop making virtuous speeches here and go and enrol in a good course of elementary macroeconomics, which some of us here seem to need - of course, I am not including the Minister in this comment. He seems to know about it - or has learned about it - and I am grateful to him for that.</p>
<p class="contents">The substance of the matter is that today we need expansionary, rather than contractionary, economic policy. Just as there is inflationary stability, there can also be deflationary stability. From that point of view the demise of the Stability Pact is good for stability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His words might be harsh, but they are right: ‘the Stability Pact was a stab in the back for the Franco-German axis, which changed from being a boost for a Community-based Europe to a factor for instability. The Stability Pact is now dead, at least as regards its power to impose penalties. This is an indication that the Community-based Europe has lost its direction’. I do not wish to contribute to the debate as to whether or not the Stability Pact was stupid. We saw how, in the space of a few days, those who considered it to be intelligent decided not to comply with it and those who believed it to be stupid protested when it was ignored. I admit that other indicators are needed and that mechanisms that apply to periods of growth might need to be qualitatively different to those that must be complied with in periods of recession. There is one thing I am sure of, however: we need mechanisms to discipline public finances in the interest of the euro and of Europe. What we cannot accept are the double standards of the criteria: some countries are obliged to comply with things that others are allowed to get away with. What is damaging to European unity is the feeling that the small countries are not allowed to act in ways that the large countries can. What is unacceptable is seeing those that have acted improperly making contemptuous and crude remarks about those who have honoured the commitments they have given. One example is the deplorable attitude of the French and German Finance Ministers towards the Portuguese Government’s courageous budgetary stance. What is worrying is that the backsliding on complying with the rules of the Pact could lead to an increase in interest rates, as Mr Solbes admitted.

I hope you will not mind if a Bavarian like myself draws a parallel. At the time of the Austrian elections, when the coalition came into being, we accused this law-abiding country of illegality and sought to use all our powers to get our own way, and the same is happening now. The larger countries are demonstrating that European law is of no interest to them.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot do other than encourage the Commission to subject what has happened to critical scrutiny, including by their lawyers, because the Council has not only rejected the Commission proposal – as it was entitled to do – but has also disregarded the Commission and simply set new parameters. This is not something that the Council is competent to do and so I cannot do other than offer the Commission encouragement.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the way the big boys play the game within the European Union has a seriously prejudicial effect on the accession countries, who, as we are aware, will, all ten of them, followed by another two, be signing up to the euro, and all the while we have had one debate after another about the need to keep to the criteria. On what arguments will the Commission or the Council rely in future when telling these countries that they have to stick to the criteria? We ourselves do not, so we can expect that they will do likewise.</p>
<p class="contents">The only thing I can actually do is give the Commission my backing. This is where the Commission must proceed with rigour and consistency, and let me issue a warning against negotiating a new Pact; the current situation in Europe being what it is, any new Pact would not be worthy of the name, but would end up as a hotchpotch of wishful thinking and aspirations towards flexibility that bear no relation whatever to what the economy demands. Europe is paying the price for Germany’s failure to do its homework over the past few years, and, at the end of the day, what we are aiming for is to keep the European single currency as a guarantee of economic stability. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Acting in the name of Germany, the German finance minister has just trodden this law underfoot by joining with France in doing serious damage to the Stability Pact. In so doing, Germany not only broke the law but also destroyed trust, not only at home, but also among its neighbours in Europe and without doubt also in the countries seeking to join the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Rules can be changed, but not by breaking them. At best, this amounts to rule by might rather than right, and hence to the antithesis of what holds the EU together. This malevolent spirit of national egoism and Franco-German high-handedness will dog Europe for a long time yet. Berlin shrank back in fear from cutting EUR 6 billion from total expenditure of EUR 1 000 billion. Such an amount is in no way crucial to the success of a recovery – not that there are any indications of one. The EU’s foundations have been tampered with, and a long-planned alliance has been forged against the European Commission. That, in essence, is the strategic position, the strategy underlying this course of action, the strategic heart of the Berlin-Paris soft-currency axis.</p>
<p class="contents">Who, then, will blame the smaller states and the Eurosceptics if they again become more suspicious? Nor will anyone be so keen to rely again on the Commission to protect them. It was a black day for Europe when this damage was done to the Stability Pact, resulting in a crisis of confidence and a political crisis within the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Tremonti,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council.</span> <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, the Presidency has been criticised for not being neutral. The Italian Presidency, and I am quoting Commissioner Solbes, made a great effort to find a solution, but it is also true that it did not vote in favour of the Commission recommendations. The way a person votes is a strange way of defining neutrality.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency’s position has been totally impartial. It has nothing to gain and I believe that the whole of this debate should be carried out at European level, without following the conventions of domestic politics. I feel I can say this as the representative of a government which considers the Commission to be important - as guardian - but considers the financial market to be equally as important.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry to see that the group chairman, Mr Poettering, is not in the Chamber. If I am not mistaken, the chairman gave the example of two countries that have shifted their position: Ireland and Portugal. I am sorry to see that Ireland and Portugal, together with France and Germany, and Belgium, Greece and Luxembourg as well, voted in favour of the Commission’s conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">Although he is not present today, I believe that a remark must be made on the position assumed by Mr Junker, who I do not believe thinks differently from the European Union, in the Eurogroup and then in Ecofin. The debate about ‘large’ and ‘small’ countries does not hold water. What we are talking about is a political process.</p>
<p class="contents">Frankly, I do not believe that the Commission has a political monopoly and I do not believe that rules are the same thing as sanctions. Monopolies are not a good thing for the economy, nor are they a good thing legally speaking. Rules can be interpreted in different ways: the Council’s Legal Service interpreted them in one way and the Council interpreted them in another way. The rules provide, not least, for a vote.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not all, though: sanctions are not the whole picture but a part of it and there is more to the rules than just sanctions. In essence, the Council decision can be welcomed in so far as the measures recommended to France and Germany are essentially the same as those proposed by Mr Prodi to the Commission. The substance is the same. The difference does not lie in the procedure: whether the procedure and the sanctions amount to the same thing or whether the procedure can be construed in a different way, the requirement of essential compliance with the Commission’s recommendations remains the same.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that sanctions are essential, but that they are most useful if they do not have to be enforced. Sanctions work well if they do not have to work. Sanctions work well if they serve to bring about extension, prevention and adjustment. This was the case and this is absolutely clear. I do not believe that enforcing the sanctions was our objective; I believe that our objective was to ensure that the rules were respected and this was the case. I do not believe that we would have reached the point of enforcing sanctions, even for a small country. I would never have voted in favour of sanctions on a small country that had, like two large countries, complied with the Commission demands. The sanctions are one part of the rules; they are not all of the rules. The main part of the rules is something else and providing for sanctions is important. Seeing the sanctions work by extending the process is the essential thing. There was total compliance.</p>
<p class="contents">I concluded my speech saying that substance is more important than form, or rather that both are important, but that, up until now, there has been too much focus on one aspect of the procedure, as if it were made up of sanctions alone, and this is not the case. Moreover, there has been no talk about substance. The substance is very simple, and this came out of the debate with political force and intelligence. We are going though a difficult stage in Europe, in which we see a striking correlation between the extent of the problems and the governance capacity. The extent of the problems: two wars in two years, the breakdown of the geopolitical balance in the world, the collapse of the financial markets, unregulated competition created by China, the effects caused – perhaps more than predicted – by the changeover in some countries, local and sectoral crises.</p>
<p class="contents">All this in the face of limited governance capacity. The old Nation States no longer have the instruments for national governance and Europe does not yet have European governance. We do not have wide margins for budgetary policies because there is the Stability and Growth Pact and it is not being challenged. We do not have margins for interest rate policies, which are impartially decided using the constitutional reasoning of the European Central Bank. We cannot establish exchange rate policies because these are decided elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2000, the European economy was doing well, the budgets were in order, the value of the euro was down against the dollar. In 2003, the economy is not doing particularly well, the budgets are not particularly in order and the value of the euro is up against the dollar. I believe that Isaac Newton would have some difficulty in understanding the cause and effect link between these two phenomena.</p>
<p class="contents">We need European governance. I believe that the Constitutional Treaty provides a basis for the development of European governance: I believe that, in the growth plan <span class="bold"> </span>proposed by the Presidency but which has now become a European plan <span class="bold"> </span>Europe has found a beneficial common undertaking in the form of a common economic policy: the first since the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2003, Europe began an extremely intensive cycle of structural reforms. A cycle orchestrated by European reasoning and in a European spirit of structural reforms of the labour market and the welfare state. Reforms extended from Finland, Holland and Germany to Austria, France and Italy. Europe is being renewed, investing in its future and changing growth expectations through a cycle of structural measures and essential structural reforms. I believe that these are the things that we should be discussing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the Brussels glasshouse, this debate about the finer details of the Stability Pact is still going on, whilst normal citizens, at least in my country, the Netherlands, have for a long time been debating something else. Why do the rules we agree on apply to some countries and not to others? What about the rules we will agree on in the new constitutional treaty, on which all Dutch people are allowed to vote in a referendum? In order to gain any credibility, this constitutional treaty will need to contain tough procedures to enforce monetary rules. I am in favour of a much stronger role for the Commission. Countries that are themselves in breach of the rules should be excluded from voting on the assessment of other countries that infringe the same rules. The French and German Governments have opened Pandora's box. This may well serve a short-term interest, but they have lost all credibility as the axis of European cooperation. As such, they carry a heavy responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
