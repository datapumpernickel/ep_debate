<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ferrer (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the increase in poverty, despite the gradual growth of world GDP over recent decades, the current tendency of Member States to reduce the funds intended for official aid to development in favour of direct investment, of which only 1% goes to the least-developed countries – which increases the gulf which separates those countries from the rich or developing countries – and the conviction that the globalisation process may increase the difficulties of the poor countries, are all factors which demonstrate the urgent need to improve the effectiveness of policies on development cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of democracy and respect for human rights we are also very far from the desirable parameters: coups d’états, violence, wars and violations of human rights are still realities in the least-developed countries. We must therefore contribute to correcting this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, it is essential to strengthen the complementarity of policies on development cooperation implemented by the Community and the Member States. Firstly, because complementarity enables us to take advantage of the synergy resulting from a coordinated approach in the actions to be implemented, not only by the European Union but also by all the international donors, which will improve the impact of those actions. Secondly, because it contributes an element of added value to the Member States’ interventions, which will help to optimise the resources destined for development aid and to achieve better results. Thirdly, because it would improve the visibility of the European Union and make its development policy more credible, which will allow it to exert the political influence it deserves as the main provider of funds – let us remember that between half and two thirds of development aid comes from the European Union – and both the NGOs and the recipient countries would like this influence to be greater given that nobody is more sensitive than the European Union in the field of social justice and human development.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, improving complementarity is important because the Treaty on European Union clearly establishes that the Member States and the Community must coordinate their policies on development cooperation and harmonise their aid programmes. That is why we must take a positive view of the Commission’s presentation of the communication on the complementarity of Community and Member States’ policies on development cooperation, since the measures it proposes may contribute to removing the obstacles which hinder significant advances in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">In general terms, it can be said that the Committee on Development and Cooperation, and myself, are in agreement on the broad approach of the document and on the measures it proposes. Nevertheless, I would like to make some specific points. The first is that I consider that the Commission should have taken account of the fact that complementarity is not an isolated element, but should rather be dealt with within a context of a global strategy which also addresses the issues of coordination and coherence, since coherence is inseparable from coordination and complementarity, and, without coordination, complementarity is not possible. Therefore, I believe that, in order to really improve the impact of European development policies and safeguard the credibility of the Union, it would have been much more appropriate and would have made things much clearer if these aspects had been tackled jointly within the framework of the communication on development policy, since that would have better highlighted the essential and inseparable nature of these elements in relation to the formulation of a development policy in accordance with the Union’s objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point relates to the very concept of complementarity, which must not be viewed as a protective principle for preserving the competences of the Member States in this field, but as a manifestation of a political will to unite our efforts to improve and contribute more effectively to implementing the objectives of our policies on development cooperation. Furthermore, the need to ensure the unity, coherence and effectiveness of Union action in the field of external policy – which is also laid down in the Treaty – must extend to development policies, since these are an integral part of the Union’s external action. The Commission should therefore take the initiative and make a qualitative leap in that direction in order to allow the European Union to establish its strategic priorities in the field of development aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I must say that it will be difficult for measures to strengthen complementarity, alone, to achieve the desired results. For that, the political will of the Council must, as a precondition, make progress towards greater integration in the field of cooperation, because what has hindered the progress of complementarity has been above all the fact that the Member States define their development cooperation policies more in accordance with their geo-strategic economic interests and their colonial pasts than with the objectives of the Union in relation to development.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we should repeat that, as well as the operative measures to improve the management of programmes, with which – as I have said – the Committee on Development and Cooperation is in agreement in principle, we believe that the Commission should take the responsibility for reflecting and making proposals, which is an essential requirement if the Union wants to direct aid not only towards promoting the economic growth of the beneficiary countries but also so that that growth will reach all sections of the population, thereby fulfilling its commitment to the development of peoples and, therefore, its commitment to peace, since, without development, peace will always be difficult to attain.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, and to sum up, I would like to reiterate the timeliness of this communication – even though we would have liked it to have been part of a global package – and say how fitting the measures are and that, together with the measures also proposed by the Committee on Development and Cooperation in my report, we hope that they will help to guide our action, providing better operational management. I should repeat once again that the Council must show signs of political will, without which it will be very difficult to make the principle of complementarity a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important that we recognise the role of the EU and the extent of its influence. We demand coherence and coordination. I would similarly like to say how satisfied I am that the importance of the work of NGOs, which work independently of governments, is being acknowledged and taken into account in development cooperation with the express purpose of strengthening civil society as a result of such cooperation. I also think that the recommendation that coordination should take place within the framework of the strategies selected by the target countries themselves is a healthy approach to the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">When we speak of development cooperation, in the same breath it is a salutary exercise to remind ourselves that development cooperation is not an objective in itself. The objective is for the less developed countries to be able to sort out their affairs themselves, take responsibility for their own development, and act as societies in a manner that is just. And instead of hindering these opportunities, we should try to help put things right. </p>
<p class="contents">At EU level, this means, for example, that our policy should not encourage countries to survive on the basis of just one product. Only those countries whose economy is in decent shape can benefit from globalisation. Those developing countries that struggle along on the basis of one product will run into difficulties. At EU level, we must also see to it that our values are reflected in our policy on development cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Conditionality must have its place. Thus, we cannot aid countries that show no interest in their citizens’ human rights or democracy. In other cases we have to confine ourselves just to humanitarian aid. I would also say it was vital that the EU should have a human rights secretary, in the manner of the Ombudsman, whose job would include observing the human rights situation in the less developed countries. At EU level we must really be aware of the political effects of aid, as we already know from experience that aid can be damaging. In fact the risk is considerable. We have to develop the sort of aid that by its nature prevents conflicts, and does not fuel them. Aid must be directed in such a way that it brings benefit to the worst-off of all. Crises caused by environmental problems must be able to be predicted, and aid should not be given in such a way that it stirs up conflict over natural resources. We have to learn to recognise those societies in which the risk of violence is associated with state-induced terror. In channelling aid we have to see to it that it does not prop up undemocratic state structures. Through the conditionality of aid we can prevent corruption and the oppression of certain groups. I know that the issue is not simple and that conditionality is an arduous and cumbersome exercise, but positive conditionality, as it is referred to, can achieve a lot. Experience has shown it. For that reason the EU should not shy away from it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sauquillo Pérez del Arco (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before this debate we would have liked to ask the Council a question on the policy of complementarity. We tried to, but we were unable to. It has not been possible, and we regret this because the truth is, Commissioner, that on this matter you are not alone. There are also the Member States and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I believe that the report which Mrs Ferrer has presented this afternoon is a sound report and, as she too has said, we would have liked to have a joint text. We are dealing with development policy in a piecemeal way and this prevents us from having an overview. Her report can, however, be considered to be an important contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is of an importance which transcends the material scope of development aid policy. As well as being a requirement of the Treaty, complementarity between Community aid policy and that of the Member States, is an invaluable instrument for helping the Union and the Member States to progress along a common path in the field of aid.</p>
<p class="contents">We Socialists believe that development aid policy in general must be the flagship of Community external action and yet there is no such complementarity, apart from a few pilot projects. We are failing to use a mechanism which would to such a large extent maximise the resources, which are becoming scarcer, dedicated to aid as the political result of a joint effort, despite the repeated requests of this Parliament and the repeated resolutions of the Council itself, which basically has ultimate responsibility in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Complementarity is currently expressed in operational coordination on the ground and in the commitology procedure in Brussels. With regard to the former, I have already said that it is only applied in certain pilot projects. As for commitology, I will give you an example of how this is not working either: the Latin America committee has only met twice this year, instead of on a monthly basis which used to be the case and which would be necessary for it to work. Some of the programmes approved by this committee, such as the regional programme for the reconstruction of Central America in relation to Hurricane Mitch, are still to be implemented. There is a clear lack of political will to implement the measures which we decide on in Parliament, and that leads to inefficiency in the achievement of our political objectives, to a gradual paralysis of the functioning of the European institutions and to a bad image which, as the previous speaker said, is sometimes projected to the public. Complementarity with the Member States, coherence between Community policies and coordination between departments must form the basis of development aid policy if this policy is to fulfil this Parliament’s minimum requirements in terms of efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">There are problems with the diversity of instruments and the duplication of procedures, but the real problem is the lack of political will. As has been said before, the States must overcome their individual tendencies – which often reflect their concerns about former colonial relationships or other factors – and commit themselves to a common European project. If we do not adopt this policy, we will not be efficient in terms of development cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission now has the opportunity to include these elements in its reform and the Council has the historic responsibility to involve itself in the definition and implementation of Community policies. Both institutions can rely on the strong support of the Socialist Group in Parliament in relation to development aid policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The policy of complementarity between national and Community policies has a total of 16 players (15+1). Coherence between Community policies and coordination between departments within the Commission are intended to create what we wish to be the Union’s development aid policy, with the aim of improving the efficiency of European aid by helping to optimise the use of resources, both human and financial, and to make the European Union more visible, thereby making it more efficient and giving it a greater presence in the international community. We hope that all of this will be introduced with the reform and that we will have coherent, complementary and coordinated policies in order to achieve greater efficiency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maes (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Ferrer’s report deals with the Commission communication on complementarity between Community and Member State policies on development cooperation. I share her disappointment that we are discussing this in isolation. Instead, we should be having a searching debate on a global strategy for our cooperation with the Southern countries, which involves the triptych of complementarity, coordination and cohesion, also known as the three Cs, where Europe continues to fail so miserably. This, in fact, also goes for the Member States, because the European Member States simply refuse to take these values on board and prefer to stick to their own neo-colonial ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">The lack of efficient Community development cooperation therefore serve the Member States as an excellent alibi for not having to attain complementarity, and certainly not coordination and cohesion. Some Member States make the bold claim that the Community should not adopt development policy but should delegate everything to the Member States. We certainly do not share this view. Anyone who is genuinely concerned about fair-minded world relations in terms of development must admit that, all too often, the Member States’ own strategic and economic interests prevail over development interests. At best, they try to mitigate or alleviate the effects of economic policy pursued by the rich countries in the fields of globalisation, our need for raw materials, minerals, oil, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that we want poor countries to be included in the general economic and cultural developments in the world in the interests of the populations concerned and not only in the interests of the industrialised world. This is why we need to free ourselves from these neo-colonial dynamics and relations which feed dependency and destroy the environment. We need to abolish poverty in the world. This requires a global, multilateral strategy, which, first and foremost relies on the coordination of Member State and Community development policy in every country, in every recipient country and at international level. This is more important than complementarity. There is no doubt that a more coordinated policy would have a far greater impact.</p>
<p class="contents">The contrast between the high level of European aid, which accounts for more than half of all aid globally, and the little political impact, for example upon ending armed conflict and severe violations of human rights, is really poignant. If coordination and complementarity were already in place in the recipient countries, donor countries would prefer to hoist their national flags there too. Is the Council actually prepared to change the system of comitology? This, in my opinion, is a <span class="italic">sine qua non</span>. It will be a real challenge for the Commission to delegate EU responsibilites to our delegations based out there. If this fails, then opponents of the joint development policy are bound to press for abolition full stop.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to coordination at international level, we would welcome a European approach which can be different from that of the IMF and the World Bank. We do not want to be an extension of the Bretton Woods institutions. We want to play a leading role in the world. This is why these Member States should stop telling their electorate that nothing in Europe ever works. It is high time they acknowledged their own share of responsibility for these failures, but we should do the same. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">From this article, it is clear that there is no question of replacing the Member States’ development policy. The EU aid policy is determined by the fifteen Member States and financed by contributions from the Member States, as established in the EU Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">In theory, this is a solid basis for a decisive and clear DC policy, with implementation to match. In practice, however, both leave something to be desired. The payments, for example, pose a problem.</p>
<p class="contents">On the whole, two visions are to be distinguished between in the DC Council: that of the Northern Member States, which consider DC to be a valuable area of policy and which are, by and large, of the opinion that the EU DC is lacking in terms of quality, and that of the Southern Member States which consider DC to be merely an instrument of foreign and economic relations. These discrepancies are marginalised all too easily by the EU in the complementarity and coordination proposed by the rapporteur and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason why the Council and Member States suffer from a lack of ‘political will’, as highlighted by the rapporteur and Commission, can therefore be found in this fundamental difference in approach to development cooperation. This is why at EU level, it is impossible to develop cohesive policy in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Treaty terms the EU’s DC as supplementary to the aid from Member States. In our opinion, this means that the Commission should provide the added value over and above what the Member States can offer, such as granting emergency aid in emergency situations such as natural disasters and wars. Long-term programmes, on the other hand, fare better within bilateral, often historical relations between developing countries and Member States. In any case, the Commission should not act as the sixteenth bilateral donor, which is the case in practice. The European Union could, however, help coordinate Member State aid and intervene if the Member States fail to take any action.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore partly endorse the view that European coordination and complementarity are important, but we do not conclude from that that EU DC coordination adds something to what should be the actual objective, namely coordination which unites all relevant donors, preferably under the guidance of the recipient country or, if this is not possible, under the guidance of the UN or the World Bank. We will take a stance to this effect in the discussion on coordination and complementarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The problem I am referring to is the notable lack of harmony and coordination in development cooperation action and policy between the European Union and its Member States, on the one hand, and between some of the Member States themselves, on the other. What has been described and condemned by many authoritative voices and, in particular, by organisations that work in this area – and also by our own Parliament – is that over the years the different Member States have been acting independently in the field of cooperation, often according to individual national views and interests, sometimes honourable and sometimes less so, but in any event without any significant effort to be coherent and fairly distribute roles, not even in terms of providing mutual information and even less in terms of coordination. To sum up, there has been no effort to act rationally and efficiently so that the available resources, which are always limited, are not wasted and instead yield the best possible results.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, until very recently, the required effort has not been made to reasonably coordinate Community policy in this field with the policies that at the same time were being carried out by the 15 Member States, although this is certainly not exclusive to the area which we are dealing with. It was truly regrettable to see how Community actions were being implemented, sometimes without even an awareness of what each of the Member States was doing in relation to the relevant countries or sectors. The result was, and to a large extent still is, so far, disparate actions, overlapping in many cases, and even the duplication and incompatibility of what each of us is doing. This is absurd and is something of a disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation was naturally unsustainable and was one more problem to resolve, but that need has become all the more blatant and urgent given that the very process of European construction, the reforms and the progress of the Union, are making it essential that we act on the international stage as one country, with one voice, and given that it is an undeniable priority for the viability of our project that we implement a common foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, anything we can do in the field of development policy is but a substantial part of this foreign and security policy. That is what Mrs Ferrer demonstrates, and the heading of her report highlights the key concept of complementarity. This is not the first time we have discussed this issue in Parliament, of course. The faults which we had noted were too obvious not to have been raised in previous debates. Nevertheless, by taking account of a situation which is particularly pressing, but also particularly favourable, we are taking an important step forward and we are doing so at a time when both the Commission and the Council seem convinced that we have to adopt specific measures in order to leave behind the previous situation and produce the coherence which will enable the resources which Europe intends for development cooperation to be more substantial, in both qualitative and quantitative terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in this way, we will achieve for Europe a much more decisive role in the challenge, which is of such concern to us, of creating a fairer, more balanced and therefore more stable world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Junker (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am taking the same line as my predecessors, because, unfortunately, we cannot conceal the fact that the public image of European development cooperation bears no relation to the enormous amount of financial support that the EU itself and its Member States gives to the countries of the south. Although the EU is by far the largest donor, it comes off far worse in terms of people’s perceptions than do the large multilateral organisations, such as the UN and the World Bank. Approximately 60% of all financial aid comes out of the European pot.</p>
<p class="contents">Complementarity, coherence and coordination are the notorious three C’s at the centre of the debate on European development cooperation. The European Commission’s financial housekeeping, which revealed a considerable amount of unspent funds, played no small part in re-igniting the reform debate. Theoretical transactions do little to help our case though. Nor can it be denied that there have been successes that should be shouted from the rooftops. Above all, it is practices that must change, which requires the necessary amount of political will on the part of all those concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Take Mozambique and the deployment of ECHO, for example. Right at the very start of the flood disaster at the beginning of February, ECHO rushed to the aid of the most vulnerable with EUR 750 000. Since then, a further EUR 9.65 million have been made available as emergency aid, and EUR 21 million are to be provided in addition, to deal with the consequences in the medium-term. There was a rapid reaction from the Member States too. The European Union and its Member States have provided a total of EUR 85 million in aid, whereas the UN contribution brought the overall international package to only EUR 115 million, including the European funds.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are lacking is the aforementioned three C’s. Coherence can only be achieved if strategies and measures are brought into line. Complementarity and coordination are important pre-requisites for creating synergy. The juxtaposition of multilateral and bilateral development cooperation, on the other hand – which is in evidence in countries besides Mozambique – leads to completely unnecessary frictional losses, as I saw for myself when I visited the country a few weeks ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Ferrer’s report contains a whole host of proposals and demands that deserve our unqualified support. I would like to highlight three points in particular: complementarity, coherence and coordination must be brought together in one uniform strategy because they are interdependent. The political leaders and the civil society of the partner States must have their decision-making powers strengthened, as must the EU delegation posts in situ, which is already happening with the elaboration of national indicative programmes within the scope of ACP cooperation. This will also require there to be improved cooperation between the delegations of the European Union and the diplomatic services of the Member States, which is a matter for the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to redouble our efforts, in order, not only to further coordination between the EU and the Member States in this sphere, but also with the international bodies. Since we provide the lion’s share of the funding for development cooperation, we are also entitled to clear recognition on the operational front and in terms of public perceptions.</p>
<p class="contents">There have certainly been positive moves in this direction, but they must be developed, and consolidated in a definitive frame of reference. At the same time, we must overcome the burdensome legacy of colonial history, or the geo-strategic interests of individual Member States. The lack of political will on the part of the Member States represents the greatest obstacle to us being able to practise the three C’s satisfactorily, because they have no real interest in efficient, harmonised development cooperation, thereby tarnishing the European image and preventing us from optimising our potential as regards development policy, which reflects badly on the Member States themselves more than anything. Those in the European capitals ought to learn that strengthening Europe’s standing can do the same for their own image. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – I believe that complementarity and EU coordination are among our most important tools for increasing the effectiveness and impact of EU development cooperation on the ground. I therefore welcome Mrs Ferrer’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament and the Commission share the same considerations and agree on the approach. We agree that we now need to see results. We need to increase internal EU coordination, country by country and sector by sector, following the 1998 guidelines on operational coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">We should help partner countries in their efforts and reinforce the role of EU coordination as regards wider global coordination between donors, whether they be the World Bank, United Nations organisations or bilateral governmental or non-governmental organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already taken the first step. We have adopted a harmonised framework for the elaboration of the country strategy papers. We will use this framework in future programming exercises. The country strategy papers will guide us when reviewing our assistance programmes. They will indicate how Community assistance fits in with what other donors are doing.</p>
<p class="contents">These country strategy papers are the first practical tool, not only for improved donor coordination and complementarity, but also for overall coherence of development cooperation policy with other EU policies. The country strategy papers should also steer us in the right direction for achieving an optimum division of labour between the Commission and Member States. Collectively, we should be able to respond to most of the essential needs of partners in the developing countries. The move towards sector-wide programmes will greatly facilitate this process. I also hope it will produce greater cost effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if we are to succeed in this, our Member States must join forces and participate in this exercise. The quantitative aspect of how much each and every Member State is mobilising and putting into this effort is also part of our collective success or collective failure.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me comment on some details of your report. Firstly, I note that at several points in the resolution, the issue of complementarity is placed within a broader framework connected with a need for greater consistency between the various policies of the EU. I agree.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the reason we speak about the policy of the three Cs: complementarity, coherence and coordination. On coherence – which we have often discussed – we have now established the coherence focal point in the Directorate General for Development. It has been operational since the start of this month and we are using it and we would like others to do the same whenever a problem seems to exist concerning coherence.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also mention that today is a big day for coherence in our development policy and trade policy. The Commission, having talked about quota-free or duty-free access for essentially all products from least developed countries; has decided to drop the word “essentially”. From today the Commission has a clear policy. It is now up to the Member States. We are offering, for all products, quota-free, tariff-free access for the least developed countries. This is a very good decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I welcome your wish to strengthen coordination between the Community and the Member States in international forums and at international conferences. We, in the Commission, share your concern. It is paramount that we improve the effectiveness and visibility of the EU at international level. This has been demonstrated at several conferences: we work well together and we represent a constructive progressive force at global level.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been invited to participate in the development committee in the World Bank. No Commissioner has tried that before. Next May we are organising a conference with Unctad, in this Chamber, on the least developed countries and we are also organising a conference with WHO and UNAIDS on 28 September concerning malaria, HIV-AIDS and tuberculosis, the three major communicable diseases. We also work well with our partners at multilateral level.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, specifically relating to the recommendations of the motion for a resolution, I welcome your support especially on two essential issues: firstly, human resources and, secondly, the role of management committees in development cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The lack of human resources is a serious and real problem that for too long has been ignored. It has come back to haunt us and now requires action. We are continuing our efforts at the Commission to improve the effectiveness of our services. We are radically changing how we do things but this is not enough. We also need the human resources to match our programme resources and ambitions. Your support here will be crucial when the budgetary decisions have to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Member State committees that work in parallel with the Commission in the management and implementation of the development programmes, we believe that their key role should be to discuss political priorities and overall strategy with us. It should not be to micromanage the process or examine individual projects as is, unfortunately, still the case. We need to find more effective ways of working together. The support of Parliament is also vital.</p>
<p class="contents">It was said in the discussion here that some Member States want to dismantle what we do collectively. I do not think this is the case. In any case, Member States warmly welcomed the overall policy statement which is the basis for what we do. We also have a clear commitment on the ninth EDF and the financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">Compared with any other major worldwide donors, the Commission – and what we do together in Europe – is backed financially in a much more predictable and solid way. This also puts a heavy responsibility on our shoulders but, the basis is that we are not only the biggest but also the most predictable and stable donor to work with.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to thank the rapporteur again for her excellent work. This is a very useful report and I am determined to move forward on complementarity and will use the new tools available: the country strategy papers, the new and improved programming systems and a more effective management of external assistance, which also includes greater responsibility for our delegations in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I am confident that the European Parliament will provide us with the necessary support in these endeavours. I look forward to continuing to work with you in an open and constructive manner. The reform process is now moving. We know what kind of battles to fight and, with your support, we are also going to win them.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we can be proud that we are doing all this and, hopefully, tomorrow we will also have reason to be proud of how we are doing it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
