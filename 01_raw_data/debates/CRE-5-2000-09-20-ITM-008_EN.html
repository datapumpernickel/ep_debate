<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Evans, Jonathan (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, perhaps I can begin by saying the introduction of the title of our debate no doubt had many <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> journalists salivating, but the issues that we are considering are fundamental issues that go to the heart of what the European Union is all about. That is the development of a true, single market; because if we were able to achieve a true, single market, not only might we find more unanimity within this Chamber, but we should be well on the way to serving our constituents by ensuring that we achieve real economic progress in Europe. Therefore, this particular piece of legislation falls within that context.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of ways in which competition policy is important in driving this agenda forward. The Commissioner, and I congratulate him for it, has seized the initiative in terms of the application of state-aid policy; we will be debating that in the second session in Strasbourg in connection with another report which I am currently taking before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. The other major area that Commissioner Monti has been busy with is the modernisation of competition policy itself. We are awaiting the outcome of the Commissioner’s review of over 100 responses to his White Paper on the reform of restrictive trade practices and the abuse of market power. Earlier today I heard that we may receive the result before the end of this month; perhaps we will hear more from the Commissioner about that in due course.</p>
<p class="contents">The reform that we are looking at, according to the Commission itself, forms part of the overall agenda of reform. Within that context, I want to say to the Commissioner that business is looking for a number of things. It is certainly looking for the things that the Commission was seeking consultees from about whether the current regulations have become too legalistic, too bureaucratic and could be simplified. I have no doubt that the Commissioner’s proposals will achieve that simplification. Business is looking for the development of confidence in the whole range of new mechanisms which the Commissioner is seeking to bring forward as part of its overall reform package. I would therefore ask the Commission how he sees this specific reform, which is not controversial, in the context of his wider reform of competition policy which, as he well knows, might be generously said to be slightly more controversial.</p>
<p class="contents">May I turn to some of the detailed areas in the particular proposals that the Commission has asked Parliament to comment upon. Firstly, I welcome this process. The Commissioner is inviting Parliament to express its views in relation to the paper that was produced in April of this year. In essence there are a number of areas where, having agreed with the thrust of the reform being taken forward, I feel that the Commission might give the matter further thought. Firstly, I would like the Commissioner to explain why there is a contrast between the treatment of horizontal restraints and vertical restraints. I would like the Commissioner to indicate whether, in due course, it is his intention to see further exemption categories specified in the legislation. I have indicated that businesses are strongly of the view that the duration of exemption in the cases of research and development should be expanded up to a period of ten years. Since the Commission’s own papers make it clear that horizontal cooperation agreements are generally not made in order to work against the interests of consumers, I would be grateful to see what the Commissioner’s response is in that particular area.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also be grateful to have clarification of the position regarding trade supplies, not least because that is an issue that troubles Mr Berenguer Fuster. I know he has tabled amendments in relation to that.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly concerned to ensure that we take all steps to avoid a re-nationalisation of EU competition law and I would be grateful to hear what reassurances we can have from the Commissioner in that area.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, business would prefer a lengthier transition period; they would also prefer the Commission to look at more than just the market share in assessing market power. For these purposes what the Commission proposes may be appropriate, but deciding market power solely by assessing market share is too inexact a science. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karas (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Evans warmly for his report, and also for his statement just now, which has already placed this report and the Commission’s statement in the wider context of the necessary reform of competition policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We know how rapidly the world economy is changing and so we are also aware of the increasing importance of research and development, the value of cooperation between companies, and the need for companies to specialise, and hence also the need for specialisation agreements. Competition is not an end in itself, as far as we are concerned, it is a means of achieving growth and employment, and if, like the Commissioner and ourselves, you champion a functioning single market organised along the lines of the social market economy, you do not favour unlimited competition, but competition governed by the necessary principles of political organisation, keeping in mind that we have a responsibility towards the future and our fellow human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">The point has already been made today that these are very welcome reforms, that there is a need for companies to work together, and that the statement affords companies greater freedom as regards their cooperation agreements, and will allow for simplification, flexibilisation and liberalisation. That is what we have on the plus side. We are also critical of some aspects, and there are certain things we would like to see. The rapporteur touched on some of them, and I would like to explore them again. Firstly, Commissioner, we believe that, in view of increasing autonomy, the people hanker after legal certainty. I therefore ask myself whether treating horizontal restraints and vertical restraints differently will really lead to greater legal certainty, or whether it would not be better for both, to have a block exemption regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is our wish that the exploitation of the results should not be restricted to five years, but should be extended to ten. We urge you to make it perfectly clear, by including them in the guidelines, that reciprocal, or unilateral agreements on supply – ‘trade supplies’ for short – are not affected by the ban laid down in Article 81(2), and we take the view – which is also expressed in the report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs – that you ought to consider the definition of market share. Which market do we mean? The buying market, the selling market, the national market, the regional market? We all know that the market is in a constant state of flux for the businesses concerned, and we also fear that guidelines 122 and 141 will set an arbitrary market power threshold of 15%. We feel it is important to increase this threshold, just as we believe that the length of the transitional period for introduction of these regulations should be increased to at least two years, so that your aspirations are fully realised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berenguer Fuster (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate Mr Evans on his wonderful report and point out once again the large extent to which we have agreed on analysing the reforms of Community competition law as a whole, as well as the social consequences of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the great beneficiaries of an appropriate competition policy are the consumers, the citizens as a whole. We should not see this regulation as something that exclusively concerns companies; it is of interest to all of us as citizens. We also agree on our positive assessment of the Commission’s attempts to modernise and reform Community competition law.</p>
<p class="contents">We must congratulate Mr Monti and the whole of the Commission on having the courage and bravery to complete a reform – which the Commission is determined to do – a reform that was started years ago. I have said in other interventions that, in my opinion, it is not only necessary but also takes us in the right direction. The Commission’s chosen path is the right one.</p>
<p class="contents">Having been in force for 40 years, Community competition law had begun to show signs of exhaustion. There is no doubt whatsoever that the competition rules included in the Treaty, and in the law derived from it, have contributed significantly to the growth of a culture of competition, and have been fundamental to the creation of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the Commission’s decisions and the judgments of the Court of Justice have enjoyed well-earned prestige in terms of achieving this aim. We must not forget, however, that those rules were initially alien to European law. The European legal tradition, especially the continental tradition, concentrated more on aspects relating to unfair competition; the free competition elements were imported from the United States. A Spanish business academic – Professor Garrigues – explained very graphically that the American soldiers who came to Europe to fight in the Second World War brought ‘antitrust’ legislation in their rucksacks. Now, those positive aspects could not disguise certain deficiencies which had traditionally been demonstrated by the experts. Perhaps the best-founded criticism referred to the rigidity of the rules. It is true that it was perhaps necessary at the beginning to apply the rules so rigidly, because new rules had to be applied, imported from the United States, in accordance with the continental legal tradition.</p>
<p class="contents">I must add here that it is no surprise that Mr Evans’ assessment and concern does not coincide exactly with that of his colleague in the Group of the European People’s Party, Mr Karas. Mr Evans is behaving more like an Anglo-Saxon lawyer, while Mr Karas has demonstrated the usual preoccupations of continental lawyers. I believe that this reform is more along the lines of Anglo-Saxon law and, despite being a continental lawyer, I agree with it. I am not so concerned about legal certainty as some people.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, it is true that what was acceptable twenty or thirty years ago is not necessarily acceptable today. Today, the single market is a reality and the culture of competition is sufficiently widespread. Change was therefore necessary. It is no longer possible to apply competition rules which do not take account of the economic analysis and a consideration of the market’s power.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of vertical restrictions, the new regulations on exemption by category and the guidelines for their application have been approved. The time has now come to introduce reform in the field of horizontal restrictions. In this area, the Commission is now presenting us with two proposals for regulations, one on research and development agreements, and the other on the regulation of specialisation agreements, accompanied by guidelines. It should be noted, as the report does, that there is now an noticeable difference with regard to the treatment of vertical and horizontal restrictions since, in the case of vertical restrictions, there was a single regulation and guidelines which covered all the possibilities to which that regulation applied. With regard to horizontal restrictions, however, there are guidelines which are, to a large extent, broader than the two specific aspects regulated by the two proposals for regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Party of European Socialists has presented Parliament with five amendments which express some of our concerns. Of these, I would draw your attention to our concern at the fact that crisis cartels are not dealt with. They were included in the previous legislation and have disappeared here without sufficient justification. I would therefore ask you to vote in favour of these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, ladies and gentlemen, as a result of the reform, the Commission will be able to focus on tackling the conduct of those who hold power in the market, because it is that conduct which is genuinely anti-competitive and damaging to the market. I repeat that in this sense we are in agreement. It seems that we will finally be able to say goodbye to an over-rigorous and over-formal approach and welcome economic analysis into European competition law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It would therefore appear that the Commission has a keener sense of fair trading than the European Parliament, despite the fact that, logically-speaking, the opposite should apply. It is the European Parliament which should be more sensitive to the social impact of competition policy. Especially as, even though we have the most stringent fair trading legislation, the real world in which we live is a world in which large monopolies abuse dominant market positions, in which mergers, take-overs and acquisitions by corporate behemoths are a daily occurrence, giving rise to monopolies of global proportions which almost always lay off thousands of workers and have a huge impact on employment and which then monopolise wealth-producing resources, markets and consumers. It is precisely because the real world is thus that we should be more careful and stricter when it comes to ensuring that horizontal cooperation agreements are treated and controlled in the same manner as mergers and vertical restraints.</p>
<p class="contents">This being so, we are unable to vote in favour of the proposals calling for policy restrictions to be relaxed, as proposed by the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to express the Commission’s appreciation of Parliament’s consistently constructive attitude to competition issues, which we consider to be an important tool in the framework of the social market economy to which Mr Karas referred, the ultimate aim of which, as Mr Berenguer Fuster stressed, is to protect the consumer. Mr Berenguer has also grasped perfectly the line which the Commission intends to take, which is to focus more on economic analysis in developing competition policy, but, at the same time, as Mr Karas, Mr Evans and others have requested, we are endeavouring to provide the greatest possible legal certainty for businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s debate concerns a major aspect of our attempts to modernise competition policy. On the one hand, the Commission has drawn up a revised version of the block exemption regulations on research and development and specialisation agreements, and, on the other hand, it has prepared draft guidelines on the applicability of article 81 to horizontal cooperation agreements. In this way, it is the Commission’s intention to codify the relevant case law and working practice as they have developed on the basis the evaluation of individual cases over all these years, without making any major changes to the criteria for evaluating horizontal cooperation agreements on the basis of Community law. These documents are therefore intended to clarify the criteria used to implement competition policy in this field, certainly not to alter them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress this aspect, because there has been some criticism of the Commission’s proposal that it is masking a thorough revision of the line taken regarding the horizontal cooperation agreements. These allegations are completely unfounded. It is generally understood that agreements signed between competitors are likely to restrict competition to a much greater degree than other types of agreement. This is certainly the case where agreements between competitors are intended to set prices, divide up the market or limit production. We are certainly not attempting to make anybody think that horizontal agreements, which have severely negative implications for competition, will in the future be regulated less rigorously. However, in the absence of basic restrictions, it is necessary for the agreements to be examined in their economic context, so that it can be ascertained whether they would have a negative effect on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, clearly a need to update and clarify the regulations on horizontal agreements for two fundamental reasons: firstly, because these regulations represent a response to the present economic reality, for businesses have to react to increasing pressure from competition and adapt to a market which is in a constant state of flux. Cooperation can often be a way to share risks, save on expenditure, pool expertise and speed up the launching of innovations onto the market. It is an important tool, particularly for small- and medium-sized businesses. Consumers will benefit from these economic advantages, but only if effective competition is maintained on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second reason for revising the legislation in this area is the fact that clarification of the norms is essential for the success of our undertaking to modernise competition policy, an undertaking whose scope the rapporteur, Mr Evans, has grasped fully, and for this I am grateful to him, as I am for his reference to state aid, which is another, no less important element of competition policy. The line taken is similar to that recently adopted on vertical agreements, and primarily responds to two objectives: preventing the Directorate-General for Competition having to examine cases which have no bearing on competition policy, and enabling the businesses themselves to establish whether or not an agreement would restrict competition and whether it would be eligible for an exemption.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft resolution shows that Parliament supports the aims of the reform. The questions raised by you and others contain extremely valuable suggestions. I am now, already, able to inform you that I intend to incorporate the majority of these suggestions. I shall, in particular, recommend to the Commission that it adheres to your opinion on three major points in respect of the block exemption regulations. Firstly, the maximum duration of the exemption for research and development agreements should be extended beyond the current limit of five years. However, a compromise does need to be reached between the businesses’ interests in exploiting the results of their own research and the public interest, in guaranteeing competition on the new markets. I shall therefore propose to limit the duration of the exemption not to ten but to seven years.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the restrictions concerning the possibility of parties exploiting the results of research and development projects carried out jointly should be as few as possible, in order to encourage the movement of knowledge, which is instrumental in both technical and economic progress. I shall therefore propose, on the basis of your comments, that, as a rule, these restrictions be allowed to intervene only where they are to be applied to businesses which are not in direct competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the transitional period should be extended. In this we can take the block exemption regulations on vertical agreements as an example and set a period of 18 months. Then, with regard to the guidelines, we will certainly be able to comply with your request to operate a clearer distinction between the guidelines for horizontal agreements and those for vertical agreements, and to be clearer in our handling of industrial supply agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission intends to adopt the definitive version of the block exemption regulations and guidelines before the end of the year. This would avoid a legal gap forming after the current regulations expire, but it would also contribute considerably to keeping Community policy up to date.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this debate has touched on a number of other important, interesting points. I do not have the time to comment on all of them, but I would just like to make a couple of observations. Mr Theonas, you raised the question of mergers. The care with which the Commission has exercised its powers in the area of merger control cannot have escaped you. As we are required to do by the regulation, we are adhering rigorously to the criterion of prohibiting mergers where they would lead to the creation or consolidation of a dominant position. Often, this is not the case – there is no danger of it happening – partly because the businesses are aware of this requirement and propose remedies which can, on occasions, be extremely effective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Evans raised the question of trade supplies. I agree that the treatment of industrial supply agreements needs to be elaborated in the guidelines. This will be done in the chapter on production agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Crisis cartels, Mr Berenguer, aim directly at reducing output and raising prices; they therefore always have a restrictive effect on competition. That does not exclude the possibility of such cartels being exempt under Article 81(3). It would, however, only be possible after an individual examination of the case and the merits of the agreement. That is why it would be inappropriate to include these agreements in the guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, how does this all fit into the broader modernisation effort? First of all I can confirm to Mr Evans that I expect the Commission to be able to adopt a proposal for a regulation to reform Regulation 17 of 1962 before the end of this month. That reform involves the elimination of the notification system.</p>
<p class="contents">This, however, Mr Karas, should not reduce the legal certainty for companies. In order to ensure this, the Commission is clarifying its present substantive rules. We have already done so for distribution – vertical agreements – and we are now doing it for horizontal agreements. Our block exemption regulations and notices will give companies more certainty on the contents of our rules and in self-assessing their agreements in the spirit of an overall modernisation effort. This cannot be considered a renationalisation of competition policy but, more than in the past, it will benefit from the cooperation of the national in the cooperation of the national competition authorities and the national courts in the general effort of applying EC competition rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
