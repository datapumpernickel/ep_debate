The European Parliament took responsibility for producing this report on the effects of globalisation on female immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">Emigration is an ancient phenomenon but it has recently taken on some new characteristics. It is not only men who emigrate, with the women then using regrouping to later reunite their children with the husband, but rather the woman herself is now the emigrant. The woman is the head of the family and it is she who seeks, by changing country, by coming to the European Union, a better personal situation, a better future for herself and her family. The woman comes as a person seeking opportunities that are not available in her country of origin. In general, she works in the service sector, she does not have a high level of training and she finds herself in a vulnerable situation as a result of being both an immigrant and a woman. She usually does work which the nationals of the various countries do not want, but which are necessary for the economy to operate properly. Recently, female immigrants have also been important for maintaining jobs, for bolstering the active population, given the ageing of the population in certain Member States, and for future prospects.</p>
<p class="contents">These women do not come temporarily in order to resolve a problem, but they come determined to stay, to start a new life in a country which they believe is going to accept them. In the majority of cases they come without sufficient information. They have often been deceived and are victims of mafias that traffic in human beings, from which they are unable to escape, in many cases ending up in prostitution.</p>
<p class="contents">This lack of information is one of the most important aspects that we highlight in this report. These women must be aware of the state of the job market, the legal requirements, what their living conditions will be and what they must provide in order to work legally in the country they are heading for.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also cases of highly qualified women who have to do work which is not appropriate for their training. There are situations of abuse, resulting from their state of vulnerability in a country with whose language and legislation they are not familiar, living isolated in a world which is difficult for them.</p>
<p class="contents">We want these women to live in a legal situation with decent employment contracts so that they cannot become victims of exploitation. This means that they must be provided with greater information in their countries of origin. We therefore call for offices to be set up in order to resolve these problems so that these women may come fully informed about the work they are going to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I must point out that in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, certain amendments have been introduced into the report which neither I, as rapporteur, nor my group, agree with. They refer to the concept of ‘Euro-Mediterranean citizenship’. This concept raises legal problems. There is no precedent for this concept in any report or any declaration either by this Parliament or by the national parliaments. Citizenship is a national competence of the Member States and I believe that introducing this concept into the report adds little and could, in fact, create legal problems.</p>
<p class="contents">We have therefore requested a split vote because we would like to remove this concept from the report so that we can support it without problems. If it is retained, I think it will be very difficult for us to vote in favour of the report, which would be unfortunate since the report has some very positive aspects for women and is greatly needed given the situation in which the majority of these women find themselves. I would like to ask you to reconsider so that, by removing these terms, we can have a report which is approved by the whole House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My congratulations are sincere because she has been able to deal in a full and balanced way with the consequences which globalisation have had on the world of immigration, specifically for women and in particular for women from the southern region of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the rapporteur has sought to produce a balanced text, which is necessary and possible, which reflects the differing views and sensibilities, while avoiding extremist and dogmatic positions, and a text which reflects the diverse opinions and the seriousness of the situation. Of course, globalisation is not a panacea for all evils. Globalisation does not necessarily mean well-being and wealth and, in many cases, it is or could be a source of inequality and greater poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Amsterdam established for the first time the Union’s competence in the field of immigration and asylum, and the Tampere European Council agreed that the issues of asylum and immigration, which are different but closely related, make a European Union common policy necessary. This means that we need to evaluate present and future migratory flows in all their categories: humanitarian reasons, family reunification and economic reasons, as the rapporteur already mentioned, and demographic changes, the situation of the labour market and of the immigrants’ countries of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">In political terms, I believe that we must choose between continuing to hold the view that the Union can continue to resist migratory pressures or accepting that immigration is going to continue and must be adequately regulated, working together to maximise the positive effects of immigration, both for the Union and for the immigrants themselves and for their countries of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is clearly more critical in the case of female migrants. They are more vulnerable to abusive practices. We must, therefore, accept any initiative which may make us reflect on this issue. Such matters include the demographic structure of each country of the Union as a whole, demographic development, the origin of existing immigrants in the European Union, jobs which they carry out in the place of others – in other words, domestic work done by immigrants allows women from the receiving country to work outside the home – marginalisation, prostitution and living and working conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this must be considered within a balanced framework of rights and obligations for all nationals of third countries resident in the Union. I therefore believe – and I appeal to the generosity required by the seriousness and the exacting nature of the issue – that it would be good to remove concepts such as ‘Euro-Mediterranean citizenship’, which I believe create confusion and in my view are exclusive. The Mediterranean, the birthplace of civilisations and culture, must be a factor for integration and not for exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that we must support action to integrate women and to provide them with dignity, and we must not forget that in many countries they are still not even considered to be citizens. A broad consensus will no doubt give our demands and our actions more force. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Napoletano (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, I feel that we should make the purposes of this report that we are discussing much clearer than is achieved by its entry on the agenda. I do not know how many Members are aware that a Euro-Mediterranean Forum for women Members of Parliament is to start tomorrow. This forum was not the result of a European Parliament initiative. This is the second year it has been staged: the first took place last year in Naples on the initiative of the national parliaments. Parliament did not take part at all precisely because the forum was not the result of consultation between the European and national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, the – in my opinion, wise – decision has been taken to participate in this assembly through the appointment of two representatives – Mrs Avilés and myself – as part of the Presidency bureau and of four Parliamentary representatives to attend the plenary forum. It was decided by the forum bureau<span class="bold"> </span>to give the women from the European Parliament the subject of 'Globalisation, migration and citizenship': this is the title of our contribution and also of the contribution of the speakers from Tunisia, for the reports expound two different viewpoints.</p>
<p class="contents">To be honest, I do not know whether it was wise to base a procedure involving a plenary vote on our contribution, a contribution which will have to be somewhat freer than a simple report. This has caused problems: in fact, in tackling the subject of migration and, to a lesser degree, citizenship, we have raised problems for the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market – problems which I can understand – and some incomprehension within the groups, since this concept of Euro-Mediterranean citizenship is not a legal concept. I should like to banish totally the suspicion that we might be discussing something which would then require formalisation. We know how difficult we are finding it already to advance a meaningful debate on, for example, the idea of coordinating migration and creating a migration policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we have begun to tackle the political and cultural concept of Euro-Mediterranean citizenship, for example in the Parliamentary Forum held a few weeks ago in Brussels. What is the purpose of this initiative? To enable us, within the partnership that we have initiated with these countries, to build a relationship on democracy issues, on respect for human rights, on the tendency of certain forms of progress in those societies linked to a concept of integration based on shared values. In my opinion, it is possible to meet this challenge and it will provide us with the opportunity to tackle, together with them, for example, the issue of respect for human rights – a recurring subject in our relationship with these countries about which there is always a hint of interference in their internal affairs – on fresh, equal ground, which will challenge those societies – but also our own – where, for example, the issue of migration poses cultural problems and problems of integration and convergence.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore appeal to the rapporteur. If she insists on there being a vote in Parliament, I am afraid there is a danger that this report may not be adopted. I suggest that we leave it as a contribution of the Committee on Women's Rights. A contribution which will not implicate Parliament as an instrument which we will be able to invoke, which will allow us to be freer in the forthcoming debate in Malta and which will not be binding upon this House. I would ask you sincerely to consider this option. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sanders-ten Holte (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL) </span>Mr President, let me begin by saying that it is in itself a good thing that the rapporteur should focus attention on the problem of the consequences of globalisation for female immigrants. However, I have some misgivings, because what is the purpose of this report? The previous speaker made this point. Does it contribute to the finding of work, and if so, how? The problems are certainly not limited to women from Mediterranean countries. Women from other parts of the world often have to contend with the same problems. In addition, it is not the case that the European Parliament has not concerned itself with these problems before. I think, for example, of the reports on trafficking in women and the communication from the Commission on a Community-wide immigration policy, which will shortly be discussed in various committees in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">My group therefore considers that this report is, in fact, too immature and too superficial to provide a substantial contribution to the discussion. There are also a number of shortcomings in this report. I shall mention a few.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally we agree with gender mainstreaming in this field, but I have problems with the text: in Section 15, the Dutch version speaks of the “channelling of migratory flows to Europe”, while the English text refers to “quotas of migratory flows”. Channelling migratory flows is just about acceptable to my group, but the introduction of quotas is definitely not.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point. Internally the European Union has still not solved the problem of the recognition of each other’s national professional qualifications and titles. That is, of course, crucial to this problem group, which is why, during the discussion in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, the Liberals invited Member States – also in the context of immigration from Mediterranean countries (and, in fact, from all countries) – to recognise professional qualifications and titles. But I find the proposal contained in the report to set up, especially for immigrants, an information office on domestic services, very odd. It sounds very limited. Surely it is not just a matter of cheap domestic help?</p>
<p class="contents">A third point. The report talks of Euro-Mediterranean citizenship. Does such a thing exist? Will we have Euro-ACP citizenship or Euro-Mercosur citizenship? Because the European Union has entered into treaties with these countries too. And what kind of status will such a citizen have? A higher status, or a lower one? Such a measure might well lead to discrimination. And I could go on.</p>
<p class="contents">My group therefore concludes that while it is in itself useful for the problems of women immigrants to be highlighted, this has been done previously and better. This report is too superficial, too one-sided and bears the marks of a one-sided approach to a very vulnerable group. As a result, my group finds itself obliged, despite the improvement introduced by us, to withhold its support from this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also hope that the Bureau and all the political groups are aware of the fact that the numbering of the recitals and the paragraphs in the report differ from one language version to another, which means that, in a possible vote in the plenary sitting tomorrow, it will be incredibly difficult to know what we are voting on.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the actual content of the report, I do not think that the consequences of globalisation for women should be dealt with on the basis of the demands made by an ageing population upon the EU. Humanly speaking, that is the wrong end at which to begin. I am sympathetic to Mrs Avilés Perea’s personal views on the issues of refugees, asylum seekers and immigrants. I completely share the view that they must be accorded human rights, but the report as a whole does not attach enough importance to these issues. We cannot therefore vote in favour of the report in a possible vote to be held in the plenary sitting tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also appeal to Mrs Avilés Perea to withdraw the report and to take on board the discussions in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, together with the outcome of the vote taken in that Committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In any case, I feel that a text adopted in Parliament would provide the representatives of the European Parliament with a mandate which may well, so to speak, be less free but more representative: it would be up to the representatives of this House to strike a wise balance between these two criteria. I see that the matter has already been the subject of debate and even argument, so I will leave it there. I hope that those who have spoken on the subject will be able to come to an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I have taken the floor merely to express my satisfaction at a couple of points which have been expressed extremely clearly in this report, which the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which is more directly concerned with migration issues, has hitherto not succeeded in expressing so clearly. I refer, in particular, to the part of the report which "Stresses the link between unwarranted barriers to immigration and trafficking in human beings, particularly women; ... and<span class="bold"> </span>calls on the Member States to improve and amend their national laws on work permits and regularisation of immigrants".</p>
<p class="contents">This point, which is expressed so succinctly, simply and clearly, appears to be the root of the problem, the tensions and the negative effects of prohibitionist migration laws, which, I feel, work entirely to the detriment of women migrating to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point which I strongly welcome and which has never been expressed so clearly by another competent committee, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, concerns the issue of work. Indeed, the report "Calls upon Member States to legalise and accord an appropriate legal status<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>to service sector jobs, which are widely filled by immigrant women". I would add, also to legalise in terms of deregulation, for here, too, the regulations are rigid and bureaucratic in granting permits and in defining those forms of work; they are constraints which are wholly inappropriate in Europe today, which drive immigrant women, in particular, to marginalisation and illegal activities. We therefore welcome these two points. </p>
<p class="contents">However, I am much less enthusiastic about the proposal regarding a new observatory. In my opinion, the experiment of European Union observatories should be fully analysed. I see these experiments as extremely negative attempts at creating bureaucratic machinery which is extremely ineffective in achieving its established goals of provision of information and awareness raising, as, moreover, are the awareness campaigns themselves. I would have much more confidence in rules which bring about deregulation but also grant much greater freedoms and rights to immigrant women rather than attempting to replace consensus on policies with awareness campaigns. I have much more faith in rules which guarantee rights and freedoms than in investment in awareness campaigns.</p>
<p class="contents">The same may be said of the issue of citizenship. In my opinion, when we have recourse to a term such as 'citizenship', either we have to define clear legal statuses, rights with corresponding duties, rights, therefore, which guarantee the new freedoms, or else the term will be likely to cause confusion.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what I wanted to say on the report under consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, two points must certainly be stressed, which have emerged both from the debate which took place in committee and from a series of majority votes which have contributed to creating or fostering the presence of certain positions within the report which I feel are questionable.</p>
<p class="contents">I will therefore divide the report into two parts: a first part, which I totally endorse, in which the rapporteur extremely courageously raises a major question of legality, managing to pre-empt to some extent in this report the need, which is present in all the European States, to tackle the issue of migration as a whole once and for all, in the knowledge now that the countries of the Union cannot have differing individual policies in such a problematic, sensitive field, and defining the rights and responsibilities of both the immigrants and the host countries. At the same time, within this policy, the role of the most vulnerable groups – women and children – must certainly be analysed extremely carefully. From this point of view, this aspect of the report is very useful, particularly in that it includes certain guidelines and decisions already expressed by the Tampere Council.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would express my concern essentially on two points. I, too, find it difficult to endorse either the creation of another observatory – for, in my opinion, observatories lead to rigidity and problems – or the use of the term 'European,' or even 'Euro-Mediterranean citizenship', which has absolutely no legal status and would cause confusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The way in which they do so depends mainly on their constitution and political institutions. Despite some progress in the treatment of women in paid employment and in implementing equal treatment boundaries throughout Europe, sexual inequality persists. The main aspects are correctly presented in the report. This applies to the description of the situation of self-employed women, to gender-specific wage differentials and to differences in types of employment and unpaid work.</p>
<p class="contents">These economic ups and downs have serious consequences on the standard of living of individual families, most of the responsibility for which is shouldered by women. As 8 March approaches, we need to get the point across that a person's achievements count for more than his or her sex. Domestic violence and stereotypes, not to mention mediaeval perceptions of a woman's place, should be consigned to the past once and for all. I want a Europe with one culture, where the dignity of men and women and of foreigners and immigrants is an asset, not an economic burden. The report considers that all is not well here.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the number of immigrants is rising, begging the conclusion that it really is time to create optimum conditions in the European Union, otherwise conflicts may intensify. The report should cover these tasks more amply. I would remind you that enlargement to the East is imminent, bringing with it many women with different traditions and different cultures who need to be attended to, not sidelined. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is important to bear in mind when we discuss the problems of immigrant women in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that zero immigration is neither realistic nor justified. The policy has never been fully implemented, not only because of the legitimate need for family reunification, but also for economic reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">In the future, demographic factors – the ageing of our workforce and population as a whole – are likely to make immigration more, rather than less, necessary and understood. In this process we have to prevent gender-based discriminatory practices. The promotion of proactive gender equality is very necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">In its communication on a Community immigration policy presented on 22 November last year, the Commission stated that, in the short term, immigration can be an important element of population growth and could accompany other responses to demographic change. It will not in itself be an effective way of dealing with labour market imbalances, but can help alleviate skills shortages within the context of an overall structural strategy. Migrants, including women migrants, may have a particular role to play in some of the areas particularly affected by the increase in the number of older people, while legal migrants, the majority of whom will be of working age, will play a part in reducing the financial burden of the elderly on the population of working age.</p>
<p class="contents">In December 1999, the Commission launched a draft directive on the right of family reunification which, among other matters, gives family members the right to immediate access to education, vocational training and employment. The next steps will be the presentation of a draft directive on the status of long-term residents and a proposal on the admission of third-country nationals for the purpose of employment and self-employed activities and for the purpose of study on the territory of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Amsterdam explicitly includes gender equality among the objectives of the European Community. This applies to our domestic, as well as external, policies. In addition, there are several political decisions which explicitly call for gender-equality concerns to be acted upon in development cooperation. In order to strengthen the promotion of gender equality as an issue which affects all policies, programmes and projects, I will, in the near future, present to the college a programme of action for the mainstreaming of gender-equality development cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The trafficking in human beings is facilitated by globalisation and by modern technologies. Trafficking in human beings, and in particular girls and women, not only involves sexual exploitation, but also labour exploitation in conditions akin to slavery.</p>
<p class="contents">The traditional flow between certain Third World regions and Western destinations continues. What gives rise to even greater concern is the increase in the numbers of women and children trafficked into the EU from Central and Eastern European countries. The Commission has taken significant steps against this violation of human rights. Freedom from discrimination is a basic human right, be it on the grounds of nationality, sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. That is why the Commission very much welcomes that the Treaty of Amsterdam gives the Community powers to combat discrimination on all these grounds under Article 13. The promotion and protection of human rights is an integral part of the EU’s human rights policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Immigrant women are particularly vulnerable to discrimination and social exclusion. The employment strategy and the social funds are both designed to combat discrimination and secure inclusion in society. Two directives recently adopted deal with discrimination, one related to employment and the other to racial discrimination. Both integrate the gender perspective and the programme will support transitional activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the position of women in the labour market, let me recall that the Community’s employment strategy with its priorities of employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities is about supporting Member States’ efforts to introduce structural reforms into their employment, social protection and taxation systems. This is a matter of equality. It is also a matter of replacing discrimination with the economic good sense of engaging the enterprise and creativity of all those who need and want to work. This requires our social model to be reformed to engage all our people, both women and men, in an inclusive economic and social Europe with equal access to opportunity, skills, personal development and the support this implies. The European Structural Funds play a major role in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">To secure the rights of immigrant women is now fundamentally about good governance on the basis of shared values in a changing world for both sexes. It is about tolerance, modernisation and improvement of the various tools of policy. It is also about democracy and solidarity. Equal representation is a key issue here. The participation of women in political and civil life is fundamental to good governance, whether in Europe or elsewhere. Women’s voices are still not being heard sufficiently in major policy areas. Structural changes are required to make them more audible. Institution-building to meet the challenges of globalisation must be accompanied by equal and shared participation of women in the political process. Many of these things are well-known, well-established challenges. Hopefully the new thing we can do is to face those challenges with a more rigorous will to do what is politically needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
