Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste resulted in a reduction of the environmental effects associated with packaging and packaging waste, particularly because more waste was collected, recycled and recovered.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, packaging is recycled all over Europe and no longer only in central and northern European countries. No Member State has failed to achieve the minimum targets for recycling for 2001 as early as 1998. This proposal is intended to lay down new targets for recycling and for recovery as a whole, significantly higher than those envisaged in the current version of the Packaging Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal more than doubles the minimum target for recycling by fixing it at 55%, and raises the minimum target for recovery as a whole by 10%, to 60%. Parliament has repeatedly highlighted the need for the economic and environmental consequences of the targets for recovery and recycling to be taken into account. This was done in the most detailed cost-benefit analysis ever carried out on the Community's recycling targets. The additional finance required is estimated at a total of EUR 700 million per annum, with, by way of comparison, the costs of alternative disposal methods totalling EUR 800 million. The benefits to the environment are, in addition, estimated at around EUR 350 million.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, substantial differences between one type of packaging material and another, both as regards the environmental benefits and also the cost of recycling. It is for this reason that the Commission proposal not only specifies overall targets for recovery and recycling, but also targets differentiated according to the materials concerned. This is intended to have the effect of concentrating on those materials the recycling of which yields the greatest environmental benefit in comparison to the cost involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Member States have already achieved the new targets proposed by the Commission, whilst for others, whose recycling programmes have not yet reached this stage of development, these represent a major challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add that I am presenting this proposal in place of my fellow Commissioner Mrs Wallström, who is spending today at the Johannesburg Summit on sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Corbey (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European packaging directive has had a considerable impact. We are sorting and collecting our waste. There are now recycling installations all over Europe. There are people across Europe processing the waste that we all produce. This is demanding and labour-intensive work. We are doing all of this for the sake of the environment, and we must persevere, for the waste mountain is still growing. However, we should not turn a blind eye to a few difficulties that the packaging directive poses.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, there are major discrepancies between the Member States in their implementation of the packaging directive. This is sometimes due to laxity, but often also due to real problems, such as a lack of waste disposal facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the environmental yield is not always obvious. We think that recycling benefits the environment, but there is a limit. In the case of excessive distances, for example, the environmental burden outweighs the benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we still notice there is a great deal of unnecessary packaging. Needless to say, packaging plays an essential role, namely to protect the product, but a double layer of plastic for a small loaf of bread is surely somewhat excessive. These matters were raised in Parliament's resolution last year. We discussed the Commission's proposal against this background. We support the Commission's review proposal, but do consider it to be too restricted. The area of prevention, in particular, has had hardly any work done on it. Ladies and gentlemen, we have discussed this topic at great length. I would thank all my fellow MEPs and the shadow rapporteurs, in particular, for their contributions. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is able to submit a result that sounds the right note for new steps towards sustainable developments. I should like to single out a few key points.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, there is the directive's environmental result, which is, unfortunately, not always evident. The environmental impact should be clear if the public are to continue to be motivated to separate their waste. This is why the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy demands a clear evaluation of the environmental yield of the Packaging Directive. Not only should the environmental impact be clear to the public, it should also be a primary consideration in the choices made by industry and governments. We must lay the foundation for this here, which brings me to my second point: prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">Producers opt for product packaging on the basis of essential functions, within which there are various options. Soft drinks can be wrapped in cardboard, metal, glass, plastic or a combination of these. The Environmental Committee asks producers to opt for the most environmentally-friendly alternative, for which an indicator is to be prescribed. This Packaging Environment Indicator consists of at least two parameters: the volume of waste and the emission of greenhouse gases. As the emission of greenhouse gases is a global problem, the same value is to be accorded to this parameter in each country. However, the waste issues and recycling capacity are different in each country, and thus the values accorded should differ in line with this. The Packaging Environment Indicator has generated a great deal of discussion. One effect is at any rate clear. Different materials, such as paper, metal, glass and plastic must compete with each other on the basis of environmental quality. This is how an incentive is created to achieve consistent innovation in the environmental sphere, an incentive to invest in recycling capacity. In this way, each country develops its optimum recycling capacity. It is important for us to take the first step now. Industry wants clear political statements that at least indicate the way.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point concerns recycling. As long as the prevention policy is not fully functioning, we need to work with recycling targets. The problem with the recycling target is that it can never absolutely suit all countries. What is ambitious for the United Kingdom and Spain, is not for Germany or Austria. I consider the 65% proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy to be a good compromise for first reading. There has been a great deal of debate about whether material-specific targets should be prescribed or not. Here too, I propose a compromise solution: no material-specific targets but a distinction between easy and difficult materials, with a minimum of 25% for plastic and wood and 60% for the rest. This leaves Member States sufficient options to achieve the best possible percentages. As for maximum targets, these were a good idea in the initial stages of recycling, but are now absolutely redundant. Excessive national targets no longer distort the market.</p>
<p class="contents">My next point concerns re-use. The discussion surrounding re-use focuses mainly on drinks packaging, which has again become a live issue in a number of countries, particularly in Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands. Re-use also generates most internal market problems. The obligation of re-use is often to the advantage of local producers of beer or mineral water. It is, in fact, an improper use of re-use, and one that must be avoided. This is why we must put the environmental result at the top of the agenda in this respect too. Member States must promote re-use if this is more beneficial to the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">A final point concerns heavy metals. It is clear to everyone that these must be eliminated. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has opted for a complete ban. It has been pointed out that this hinders the use of recycled material, and this is obviously not our intention. This is why we would clarify once again that the use of heavy metals should be banned.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish off with a word on sustainable development. In Johannesburg, the entire world is talking about sustainable development. Today, we have the opportunity of turning this fine concept into reality. The concept of sustainable development must be given a practical dimension. We must clear up our own mess instead of exporting it to developing countries. This is why we must be serious about producer responsibility. We have done this before in the directive on electronic waste and the directive on end-of-life vehicles. Producer responsibility is not only of a financial nature. Producers must also innovate in terms of environmental quality and their packaging. Innovation is also the best guarantee for retaining employment in the packaging industry. It is the best guarantee for future generations not to be saddled with our waste, a shortage of natural resources and climate changes. We hope that the revision of the packaging directive helps to achieve this. I thank you for your attention and look forward to the debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has expanded the debate on the amendment of the Packaging Directive and put it in the broader context of environmental policy. Over and above the change to the recycling quotas, she has added consideration of environmental impact assessments to the discussion, by, among other things, drawing on life-cycle analysis. One might say that she has thus already pre-empted the discussions on the White Paper on integrated product policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of course never wrong to give consideration, at as early a stage as possible, to methods of assessing environmental impact, for this is how more general awareness of environmental policies of this sort is created. On the other hand, however, we must not use the Packaging Waste Directive to prescribe the outcome before we in this House have thoroughly got to grips with the issues. This, after all, is what the White Paper on integrated product policy is about, or, in any case, that is what almost everybody on the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy thought.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why a majority of us on the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy urged that we should vote for the removal from the report of Amendment No 16, which provides for the immediate introduction of environmental indicators for packaging. Moreover, Amendment No 16 envisages an overall reduction of 10%. Does this mean that the production of packaging material is to be cut back? How is that to be achieved? Do we intend to reduce by 10% the industrial production of goods that need to be packaged? That too is a proposal to which we should give a wide berth.</p>
<p class="contents">Just a few brief words on the content of the Directive. The new targets must be seen as ambitious, but I do believe that they are justified, from the point of view of industrial policy, in terms of their objective, which serves the European Union's environmental policy objectives. Albeit with the reservations to which I referred earlier, we will be happy to give substantial support to Mrs Corbey's report.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ayuso González (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are going to vote on tomorrow has kept us very busy in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy over recent months, particularly the rapporteur, Mrs Corbey, whom I would like to congratulate, because this subject is far from easy and she has had to work very hard.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendment of the packaging Directive will have significant implications for the various agents concerned. For public administrations, for selective collection systems, for companies producing materials and packaging, for the agri-food industry and – most importantly – for the consumer. Because without the cooperation of the consumer, this Directive will not be complied with in any country.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that we must set quantitative targets and that they must be ambitious, but it is also the case that the targets must be achievable. We must be aware that in certain Member States the targets will be more difficult to achieve due to a historical lack of infrastructures, low population densities or consumer habits. We are debating a Directive which must have a sufficient degree of flexibility in order to allow national laws to be brought into line with it and furthermore we cannot oblige consumers to separate the waste from the containers in order to facilitate collection. This is something they must do voluntarily as a result of education.</p>
<p class="contents">The recovery and recycling targets proposed by the Commission for 2006 are particularly ambitious for the majority of Member States and we must acknowledge that certain Member States will not be able to achieve them. However, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is going to support the approval of the percentages proposed, but maintaining the upper limits, because the proposal already provides for the possible exceeding of these limits with the permission of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We are opposed, however, to the idea of specific objectives for each material, since they would lead to a distortion in competition between materials and reduce the consumer’s scope for choice. Our proposal – in Amendment No 45 – is a minimum of 25% for all materials, along the same lines as the Directive in force, although we know that for the plastics sector 25% will be a very difficult target to reach. The fact that the objective is 25% will not prevent it from being exceeded. Under the current Directive, with 15%, objectives of 70 or 80% for recycling are being achieved in certain countries, but nevertheless, this is going to promote free competition between materials within a free market. I personally believe – and I am not now speaking on behalf of the PPE-DE Group – that the broad objectives for recovery and recycling must be set at local level by the competent authorities, who have the best knowledge of their capacities, their infrastructures and the habits of their consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposes that the objectives be fulfilled by June 2006, and our proposal is that that date be put back to 31 December 2006, because it is more practical to discuss and take stock by calendar years and because, furthermore, it is a very tight deadline.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this, I also understand the desire to put compliance with the Directive back to 2008. Moreover, the Member States are going to have little time to bring their legislation into line in view of the codecision procedure, which is going to increase the time it takes to adopt the Directive. However, I believe that delay is a message which Parliament should not send. On the other hand, I do support differentiated targets and time limits for certain Member States such as Ireland, Greece and Portugal, for whom it is very difficult to keep up with the proposed pace.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that a prevention objective is not necessary, because, for environmental and economic reasons, such as the payment of the ‘Green point’, which exists in certain countries such as my own, industry is already trying to reduce as far as possible the amount of material used in the manufacture of packaging.</p>
<p class="contents">We should bear in mind that the volume of packaging on the market also depends on the quantity of products sold, not just on the materials used in their manufacture. We are in favour of shared responsibility, so that the manufacturer uses the maximum amount of resources to ensure that the product is appropriately packaged, that the consumer cooperates in the collection of waste and that the municipal authorities manage the volume of waste and recover value from it wherever possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We also opt – in Amendment No 44 – for recycling and re-use being promoted equally by the Member States, in accordance with their particular circumstances and infrastructures. We must be flexible. Industry is already making efforts to improve the design of its products and to make them more environment-friendly, because this is an aspect which the consumer is increasingly sensitive to, and we should not forget that the Directive we wish to amend arose originally as a result of problems relating to the operation of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a final observation, and that is that this proposal, like the others presented to us, is intended to be complied with by all the Member States and that the socio-economic conditions, infrastructures, traditions and ways of life vary very widely from one country to another, and this will be even more the case following enlargement. We in the European Union must therefore implement rules which set minimums which everybody can achieve and which can be raised for anybody who is in a position to meet them. When the application of legislation becomes a question of exceptions and non-compliances, it is because something is not working. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Sixth Environmental Action Programme approved the principle that the volume of waste generated should be de-coupled from economic growth. This is also one of the most important environmental policy objectives of the summit currently being held in Johannesburg. Indeed, this directive on packaging waste is just part of this problematic issue, but it is now a matter of debate for us here, and we should also bear in mind this higher goal whilst considering it.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, in any revision of the 1994 directive ambitious targets must be set, as the rapporteur, Mrs Corbey, has also stated. What the Committee finally decided was not quite what the Social Democrats and the rapporteur wanted; hopefully, however, we will be able to hold to that target of a 10% reduction in the generation of waste. The environmental impact of the use of packaging waste actually requires a lot more research. It is not wise to establish any rigid hierarchy with regard to re-use and recycling; in some countries recycling works better, whilst in some regions re-use is more effective. For example, in Finland the re-use of soft drinks and beer bottles works excellently, and must therefore be encouraged, but in a way that allows everyone to be involved in this system openly.</p>
<p class="contents">Research into environmental impact should lead to the establishment of environmental indicators for packaging. When we discussed this directive with various parties, we noticed that there are just as many experts as there are interested parties associated with the materials. We must definitely have data based on research regarding which materials improve the state of the environment most and in which circumstances. For there to be genuine competition between materials, in addition to the targets associated with materials I think there should also be a general aim where competition would be based on bringing more packaging materials that fulfil environmental criteria onto the market. Recycling is also an excellent solution when talking of sustainable development as a combination of social, economic and environmental policy. It creates jobs and helps the excluded in this sense, and it improves the state of the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is absolutely necessary to revise the packaging directive. A clear solution regarding objectives for the utilisation of packaging waste must be achieved, because the situation as it is at present is very confused.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal for a general level of recycling regarding packaging waste is an ambitious aim, but it is attainable on certain conditions. Material-specific recycling targets should be closer to one another. There can be no justification for very different targets, at least with reference to environmental criteria. Material-specific targets within the EU accord a different status to each material, but Member States are also in an unequal position if their practices regarding packaging and, as a consequence, the proportion of different packaging materials they use varies greatly from one to another.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been said here already, it is especially important to prevent the generation of waste. This can be done, for example, by making effective use of renewable raw materials, by manufacturing good quality, hard-wearing, durable and recyclable products, and by reducing the hazard of waste that results. Whether the re-use of packaging should be encouraged must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. For example, fibre packaging is easily manufactured from recyclable, renewable raw materials. It is often more beneficial environmentally speaking and cheaper than re-usable packaging. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I agree with the Commissioner that the 1994 Directive has certain positive aspects, in that, to a greater or lesser extent, all the Member States distribute waste at source and recover, recycle and re-use waste. I believe that it has those effects, although there are significant differences in each of the Member States. I also agree with the rapporteur that it would be necessary, on this as on other aspects of environmental policy, since there are regulations, directives and decisions, to simplify and consolidate the legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">There are perhaps two issues which are the most controversial amongst the various groups: the first is the levels of concentration of lead, cadmium, mercury and chromium present in packaging and the second is the particular percentage of recycling and recovery for each of the materials proposed. I believe that in the end it may be necessary to deal with the strictest aspects of these two issues, in order to be able to achieve a possible conciliation with a high level in the Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a concern of the rapporteur which we share, relating to the marketing of recycled products, which involves very many difficulties and, like the rapporteur, I believe that the public administrations must have these opportunities to contract recycled products.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end, Mr President, with what I believe to be the most important aspect of this issue: prevention. Consumers must participate in prevention. Experience demonstrates that consumers, if they are appropriately informed, duly participate in it. For their part, as we saw in Johannesburg, producers are responsible for the use of materials which produce less waste and they must take account of the emission of greenhouse gases, dumping and the protection of scant natural resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McKenna (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, after a delay of one year the European Commission's proposal to amend the packaging and packaging waste directive is finally before us. I should like to thank Mrs Corbey for her work on this report. I very much welcome the improvements made and hope that they will help in our efforts to reduce waste within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is extremely regrettable, however, that Member State governments are so unwilling to put the environment before big business, in particular in light of the rhetoric on sustainable development we have heard from Johannesburg over the past week.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has tabled several amendments in an effort to further improve the text. I should like to take this opportunity to briefly explain our reasoning behind some of these amendments. Firstly, on the time: we propose a compromise date of 2007 rather than 2008. The Commission's proposal is already one year behind schedule and according to the objectives should be postponed by one year but no more. I also welcome the PPE Group's amendment of a 2006 deadline, which would be better.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, prevention and reuse of packaging waste should be increased to reduce its environmental impact. Waste prevention must be the first priority of the EU's waste policy and yet too little is done about it. Reuse systems have been shown to be beneficial to the environment, provided a minimum number of reuse cycles is achieved and transport distances are not too great. They are often hampered by the use of too many different bottle types. We have suggested that the Commission should look into the possibility of a uniform bottle type and of taking Community action to facilitate reuse.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we have tried to strengthen the use of recycling as opposed to recovery. According to waste management strategy, recycling is environmentally more beneficial than recovery and, in my opinion, 'recovery' is just another word for incineration – a polluting activity with significant environmental and health impacts. For that reason recycling rather than recovery should be increased. The Commission is saying that Member States '<span class="italic">shall</span> encourage energy recovery'. '<span class="italic">Shall </span>encourage' – the Commission is forcing Member States to introduce incineration. For my own country, Ireland, this would be just wonderful because that is what it wants to do. It does not want to solve the waste problem, it wants to burn it! Look at the attitude towards recovery. No maximum is set by the Council – which is very interesting – yet it has set a maximum for recycling targets, which is farcical. Why should we prevent more recycling if it is possible?</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, there should be no maximum targets for recycling as it is environmentally beneficial to promote a shift to materials which are recyclable and more ambitious minimum targets should be achieved. As I have said, the idea of setting a maximum is not acceptable. We have also proposed that exports of packaging waste to non-EU countries should not count towards the achievement of the targets. Exports of packaging wastes are currently unregulated and are in violation of the requirements of Annex 2 of the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movement of Waste if they pose a significant threat to the development of environmentally sound recycling infrastructure for packaging waste in the EU and exacerbate the waste problem in the importing country. At least some of the packaging waste currently exported from the EU is processed in operations that are harmful to human health and the environment, or landfilled instead of recycled, which should not be encouraged.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we propose several amendments covering heavy metals and PVCs. Heavy metals should not be deliberately used in packaging after 2006 and there is no reason to exempt recycled materials from restrictions in relation to heavy metals. According to the Commission's studies on PVC there is no safe disposal method. Current recycling rates of PVC packaging are less than 3% in the EU and all of it is down-cycling, which produces inferior quality with no environmental or economic benefits. We should phase out in line with the European Parliament's resolution on PVC, which called for substitution policies to be introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1997, 58 million tonnes of packaging waste was produced. In 1998 that increased to 60 million tonnes, equivalent to 2 kgs per day for a four-person family. Some Member States have only half as much as others – here I am comparing like with like. Finland and Sweden have 100 kgs per person per year; France and Italy, which are very similar countries, have 200 kgs per person per year. There are no figures for countries like Portugal, Ireland and Greece, which want a derogation. I find it completely incomprehensible that my own country, Ireland – a country where the living standards are almost the highest in Europe and which has a booming economy – wants an exemption for its waste problems. Austria, Denmark and the Netherlands reduced by 10% the amount of packaging placed on the market from 1997 to 1998. So it can be achieved, we can achieve a reduction if we put the policies in place to encourage this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In our view, European environmental policy should therefore aim to protect the entire creation, including the health of people, animals and plants and the quality of air, water and soil. Since packaging material in weight accounts for approximately one third of all household and industrial waste, you will appreciate the importance we attach to harmonising national measures in order to avoid, or reduce, the harmful environmental effects of packaging and packaging waste.</p>
<p class="contents">We are reasonably pleased with the directive as it is now before us. I am specifically using the word ‘reasonably’, because the proposed review provides only for the stepping up of measures to recover and recycle material. What is missing are more effective rules for the prevention of waste, the re-use of packaging material and producer responsibility. Radical changes in these areas are absolutely crucial. This is why the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy are a good start.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Corbey, the rapporteur, has worked very hard and has, thanks to cooperation, achieved a good result. I would like to congratulate her warmly on this and take the opportunity to call on the Commission to adopt a pro-active stance with regard to the new approach previously announced, in which the said matters will be dealt with in greater depth. The proposal amended by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy that is before us, is, in our view, a first step in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Thomas-Mauro (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I will, if I may, concentrate on the French approach to packaging, with which I am most familiar. In France, manufacturers have introduced a policy of reducing packaging at source by means of the procedure for certifying conformity with standard 13428 on prevention. Conformity with this standard is only mandatory in France and the United Kingdom. The amendments which I tabled in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy sought to extend this procedure to all the Member States. My colleagues did not include my proposal, but they were nonetheless sensitive to it, for Amendment No 16 to paragraph 5 of the provision in question states, quite rightly, that the Commission will before the end of 2004 evaluate the implementation of standard CEN EN 13428 on prevention<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>in all the Member States. I would draw the attention of my colleagues to the need to remove the change introduced by Amendment No 16 to Article 4(1)(a), for an arbitrary limit on the quantity of packaging does not take into account either economic growth or sociological development. Indeed, unit sales are increasing rapidly in a world where more and more people are living alone. It is through respect for standard CEN EN 13428 on prevention that the volume of packaging, its global tonnage, will be decreased, as is shown by the French example. That is precisely the challenge that we have to take up.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw your attention once again to the dangers of adopting an environmental indicator for packaging, as proposed by the change introduced by Amendment No 16 to Article 4(3)(a). There is no need for this additional indicator for packaging, in that a standardisation tool already exists although it needs to be better enforced by manufacturers. Furthermore, its complex definition should take into account all the relevant criteria such as the nature of the product, the raw material requirements, the manufacturing processes and the collection and recycling systems available. The differences between the situations in the different countries have meant, I am sure, that the results are not representative.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, on the subject of re-use, this form of recycling should not be encouraged systematically, because the environmental impact of an item of re-usable packaging is not necessarily less harmful than that of an item of disposable packaging. A number of studies have confirmed this, particularly in the bottled drinks sector, and I will not go into the complaints lodged by the Commission against certain Member States who generated trade distortions by making the<span class="bold"> </span>return system mandatory.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call upon the Members to vote against Amendment No 17. We live in a society which functions according to a rhythm worthy of the machine in Chaplin’s ‘Modern Times’: produce, package, throw away and, increasingly, I am glad to say, recycle and re-use.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not, however, lose sight of the fact that packaging is more than just an unfortunate side effect of our consumer society. It is not just there to look pretty or attract the customer: in the main, packaging serves an essential purpose. The solution to the problem facing us is to make this product subject to environmental requirements and to view it in the context of its entire life cycle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The progress made is clear to see. The Commission’s proposal seeking to improve the directive’s objectives would, nevertheless, appear quite appropriate. I can therefore only support this step for, in view of the difficulties encountered in the field with regard to the treatment of waste, particularly the treatment of packaging waste, it would seem premature to want to undertake a more in-depth review of the text.</p>
<p class="contents">There is only one essential demand Parliament must make in this matter, and that is for realism, for our goal is to facilitate the treatment of packaging waste as far as we can and, even before packaging reaches the market, to provide for waste packaging which does the least possible harm to our environment. We therefore need an integrated policy for products and their packaging. Moreover, we must look for outlets for our waste. Recycling is often problematic and it is therefore necessary to apply the principle of prevention and to limit the volume of packaging. Our legislation must, quite simply, integrate prevention, but it also needs to be simpler and more flexible.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the definitions used in the directive are also clarified, but the main problem at European level remains the harmonisation of definitions. That became quite clear when Parliament was examining the texts. Quite apart from the problem of waste packaging, it is essential that an in-depth reform is carried out and that the answer to a simple question – ‘What constitutes waste?’ – is found. The problem of waste in Europe is fundamental – for the Community institutions, for the national governments, for local authorities, for companies and for our fellow citizens, who have a key role to play. Perhaps we should be working towards a framework directive on waste. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bowe (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I am very pleased to be here today for more than one reason because, looking around the room, perhaps I am one of the few people who was actually here when we first wrote the packaging directive. I feel a special responsibility to ensure that we do not forget that and ensure that this directive continues to develop in a positive way for the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome this proposal but I am not sure whether the timing is particularly good, coming as it does from the Commission before we can fully assess the impact of enlargement. I think that we have to be sure that what we do to the directive on this occasion is a positive and sensible thing and we do not, for example, try to table ego-amendments rather than eco-amendments. Politicians always tend to want to change directives and demonstrate their power. What we have to do today is take a rather more limited approach than we took with the first packaging directives of many years ago. But I see this as a useful opportunity, if we can take that approach, to adjust the directive in the light of experience.</p>
<p class="contents">We have learned that recycling is not in itself a good thing but only good when it is positive and beneficial to the environment. Therefore, many of the tools that we have gradually developed need further refinement, whether life-cycle analysis or some of the other tools. These will tell us the real value of the work that we are doing and that we are asking others to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Simply raising the targets without any thoughtful consideration of them is not something that we should do on this occasion. Let us take the Commission targets, which are not bad targets at all – the Commission proposal is not a bad proposal at all – let us examine them carefully and let us refine them. Let us see if we can improve them. Perhaps minimum targets for each material is not a bad idea. There are some materials that do indeed need a lot more work on them, or if you look at the area of glass and metal perhaps less work.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to think very carefully about this directive. We must ensure that it is acceptable not just to those countries that are already and fully implementing the packaging directive but also to those that will have to implement it in coming times. We must bear in mind, of course, the very different situation countries like Malta will find themselves in. Smaller countries with particularly difficult waste disposal problems cannot really be realistically expected to adhere to exactly the same levels of recycling that might be achievable in the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also talking about Central and Eastern Europe and that is why I wonder whether we should not pause for a little thought before we push too far ahead with a radical revision of this proposal. Circumstances and conditions in those countries that will shortly be members of the European Union will dictate that we take a different approach to some of the legislation. In particular when it comes to packaging, there has to be some kind of uniform and level playing field across Europe, in which case we have to be realistic about what is achievable in central and eastern Europe in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would say that when we sit down today, I hope we will perhaps feel satisfied and happy and have a warm glow inside us, but also feel that we have done something not just for our egos but for the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have already agreed this in the case of the electronic and electrical waste directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly concerned that my own Member State, Ireland, is seeking derogations yet again. Why should this be agreed in view of the recent economic expansion there? My colleague has already mentioned this. Irish industry is currently paying a levy to Repak to meet commitments that are not being met. Minimum targets are being met, for example by the recycling of paper offcuts which have traditionally been reused, so there is more perception of progress than actual progress and a lot of smoke and mirrors around the meeting of minimum targets. I am also very concerned about monopolies and cartels in the paper industry, particularly in Ireland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All the Member States need in future to work together, in an active and constructive way, on avoiding packaging waste and on systematically collecting and recycling it. The best possible systems are needed to deal with the approximately 58 million tonnes of packaging waste that the European Union produces every year. They will enable us to ensure better protection for the environment, and also, at the same time, to give important sectors of industry greater security in terms of planning.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two amendments that I see as being of enormous importance when we come to the vote. The first has to do with ceramic containers, which have for decades been produced in many Member States, principally France, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, but also in family-run businesses in the region from which I come. Ceramic bottles, ceramic pots, and ceramic bowls are nowadays used mainly for the packaging of foodstuffs, but also for the packaging of distilled liquors, chocolates, patés and so on, and they make up only 0.1% of the European Union's waste packaging, in other words, 60 000 tonnes out of a total 58 million tonnes. Such ceramic packaging consists of nothing but baked clay and does not, therefore, contain pollutants of any sort.</p>
<p class="contents">The characteristics of the material make the recovery of the used ceramic containers pointless. They cannot be recovered thermally, nor can they be recycled. They are inert and pose no risk to the environment. Locating such small quantities separately, collecting them separately and transporting them for thousands of kilometres across the Member States, would make no sense in either environmental or economic terms. I therefore ask you to support Amendment No 68, which creates a derogation for small quantities as regards recovery targets.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point has to do with the recognition given by the Directive to the latest processes for reprocessing plastics. If we are to amend this Directive, we should take the opportunity to also make the objectives set by law technically up to date. Amendment No 43 provides for the recovery of materials from plastics, facilitating the use of polluted waste plastics to produce plastics as good as new. This process makes perfect sense in both ecological and economic terms and has proved its technical worth on a large scale.</p>
<p class="contents">In Germany, for example, it has already been used to recover raw materials from over 1.8 million tonnes of waste plastic. Technology of this sort has enormous potential, providing as it does another method for recovering synthetic materials in addition to the melting down of plastic packaging of genuinely high value and the merely thermal recovery of mixed plastics in waste incineration plants. That is why it should be incorporated into the Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Over and above this, the protection of consumers makes it necessary for packaging materials to be safe, for them to comply with the requirement that the hazards of waste be minimised, and for the manufacture of packaging to use the most up to date technology. I do not think much of the idea of developing environmental indicators for packaging. The Commission should, rather, be working towards definite criteria for the assessment of the impact packaging has on the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">We need this Directive in order to establish a working system for managing packaging waste in all the Member States of the European Union.</p>

At last the people in my country are starting to take the issue seriously, but coming from such a long way behind we need to be realistic about how quickly countries such as the UK and Spain can catch up with nations such as Germany which have already set the pace.</p>
<p class="contents">It will take years for the UK to approve the planning permission that will be necessary to build the plants in order to meet these targets. It will take years for local authorities to follow public procurement rules. It will take huge efforts to persuade the public to separate their rubbish and it will take ages to develop a market for recyclets. That is why we need an extra two years to implement the rule change as agreed in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted to see that the Council of Ministers have agreed to set relatively high standards in the whole area of recovery and recycling. I am pleased to see that the committee has agreed to the suggestion of harmonising data collection in this field, so we can be really sure we are comparing like with like across Member States. We must put pressure on business to reduce unnecessary packaging. We have seen time and time again that voluntary agreements in the business world are rarely honoured. That is why a compulsory reduction in packaging for goods should be agreed to.</p>
<p class="contents">An environmental indicator to measure packaging has certain merits, but so far no one has managed to explain to me exactly how this would work and I therefore have reservations about writing into European law a system that does not yet exist. I hope that we all take our responsibilities seriously. The governments need to take their responsibility for waste seriously, but so do all of us as individuals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Doyle (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, as we debate the revision of targets set in the 1994 packaging directive, in an effort to reduce the EU's growing mountain of packaging waste, I would like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Corbey and the shadow rapporteur Mrs Ayuso González, for their hard work in this very important area.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two issues in this debate, the first is the targets and the second is the timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">While I agree with the emphasis on prevention targets and not only on the new recycling and reuse targets, I feel strongly that national authorities in each Member State should be free to optimise their own mix of recovery and recycling options. In relation to the timetable, I urge the Commission to carry out further studies to ensure that the targets applicable in the EU are also right for countries at the margin, not the least the new applicant states.</p>
<p class="contents">The consultants engaged to assist the Commission in setting the revised targets, RDC-Environment and Pira International, assumed a number of underlying principles which do not apply to some Member States, such as Greece, Portugal and Ireland. They fail to take specific geographical and demographic problems into account. For example, in Ireland 80% of our packaging is imported. Therefore there are limited indigenous outlets to use recycling packaging in the manufacture of new packaging. Hence my amendment, for which I urge support, for a 2011 timetable deadline for Greece, Portugal and Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the EU environment ministers appear to have already reached a 'common orientation' on this Directive in June 2002. They called for a deadline of 2012 for Portugal, Greece and Ireland. That is fine by me.</p>
<p class="contents">The real issue is that we should set realistically attainable targets and timetables and insist on the Irish, Greeks, Portuguese and others delivering on time, with no excuses.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to end with a good news story, a dramatic example of a fiscal incentive to prevent, minimise, reuse and recycle and an example of how each Member State can determine its own mix of prevention, reuse and recycling to meet targets. On 4 March 2002, our environment minister introduced a plastic bag tax in Ireland, 15% per bag. It has had an incredible effect. We have had a 90% decrease in consumption in just a few months. One billion plastic bags have been taken out of circulation in six months. The Exchequer has collected EUR 3.5 million since March this year. The turnaround has been dramatic and there have been few complaints. There was a moan or two for a week when we would forget to bring the old shopping bags, but in changing the mindset this tax on its own has done what years of talking in this Parliament and national parliaments could not do.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the fact we have already done something to deal with the problem of these wretched plastic bags will not be held against us in relation to targets. Perhaps we were a year too early, because this would have allowed us to show a dramatic improvement in meeting all targets and timetables – I am being somewhat sarcastic but it is a serious point. The scheme has been a huge success and I would urge other countries to follow suit immediately to deal with this scourge. I understand the United Kingdom is looking at it. It will do more than all the talking and directives and transposition into national law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She had, apart from anything else, 123 amendments to work through, 35 of which were from my group alone. Let me now also express very warm thanks to Mrs Ayuso González, who managed to achieve a coalition of highly divergent intentions in a most important area. I am referring to Amendment No 45, to which I personally will be giving firm support.</p>
<p class="contents">You see, the Packaging Directive has already been transposed in widely divergent ways, and incurred different costs, in the individual Member States, rather than leading to the harmonisation that is required. The maximum rate is therefore meant to prevent the four-speed Europe in this area from drifting even further apart, with even greater distortions of competition being the consequence. Since 1994, the current quotas have been achieved only by Austria, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark, although one has to bear in mind that the Netherlands and Denmark have done so only because they have fully-developed and highly economical systems of waste incineration, whereas Belgium and Germany have managed it through the use of the sort of recovery processes that environmental considerations make less than desirable and which will, indeed, cease to be authorised as a result of a change in definition contained in the proposal for a Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the burden of costs, Austria comes second in Europe, and it is high import levels and the huge problem of freeloaders getting away with not paying their way, especially in the plastics sector, that put Austrian foodstuff production, like, no doubt, that of other States as well, at the greatest competitive disadvantage. As we have said so many times already, we will vote for this draft, but one most specific area seems to me to be in real need of improvement. The Commission proposes that, in addition, the following minimum targets for the recovery of materials contained in packaging waste should be achieved: 60% by weight for glass, 65% by weight for paper, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">With your permission, I will turn to Amendment No 45. The 25% by weight minimum target for the recovery of materials is quite adequate for materials such as glass, paper, carton, metals and plastics. As an Austrian, you see, I have not the slightest problem with it, but we have also learned that, where countries are quite simply not so far advanced, there is no point in giving them targets that they know they will not achieve anyway. I do think it makes more ecological sense to set an objective that is actually capable of being achieved by all Europe's states and economies. We have always made environmental policy with business rather than against it. Only an environmentally responsible market economy will enable us to reach our goal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an important directive we have been waiting for, as recycling must be introduced effectively precisely where it will genuinely benefit the environment, and the volume of waste generated must be dramatically reduced. Recycling for the sake of recycling itself is something we have no need of; it must mean a genuine saving.</p>
<p class="contents">By virtue of its legislative nature the directive should still allow for flexibility on the part of Member States in its implementation. The criterion must therefore be genuine conservation of the environment. Population density and distance will be the deciding factors in assessing whether recycling is sensible.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall recovery and recycling targets should be considered to be along the same lines, that is, along the lines of the Commission proposal. This would prevent the use of recyclable materials merely as sources of energy. I am of the same view as Mrs Corbey that material-specific recycling targets should not be put forward. Apart from the fact that they would be awkward to set, it might mean that one sector is favoured and it might therefore distort competition.</p>
<p class="contents">I tabled amendments both for the Committee and plenary session. They concern really quite small details, but are the sort of thing this directive seems to need for it not to become too cumbersome. One fairly prosaic example is the toilet paper tube. Perhaps many of us would not be eager to class it as packaging waste that would then have to be recycled and used, for example, in our neighbour’s toilet roll.</p>
<p class="contents">It is to be hoped the directive will have an impact in two directions: it will be of major importance in rationalising practice, but, hopefully, also in preventing the generation of waste. The volume of waste should be de-coupled from economic growth, as my colleague Mrs Myller quite rightly stated here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to comment on the most important of the amendments that have been dealt with and which are due to be voted on tomorrow. The position taken by the Commission on these is that, firstly, as regards the timing, that is to say the extension of the deadline by which the targets are to be achieved, the Commission continues to favour an ambitious timetable. In principle, though, it is able to accept delay to a limited extent.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the targets, the targets proposed by the Commission ought to remain largely unchanged. They are based on a cost/benefit analysis of the proposals. There is, in particular, no justification in cost/benefit terms for an increase in the minimum target for recycling from 55% to 65%, and so the Commission rejects this. Nor is it willing to reduce the targets for glass, paper and metals from 60%, 55% or 50% to 25%, as these materials can be recycled with great benefit to the environment and at low cost. We see these objectives, specific to certain materials, as also being necessary in terms of legislative clarity and of security of investment for firms offering recycling services.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the maximum targets, the proposed deletion of the maximum target for recycling can result in distortions of the internal market if more material is collected than is capable of being recycled. This can lead to increasing problems in the sale of collected materials, especially in the countries that have introduced their own recycling programmes only at a late stage.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question or prioritising the prevention of waste over its management, the Commission, in principle, shares your view that it is more important to prevent waste than to manage it. However, this issue merits further consideration in terms of the criteria by which prevention should be guided, whether these should be the environmental effects or the weight involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is unable to endorse the introduction of 10% reduction as a quantitative prevention target, as it is not clear how this objective is to be implemented and what the costs and benefits might be. The possibility cannot be excluded that such a measure might have a negative overall impact on the environment, especially if it were only to bring about greater use of lightweight packaging such as plastic.</p>
<p class="contents">The requirement that, when choosing packaging, its impact on the environment should be minimised on the basis of life-cycle assessments, is in essence acceptable as proposed, even though an approach of this sort may well need to be worked out in more detail, and it is also preferable that it should be developed in the context of the Directive's basic requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to express the Commission's gratitude to the rapporteur and her co-rapporteur and thank the Committee as a whole for the work they have done.</p>
<p class="contents">In total, there are 68 amendments, six of which the Commission is able to adopt in their entirety, whilst it can adopt six in part and accept fifteen of them in principle. The bureau has been given a list of the amendments to which I have referred<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
