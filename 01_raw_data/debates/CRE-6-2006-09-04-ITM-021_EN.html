<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Louis Michel, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is obviously a pleasure for me to find myself back here today before this Parliament in order to discuss a country that is particularly dear to my heart – the Democratic Republic of Congo – and, more specifically, in order to discuss the electoral process that is currently under way there.</p>
<p class="contents">You will recall that, after the Lusaka ceasefire agreements were signed in July 1999, the European Union and the European Commission worked tirelessly alongside Congo not only to restore peace and stability there, but also to restore peace and stability throughout the Great Lakes region. It is with a certain pride, I believe, that we can say today that the peace and democracy process in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is one of the rare cases in which the European Union has been able to show itself to be a real political player by deploying all of its external policy instruments. It is worth pointing out, in this regard, the increased importance of development cooperation in the context of the Cotonou Agreement, which had been suspended for more than a decade, the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the European Security and Defence Policy, the appointment of a special envoy and the only military operations conducted outside Europe: Artemis in 2003, in order to bring peace to Ituri, and now EUFOR, in order to directly support a United Nations peacekeeping mission and an election observation mission led by your fellow Member, General Morillon, and in which a good number of you have participated.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that so many diplomatic and financial efforts should have finally led to a first round ballot of the presidential election and the legislative elections being held on 30 July. This first brush with democracy, after more than 40 years, occurred under what can be described as model conditions, given the overall situation in the country. The election observation mission was able to observe first hand the objective difficulties that the country and its population are experiencing. In spite of these difficulties and the disturbances that took place in the wake of the provisional publication of the first round presidential election results, this is an important result, with which we can only be satisfied.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that, throughout this process, the task has not been easy for anyone, and especially not for the people of Congo and their leaders, who have inherited a country that has been divided and rocked by years of war. A country in which 30 years of poor governance and corruption have destroyed the institutional capacities of the rule of law, irreparably damaged the basic infrastructure and profoundly altered the socio-economic fabric and social organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">These elections represent a unique opportunity to draw a line once and for all under the bad practices of the past, which have led the country into bankruptcy, plunged it into the depths of war and dragged it into the vicious circle of under-development and poverty. Congo possesses considerable natural resources, occupies a strategic position at the crossroads of Central Africa, and has high-quality human resources; I firmly believe that Congo will be called upon one day to play a major role in the stabilisation and development of the whole of Africa if good governance, the rule of law, human rights and the key elements to which Congo has subscribed by ratifying the Cotonou Agreement are fully respected in there.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to the work done thus far, there is now an opportunity to really lay new institutional and administrative foundations in the country and to embark upon – and I am by no means exaggerating here – a radical reform of the State. It is not the interest of a few individuals that is at stake here, but clearly that of the whole of Congo and its population, and we, the European Union, have a moral obligation to respond in an effective and clear-sighted manner to this requirement that the people of Congo are voicing out loud.</p>
<p class="contents">The deplorable events that, on 20, 21 and 22 August, followed the provisional publication of the results, have not, in my opinion, done anything to taint the symbolic value of this major act in the history of Congo. Through their massive turnout at the elections and their model behaviour, the people of Congo have taught their leaders and their politicians a great and fine lesson in democracy and good citizenship, one that cannot go without being mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">With the second round of the presidential election, scheduled for 29 October 2006, in prospect, the two presidential candidates must therefore be called on by all possible means to submit to the verdict of the ballot boxes and, above all, to respect the results unconditionally. In this connection, I also wanted to point out the importance, which has often been overlooked until now, of the results of the legislative elections. These results will determine the majority in parliament, from which the prime minister and future government will have to derive. Indeed, the new Constitution provides the country with the institutional structure of a modern country in which the separation of powers guarantees a balance of forces and in which the government is called upon to be accountable to its citizens by regularly submitting to elections.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of the difficulties over the last few days, the aim of the European Union’s action in DRC can only be to make a success of a transitional process that must hinge on the establishment of new authorities and institutions on the basis of the results that will come from the ballot boxes, in line with the international standards of transparency and reliability in electoral matters. It is clear that the situation remains tense and that this tension is liable to mount further as the election campaign and the date of 29 October, which has been set for the second round, draw near. It is therefore vital that the international community continues closely and constantly to monitor the situation on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I am convinced that MONUC and EUFOR and the people of Congo will be able to do a great deal to help prevent outbursts and acts of violence in Kinshasa. Faced with these objective difficulties, some early, encouraging signs are reaching us from the ground. Under the auspices of the United Nations, a joint committee on the Kinshasa events has just been put in place; it will be divided into two sub-committees, an independent investigation sub-committee, which will be in charge of establishing the facts about the events of 20, 21 and 22 August in Kinshasa, and a sub-committee that will have the task of defining the codes of conduct necessary for the election campaign, ahead of the second round of the presidential election and post-election period, to go off peacefully, in accordance with the will of the Congolese people.</p>
<p class="contents">The two parties have also promised to cooperate fully with the independent investigation committee and have committed themselves to working in favour of the electoral process, in accordance with the global and inclusive agreement, signed in Pretoria. To this end, the two sub-committees began their work on 30 August 2006. On the other hand, it is important for the other African players, particularly the African Union and South Africa, to commit themselves to taking a leading role in the actions aimed at bringing President Kabila and Vice-President Bemba closer together, in the common interest of the nation.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the European Commission, I am pleased to inform you that I have just agreed to the request put to us by Secretary-General Kofi Annan to help in covering the USD 46 million financial gap in the electoral process by contributing an additional EUR 16 million; the Community’s total contribution to the electoral process will therefore increase to EUR 165 million.</p>
<p class="contents">I can also confirm to you that the election observation mission, placed under the control of General Morillon, will continue to monitor the progress of the electoral process, in this interim period, until its conclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee on Development discussed this with the Commissioner a week ago, and as far as I am concerned that lays the matter to rest.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one lesson, though, that we must learn from what has happened, and it is that what is said in this House on the subject of the Congo may well not always be listened to here, but a very great deal of attention will be paid to it there, as we have been obliged – painfully – to learn. Let every one of us, then, be careful in what we say in our contributions to this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">This very evening, the results of the parliamentary elections and the outcome of the scrutiny by the Supreme Court are expected. That is the moment at which the first round of the presidential election can be regarded as over. Even though it is fundamentally improper that we should be debating the Congo at this point in time, let us, here in this House, congratulate the Congolese people and its independent electoral commission, whose dedicated work, patience and tenacity have made this first electoral round a success.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us hope, for our own sake and for that of the Congolese people, that the first national assembly to be elected for forty years may be able to convene and commence its work. It will help to stabilise the country. It will be for us an important partner in dialogue. Let us play our part in preparing the provincial elections; Europe and its Member States must play an effective supportive role, not only in the electoral process from beginning to end, but also in the subsequent period of reconstruction.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Morillon will confirm, the EU’s election monitoring commission is staying put, and the UN is making its own considerable contribution. MONUC and EUFOR have found their roles and enjoy respect, and we MEPs will observe the forthcoming round of elections.</p>
<p class="contents">It is cause for hope that the Congo has such a considerable potential as a democracy, but the process of democratisation is under threat from agile forces with which we are familiar, and on which we need to exert influence. Let us then persuade them that it is in their interest too that peaceful democratic elections should meet with success, and that the authority of a legitimate state should come into being; that is the only chance for the Congo and its people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I visited more than 40 polling stations in various parts of Kinshasa and I had the opportunity to observe the work of one of these polling stations in Dima, just one of the 250 000-plus around the country, until the last vote had been counted. I admired the patient dedication of the Congolese people – men and women, people working in polling stations and voters. They all said to me, with moving seriousness, that the authenticity of the people’s choice – the choice of the 25 million-plus registered voters in a logistical operation of epic proportions – would depend on their commitment and vigilance in carrying out their electoral duties and that, in turn, peace, democracy and the country’s development would depend on that choice.</p>
<p class="contents">This operation, and indeed the entire transitional process in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) since 2003, could not have come this far were it not for the European Union. The election should therefore be a source of pride not only for the Congolese people, but also for Europe, which provided 80% of the funding for the presidential and legislative elections, with the European Commission contributing EUR 165 million. The EU’s involvement in the DRC since the terrible war that devastated the country has been the best example of the implementation on the ground of Europe's security doctrine: humanitarian and development aid, technical support for demobilising and disarming militias, the maintenance of the political process and use of the instruments of European security and defence policy, with any additional resources used coherently to achieve a single goal, namely a democratic, peaceful and prosperous Congo, in control of its resources for the people’s benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards EUFOR, the European military force which, since the 30 July election, has played a key role in reducing tensions between the forces of the two presidential candidates, Mr Kabila and Mr Bemba, consideration should be given to the idea of extending its tour of duty until the new government takes office towards the end of January, in order to guarantee that the electoral process is carried through to a successful conclusion. It would be a serious mistake to leave the job only half done, because the transitional process remains poised on a knife-edge. The fighting in the capital in August between the presidential guard and Mr Bemba's militias demonstrates that the main political actors are still prepared to resort to armed violence.</p>
<p class="contents">It also shows up the inability to form a unified national army, which has perhaps been the biggest and most dangerous failure in the transition process. According to the International Crisis Group, the task of integrating the armed forces has been only half completed. It is not only Azarias Ruberwa and Jean-Pierre Bemba who retain private armies. President Kabila himself has failed to submit his presidential guard to the <span class="italic">brassage</span> process, and it was his forces who set off the armed hostilities that took place in August.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever the result of the election, the international community’s priority should be to demobilise the militias and help set up a single Congolese army viewed by the Congolese people as a force for stability and democratic authority. Right now, however, it is not Congolese or European weapons that will guarantee the ultimate success of the electoral process. That will primarily depend on Congolese men and women, such as the independent candidate for Parliament, Eve Bazaiba Masudi, member of the Kafko NGO, which is made up of women fighting courageously for peace, democracy and human rights, in close coordination with MONUC, the United Nations Mission in the DRC. Eve Bazaiba Masudi and other women representing Congolese civil society are seeking to mediate and to hold the warlords to account. These women deserve the EU’s support, and I trust that the Commission’s delegation and the committee chaired by General Morillon, whose outstanding work thus far I wish to commend, can support these people who are bringing peace and dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">An entire book could be written on the exceptional adventure embarked upon by the people of Congo in order to provide themselves with democratic institutions with the help of the international community and of the European Union, in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall confine my speech this evening to some comments about the new stage that was reached on this road on Sunday 30 July, during the first round of the presidential elections, which coincided with the legislative elections. Just after that first round, I had the satisfaction, on 1 August, of signing, together with my counterparts from throughout the world, from the African Union, from the French-speaking community and from the Carter Foundation, a joint declaration that was basically designed to point out how impressed we were – and I quote – with the strong turnout of Congolese male and female voters and with the participation of the political party witnesses and the national observers in the election of 30 July.</p>
<p class="contents">In congratulating the people of Congo for the calm and dignified atmosphere in which these elections took place, we were urging the candidates – and I quote again – to respect the choices of the Congolese people and to use legal means of redress in the event of a dispute. Finally, we were calling on them to develop the peace process observed and to make a lasting contribution on the road to national reconciliation and to the rebuilding of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">This appeal was sadly not heard by the most diehard supporters of the two candidates who were well ahead in the first round and, shortly before the provisional results were announced, on Sunday 20 August, they began to confront each other in the very heart of the capital, before reaching the stage, late in the afternoon on the Monday, of fighting with heavy weapons around the residence of the senior vice-president, in which the members of the international transitional aid committee, chaired by the United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Bill Swing, were gathered.</p>
<p class="contents">It was only thanks to the assistance of a security operation put in place by the general commanding the MONUC forces, with the support of the European-led forces of EUFOR, that the hostages were able to be set free and the madmen forced to return to their camp. I was therefore pleased to have championed in this Chamber the setting-up of that force and I felt proud – you are right, Commissioner – to be European, because it was the remarkably effective intervention of the European Union that enabled a swift return to calm.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also once again congratulate the people of Kinshasa, who refused to let themselves be led into murdering and looting again, as they were being called on to do by the staunchest of those who remained opposed to any democratic revolution. The calm that has prevailed since then throughout the country may offer hope that those people will no longer cause any harm. It is up to us to demonstrate the greatest vigilance and to continue to use all of our political and, if need be, military, weight to put pressure on the two candidates that are still in contention until the second round of the presidential elections, scheduled for 29 October.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, and in accordance with the Constitution, the power, Commissioner, will return to the people, by means of its elected parliament. That is what the people of Congo aspire to. That is what we must continue to help them achieve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The same goes for the desire expressed by the Congolese people to finally be able to choose their leaders by themselves, and for Europe’s support in this area, provided that this support is perceived as being completely neutral, something that has posed problems recently.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, the situation remains very tense, and while it is clear that these elections seem to be necessary or urgent, after so many years of war, chaos and victims, they will not be enough to put right a country that still has serious problems, starting with extreme poverty and a high level of violence, which regularly undermine the efforts to establish the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Controlling the trafficking and trade in weapons, setting up an effective police force and judicial system and bringing the most serious criminals before the International Criminal Court are the requirements for consolidating peace. This situation of impunity has just as serious an effect on health issues. Besides the shortage of health care personnel to which Doctor Mukwege, who practises in the west of Congo, drew our attention in Brussels, in May, there are also the mass rapes and inhumane treatment inflicted on women that must be combated relentlessly. This must be done by also relying on the abilities of the local communities to organise themselves, to restore acceptable daily living conditions, and to denounce and punish acts of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the new elected leaders of DRC be able to put a stop to this violence? It is justifiable to be worried, especially given the unrest that followed the announcement of the presidential election results, which do, however, still offer an opportunity to both of the candidates who finished first in the elections. In the event of serious unrest, what exactly would EUFOR’s mandate be?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the mineral and forestry resources in DRC are now the subject of shameless exploitation, whereby corruption more often than not goes hand in hand with a disastrous social and environmental impact. The answers that will be given, not only by the elected Congolese authorities, but also by the European Union’s political and economic partners, in relation to transparency, to the way in which profits are used, and to social and ecological conditions of exploitation, will be key to determining whether or not DRC is capable of taking action in favour of sustainable development. How do you see things in this area, Commissioner?</p>
<p class="contents">If one takes account of the events that took place in DRC, then to put in place a democratic and peaceful transition would constitute a strong sign of hope for the thousands of Africans who are now fleeing their countries in order to make a dash for Europe’s shores with the idea of thus escaping from the chaos and of ensuring their own survival. In any case, everything must be done to give the Democratic Republic of Congo and the millions of Congolese people, who have suffered so much and who have reacted with so much energy and vigour, their chance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The lamentable fact is that this is another indication of the ‘importance’ attached to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Glad though I indeed am that these elections took place, I take a rather more sceptical view of them than do those who have already spoken. Although we are told that both the elections and the deployment of EUFOR were great successes, I think the European Union and Congo have narrowly escaped disaster. What if Kabila had been elected in the first round? The situation would have been markedly worse than it is now.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear from the results and the campaign that these elections were not essentially about politics; they were to a considerable degree about regional allegiance in a Congo that is, in fact, divided between East and West. Many persons in positions of responsibility within the EU – and none more so than Commissioner Michel – displayed a bias in favour of Joseph Kabila. I would like – and here I am addressing Mr Schröder – to be able to say that this has sorted itself out, but, far from it, it had a great influence on what happened on the ground, and I would like to quote from a <span class="italic">Deutsche Welle </span>article, according to which: ‘The gross irresponsibility of Bemba’s campaign, which was characterised by ethnic nationalism and sometimes by racism, was at least equalled by that seen in the conduct of the Europeans, in particular that of the Development Commissioner Louis Michel, who, piquantly enough, is from Belgium. His manifest and public bias in favour of the previous incumbent, Kabila, prior to the elections at the end of July 2006 is something for which the people in the West of the country, and particularly those in the Bemba stronghold of Kinshasa, have never forgiven him’.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say to Commissioner Michel that the normal response to something like that would be to resign. As I have done before, I demand that you pay for actions by doing so. We also know, Commissioner, that a whole array of economic interests are at stake here. For example, George Forrest, a Belgian, invested USD 400 million in a copper mine in Kamato, and it seems likely – or this is what keeps on being said, at any rate – that he used this to make a considerable contribution in support of Mr Kabila’s campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">The <span class="italic">Neue Zürcher Zeitung </span>does not mince its words when it writes that Mr Kabila is making use of State resources and has received payments from foreign mining enterprises. I do not regard that as a good sign. All we can do now is to hope that the European Union really will play a neutral role. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Note that these losses have been estimated to amount to between 50 000 and 200 000 dead. However, according to UN statistics, around four million people have died during almost ten years of internal conflict in DR Congo. This is a tragic world record.</p>
<p class="contents">From an economic point of view, DR Congo is a very important country for the world economy. It has no crude oil, unlike the Middle East, but it does have a raw material which is needed for the production of mobile phones: coltan.</p>
<p class="contents">A resolution of the conflict in DR Congo is at hand. This is not thanks to a single superpower which desires to be the world’s policeman, but thanks to the UN international forces, which have often been mocked. The largest peacekeeping force in the history of the UN has been deployed in DR Congo. It consists of 17 500 young people. The elections in DR Congo have cost the international community 500 million dollars. This pales in comparison to the war in Iraq, which costs 177 million dollars just for one day.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the planned European Parliament mission will be a further step towards re-establishing order in a country which deserves to finally enjoy some peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that I do not agree with the proposal made by the previous speaker, Mr Pflüger, with reference to the dismissal of Commissioner Michel. It is far more entertaining to have Commissioner Michel here in this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Just now, Mr Morillon, to whom we must be grateful for the outstanding work he did as chief observer of the elections, once more confirmed that it would not have been possible for calm to be restored as speedily as it was had it not been for the deployment of troops – specifically Spanish and Polish troops – under European command, and I see that as the best indication of the rightness of that decision. We must, however, remain vigilant, not least in the immediately ensuing days and weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also significant that our activities in Congo should involve the civil and military powers, working closely together to manage the crisis. Commissioner Michel has just brought home to us in a powerful way what the European Union did in the past to stabilise the Congo; the securing of these elections is just one among many interventions. I am confident that the Commissioner, now that these elections are over, will continue to develop the plans that are needed if this country in the heart of Africa, which is important not least in terms of the security of Europe, is to be made even more stable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, there are a number of reasons why that is justified.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, as colleagues have said, the three million deaths in five years; there are still one thousand people a day in the Congo dying from the indirect consequences of that war.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the electoral process to enable those former belligerents to join the democratic process remains fragile, as the three days of fighting in the Congo following the publication of the preliminary first-round results demonstrates. We should do everything as a Parliament to support the process of post-conflict reconciliation and democratic transformation.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, this is an electoral process where the EU is playing a central role, as Commissioner Michel has already explained: 80% of the cost of the election is being met by the European Union, the biggest ever EU electoral observation mission in Africa and all of it backed up by an EU military mission assisting our UN partners in providing the necessary protection to enable the election to take place in peace and stability.</p>
<p class="contents">The electoral observation mission, ably led by our colleague General Morillon – whose work I commend – has made only a preliminary report and any political assessment this Parliament makes must similarly be guarded before drawing our own conclusions in this House. Yet, the Members of the European Parliament present did note the late publication of the voter rolls, the failure in many, if not most, cases for the candidate details to be posted outside the polling stations and the apparent sharp inequalities between the financial means available to different candidates and parties, together with legitimate questions as to how their money was raised.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in terms of the technical conduct of the elections, I want to emphasise the incredible commitment to the process shown by the mainly young polling officials. In Lubumbashi, where I was based, they worked non-stop throughout the night, without electricity, fuel or water; a 22-hour count conducted in large part by candlelight and where the officials slept for a few minutes by rota in their determination to enable the process to be completed fairly and accurately. I have been taking part in elections since 1979. I have never seen an election like it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, my colleague, Mr Schröder, has already made it quite clear that it was necessary to enable Commissioner Michel last week to answer on the record the questions raised with him, and that process has been completed. Tonight, I want to simply repeat my closing statement to the Commission last week and say that redoubled efforts should be made to insist on the European Union’s neutrality in this process and that the European observation mission must be specifically tasked with monitoring the allegations of bias made in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I invite the Commissioner to join with his colleague, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, to ensure that the results of this monitoring are fully evaluated, both for the second round of the elections in the Congo, and for the benefit of future European electoral missions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The euphoria of the moment, however, should not blind us to certain developments that give less cause for optimism and more cause for disquiet.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, there were the extravagant and disproportionate election campaigns waged by a handful of big players, while other candidates did not even have the absolute minimum at their disposal. The large-scale misuse of government funds meant that the playing field could hardly be described as level. Only those with funds and a private militia were able, and allowed, to take part, which begs the question of where the money came from all of a sudden.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there was the very negative campaign from a certain corner of the opposition which put itself offside. The nationalistic, patriotic discourses of those men degenerated into language with genocide overtones, and it is regrettable that other candidates adopted it as well. Major frustration even led to the reproach that the international community and the EU were taking sides. This reproach intoxicated even those politicians, who, like Tintin, had only discovered Congo, and it makes no sense whatsoever: the truth is that there would probably never have been elections in Congo had it not been for Commissioner Michel’s unstinting efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is the painful conclusion that Congo’s democratisation process remains very fragile. The events of 20 August have left a bitter aftertaste, along with the fear that a long campaign which has divided the country into West and East will, in the long term, fail to produce the stability that is hoped for. The Congolese people fortunately did not respond to the provocations. They are desperate for peace, and deserve better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Mr Howitt said, the election agents were well trained and confident about what they were doing and showed great dedication.</p>
<p class="contents">There were a few things that appeared not to be organised absolutely perfectly. For instance, there did not appear to be a coherent plan for dealing with the enormous volume of material disgorged into the compilation centres – some of it sensitive material, some of it not. It is important in the weeks up to the second round that as much is done as possible to tighten up on any procedural weaknesses, so that there can be no technical grounds for dispute at what will be a very sensitive moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we observers detected the perception in some quarters, as has been mentioned, that the EU was not neutral. It was an erroneous perception, but it could weaken the authority of the EU mission, which needs to be trusted by all sides. It could also potentially put EU election observers at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU needs to work hard in the weeks up to the second round to convince the Congolese of its neutrality. Nothing must be done that could be construed as favouring one presidential candidate over the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would stress – as did Mr Schröder – that no one must doubt how much this election matters. It matters for the Congolese, who have waited 40 years for democratic elections and who turned out in great numbers on 30 July, but it matters globally too. For example, there is a supposedly closed uranium mine in the south of the Congo from which uranium is still being mined and exported, probably to Iran. The world is not safe while there is an ungoverned hole in the heart of Africa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Louis Michel, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thought at first that I would not reply to the speeches in which some doubts were expressed about my neutrality regarding the problems in the Congo. I shall reply, however, because the comments have occasionally been very excessive.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Pflüger, I would like to tell you that your conception of the law is, let us say, too hasty. In certain non-democratic countries, we still encounter these sorts of conceptions. I thought that we were safe from such conceptions as that in Europe, in any case, and especially in a Parliament as honourable as this one, which is, effectively, the guardian of democratic values such as the right to a defence, respect for proper information and objectivity based on extensive argument.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to be very clear regarding what has been said. Mr Pflüger, all the statements that I have been making for weeks, months and even years regarding my interest in the Congo seem to have escaped you - and without doubt this is because, like others too, you have not tried to deepen your understanding of the issue. Now, I have never sided either with one candidate or the other. I still maintain very regular telephone contact with President Kabila just as much as I do with Vice-President Bemba. During the events of the 20, 21 and 22 August I intervened personally in order to calm people down, as I believe General Morillon knows. I can therefore affirm that I am in personal contact with both candidates.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, I can tell you that President Kabila reproaches us for not having reacted sufficiently when, in the course of the election campaign, candidates used arguments based on ethnicity or ‘being Congolese’ and made xenophobic statements. I must say as well that the strategy of certain candidates involving the denunciation of ‘the foreign candidate’ – this unfortunately forms part of certain practices - has evidently impressed the international community to such an extent that it has not reacted to what is obviously a worsening of the Congolese electoral debate, with argument based on ‘being Congolese’ or on one or other candidate belonging to the Congo.</p>
<p class="contents">I mention all this in order to say that I utterly and completely reject the accusations of partiality that certain people have levelled at me. I could show you more than ten interviews I have given to European or Congolese newspapers that express my perfect neutrality. I have reproached President Kabila just as much as I have reproached Vice-President Bemba and other candidates on the electoral lists.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Van Hecke has had the intellectual honesty to be more thorough in the remarks he has made. Thus, several months ago I also spent a whole afternoon in the house of Mr Tshisekedi, urging him to get his supporters to register and even urging him to make use of his right to be a candidate because I thought, and I still think, that Mr Tshisekedi is a man of experience who knows the Congo well, a man with a programme that could have been revealed in order to improve the political debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking into account what I have just said, Mr Pflüger, it is a little thoughtless to accuse me of being partial simply because one day during a broadcast, in response to the question ‘what does a candidate like Mr Kabila represent?’, I answered ‘the hope of the Congo.’ If I had been asked ‘what does a candidate like Mr Bemba represent?’, I would have answered ‘the hope of the Congo’, because all those who take part in an election represent the hope of their country, in this case above all because it was the first time that an election was being held. I therefore find your tunnel vision particularly excessive. You accuse me, for example – and if we were in the Belgian national Parliament I would have immediately reacted by appealing to the Rules of Procedure in order to respond to personal comments – of protecting Belgian economic interests. Which Belgian economic interests?</p>
<p class="contents">One of the serious problems facing the Congo is the lack of interest from foreign investors. Moreover, it is legitimate enough for any country, for any business to deem that it has the right to seek economic or commercial partnerships with any other country, on condition that it ensures that natural resources are respected, that it prevents these resources from being pillaged – this is what foreign forces have done for a very long time and what internal forces are still doing today – and on condition that it respects basic economic ethics, a factor that, unfortunately or fortunately, must be taken into account in the open world with which we are familiar.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore ask the question: which economic interests? Today, the economic interests that I encounter in the Congo are Chinese, Indian, Israeli, American. This is not a reproach, not a critique, but I find few, very few European economic interests, Mr Pflüger. The truth has rights, and I must tell you that I would hope that European businesses would invest in a country like the Congo. It needs such investment.</p>
<p class="contents">You made reference to a Belgian business that has developed in the copper sector. I suppose you are referring to the business owned by Mr Forrest. I cite this because it was pointed out that one of my sons was married to Mr Forrest’s daughter, that they were directors of Mr Forrest’s companies and that I was therefore related to Mr Forrest. In my life I have only met Mr Forrest three times for a few seconds, and I was in the company of a Belgian parliamentary delegation. Mr Forrest creates 630 jobs through his company; he creates hospitals and schools: a whole social system is developing there. I am not defending Mr Forrest personally; I do not know if he is honest or not, I am simply observing. What I do know is that a Belgian journalist carried out an investigation on Mr Forrest and that he became a supporter of Mr Forrest, simply because he creates jobs. Out of the 630 people whom he employs in his business, there are 600 Congolese. I am not defending Mr Forrest, I do not know him well, I have met him three times in my life for a few seconds. I have therefore had enough of this sort of attack which – it has to be said – borders on nastiness and which I cannot let pass.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you of one thing: I am completely impartial, I have contacts with everyone in the Congo and I am proud of having doubtless been one of the first - well before 1999, when I was still leader of the opposition in my country - to try to mobilise the international community to finally take an interest in this country. Why? Simply because, as someone said in this House, there have been almost 4 million victims in Central Africa in ten years. This figure cannot be compared with those of other world conflicts. That is why I have always thought that it was my duty as a politician to concern myself with the Congo. That is true, Mr Pflüger.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason why I am so engaged in the Congo is that I am Belgian and thus, in a way, I feel inspired by a kind of historical memory. As a Belgian, it is not so much that I felt responsible, but rather I felt indebted to the Congolese population. It is thus true that I feel a particular attachment to the Congolese population, without doubt because I have this recollection of a certain collective bad conscience and because I still have this old conception of morality which consists of rereading the history of my country and of my people in an intellectually honest way. This is why, when I was the Foreign Affairs Minister, we visited the Rwandans to apologise. This is something that others have not done yet, and I regret this. This is the reason why, as regards the political assassination of Mr Lumumba for example, I also apologised in the name of my country to Mr Lumumba’s family. I do not therefore need a lesson in ethics, and you may organise all the investigations you wish into my activities. The same people who claimed that I was biased have also claimed that I was the owner of a diamond mine in the Congo, that I bought a villa on the river - in short, it is all gossip-mongering.</p>
<p class="contents">The only excuse you have for such an excessive reaction - and this does not correspond with my definition of intellectual honesty - is that you do not, I think, know the Congo very well. Perhaps you have been to the Congo, perhaps not, I do not know, but in any case you have an image of the Congo partially distorted by the excesses of certain parties who use any old argument in the campaign. There is populism in the Congo too, it exists everywhere, it even exists in our countries. Sometimes it even exists in this Parliament, and I regret this.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what I meant about neutrality: hearing a chorus of people repeating that the Commission is not neutral is ultimately tiresome. To the accusation: ‘you have not been neutral’, I reply: ‘we have been perfectly neutral’. Mr Kabila is annoyed with me because we did not denounce the excesses in the debate on ‘being Congolese’; Mr Bemba is annoyed with me because, in my capacity as Foreign Affairs Minister and as Commissioner, I would meet President Kabila. When I go to the Congo, whom do you want me to speak to if not the head of state. Of course it was necessary for me to meet Mr Kabila. However, if there is one thing that proves my neutrality, it is that I have never been to the Congo, not once, without meeting Mr Kabila and the four Vice-Presidents who make up the presidential milieu. I have taken my sense of neutrality even further. I have systematically sought contact with Mr Tshisekedi. Somebody mentioned women; I have met representatives from the whole of civil society, I have met everyone. It is true that I am probably someone who has quite an important network of information in the Congo, and I pride myself on having been able to play a modest role in the transitional process.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, people bore grudges against me because I supported the transitional process until the end, but there was no solution other than to support this process. Mr Tshisekedi and the UDPS, who denounced the transitional process, had signed the Pretoria Agreement, they had signed the Agreement underpinning the transitional process. Afterwards, I had the impression that this party chose the policy of making things worse, that it had decided that the transition was not going to succeed, so that an alternative was needed and that this was the best way to gain power. Personally, I can do nothing. I do not think I can be blamed for the fact that the party withdrew from a process that it had supported and to which it had signed up. I simply hoped that all the active political forces would participate in the election. Unfortunately this did not occur, and I regret this.</p>
<p class="contents">This chapter is now closed. If I truly felt that I should resign, I would not wait for anyone to ask me. Perhaps I am a little old-fashioned in this respect. I still believe in political responsibility, but this sense of responsibility should work both ways: it should affect the person who has responsibility and the person who exposes the way in which that responsibility has been exercised. Now, if you criticise the way in which someone has exercised political responsibility, your criticism should be based on real points. You cannot just say anything. I am prepared to argue for a long time about this and I cannot accept the accusations made against me. These affect me deeply because, for years now, the basic intention underlying my political commitment has been, precisely, to try to help this fine country and fine people to escape from the poverty and confusion towards which – it has to be said - the international community has shown complete indifference, if not disdain.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the army, I have noted what was said with great interest and I obviously agree for the most part with the various speeches that have been made. I agree with Mrs Gomes when she says that the reform of the army will be an extremely important point. More or less half of this reform has already been achieved. I would simply like to point out that it was necessary to reduce the army concerned, or rather the assemblage of different troops and militias amounting to roughly 330 000 soldiers – I do not know if you can imagine this - down to 100 000 men, also taking into account the fact that, for example, the process of demobilisation and reintegration attracted fake soldiers who joined in because they wanted to profit from this process. To reduce such an army is therefore much more easily said than done. It is easy to talk about but difficult to achieve, and a certain amount of time is required in order to carry out this process properly. I hope that the international community will continue with its commitment to aid the Congo and to reform its army. The same applies to the police. Substantial progress has, moreover, already been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schröder, I agree with almost all of what you have said and I would also like to thank you for the balanced nature of your comments with respect to the aforementioned subject. Even so, when you say that we should not debate the Congo at the moment, I myself believe that we should debate it. I think that the second round can succeed if the international community tells both candidates unequivocally that they do not have the right to sabotage the second round because that would be to insult the Congolese people’s passion for democracy. The attitude of the Congolese, this people’s enthusiasm about its historic meeting with democracy has been beautiful to see and has been the best recompense for all the European Union’s efforts. I think we must talk about this. In fact, we must not stop repeating that the second round must not be a failure and that whoever is beaten must respect the result. Whoever is beaten will also have his role to play, and the winner will have to take this into account. This is my personal conviction. Perhaps people will again reproach me for exceeding the bounds of strict neutrality, but my personal conviction is that whoever wins must have the wisdom not to act as if the other candidate did not count or as if he represented nothing. That is the approach he will have to adopt in order to revive the Congo. This is my profound belief, and the leader of the opposition will also have his role to play.</p>
<p class="contents">Without any sycophancy, I would to like to congratulate General Morillon for the way in which he has carried out the election observation mission up to now. I believe that he deserves a lot of credit: he has carried out his mission under extremely difficult conditions; with his considerable experience he has succeeded in seeing things in context when it has been necessary not to be absolutist, in being severe when it was necessary to be severe, and, in any case, in remaining rigorous and never straying from his course. I would genuinely like to thank him and to congratulate him.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Aubert, you have asked me the following question, and with very good reason: ‘What do you plan to do?’ As I recall, this is the main point of your speech. The real response is based on what we have already debated in this House. I think that, more than ever, we must suggest and encourage projects of good governance in the Congo. You mentioned, for example, the correct and appropriate use of natural resources. We all know that the Congo is in fact a very rich country. It is creditworthy, as they say, it is a country that could ensure the prosperity and well-being of its population. The Congo has everything. In the first place, it has its people and extremely important human resources. In my view, what is needed is to recreate a genuine state, a state in the governmental sense of the word, with a working judiciary and administration, with people who are paid and who receive their salaries and with a working education system and a working health care system. I have spoken with both candidates and I have told them: rather than arguing about how Congolese you are and about all these subordinate issues which, at base, only concern your own personal interests, it would perhaps be more worthwhile to tell the Congolese how you plan to give them better access to education, justice, health, administration, culture and infrastructures; and also how you are, for example, to implement an embryonic social security system with the help of the international community. This is the real debate.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(The President asked the speaker to conclude)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I think that what I have just said corresponds very closely to the conclusion I wanted to offer.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I apologise for having lost track of the time. I thought that it was important to set the record straight on a number of points and to specify my hopes concerning the second round of these elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
