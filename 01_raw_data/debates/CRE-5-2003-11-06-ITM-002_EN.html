Naturally, we cannot deal with the mid-term social policy agenda review established in Nice in her absence. Incidentally, it is nice to see that Mr Fischler is present, and therefore the Commission too.</p>
<p class="contents">I would have liked to have had her answers, particularly because we had already discussed the mid-term social policy agenda review with her in our committee. Nevertheless, there were still a number of questions left unanswered, and that is why we are putting these questions verbally today, without a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">The Nice social agenda is very important for the perfectly simple reason that Europe and European citizens are expecting the social side of Europe to develop further after the introduction and coming into force of EMU, the euro, and the stability and growth pact. This is indeed necessary; it not only costs money, it also delivers benefits; this has been clearly demonstrated by the Commission in its study. This agenda naturally includes creating more and better jobs, anticipating working environments, fighting poverty and social exclusion, modernising social protection, promoting gender equality and ultimately social policy as part of enlargement. At the end of my speech I would like to ask a few questions which we would like the Commission to answer.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, I note that the European Parliament has already expressed its objections relating to this social agenda three times during the annual scoreboards. Each time, we asked that attention be paid to the points brought forward by Parliament – some existing points relating to the social agenda, some new points connected with current events, such as the events currently taking place at Ford Genk. In other words, therefore, we are asking for the new policy initiatives to be properly implemented, but also for an indication as to the means by which this will be done. We are also of the opinion that there is often a great deal more to be done – including legislative activities – than is currently being done: deliberation, consultation, expert groups etc., all of which takes time.</p>
<p class="contents">When I came in here, I thought we were going to deal with the European works council, but this will still not have happened by the time I leave, and it may not even happen during the next legislature. This is causing us problems all the time in practice; today's debate is proof of that!</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, we are not satisfied with the way in which a number of proposals on this agenda are being dealt with at the moment, and I would like to list a few examples. The most important is naturally the question of the European works council. We have already let it be known that we believe that consultations have been going on long enough, including in the area of social dialogue. The partners have had more than enough time to exercise influence on this. Now it is time for measures! We had already expected these in 2002, but they have still not arrived! This is in fact nothing new for the Commission, and it is nothing new for the Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to the working time directive. We asked that attention be paid to this area as well. At the moment, a number of countries in Europe are avoiding the working time regulations, and that is exactly what we do not want, as it distorts competition. We want to see measures introduced in this regard, and as soon as possible! The Commission should take the initiative on this point, and it should do so quicker than is currently the case. We could go on like this for a while, including with regard to aspects such as the new occupational diseases. I could give you a whole list of rapporteurs we have had on this subject: Mrs Van Lancker, Mrs Smet, Mrs Hermange and finally Mrs Figueiredo. New occupational diseases, the social sides of competition policy, intervention procedures in the area of the delocalisation of companies; we have been asking for these for some time now. These points seem to be repeatedly left off the agenda, however.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as social and fiscal measures are concerned, we want to put the effects these have on cross-border working on the agenda as soon as possible. We want the regulations to address the question of gender inequality. We could go on like this; the legal basis for what we call the ‘civil dialogue’ is also one of these points. In other words, what I said was not yet exhaustive. Taking all this into consideration, we would like to ask the following two questions:</p>
<p class="contents">How does the Commission intend to use its right of initiative (in other words its right to take active steps) to implement the social policy agenda, both with regard to the old points and with regard to the points we have put forward on behalf of the European Parliament? In doing so, we must bear in mind that these should contribute to creating full employment, the fight against social dumping and discrimination and improving the quality of employment in Europe. That is our first question.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second question is this: How does the Commission envisage improving employment and social policy after the enlargement of the EU? We have been highlighting the problems in detail for some time, including the follow-up and implementation of the legislation, the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>and the development of social dialogue. These are not easy subjects for the accession countries. In this connection, I would also like attention to be paid to progress in European employment strategy and the use of the open coordination methods with regard to social exclusion and social protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As you are aware, the Nice European Council laid down the social policy agenda. It was also agreed that a mid-term review should be carried out in 2003, the object of which was to be to target more specifically the actions and measures considered necessary and to present a timetable for the second half of the period ending in 2005. The mid-term review, adopted by the Commission at the end of June, is based on an overall evaluation of the first years of implementation, which have been the subject of annual reports in scoreboards and on a review of the most significant challenges and of the drivers of change. The review also sets out the Commission’s thinking as regards the realisation of the EU’s overall objectives, and the creation of more and better jobs and also greater social cohesion, all within the context of the further pursuit of the Lisbon strategy. The Commission has announced a comprehensive package of initiatives and actions, in which all the relevant actors will be involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say, in response to your two questions, that the Commission is using its right of initiative to propose the specific measures that are required and that have been announced in the mid-term review. These include, for example, new draft legislation, such as the proposal for a directive on temporary workers, or the simplification of existing ones, such as those in the area of health and safety at work. The Commission is also availing itself of its right to consult the social partners and to join with them in discovering those problem areas that still remain to be attended to. One of them, for example, is the issue of the portability of occupational pension rights. Another is the following-up of the revision of the Working Time Directive. This has to do with the European employment strategy, in particular with the proposals for guidelines and recommendations relating to it. At the same time, the Commission is encouraging the Member States to work together in modernising social security and promoting social inclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards your second question, I have to stress that the mid-term review’s priorities as regards the structuring of the next few years’ work are twofold. One is to further develop the agenda for an enlarged European Union. The other is, as a matter of priority, to monitor the transposition and implementation of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>in employment and social affairs and to ensure that this is done properly. In order that this goal may be achieved, it will be necessary to pay particular attention to involving the relevant networks of national representatives, who are to perform a supporting role in transposing and implementing European law, and also to make use of the monitoring instruments still at our disposal. Although the primary emphasis will be on assistance and advice, the Commission will not hesitate to apply appropriate enforcement measures or, where appropriate, to take legal action. That applies, though, not only to the new Member States that will be joining the European Union next year, but to all the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Smet (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(NL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your answer. When I look at the social policy agenda and see where we are at the moment – we are mid-term – we are a year away from elections, and enlargement is also just around the corner. I think that we cannot avoid taking this into account.</p>
<p class="contents">If we have to choose between the priorities, then for me, enlargement is the top priority. There are numerous social directives. We are encouraging the development of social dialogue. We are encouraging the creation of administrations, services and institutions that can guarantee social security in these countries. We all know that despite the fact that these countries are acceding, it is still very difficult to implement a large number of these aspects. If this implementation does not go well, if social dialogue does not take place, if there are insufficient institutions in place to apply all of this, this will cause a delay everywhere. Including here. It goes without saying that this will entail a delay. After all, you cannot simply concoct a whole series of new directives when the countries that are joining next year – thus creating a global Union of 25 countries – are unable to comply with a particular dimension of this European Union. It is extremely important for social policy to develop in the enlargement countries. It is developing much too slowly and on much too narrow a scale. I therefore believe that this is a top priority, because it will adversely affect the growth of social policy at a European level, whether we like it or not.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second priority is employment. I think that the Commission is making a good choice, including in its priorities. I agree with that. As we can all see, the things that were proposed in Lisbon, namely an employment level of 70% and so on, are progressing extremely slowly. When the new countries join, employment levels will naturally fall, not increase. We will therefore be even further away from the Lisbon targets than we are at the moment. The whole policy surrounding employment must be stimulated and supported.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is a third point: the review of certain directives. I think we can do that, for example the review of the Renault directive, the review of the works council directive, even the review of the directive relating to health and safety at work. A great number of our directives need to be reviewed. For me, that is the third priority that we could introduce. If we want new directives, we will really have to make choices and establish priorities. We are no longer in a position to introduce 40 new directives, not even 10. I think we must limit this and I think that one of the priorities in new directives should be to do something for the disabled. We have already had an extensive debate on this. This social group still has a difficult time accessing the labour market. I think that we need to regulate a number of things specifically for them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is full of hot air with very little substance. There are a range of issues outstanding. We now have a three-year delay in the revision of the European Works Council Directive, despite the recent occurrences at Genk and a whole series of earlier problems. There is a blockage in Council on the temporary agency workers directive, a vital part of our effort to balance security and flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a very uncertain timetable around the revision of the working time directive and an end to the scandalous abuse of the opt-out in my own country. There is an outstanding call from Parliament for a directive on individual dismissals and the social security aspects of atypical working: no action on those fronts has been taken at all.</p>
<p class="contents">I also share Mrs Smet's concerns over enlargement, the <span class="italic">acquis</span>, the application of the <span class="italic">acquis</span> – particularly in the area of occupational safety and health, the development of social dialogue, open coordination in the European Union as it will be this time next year. All of these things are causing us deep concern and we have seen little, if any, action on all of these important issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make it clear that we fully understand the pressures and the obstacles being put in the way of Commissioner Diamantopoulou and her efforts to deliver on these important issues. Some of these come from inside the college of Commissioners, some from Council, some involve governments of a socialist complexion.</p>
<p class="contents">All I can say is that we will redouble our efforts to try to ensure that we support her in overcoming those obstacles and moving the social agenda forward. That is vitally important. Unless we can deliver and move the social agenda forward, there is a very real danger that the overall, carefully-balanced policy mix established at Lisbon will be destroyed. If that happens it will be a major disaster for the future of the whole of the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know that there are more than 15 million unemployed people in the European Union and more than 60 million who live on less than 60% of the average national income. These are problems that mainly affect women, but also the elderly living on very low pensions, immigrants, children, people with disabilities and workers in insecure and badly paid jobs. The situation is considerably worse in the candidate countries that will be joining the Union in May next year.</p>
<p class="contents">In light of this worsening socio-economic situation, measures must be adopted that are different to those used to date, because disparities have increased, cohesion has weakened and no real progress has been made as regards gender equality policy. The current situation calls for absolute priority no longer to be given to complying with the Stability Pact and, on the contrary, for this to be suspended so that its irrational criteria for nominal convergence can be reviewed. The current situation calls for the primacy of monetarist and competition policies to be ended and for resolving these serious social problems to be put on the agenda, for compliance with the Social Policy Agenda and for an effective public investment policy in order to create the fifteen million jobs that the European Union needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, as stated in my recent report on implementing the Social Policy Agenda, which this plenary adopted in September, priority must be given to solving the serious problems of unemployment and poverty – including persistent poverty – in all Community policies, specifically in competition policy (and since the Commissioner responsible for the common agricultural policy is here with us, this could at least help us to look at farming issues and here too amend policy, with a view to combating poverty and social exclusion), not forgetting the Structural Funds and the Stability Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">We regret the fact that the Commission is not only failing to comply with the Nice social agenda, but also still has no plans to present new initiatives in areas already requested by the European Parliament, which has insisted that these be drawn up rapidly. This is a long list, which other speakers have already referred to, but which we also adopted at the sitting of 3 September and for which I once again express my support, in addition to agreeing with all the questions that have been put here. I repeat the need for effective measures, for mechanisms for intervention in the field of company relocations, and of the directives on Article 13, both with regard to women’s rights in all the various areas of employment and to people with disabilities. We must make good the delays in improving the directives intended to promote health and safety in the workplace, specifically for women, and the proposals that this Parliament has approved must be implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The introduction of the EU’s socio-political legislation on the working environment and labour law will mean a very great deal for wage earners in the new Member States. It will also, however, mean something for the present Member States. The risk of social dumping between our countries will be much reduced, something that is incredibly important.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important issue in connection with enlargement is the dialogue between the two sides of industry. In many of the new Member States, there is no dialogue up and running, and no employers and employees used to participating together in the socio-political agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">A third issue is the Lisbon cooperation, which we must review and stick to. This must not, however, mean that we do not put forward proposals in new areas, for example in the area of the working environment in response, for example, to atypical jobs. We must therefore cope successfully both with enlargement and with new risks and new socio-political challenges. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is incomprehensible that the evaluation of this directive has not been seized as an opportunity to better assess the problems of cross-border employment of workers and to take new initiatives in this area. Enlargement is just around the corner, and I have already told Commissioner Verheugen and Commissioner Diamantopolou that this transitional period is absolutely not a solution to the problems that enlargement may bring with it. We must pursue a proactive policy and we must create better conditions for active workforce mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">My fellow MEP Stephen Hughes has already mentioned the temporary agency workers directive. The impasse we have reached in this area must naturally not be taken as a reason for not doing anything else in areas relating to the situation of non-typical jobs, including in connection with this directive. I am thinking of the position of the self-employed who are not actually self-employed but are in fact employees, for example, and the social security of the non-typical employee. If we do not create a better framework of definitions and labour and social regulations in Europe, this social <span class="italic">acquis</span> will soon only apply to a small minority of employees, and they will not be the ones who need it most!</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a word of warning. I think that if we do not manage to implement this social policy in Europe, a lot of people will turn against Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Basically, the one thing I can tell you is that I share your view, firstly, of the enormous significance of the policy set out in what we term the Lisbon targets, and also of the tasks we are presented with in the field of future social policy. I also agree with you that it is now in particular, so to speak on the eve of enlargement, necessary that we have to give particular attention to how these issues fit into this context, and, like you, I believe that this is a matter of urgency. Fundamentally, I believe, we have to continue to take action on both fronts, for we must not overlook the close connection between issues of employment and social security and the question of whether we will succeed in recreating proper growth in Europe. That is one of the basic conditions, and we will bring about growth of this only if we take appropriate action regarding the various elements that are necessary if our European economy is to be restructured.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, though, it should not be thought that this is only about growth, in other words, only about the economy; it is also, of course, about social protection. I have already told you in my opening remarks what the Commission’s current plans are. I hope that these measures will indeed enable us to make the necessary improvements to the situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
