<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">González Álvarez (GUE/NGL),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (ES)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as indicated by the President, this is the second reading of a common position established by the Council on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from new vehicles. We must remember that the intention behind this second reading is to meet the Kyoto objectives, subsequently approved in Bonn, of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. We continue to feel that these objectives are modest. Given the Environment Agency’s report which stated that emissions must be reduced by 30%, the proposed objectives are definitely modest. However, we are pleased with this common position which is heading in the right direction of preventing new cars from emitting increasing amounts of carbon dioxide.</p>
<p class="contents">At first reading, 45 amendments were tabled in the Committee on the Environment. They were approved by a large majority. Of these 45 amendments, 29 were adopted in plenary. The Council should be thanked for having included a large proportion of these 29 amendments in the common position. However, there are 10 amendments which we are tabling again as they were approved, with just one abstention, by over 40 votes in the Committee on the Environment. These amendments concern some of the issues which, at first reading, seemed important to the majority of the Committee on the Environment. Some only involve a change of words, such as Amendment No 1, which states that greenhouse gases, in this case carbon dioxide, should not just be stabilised but also reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 2 proposes monitoring on an objective basis. We have made a small change to this at the Commission’s suggestion.</p>
<p class="contents">In Amendment No 3 we indicate the legal framework which should be provided in case the voluntary agreements fail. I would remind you that this House in general, and the Committee on the Environment in particular, has little faith in effective results being achieved by voluntary agreements. This is why we propose establishing a legal framework.</p>
<p class="contents">We also mention tax incentives and the inclusion of commercial vehicles. The latter must not be omitted from the proposal given that they are responsible for a significant proportion of carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">We propose a change to the method of data collection if results are not achieved within a certain period of time. The Council’s common position itself mentions that the Member States have a variety of data collection proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we ask for a report on the operation of this method for December 2002. At the suggestion of the Commission, we have also made a small change to this. We would have liked this report by June 2002 but we have accepted December in order to allow more time.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report which the Commission must present to the Council and the European Parliament, we also want an analysis of whether the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions is due to the technical measures of industrialists or to consumer habits.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 10, which the Commission and Council accept, refers to the weight and size of cars.</p>
<p class="contents">We thank the Council and Commission for having accepted certain amendments. However, we must insist on some of these 10 amendments which we are tabling again because they were approved practically unanimously, with one abstention, in the Committee on the Environment. Even the Commission and Council representatives have said that they are still studying some of these amendments, for example the one on tax incentives and the inclusion of commercial vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore feel that these amendments are simply supporting this study process of the Commission and Council on, for example, tax incentives and commercial vehicles. These are easy amendments for the Commission and Council to accept. We are perfectly well aware of the difficulties faced by the Council in convincing the fifteen Member States of a proposal of this nature. Yet we must say that, having consulted practically all the groups, they stress that we must keep these amendments and so I defend the proposal from the Committee on the Environment.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The original Commission proposal sought to set up a monitoring system to provide reliable information on CO2 emissions from new cars. The proposal forms part of the European Community strategy to reduce CO2 emissions and fuel consumption. Other elements of this strategy are an agreement with the automobile industry on reducing CO2 emissions by a certain deadline and a fuel consumption labelling system in order to make it easier for consumers to choose a new car.</p>
<p class="contents">This strategy is certainly a logical one because we know that about half of all CO2 emissions are caused by traffic; however, we should also note that about 12% of all CO2 emissions are emitted in the European Union and about 88% in the rest of the world. The Council of Ministers has adopted a number of amendments tabled by the European Parliament at first reading which strengthen the original Commission proposal. These amendments refer, for example, to the Kyoto protocol, the importance of collecting data so that the voluntary agreement to reduce CO2 emissions from cars by 2003 can be properly monitored, the European Commission’s undertaking to report on the monitoring data forwarded by Member States to the European Parliament and, finally, some additions to the information to be forwarded. We therefore welcome the Council’s common position. If we are to create an efficient monitoring system without too much delay, we need to adopt this proposal as quickly as possible. The decision could then enter into force this year. That would mean that the year 2000 would be the first year for which data then needed to be compiled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to do so, we need to consider briefly why this directive has even been tabled. Surely not because it is fun to collect data; enough data is being collected already. No, it is because we have concluded a voluntary agreement with the motor industry. That is the first time that we have done so at European level. We need to have instruments so that we can monitor this undertaking. That is why we have tabled this directive and that is why this directive needs to be a suitable instrument which really can be used for monitoring purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">There are therefore three points, I think, which need to be included in the directive and in this respect I support the excellent work carried out by the rapporteur. First: we must make it clear that if the monitoring data show that the voluntary undertaking does not work, then legislation will follow. In other words, there needs to be a link between monitoring and legislation if the figures prove unequivocally that the undertakings are not being complied with. That needs to be added.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: we also need clear rules on using the data. It is no good filing the data and leaving the files locked away in a cupboard somewhere. They must be the basis in 2002 for monitoring the voluntary undertaking. We need an independent data register for monitoring the voluntary undertaking and I feel that this needs to be clearly stated in the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: the voluntary undertaking by the motor industry, both in Europe and in Japan and Korea, refers to technical measures to reduce CO2 through better engines, lighter vehicles etc. That also needs to be monitored. If CO2 consumption drops due to changes in purchasing patterns, because suddenly we all want to buy three-litre cars, then that is something else. We therefore need a clear division between technical measures and consumer patterns and this too needs to be integrated into the directive so that this instrument really can be used in line with the intention which brought about the directive in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">So let us add these three points to the directive so that we have a proper, efficient instrument for monitoring this voluntary agreement which, after all, is an experiment for the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is in fact in all the parties’ interests that this decision should be taken without further delay so that we might set in motion an objective monitoring of the environmental agreements which have been made with the car industry. </p>
<p class="contents">Mrs González Álvarez pointed out in her recommendation that the common position contains many of the points of view which the European Parliament presented in its first reading. As Mrs Schleicher said, Mrs Flemming has stated that she could accept the common position without any further changes.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we should be clear that it will only be possible for this decision to come into force during 1999 if the common position is accepted in its current version. Otherwise, we shall lose a whole calendar year in which we could be collecting data. </p>
<p class="contents">Where the Amendments which have been submitted are concerned, we can give our full support to three proposals for possible improvements to the common position, namely Amendment No 3, part 1, together with Amendment Nos 7 and 10. We can also support a number of further Amendments in principle: Amendment No 2 and Amendment No 4, part 2, together with Amendment No 9, even if we consider that they need to be reformulated. </p>
<p class="contents">I want briefly to talk about the justifications behind the position adopted by the Commission. First and foremost, I want to comment on Amendment No 2 about also allowing other motor vehicles to be covered by the decision. As a consequence of the desire expressed by the European Parliament at the first reading, the Commission is at present taking the first steps to include light goods vehicles’ fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions in the legislation concerning type approval. This applies therefore to vehicles in category M1. The Commission will then see if it is possible to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from such vehicles. The Commission agrees that vehicles in category M1 are the most important target group for such measures. There are therefore no plans at present to look into the question of whether other types of vehicle might be included, mainly because vehicles such as lorries are expected in any case to be highly fuel-efficient or because the contribution of, for example, two-wheeled vehicles to local carbon dioxide emissions is not great. It is the Commission’s intention to take account of these factors and to reformulate the proposed text in the following way: “The Commission is to investigate the possibility of submitting appropriate proposals concerning harmonised procedures for measuring the specific carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles in category M1 in accordance with Annex No 3 to Directive 70/156.”</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to Amendment No 4, part 2 concerning other parts of the strategy in respect of carbon dioxide and vehicles, we consider that the first part of that Amendment is almost entirely covered by justification 6 in the common position. We cannot accept this part of the Amendment because it ought to include a reference to the Community objective of 120 g/km. The year by which this objective is to be achieved, namely 2010, has however been left out of the European Parliament’s Amendment. In the second part of the proposed justification, reference is made to the second and third pillars in the strategy concerning carbon dioxide and private cars and, specifically, to consumer information and the employment of tax measures. The directive concerning consumer information was adopted by the European Parliament at the second reading on 4 November of this year and may therefore be considered to have been accepted in accordance with the common position. There is therefore no reason to refer to this matter again. Because tax measures are an important factor in the strategy, it may well be worth including a reference to these. In view of the fact that the Commission is already in the process of investigating the possibility of a frame of reference, the proposed justification ought to reflect this situation in a correct manner. The Commission proposes another variant, worded as follows: “The Commission is investigating the possibility of introducing a frame of reference for tax measures which may encourage the use of fuel-efficient private cars.” </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendment No 9 concerning the content of the annual report, the rapporteur wants to add a new Article to clarify what the annual report is to contain. The report is to include an analysis of the extent to which changes in carbon dioxide emissions depend upon manufacturers’ initiatives or upon factors which have to do with the strategy concerning carbon dioxide and cars. An analysis of this kind is important for discovering whether manufacturers are in fact carrying out the tasks to which they have committed themselves within the framework of the environmental agreement. This is the case, for example, in relation to the partial objectives which have been set for the year 2003 and naturally also in relation to the final objectives for the year 2008. However, an analysis of this kind requires a major effort in developing relevant methods and technical research, as well as intensive discussions with the manufacturers. It will also take some years before it is apparent whether any developments worth mentioning have in fact taken place. The Commission will therefore probably not act upon the first assessment until the time limits for the partial and final objectives have expired. This ought to be reflected in the text of the decision. We therefore propose the following reformulation. I quote: “In the reports for the year by which the partial objective is to have been achieved and for the year by which the final objective is to have been achieved, it shall be stated whether the reductions are due to technical measures taken by the manufacturers or whether there are other reasons, such as a change in behaviour on the part of consumers.” </p>
<p class="contents">We have difficulty in accepting the remaining Amendments, that is to say Amendment No 1, Amendment No 3, part 2, Amendment No 4, part 1 and Amendments Nos 5, 6 and 8 which neither improve nor clarify the text. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to say a few words about Amendment No 3, part 2. Here, it is prescribed that the Commission is to compose a legal framework for environmental agreements. I want to emphasise that the European Parliament’s involvement in the environmental agreements is a crucial issue for me. As I have already explained before the plenary sitting on 3 November, I do not intend to present any new proposals for environmental agreements as long as the European Parliament’s role remains undecided. We are therefore now putting together a general document concerning environmental agreements, their legal framework and the institutional procedures relating to them. When it comes to such agreements as have already been made, or are in the process of being made, for reducing carbon dioxide emissions from private cars, the Commission has, on a number of occasions, pointed out that legislation concerning the limits for carbon dioxide emissions will be considered if the car industry does not fulfil its commitments. Now would not be the appropriate time, however, to introduce the technical preparations for such legislation. This would be to send out the wrong message to industry. </p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, I should like to say that I am very satisfied with the fact that the common position has, on the whole, obtained such a positive reception from the rapporteur and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. I hope now that this House can offer its support so that the decision can be taken as quickly as possible. We shall then have the opportunity to monitor in sufficient detail the way in which the environmental agreements concluded with the car industry are being implemented. If plenary considers it necessary to submit more Amendments, the Commission is, in certain cases, prepared to support them, either in full or in principle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
