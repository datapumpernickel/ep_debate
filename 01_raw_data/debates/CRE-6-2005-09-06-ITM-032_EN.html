<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Salvador Garriga Polledo (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, Mr President–in–Office of the Council — who is no longer present — Commissioner, it is not usual to hold a debate on an amending budget. In fact, other amending budgets are presented in this Parliament without any debate, even when the financial sum involved is greater.</p>
<p class="contents">We should recall that this amending budget for aid for the tsunami has required two different trialogues. It took up a significant part of the conciliation procedure of 22 June and furthermore, it has led to long and complicated discussions amongst the three institutions. I must acknowledge the efforts made by the President–in–Office of the Council at the time, particularly since he is British, and the British are very tough negotiators. I must recognise that he showed a degree of flexibility without which it would not have been possible to reach an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">A solution has always been sought on the basis of the Council’s original position, which was completely unacceptable to the other two institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission originally presented a proposal for the funding of aid for the reconstruction of the countries affected by the tsunami which we in Parliament considered to be acceptable and logical. I recognise that if the Council had shown greater flexibility from the outset, we would be in a position to vote today for the European Commission’s original proposal. This is because the European Parliament had faith in the Commission’s proposal despite the fact that it involved reprogramming, which also has its drawbacks, as our colleagues in the Committee on Development quite rightly pointed out. We in the Committee on Budgets believed that such reprogramming was inevitable, but we demanded that it be confined to the Asia programmes or that, at least, the duration of the aid scheduled be extended.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, both the European Parliament’s statement and the statement by the Council in January of this year said that none of that EUR 350 million, which amounts to the bulk of the reconstruction aid, could be financed from the budgetary headings already committed. To put it another way — and this is what the Committee on Budgets and this rapporteur have been saying throughout. The new financial resources are necessary in order to fund new external commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">This was our main point of disagreement with the Council and the reason for so many failed negotiations. The outcome has been that it has taken nine months to adopt a final decision. It has unfortunately taken that long to reach a decision on the mobilisation of all of this aid in order to present it for the approval of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council intended to finance part of this reconstruction aid by sacrificing programmes already established by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the agreement has been reached at the expense of the emergency reserve, which was the solution proposed more modestly by the Commission in order to gain the agreement of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Parliament insisted in particular on the mobilisation of the flexibility reserve but, in the end, we have decided to accept a proposal mobilising the emergency reserve to a greater degree than we felt was prudent.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us hope that there will be no need to mobilise any more than the sum currently available in the emergency reserve during the last few months of 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">The President–in–Office of the Council said in the previous debate that he is optimistic about the additional EUR 13 million that we have to fund in 2005. I too am optimistic, since, as the report makes very clear, we still have EUR 293 million in the flexibility reserve to mobilise. I am therefore sure that we will be able to find that 13 million in the flexibility instrument because at this stage we feel it is unrealistic to think that 13 million can be obtained in the final budgetary implementation of 2005. What is more, I do not believe I would be able to present a proposal of that nature in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, what is clear is that the European Union may well be top of the league when it comes to issuing important and solemn declarations which affect all of the institutions and represent a commitment in the external field. Unfortunately, the Union is in bottom place when it comes to turning the declarations it signs so solemnly into financial commitments. I hope we draw all the possible conclusions and lessons from this process and that, from now on, we can act much more quickly when it comes to unblocking aid to other countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Reimer Böge (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, we heard earlier some very statesmanlike things from the British Presidency of the Council about the demands of foreign policy, accompanied by some calculations with virtual figures, but, as regards the compromise that has emerged from negotiations and that we unfortunately have to discuss today, I agree entirely with what was said by Mr Garriga Polledo in his capacity as rapporteur on the amending budget, namely that it does in fact stand in contradiction not only to these statesmanlike utterances but also, for example, to the response to this great catastrophe heralded by the Council conclusions of 7 January this year.</p>
<p class="contents">It follows that what we unfortunately have to discuss is a marvellous example of the credibility, of the occasional haggling and of the questionable timescales, all of which evidently exemplify the only response to inevitable and current challenges that the European institutions can sometimes manage. This should be a lesson for all of us as we prepare for the negotiations on the post-2007 budget framework and on the instruments that will be needed in future.</p>
<p class="contents">At the outset, the Commission came up with a proposal that envisaged such measures as the use of the flexibility instrument to the tune of EUR 98 million. From a total of EUR 170 million, EUR 15 million have emerged in this amending budget, while the EUR 13 million that we have not yet come up with are to be found from somewhere over the coming months. It is also worthy of note that funds have been reallocated from budget lines that were already intended for this region. The Council, and its British Presidency, cannot escape questions as to how all this can be in line with the great Millennium Goals, to which they, in their statements, have repeatedly affirmed their commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind you that, as we read the situation, the Council does not exactly appear to have simply goggled like a rabbit confronted with a snake and said: ‘No, we cannot give more than 15 million, or else we will have used up the 200 million in the flexibility instrument for 2005.’ If the N+2 rule had been applied, there would have been plenty of margin available.</p>
<p class="contents">While I am on this subject, the point has to be made that it was the European Parliament that said, from the very outset of the negotiations following the Heads of State or Government’s adoption, in 1999, of Agenda 2000, that Category IV was chronically underfunded, in the same way that foreign and security policy and the neighbourhood policy were likely to be chronically underfunded if the Luxembourg compromise for the new Financial Perspective were adopted. With the worst-case scenario in mind, we insisted on the provision of a flexibility instrument and were partly successful in negotiating one. Events have proved us right, for the fact is that unforeseen measures have made it necessary for this flexibility instrument to be resorted to every year, so what I want to say is that the embarrassing situation in which we find ourselves as regards time and resources obliges us to agree to this compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make use of this debate to reiterate that we, not least in the course of negotiations on the next Financial Perspective and the instruments associated with it, will do everything possible to introduce greater flexibility and more room for manoeuvre. Let me repeat what the plenary said in the relevant report, namely that Parliament will regard that aspect of its position which refers to the creation of reserves for emergency situations as non-negotiable. You will be familiar with the figures that we quoted on that occasion. We sometimes get the impression that the Commission, and particularly the Council, would rather not negotiate about figures at all. At the end of the day, though, we will have to come to an agreement on them and find a way in future to deliver responses of this kind faster, more promptly, and with greater credibility than we have done in these proceedings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The response of the European population, European governments, the European Commission and the Member States was overwhelming. In Sri Lanka alone, institutional and public commitments came to about EUR 5.8 billion. In Indonesia some EUR 8 billion has been committed.</p>
<p class="contents">However, promises and delivery, pledges and action are very different. I have just returned from Sri Lanka and Indonesia. In Indonesia I talked to Mr Kuntoro Mangkusubroto, head of the Indonesian reconstruction agency. He told me they cannot spend the money as quickly as we think they can. He thought he could spend it in four years, while the President of Indonesia wants to spend it over a period of five years.</p>
<p class="contents">In Sri Lanka, I regret to tell you that very little has happened. Nothing much has changed. The government is blaming the international NGOs and the NGOs are blaming the government. I am the budget draftsman of the Committee on Development. We adopted that opinion yesterday in my committee. I tried to explain that, although the needs of the Commission are paramount, I recognise that it has to make commitments, put money in the trust fund and then start spending those funds on whatever projects we have undertaken.</p>
<p class="contents">The capacity of Sri Lanka and Indonesia to absorb this huge amount of money transparently and properly is minimal. The Sri Lankans are still shifting paper around while people are still living in tents. Nothing has changed in the last seven months, since 26 December 2004. It is a tragedy and a scandal. However, we need to understand that, no matter how generous we are in giving and in wanting to help the people most in need, absorptive capacity and the ability to act fast in times of crisis are limited. As we have seen in New Orleans, even the most powerful nation in the world is unable to cope with tragedies of this kind. It has taught us that our Humanitarian Office, ECHO, has more expertise and is better prepared to deal with these emergencies than any other institution in the world. The one positive contribution we can make is to teach people what we have already learned on many occasions. One of the things we can do with the tsunami and in New Orleans is to give advice and guidance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is no cause for rejoicing, but rather a cause for concern and a reason to take an inventory of our own options and capacities. When one considers the causes underlying this, one can certainly describe what the Council and the Member States have been getting up to as ‘kangaroo politics’ – a lot of leaping around with an empty bag.</p>
<p class="contents">One problem that would not go away was that, although Parliament had rightly called on the Council to do what it had promised, the Council, unfortunately, did only half of it and with a great deal of resistance. I find this highly regrettable. Having given undertakings, it then left it to Parliament to deliver on them. The debate on the technical aspects of funding was largely intended as a substitute for money. While that is ineffective, it is very much what one would expect from the conduct of many Member States, for, although 22 of them committed themselves to a programme of reconstruction, only nine of them have, according to the Commission’s website, handed over any money so far. In the same time, only three of them have come close to finishing all the things they undertook to do. I might add that the website was last updated on 20 May this year, so the Commission is in no hurry to bring its achievements in the area to people’s attention. As I am told that that is the most up-to-date information on the progress of the debate, I would like to congratulate the Council Presidency on being, according to the statistics available on that site, well ahead so far when it comes to doing what it has promised.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to ask ourselves what Europe’s promises of aid in the aftermath of such calamities are worth. Let me remind you also of the Iranian city of Bam, stricken by an earthquake a year before the tsunami. To date – at least according to the ‘Red Crescent’ – 17% of the aid promised from around the world has actually materialised.</p>
<p class="contents">We keep our word; if we cannot manage to fulfil our commitments, it is better not to make people empty promises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It relates to the activities that we committed to financing in order to support the reconstruction of the countries affected so seriously by the tsunami in December 2004. Like you, I deplore the Council’s attitude. The budgetary authority has taken all this time to release the promised funds. In January, or even back in December, the EU promised EUR 350 million. Nine months later, we are only just going to manage to donate EUR 170 million over 2005. On 27 April, the Commission proposed a preliminary draft budget and called for the necessary mobilisation of the flexibility instrument to a level of EUR 98 million.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council, however, would not hear of this mobilisation. You know, it is a terrible thing, this Council’s slogan is ‘Hands off my money!’ It is terrible that we have a budgetary authority that takes on responsibilities and commitments, but refuses to see them through. We have therefore had to negotiate bitterly in Parliament over the last few months in a struggle to extract EUR 15 million from the flexibility fund. That is why we have had to reallocate EUR 60 million from other humanitarian actions in order to reach a balance and to find the EUR 170 million. I have to tell you that we consider this to be a scandal, because no poor country has become richer; quite the opposite, poverty is spreading in all these countries. There is still EUR 70 million in the emergency reserve; let us hope that we will not need it at the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we support this agreement because it is urgently needed by the populations and citizens affected by the tsunami. But what a mockery! Gentlemen of the Council, I would ask two things of you: first of all, do not make any more promises, because you are never able to keep them. Secondly, I must tell you that you have notified us, but what good is the Council’s commitment with regard to the financial perspectives? I now turn to Mr Böge to say: let us take account of this event, of this problem, when negotiating the next financial perspectives. Even where the Council has taken note of it, it does not keep its word or its commitments. Yes, the European Union really is sick. The citizens have noticed it, but in general the fault is with the Member States, who have forgotten that we need to build the European Union together, for the citizens of Europe, but also for the position and the generosity of Europe, because we have a duty towards all the countries of the world, and more particularly towards the people affected by the tsunami. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union wants to contribute EUR 350 million in the form of rehabilitation and reconstruction assistance to the areas affected by the disaster, of which EUR 170 million will be granted this year. Approximately EUR 85 million of this is ‘fresh’ money. The amount is considerable, the next largest after that pledged by Australia and the United States of America. It shows that the EU is endeavouring to have a responsible role in dealing with major catastrophes. In December, the EU managed to set aside EUR 123 million in this year’s budget, of which food aid accounted for EUR 23 million, and the emergency relief reserve EUR 100 million. Now the issue is one of reconstruction assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Reconstruction is a huge project. It means clearing up entire regions, the repair and construction of homes, and reviving the economy. With this purpose in mind, the revival of fishing as a means of livelihood, for example, is vital.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a positive sign that the European Parliament and the Council should have reached consensus on financing arrangements in July. Recently, cooperation between the Council and Parliament has not been exactly brilliant in matters relating to the budget, and that reached an acute stage in the complete deadlock in talks on the financial framework in June. The fact that consensus was reached even on this important issue shows that positive results can be achieved in the work of the EU, if only we can recognise our joint responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I will join them in recalling how, in response to this dreadful tsunami disaster and for the benefit of the world public, the Council announced Europe’s intention of making available EUR 350 million worth of aid for the tsunami’s victims. That was announced at the beginning of this year and was intended to run throughout 2005 and 2006. While we had a share in making this commitment, it is also, of course, by it that we have to judge the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already heard about the fierce debates that have gone on, particularly in relation to the so-called flexibility instrument. About these, I have to come to the same conclusion as some of the previous speakers, namely that the debates we have had over the past nine months with the Council have sometimes been a cause for real shame, and I can do no other than forthrightly criticise the Council for the way it handled them.</p>
<p class="contents">I also take the view that the funds made available for other aid programmes in Asia, which some now want to use for emergency aid, must be replaced whatever happens; the Millennium Goals demand it, and I believe that the credibility of the European Union is at stake here. If you make promises of that sort and want global public opinion to give you credit for them, you must also have the political guts to put these resolutions into practice and make the necessary resources available.</p>
<p class="contents">Like others who have spoken before me, I regard the compromise that has emerged from our negotiations as highly problematic. I do believe, though, that the European Union had to consider the victims’ needs and could not have waited any longer to vote these funds once and for all and to make them available, for to do otherwise would have adversely affected its credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot, however, forbear to criticise the Council in strong terms for their petty-minded and obstructive approach to negotiation, particularly when set against what they have made known to the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite that criticism, and in view of the difficult negotiations that await us in 2006, I call upon them to ensure that these negotiations take a different course and that we will again be able to avail ourselves of the flexibility instrument for emergency situations such as these – that is to say, in the way it was intended to be used. A challenge such as that should not be met with a small-minded response. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a member of the Committee on Development, I visited, together with Mrs Morgantini, the chairman, Mr Deva, the rapporteur, and other Members, the areas hit by the tsunami, and in particular the Indonesian region of Banda Aceh.</p>
<p class="contents">The scale of the damage is truly remarkable: entire communities have been destroyed and swept away by nature’s fury. The local population, however, despite suffering from the loss of material goods and of loved ones, is rolling up its sleeves and rebuilding its future. Europe, as was its duty, did not shrink from the obligations of solidarity. Not only did the institutions take swift action, but many, very many ordinary citizens also thought it their duty to help out and make a contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of these comprehensive, rightful and appropriate efforts, the proposal by the rapporteur that EUR 100 million be allocated in 2005 for reconstruction and recovery should be supported. This figure is in addition to the EUR 123 million already provided for humanitarian aid and the commitment to pay the remaining sum of EUR 250 million in 2006 and 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">As representatives of European citizens, however, we also have the responsibility to intervene with the relevant authorities, particularly in Indonesia, the Maldives and Sri Lanka, to ensure that the aid reaches the people quickly and that as a result work is done and the necessary steps are taken to achieve effective, visible and concrete improvements in the living conditions of these peoples. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to draw Members’ attention to three problems of a more general nature. Firstly, it is an unfortunate fact that natural disasters of various types, all of which result in enormous human and material losses, are becoming an ever more frequent occurrence. The Asian tsunami, the hurricane in Slovakia, the floods in Austria, Romania and Germany, the fires in Spain and Portugal and the recent disaster in the United States are merely some of the disasters that have happened this year. What this means is that we must set aside significantly more funding in future EU budgets to enable us to provide assistance to countries affected by natural disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, promises of assistance are easy enough to make, but a great deal more difficult to put into action. A good example of this is the funding for areas suffering the consequences of the Asian tsunami, which is an issue that has already been raised today. The European Union pledged EUR 350 million to this cause, but is still attempting to find sources of funding to meet this commitment, which after all is not excessively high.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I would draw the House’s attention to the overly long procedures that are in place for organising funding to deal with the aftermath of natural disasters. A good example of this is the aid for Slovakia, where a hurricane destroyed large swathes of forest in the Slovak Tatras. The hurricane hit the country in autumn 2004, but it is only now, one year later, that we are sending money to Slovakia to help the country cope with the consequences of this natural disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">Such criticisms notwithstanding, I am delighted that the European Union is so actively involved in measures across the globe aimed at overcoming the consequences of natural disasters. I am quite sure that this House’s adoption of the Garriga Polledo and Böge reports, which we are debating today, will help ensure that money is made available more rapidly for such matters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is of course good that we have now obtained a decision and an agreement. At the same time, I am, on behalf of the Committee on Development, disappointed at the result. We have always opposed a situation in which resources already appropriated to genuine development purposes within the Asia budget are now partially reappropriated to this disaster. We have also always maintained that we should, as far as possible, safeguard the disaster reserve and make use instead of the flexibility instrument. We now have only EUR 53 million left in the disaster reserve, with a good four months of this year still to go. What do we do if another disaster occurs somewhere in the world?</p>
<p class="contents">Our arguments have not succeeded. That does not mean that they are lacking in relevance or weight. On the contrary. We shall support this proposal but go on working to bring about a situation in which efforts in connection with major disasters like this must in the first place be funded from new resources and through the flexibility instrument. We hope, moreover, that we shall as far as possible safeguard the disaster reserve so that we can take action in the event of further major hardships.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would hope and believe that the resources now set aside for reconstruction and readjustment will be used in the wisest possible way and that, above all, as many aspects as possible of disaster preparedness will be incorporated. In that way, we shall not be making the already vulnerable people who live in that region still more vulnerable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The experience was a painful one for all of us, mainly because we were slow in delivering on our promises and the respective budgetary authorities were not sufficiently sensitive to each other's positions. This experience showed how difficult it is to solve our internal problems and at the same time to help those in emergency situations in the world.</p>
