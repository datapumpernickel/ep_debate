<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Attwooll (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, the Committee on Fisheries accepts that in extending the rules concerning restructuring and structural assistance in the fisheries sector for one year, changes need to be made in the pilot reduction rates in order to maintain current levels. It welcomes the tightening up of provisions concerning the transfer of fishing vessels to third countries. Amendment No 6 to Article 1(3) asked the Commission to produce a list specifying which transfers are permissible and which are not. We hope it will be acceptable to them.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee also welcomes the possibility of financial assistance being made available where any Community legislation imposes technical restrictions, but feels that Parliament should be kept informed of such cases – that is Amendment No 10.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point, the Committee on Fisheries has difficulties with the Commission proposal in that it goes beyond an extension of the rules to making three substantive changes to them. These are: removing the possibility of an increase in capacity on safety grounds; allowing financial assistance for fleet modernisation and renewal only where objectives have been met purely by reduction in capacity; and allowing such financial assistance to any segment of the fleet only where <span class="italic">every </span>segment of the fleet has met its objectives. In voting the report, the Committee on Fisheries rejected each of these three changes.</p>
<p class="contents">The motivation was mixed, relating both to the desirability of the changes themselves and the desirability of making them in the course of a one-year extension of the programme. For example, both the Committee on Fisheries and the Committee on Legal Affairs took the view that requiring every segment of the fleet to have reached its objectives before any segment could benefit from financial assistance ran counter to the principles of natural justice. Similarly, the proposal that financial assistance could be given only where objectives had been met <span class="italic">purely </span>by a reduction in capacity seemed unfair to those fleets where capacity and activity reductions had been combined. There are also doubts about making such a change in circumstances where there is increasing agreement that a variety of measures are needed to reduce fishing effort. Amendments Nos 4, 7, 8 and 9 are intended to maintain the <span class="italic">status quo </span>in relation to both these requests.</p>
<p class="contents">The most difficult point has concerned the removal of the possibility of capacity increases on safety grounds. The Committee on Fisheries is highly committed to fishing safety. There is serious concern that shipowners simply will not make safety improvements unless they are given additional capacity for this. It was also argued that abuses of the provision should be prevented by proper controls and that such a change, if to be made at all, would be more properly done in the reform of the CFP as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">It is largely on the capacity issue that I part company with a number of my fellow committee members. Of course, we must find ways of ensuring that vessels are safe, but we can no longer afford to take risks with conservation either. The perilous state of cod stocks in the North Sea is but one example. Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 5, approved by the Committee on Fisheries, reject the changes on the capacity rules altogether. Amendments Nos 11 and 12, submitted by the ELDR Group, however, accept the Commission's approach in principle, but seek to allow capacity increases on safety grounds by way of exception for existing vessels under 12 metres. The justification for this exception is that taking away the possibility of financial assistance is likely to bear hardest on the sector and put safety improvements more seriously at risk in circumstances where they are likely to have only minor effects on capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that many of my colleagues – for reasons that I respect – will wish to take a different view, but I urge everyone in deciding how to vote on this report to bear in mind just how imperative the need for conservation has become. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Committee on Legal Affairs looks at this issue through legal spectacles, as you would expect. From our point of view, it is not just important that the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy be achieved, though that is indeed important. We have to remember that the means through which the Community does this are means of the law, and therefore the principles of the law have to be respected in what is done.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Legal Affairs thought that the Commission's proposals fell down on two important legal principles, at two important points. The first was the principle of proportionality, and in effect Mrs Attwooll has already spoken about that this afternoon. In recital 3 the Commission said: "Measures to improve safety should not lead to an increase in fishing effort and such measures should therefore be applied within the existing capacity objectives for the fleet". That is to say that improvements in safety can be ignored just if the capacity objectives are not being sustained, regardless of effort. But the aim we all have is to prevent over-fishing, and it is effort that catches fish, not capacity. Therefore proportionality requires deletion of that.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in relation to the effective provisions about vicarious penalties. To require all segments of a national fleet to have achieved the annual objectives, as the Commission suggests, before any public aid for fleet modernisation or renewal can be granted, would be unlawful. It is contrary to the most rudimentary principles of natural justice. It would permit one fisheries segment to be penalised for things done, or left undone, in another. It could result in fishermen being penalised for the acts or omissions of their government and would thus constitute vicarious punishment. As a Scottish Member, I insist that these issues matter vitally to all parts of the Scottish fleet. Those who meet their targets for reduction of capacity should not be punished for those who do not and should not carry the can for failures by the UK Government or the Scottish Government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although we are only dealing with an extension of MAGP IV for one year, the Commission proposals seek to reduce over-fishing and achieve the 40% reduction in effort across the EU fleet which they have been consistently pointing out is absolutely essential, if we are to have any hope of a sustainable industry in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that some controversy has arisen – and Mrs Attwooll mentioned this – over the question of aid for measures to improve safety in navigation; working conditions; and hygiene on board fishing vessels. It goes without saying that all of us wish to see our fishermen working in the safest, cleanest and most secure conditions. But there is no doubt that such aid has been abused in the past to increase fishing effort, leading to further over-exploitation of dwindling fish stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me pointless that we try to achieve a reduction in over-fishing as a core policy objective on the one hand, while continuing to facilitate cheating at the taxpayer's expense on the other. The whole point of the MAGP is to reduce fishing effort and bring it into better balance with the existing fish stocks. Only this week the need for continued for vigilance in this area was again highlighted with the publication of the ICES report on the prospects for catches in 2002. They point out that a number of fish stocks remain in a state of great jeopardy, particularly cod, although they also point out that there have been slight improvements in haddock and whiting stocks in the North Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">In that respect I was horrified to read that Danish fisheries inspectors last month boarded a Danish industrial fishing boat and discovered 114 tonnes of juvenile cod in a 543 tonne total catch that was supposed to be composed entirely of sand eels. Pulverising valuable young haddock into fishmeal to feed to salmon in the fish farming sector is complete madness. It is a crime against everything we are trying to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that when we come to vote on this report later today, we bear in mind that the whole point of MAGP philosophy is to reduce over-exploitation and nothing we do in applying public aid to the EU fleet should undermine that principle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Adjusting the Community fleet to the resources available is a fundamental objective of the CFP. Furthermore, it is a common sense requirement if we want our fishing to be a viable economic activity and our fishing sector to be a viable economic sector. We therefore welcome the extension of the current MAGP IV until 31 December 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said, the Socialist Group supports Mrs Attwooll’s report, which was approved by consensus in the Committee on Fisheries, and we thank her for the compromise achieved in our committee, together with the Members presenting amendments, a compromise which the Council is still far from reaching. Parliament is sending a good signal by anticipating an agreement which the Council can accept.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal is not restricted to extending the current MAGP by one year, but it also intends to introduce, as has been said, criteria relating to safety, which should be debated in the context of a new MAGP. I regret that the Commission has not made any reference to the question of safety in the White Paper on the reform of the CFP. I would like to point out that, as this House approved (on debating and approving my report on fishing accidents), Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the application of measures to promote the improvement of health and safety of workers in the workplace is also fully applicable to vessels of less than 12 metres.</p>

We also agree with the rapporteur's amendments seeking to restrict the derogation for safety to vessels less than 12 metres in length and we would like to thank her for retabling these important amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we are entirely opposed to the proposal as it has now emerged from the committee. The amendments are removing the most progressive elements that the Commission is proposing. After all, both the MAGP and the FIFG are already so full of loopholes that you actually sail <span class="italic">The Atlantic Dawn</span> through. The proposal would simply close a couple of these more blatant loopholes.</p>
<p class="contents">Glancing through a scientific report on the status of fish stocks makes for very depressing reading these days. It does not matter whether it is ICES, or the STECF or any of the regional bodies such as NAFO. Everywhere you look fish stocks are over-exploited and far too often severely depleted. The EU has had to take emergency measures for three cod stocks and northern hake and it is clear that other stocks will soon be added to the list.</p>
<p class="contents">There is pretty much universal agreement that this deplorable situation is due to the excess capacity of the world's fishing fleets. The Commission is always reminding us of this, but the Member States and certain segments of the fishing industry are clearly in denial. The Community has agreed to several international instruments which seek to control fishing capacity and/or fishing effort. For instance, the FAO Code of Conduct provides that states should take measures to prevent or eliminate excess fishing capacity and should ensure that levels of fishing effort are in line with sustainable use of fisheries resources. But whenever the Commission tries to put these obligations into effect, they are shot down by Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Some have argued that it is not reasonable to try and change a programme in the last year or that certain aspects of the proposal are contrary to the idea of natural justice. The FIFG is due to continue until 2006 and so there are several years in which these reforms could bring some sort of positive effect. Surely it is far from natural justice to refuse to take action now and to continue as if the future is bright, only to have more and more stocks decrease and to impose even further temporary or permanent closures.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Members of this House to consider the case of the northern cod stock off Newfoundland which provided 200 000 tonnes of fish every year for five centuries. In 1992, the Canadian Government had to close the fisheries even for subsistence fishing and there is still little if any sign of improvement in the stock. Is that the kind of future we want for our own coastal communities? The time has come for us to take a long-term rather than just a 6-months to 12-months view. We really have to deal with this issue and I would like to support what the Commission is proposing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Equally, it is incorrect – as the rapporteur and various other Members have stated – to attempt to table amendments on the expiry date of the MAGP-IV that would have a detrimental effect on maritime safety, on the quality of life and safety of crews, on the value and quality of catches and on health and hygiene conditions.

With this principle in mind, I was unpleasantly surprised by the Commission proposal before us. I well understand that the Commission does not want to introduce a new structure policy which may be obsolete within a year as a result of the fisheries policy reforms. However, I cannot shake off the impression that the Commission still does not realise that they are missing the boat with the current multiannual guidance programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">To try to control fisheries with two very different instruments – the TACs and the quota on the one hand and the fleet structure policy on the other – will result in serious problems, particularly if the policy instruments serve different objectives, which is the case. TACs and quotas are the determining factor in managing fish stocks. Sustainable fishing can, nonetheless, only be achieved if there is room for an efficient fleet within the parameters set by the allowable catches. The fleet structure policy must support this. Unfortunately this is not happening. Under the MAGP, all kinds of subsidies are offered which are maintaining excess fleet capacity and therefore distorting competition. What is more, a number of Member States have introduced incentives which are further distorting competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The common fisheries policy needs a clear objective, and the system of TACs and quotas must be the determining factor for this. This must also include a properly functioning control system with strict punitive measures.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, the Commission is, nonetheless, holding onto its MAGP, with some changes which I can only describe as unfortunate. Under the guise of reinforcing the suitability of the MAGP, the Commission is ignoring the most elementary sense of justice in one of these amendments. By withholding government support, it is punishing one fishing segment for the excess capacity in another. Justice is further undermined by the Commission making a distinction based on the capacity reductions in the fleets. The fleet in my country regulates capacity by reducing activity (the “days at sea restrictions”). Unlike other countries, the Netherlands is now excluded from European support for modernisation and renewal.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to reverse these unfortunate changes, we will give our wholehearted support to the rapporteur's amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Thanks to the efforts of Mrs Attwooll and the Committee on Fisheries, I hope we have avoided the most unfair and dangerous aspects of this tougher line; more generally, however, the very principle of MAGPs needs to be questioned now. The professionals have never accepted this bureaucratic, brutal system, which is totally alien to the traditions and culture of the maritime world.</p>
<p class="contents">Experience also shows that this instrument is crude, unfair, redundant and costly. Its negative effects are well-known and, coupled with the blocking of aid for new construction, it bolsters the second-hand market and dissuades young people from going into jobs connected with fishing. Within the framework of the debate in progress on reforming the CFP, we must therefore give absolute priority to the system of TACs and quotas. That has to be the instrument used to keep catches in line with resources. The new CFP must be based on the quota mechanism, which we need to fine-tune by putting it on a multiannual basis, making it more transparent and more scientific, relating it more closely to the fishing zones, closely involving the professionals and monitoring it effectively and fairly.</p>

The Green Paper has merely made clear once again how serious they are. Our Committee is earnestly discussing the various approaches to solving the problems. We know we shall not be able to make all the difficulties simply disappear by waving a magic wand. If somebody really wants to pull the wool over our eyes about it, we must call it what it is, namely eyewash.</p>
<p class="contents">The common fisheries policy as it has existed up until now has not succeeded in preventing the crises affecting a number of fish stocks or in reducing overcapacities in fleets. Whether we will all survive economically depends on the Union’s future ability to shape a fisheries policy in the new century. The Commission is now proposing extending the current multi-annual guidance programme for one year. In the light of the ongoing debate on reform, I think we also need such measures for the sake of continuity.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot of course solve the problems in this short space of time, but perhaps we can alleviate them a little. The crucial thing is that the programme should be properly carried out. We need data, but some Member States fail to provide that data or their data is incomplete. We therefore need a system of penalties to ensure the data is supplied at all, and we need comparable criteria and categories. Every shipowner wants to increase efficiency. But we must not shift the premises. We want better safety at sea. That is a central part of the European Parliament’s demands. But at the same time we should be careful to avoid negative effects on safety, even dressed up as increased efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed change to structural measures also misses the target at the present time. Making the achievement of objectives in all segments of the fleet a precondition for public subsidies is counterproductive because it penalises everyone for the failings of a few. Our policy will only find acceptance among fishermen if the conditions are fair. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The MAGP’s objectives are correct, but their implementation by the Member States still leaves much to be desired. The Commission’s reports in the past have shown us that over and over again. We have repeatedly criticised the failings in implementation and it is clear that the future fleet policy will have to remedy the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Commission wants to make changes to the MAGP and FIFG provisions as well as extending them by a year. I am opposed to some of those changes because I think these matters would be better resolved in the landmark decision about fleet policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion there is no point in making extensive changes in the last year of MAGP IV’s validity, especially when they could have negative repercussions for safety on board fishing vessels. But if Member States are to continue to be able to apply for increases in capacity for measures designed to improve on-board safety and fishery product hygiene and these are to be paid for out of FIFG resources, something really must be done to ensure that those measures do not result in increased fishing. This condition is absolutely essential.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot have a situation where investments in on-board safety are prevented because the conditions for the application of the measures are not complied with or because many Member States are sometimes unable to ensure that they are or fail to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">We ought to be using the debate about common fisheries policy reform to find solutions to the dilemma between on-board safety and careful management of stocks that has again been made clear by this report.

<p class="contents">The size of our fishing fleet in the European Union is one of the greatest problems that we are faced with when considering CFP reform, but the real measure of activity should be effort as opposed to fleet size. In order to secure what we all want, sustainable fisheries, then surely fishing effort must be made to correspond to available resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the need to extend MAGP4, but I have some concerns, in three areas in particular. Firstly, it is intolerable that safety has been taken out of the equation. The provisions that currently exist to increase objectives on grounds of safety should be maintained. We should be looking for tighter control and management to ensure that these provisions are not used to circumvent the rules. Safety must remain a priority and I hope the Commission will recognise this and also make up for its failure to include adequate provisions on safety in the Green Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, while there must be penalties for non-implementation of MAGP targets, surely they must be targeted at the guilty parties. It must be wrong to penalise one segment directly for the acts or omissions of another. It is also necessary to make sure that those Member States which claim to have met their MAGP targets are not simply transferring their vessels to other flags.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the proposals which limit financial assistance from FIFG to segments where reduction of fishing effort is obtained through capacity reductions only seems to me unjust and would discriminate against fishermen whose Member States choose to reduce effort through schemes such as days at sea.</p>
<p class="contents">One reason why these targets are not met is that some Member State governments have not been prepared to match funding for restructuring. The Commission must look at ways of ensuring that restructuring funds can be distributed in an equitable fashion throughout the EU fishing industry.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need for more standardised and more rigorous assessment procedures right across the EU. Only if we have fixed, clear and comparable criteria for the measurement of vessels, including engine power and tonnage, can there be confidence in the targets that are set by MAGPs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is hard to accept that, six months before the end of a programme to restructure the fleet, the sector can be told, without scientific or technical justifications, that fishing capacity cannot be reduced by means of restructuring efforts and that the only solution is pure scrapping, all because the Commission made a small calculation error four years ago. And that, furthermore, while they are at it, they take the opportunity to turn the bases of MAGP IV and key elements of the FIFG Regulation on their heads, which is completely unacceptable, and I believe there is general agreement on this here.</p>
<p class="contents">If we add to this the fact that the greatest burden of the new requirements, as has been said, rests on the elimination of the facilities intended to improve the safety of ships, it begs the question of whether the Commission ever thinks about the fisheries sector when it starts coming up with brilliant ideas at the last minute.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore ask that you vote in favour of the amendments of the Committee on Fisheries because I still cannot understand, and the sector understands even less, what is the point in reserving safety measures just for vessels of less than 12 metres, when it is precisely the largest ships which have more crew and work furthest from the coast and therefore face considerably more risk and, in the event of emergency, have most difficulties getting back to port. And all of this with winter just around the corner and in waters which, like European Atlantic waters, are not exactly a mill pond.</p>
<p class="contents">It is fair to recognise that the Commission tried, from the outset, to coincide the end of the MAGP IV with the reform of the CFP in 2002. But, since 1997, it knew that it was not going to manage it and on that basis the Commission should have started work on an MAGP V which would have eliminated the errors committed so far and, meanwhile, simply extend the MAGP IV. And extension, Commissioner, cannot in any way be used to change the rules of the game which we have had up to now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">European fleet policy is a sensitive and complicated issue – this is something we all agree upon. However, if each State defends its own interests and only complies when it is in its own interest, we clearly get nowhere. Therefore, the Commission must rise to the challenge, through an effective policy accepted by everyone, of designing a fleet that is really suited to our fishing needs. A safe, effective and competitive fleet.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Attwooll’s report, like the report by Mr Busk, is currently of fundamental importance. We want it to draw attention, on the one hand, to the fact that the increase in onboard safety measures has nothing to do with increasing fishing capacity or power, and on the other, to the need not to introduce substantial last-minute changes to programmes which have been in operation for five years, because an annual extension is one thing, but to change fundamental conditions in the general philosophy of the MAGPs now, at the last minute, is quite another.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking you, Mrs Attwooll, for preparing this report. I have been listening to the debate very attentively and now feel somewhat obliged to clarify a few things because there seem to be some quite serious misunderstandings about this Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">First there is the question, do we need a fleet policy or not? In my opinion we do need a fleet policy and we need an effective – and more effective – fleet policy because the present rules are far from adequate. We have tremendous overcapacity in our European fleet as a whole, and if we do not adjust that fleet to possible future fishing opportunities, we will never be rid of these difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say to you clearly and in all honesty that we will not meet that objective at all with MAGP IV. With MAGP IV we are a long way from achieving a reduction of 30%, let alone 40%. There is a report with which you are probably familiar, I hope you are, which says that we will at best achieve 5% over the full MAGP period and even that is very unlikely. What is more likely is that the entire MAGP IV exercise will have had no effect. That is the reality, that is the truth and that is what we have to deal with.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is a second principle we must see as well. In my opinion it makes little sense to isolate fleet policy from the rest of the common fisheries policy. We must see it in the context of the other essential political elements of our common fisheries policy. We therefore believe that it is entirely correct to include consideration of the future of fleet policy when devising our new common fisheries policy, which we intend to do next year.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal we have submitted can be understood only in this light. MAGP IV expires next year and that would mean that we would have to isolate all other areas of the new fisheries policy from that of fleet policy. That is why we had the idea of seeking this one-year extension so that they could be synchronised. But we do not really want at the same time to lay ourselves open to the charge of prolonging an ineffective arrangement for a year. That was why we also proposed a few measures to improve this MAGP.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the fact that a few Member States are not even keeping to the modest targets of MAGP IV. Unfortunately, the Commission has no other way of enforcing compliance with the MAGP objectives than to introduce proceedings before the European Court of Justice. That is why we have also submitted proposals to that effect.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the amendments that have been tabled. Amendments Nos 1 to 3 and 5 are concerned with the question of safety at sea. Here, too, I want to clearly say that no one should accuse the Commission of being against more safety at sea. We too are aware of the problems and accidents that have recently occurred at sea. So we are also aware of how necessary it is to improve safety, and we are also promoting that. Community resources are being deployed to improve safety. I do not dispute that in some cases enhancing safety increases the weight of the ships. But that has nothing to do with the fact that we cannot therefore demand that the increase in weight of just one ship should be compensated for by taking more ships out of use. That is what this is about. After all, there is no prohibition on installing more additional safety devices on a particular vessel. That is why we are not prepared to accept these four amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">We are able to accept Amendments Nos 11 and 12 because the application of the safety clause remains confined to vessels under 12 metres in length that no longer fish with drag nets. This is of particular benefit to older vessels that are engaged chiefly in coastal fishing and for which an increase in capacity and engine power are justified, subject to clear conditions, if that enhances safety.</p>
<p class="contents">I am quite concerned about Amendments Nos 4, 7, 8 and 9. They reject any form of restriction on access to FIFG aid. But this is after all the only mechanism we have for reducing fleet capacity at all. It must be obvious that the Community’s lavish modernisation aid is thwarting all our efforts to reduce the size of the fleet. How will it ever work if we first offer Community public funds for ships to be broken up and then also use Community funds to encourage the purchase of new ones?</p>
<p class="contents">At some point we are going to have to decide which of these two things is to have priority. Parliament has also said in this connection that it is not appropriate to amend the provisions of a regulation that was adopted less than two years ago for a period of six years. In view of the present difficult situation regarding stocks, I think the time has now come to talk about this question, too.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Amendment No 6 amplifies a provision that was included in the regulation at your instigation, and that provision bans FIFG aid for exports or for the formation of joint ventures. We have already discussed this point in connection with the previous agenda item. The Commission is in total agreement on this point and suggests that the lists of countries that break these rules should also be published.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission is unable to agree to Amendment No 10 because it involves a procedure internal to the Commission, for which the Commission alone is competent. It ought therefore to be handled under the Commission's aegis.</p>
