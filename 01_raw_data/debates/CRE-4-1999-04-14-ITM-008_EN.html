No precise date or even year can be established for accession, since several countries – among them Latvia and Lithuania – will most probably be included in the process this year. In practice, this will mean a new intergovernmental conference. My own guess is that we are looking at 2004 or 2005. The problem is that an unduly long negotiating process could have a negative impact on public opinion in the applicant countries, and hence in Estonia.</p>
<p class="contents">The undoubted progress made by Estonia must not be allowed to obscure the lingering legacy, so difficult to overcome, of war and Soviet occupation. Sooner or later – sooner better than later – the country should be capable of solving its minority problems and creating a society where all people, regardless of the language they speak, subscribe loyally to the principles of democracy and the rule of law. Loyalty is not built on citizenship alone, but also on common values. The majority of foreign citizens and stateless individuals in Estonia were born there and, more likely than not, have no intention to leave. Despite legislative improvements, particularly with regard to children born in and after 1992, Estonia"s political ‘establishment" appears to be maintaining what in my view is a conservative stance on citizenship. But Estonia is destined to become – and to remain – a multicultural and multilingual society.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, foreign investment in Estonia reached higher levels, particularly in the banking sector. Nonetheless the balance of trade is still negative, although the economy in the capital, Tallinn, is largely based on tourists from Finland. Subsidised food imports from the EU have increased the difficulties faced by Estonian farmers. There is a very big economic gap between rich and poor, and between Tallinn and the provinces. Social transfers – to the unemployed, for example – are minimal.</p>
<p class="contents">Once there are open borders and an open labour market, a number of Estonians will seek work in nearby EU countries. However, this whole process is necessary if there is to be any reduction in the gap between rich and poor people, and between rich and poor countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now comment briefly on the security problems faced by Estonia as a neighbour of Russia. People in my country, Finland, felt in 1995 that membership of the European Union would – by definition – tie us in to a community capable of providing and guaranteeing security. NATO"s role and military capacity were not underestimated, but there was no express call for membership. Estonia has followed a different path in seeking also to join NATO. The country is in the grip of an illusion, in my view. Given the current situation in the Balkans, would Estonia or Finland – both sharing land borders with Russia – have gained from being members of NATO, a NATO which thus far has failed to come forward with any kind of convincing policy on the Kosovo tragedy?</p>
<p class="contents">As part of the EU debate on the Northern Dimension, it is perfectly feasible to devise a comprehensive and realistic programme encompassing the applicant Baltic countries, as well as parts of Russia, Scandinavia and the Arctic region.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from EU membership, the best guarantee for Estonia"s future is peaceful cooperation with Russia. One day, Russia will perhaps overcome its enormous economic difficulties and appreciate that good neighbourly relations benefit all sides.</p>
<p class="contents">Interpreted in this way, Estonia"s considerable progress since it regained its freedom is to Russia"s advantage too. And an enlarged Union, taking in the Baltic countries, will be a source of strength, as the German Presidency has understood.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">von Habsburg </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, again and again, discussions on enlargement involve references to all manner of things which quite simply do not reflect the real world. Over the last few years I have travelled a great deal around Central and Eastern Europe, virtually once a month. So I know that one thing is fundamentally important: progress can only be achieved if peace is guaranteed. In other words, guaranteed peace and political stability are essential for progress. Economic progress will then follow automatically. In these countries it is evident that priority has to be given to political affairs and to security, and only then can progress in other fields be tackled. This point is particularly important at a time when the countries lined up for enlargement are having to contend with a conflagration at their borders – the war in Kosovo. So we should always remember that in politics we must always be prepared for the worst. If it does not happen, we can offer up thanks. But at least we are prepared, whereas things are bound to go amiss if we are taken by surprise.</p>
<p class="contents">So in these dangerous times enlargement is one of our best guarantees of peace, if not to say the only guarantee of peace which in the long run will give these peoples what they want. Above all, if you travel through these countries – and I do not think that Mr Donner will contradict me here – and if you learn to understand their peoples, you cannot fail to see that peace is their first priority. But peace cannot be achieved by simply praying for it; it requires decisions and a clear policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, people here have various reservations. For example, people sometimes tell us that the cost of enlargement is too high. The fact is that the only person who really understands the finances of the European Union, the President of the Court of Auditors, Mr Friedmann, recently attended a meeting of our pan‐European working party here in the European Parliament, and during his presentation he told us that the cost of enlargement is greatly overestimated, because no one ever takes account of the cost of non‐enlargement. But that is enormous too. People also tell us – and there are enough demagogues around, including some present in this House – that millions of job‐seekers would flood in after enlargement. These people have no experience. The advantage in being 85 years old – excuse me, 86 – is that you can say that you have seen everything and the opposite of everything!</p>
<p class="contents">I remember very well how much whingeing there was at the time Spain was granted membership. The Spanish were going to come pouring in. And then two years later someone said to me: ‘For heaven"s sake, what has happened to all our Spanish workers?". The answer was, of course, that once Spain's economy took off, they preferred to work in the sun in Andalusia than in the foggy Ruhr!</p>
<p class="contents">We should never lose sight of this experience. An important point is that we should not tar everyone with the same brush. We have to judge each of these states according to its own particular characteristics and its own developments. It is also fair to assume that whoever takes the lead will carry the others along it its wake. But if we always set our sights according to the slowest, we will not make much progress. That applies to every country these days. As the rapporteur for Hungary, I shall take the liberty of saying that Hungary is one of the really important countries. It is the leading country today because it has always made progress on two fronts: first, the wonderful thing about the Hungarian Parliament is that when it comes to making a decision about the country itself, there are no party politicians – just patriots. They put on a united front. Second, they understand that when they are abroad they have to represent their country. They can squabble afterwards – and we can be grateful that in Hungary we have a language that no one else understands, so no one knows what is being said there anyway!</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to the other countries on the list. I would particularly like to say something about the Baltic states in this context: it is wonderful that Estonia is to be granted membership, but we should not forget about Latvia and Lithuania in the process. They form a whole. I would especially like to stress that we should not forget that at the time of the Second World War, because of one country – Germany, of course – Europe abandoned these Baltic peoples to their fate. So we have a moral obligation to accept the Baltic states as soon as possible. The same also applies to the other applicant countries at the front of the pack, and it also applies to those straggling behind, who are vital for our security. I have in mind Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and last but not least Croatia, as Croatia is one of the countries that has developed most quickly. It is working the hardest, even though it receives practically no help at all from us, and so we must support it.</p>
<p class="contents">All the peoples of Europe have a right to join Europe, even the Serbs, who we have talked so much about. I am firmly in favour of the Serbs being granted membership once they have got rid of Milosevic and have a democratic government. In any case, we should be acting in the interests of all these peoples for one good reason: European integration is the only concrete idea for achieving peace and prosperity. This has to be at the heart of our future policy. Therefore, Mr President, I have one last request: we need to make haste! We should not delay because historic opportunities can pass by all too quickly.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Speciale </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span><span class="italic">rapporteur. – (IT) </span>Mr President, I should like to talk about the subject of my report, which is Slovenia.</p>
<p class="contents">Slovenia, as is well known, is a country with a sound economy and fulfils the political and democratic criteria laid down. Perhaps, out of all the countries which have asked to join, it is starting off on the best footing, even when its size is taken into account. The European Commission, however, has expressed a critical view of this first stage, considering that progress, particularly in transposing Community legislation, has been slower and more uncertain than it should have been. The Slovene authorities have accepted this critical assessment and have indicated that they intend to react positively to it. To this end, over the last few weeks, the government has submitted a national programme for the adoption of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> and a raft of very important legislation on VAT, excise duties and the right to purchase property. The entry into force of the Europe Agreement may now provide a solid basis for the ongoing negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">This new commitment on the part of the Slovene authorities requires continuity and momentum – I think this is the crucial factor – so that a more positive stage can begin and negotiations proceed more swiftly. There are of course many issues which are as yet unresolved, in this country as in the others, starting with changes to the administrative and judicial structures and the reforms required to put commitments into practice. The Commission and the European Parliament should encourage and assist Slovenia in its efforts in a spirit of friendship and therefore with a critical and attentive eye. This is the role we should play, rather than acting as lawyers.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the vast majority of the political movements in Slovenia still claim to be in favour of joining the European Union, this does not always mean that any joint momentum is achieved: the people do not seem to be fully involved in working towards this aim, as is shown by the information campaign, which gives the impression – rather significantly, I feel – that it has just got off the ground and is a touch feeble. We were absolutely stunned when the head of the campaign told us that its aim was not actually to convince people that joining the European Union was basically a positive development for Slovenia. One does wonder in that case what aim the campaign is pursuing and what the point of it is. We should therefore not be surprised to see that in the opinion polls the percentage of those in favour of accession to the European Union is declining, though still a majority. In a situation like this, misgivings, distrust and isolationist tendencies may increase rather than diminish, and may also have a bearing on conflicts between parties and political representatives, creating a sense of detachment and a degree of insecurity.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation has been reflected recently by a number of events which have led to a certain amount of concern even in the Slovenian press. In what I feel to be an anomalous and controversial legal case, the Constitutional Court decided to suspend local elections in the municipality of Koper, that is Capodistria. The mayor of the city appealed to the Court of Human Rights, thus highlighting a very sensitive issue. I only recently found out from the newspapers that for criticising this decision in the EU‐Slovenia Joint Parliamentary Committee a sitting MP has been the subject of a procedure which is wholly incompatible with parliamentary and democratic traditions.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, I am not voicing these concerns in order to stress them unduly. I think that these episodes are merely temporary aberrations which can be put right by the political forces and the authorities in Slovenia. I believe that Slovenia enjoys all the right conditions and has the capacity to do very well. I think that the positive facts continue to outweigh the negative ones, and it is precisely because of this that we should ask a lot of the government and the parliament. In Slovenia there are major political forces, a civil society, and human, cultural and economic resources which are more than sufficient to turn this country into an example for many. I have tried to do my job as your rapporteur with all this in mind and to this end the work of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy has been very useful to me, as have the amendments which were tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, although Slovenia is a small country, it occupies a very important and sensitive geographical position, between the north and south and the east and west of Europe. In cultural and political terms Slovenia can enrich the European Union and be enriched by it as well. If this is what it wants, it has to be determined about it. Throughout the region of the Balkans there is a need for stability, development and processes of integration which transcend national identity, and Slovenia can make a significant contribution here. I think that the next Parliament should continue to consider accession and enlargement of the European Union as priority objectives and if possible not just have evening debates on the subject.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Carnero González </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL), </span><span class="italic"> rapporteur. – (ES)</span> Mr President, first of all, I would like to say that the people of the Czech Republic support their country"s application for membership of the European Union almost unanimously. Indeed, despite the recent political and institutional changes in the Czech Republic, there has never been any discussion between the politicians there about this key objective. Moreover, the authorities in Prague have demonstrated great tenacity and conviction in their efforts to become a member of the Atlantic Alliance and this is further proof, if any were needed, of the country"s political determination to form part of the different continental structures, whatever they may be.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also extremely important to stress that the values that form the basis of the community of Europe have been clearly and perfectly assimilated by the Czech Republic. This community of Europe clearly does not only represent an economic process; it also hopes to become a political area where the interests of all the different people of Europe can develop in harmony. It is important to emphasise the fact that Prague has accepted the principles on which the common foreign and security policy is based. In fact, it was the Czech Government that took the initiative of strengthening political cooperation between all the applicant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the process of accession is a long and gradual process of adapting to the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> . And, as is the case with many of the applicant countries, the Czech Republic still has a great deal to do, as the Commission"s regular report rightly points out. This ‘screening" document cannot be looked upon as a set of grades and marks; instead, it should be seen as an incentive to ensure that the correct measures are taken to benefit the Czech Republic and its application for membership of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention one concern I have had since the beginning of my work as rapporteur, which is the situation of the Roma minority in the Czech Republic. It is true that the Prague Government has restructured the Interministerial Commission on the Affairs of the Roma Community and appointed Mr Petr Uhl as the government representative for human rights issues. However, the problem of the social and cultural integration of the Roma ethnic minority has yet to be resolved. This is undoubtedly an issue that will require a global solution and it is therefore vital to improve cultural relations throughout Czech society. But it is up to the Prague Government to take the necessary legislative measures to promote this integration. The authorities cannot renounce their responsibility and society will naturally expect the authorities to face up to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important element is the rise in unemployment in the Czech Republic. According to the Commission this is due, for the most part, to a slowdown in economic activity and the effects of the process of industrial and economic restructuring in the country. The European Commission must continue to help the Czech Government to minimise the social impact of adapting to the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> , if possible. I fully support the German Presidency"s initiative to extend the PHARE programme to include support for the social dimension of the applicant countries" economies.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to end without making two remarks. We all share the aim of enabling the applicant countries to join the European Union, but to do this properly we must also be consistent ourselves. To that end, I would point out once again that institutional reform is essential to prepare the Union for enlargement and, secondly, that it is vital for the Union to have the resources required to face the challenge of enlargement. I believe that, on this last issue, the Berlin summit did not exactly set the best example as regards the decisions that should have been taken. Nonetheless, we do, in fact, still have some time left to remedy the situation.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hoff </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, this afternoon"s debate on the conflict in Serbia and the expulsions in Kosovo has made it even clearer why enlarging the European Union to include the Central and Eastern European countries is, apart from any other considerations, the most important means of guaranteeing peace and must remain so in future. We Europeans can only ensure lasting peace in Europe and in the world by working together with our neighbours to the east.</p>
<p class="contents">I say this in the knowledge that Poland has been a member of NATO since mid‐March. As the largest central European applicant country, Poland is making good progress with the accession process at a technical level, and we can therefore reasonably assume that by the end of this year a complete overview of the entire accession process situation will be available. As I see it, that would probably then be the right time to discuss and perhaps reach agreement on a possible timetable for the rest of the run‐up to accession. The Polish Government – the <span class="italic">Sejm</span> and the Senate – are anxious to achieve this, and we should not close our minds to this possibility, indeed we should call on the Commission to prepare an appropriate draft with the Polish authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission's progress report published in November 1998, Poland is described as a country that is enjoying stable social and political conditions and making progress in developing an efficient market economy. According to the economic data, and if you accept the economic forecasts, Poland is still one of the strongest economies amongst the central European countries, with growth rates over 5 %, unemployment and inflation below 10 % and income increasing by 4.5 %. Government debt is 48 % and the budget deficit in 1997 was 2.7 %. These are in line with the Maastricht criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">As only 6.4 % of foreign trade is carried on with the Russian Federation, as opposed to 64 % with the European Union, Poland has remained relatively untouched by the latest Russian crisis. Nevertheless, despite this positive economic development there will be problems in the sectors in need of restructuring, that is the coal and steel industry; about 210 000 employees are affected by this restructuring. The environmental pollution associated with these industries will also give rise to problems. Although the extent of environmental pollution would be reduced by the restructuring of the coal and steel industry and reductions in capacity, substantial investment will still be required.</p>
<p class="contents">At present Poland is channelling about 1.7 % of its gross domestic product into improving the quality of its natural resources. The environment currently accounts for 10 % of all corporate investment. Another area in which great efforts are needed is agriculture. As you know, one wage‐earner in four works in this sector, which nevertheless generates just 6 % of gross domestic product. However, most farms produce for their own needs rather than for the market. The agricultural sector, comprising over two million farms, each covering an average area of no more than eight hectares, will therefore represent a serious social and regional problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Coal, steel and farming are therefore areas in which great efforts will have to be made in the future. But there are also areas where there have already been successful reforms: the reform of central, regional and local government, in which the number of voivodeships has been reduced, health care reform to introduce medical insurance, and reform of the pension system. The reform of the educational system is due to take effect in September of this year. Overall, this is a positive Commission report, which shows that Poland is developing well.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to return briefly to the point I made at the beginning. Ten years after the historical changes of 1989 we must do everything in our power to make this crucial progress with the accession process. This applies to both sides: the European Union and the applicant countries in Central and Eastern Europe. We must build on Agenda 2000 to make enlargement feasible, and the applicants must become fit for accession. We cannot risk the enthusiasm for membership in the CEECs being allowed to wane. The fifth direct elections to the European Parliament in mid‐June and an information campaign planned by the Polish Government provide a good opportunity to enlighten the public about the significance and the aims of the forthcoming EU enlargement and of membership.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the major social and economic impact, we need more than ever to highlight the overarching factor of securing peace throughout Europe. This will enable the existing and future EU Member States to make a significant contribution to the goals of political union.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bertens </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, last week Cyprus was in the news in connection with the violence in Kosovo in a rather peculiar way. Mr Denktash, the leader of Northern Cyprus, offered Muslim refugees 100 000 homes in the ghost town of Magusta. Nicosia reacted by sending Mr Kyprianou to Milosevic in order to try, as he said, to obtain the release of three US soldiers by invoking centuries‐old relations. The reason I am saying this is so that people can see how Cyprus could move just as easily in the direction of chaos as order.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the lingering conflict began a quarter of a century ago, and that it has certain things in common with what is now taking place in the Balkans. We see reminders every day of where this can lead.</p>
<p class="contents">After all the diplomatic efforts by the United Nations, the United States and the European Union, I honestly have to say that it seems unlikely to me that we will see the stability and security on the island of Cyprus which Mr Habsburg predicts. Membership of the European Union may perhaps lead to a solution to the division of Cyprus, or its occupation as I prefer to describe it.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, accession negotiations between Cyprus and the Union have so far not exactly proved successful. The latest condition laid down by Mr Denktash is that his republic must be recognised while, rather more strangely, Nicosia must immediately abandon its European aspirations.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the negotiations between the two communities are going wrong. For a while I thought that something was actually going right, when the President of Cyprus, Mr Clerides, said that he would not be deploying S 300 missiles, which I understand had come second‐hand from Russia. The security situation on Cyprus might well have justified their deployment, but it would also have had the effect of jeopardising security still further. I have not seen any gesture at all from Northern Cyprus of course, nor from Turkey either.</p>
<p class="contents">A solution is not made any more likely by a number of Member States including my own country, the Netherlands, coming out with statements more or less opposing membership for Cyprus as long as partition remains. This removes the catalyst effect of the accession process and gives Turkey what amounts to a veto on the Union"s decision to include Cyprus as a member. This is certainly not going to encourage Turkey to withdraw from Cyprus after a quarter of a century, especially as now, according to the Commission"s progress report, Cyprus is doing well. Telecommunications and information technology are the only areas in which Cyprus is requesting transition periods. There are scarcely any problems with the other main areas which have been screened to date. The figures for the Republic of Cyprus are 50 % higher than the economic and financial indicators for Northern Cyprus. Relations between Cyprus and the European Union are drawing closer and within a few years the 1973 association agreement will become a customs union. Yet the process still needs to be speeded up, and we might consider some kind of PHARE fund action for Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, as a final point I should like to ask the Commission to allocate the remaining EUR 17 million under the present protocol to the pre‐accession strategy. A financial injection may bring accession nearer and, as I have endeavoured to explain, accession will increase stability in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end, Mr President, on a very simple domestic point. In the Dutch text there is a very unfortunate mistake or printing error. The last reference in paragraph 2 on the substantial progress achieved in adopting the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> is ‘<span class="italic">justitie en buitenlandse zaken</span> ". I have seen in the English and French texts that the reference is clearly to ‘internal affairs". The Dutch text should therefore read ‘<span class="italic">binnenlandse zaken</span> ".</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Malone </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. ‐</span> Mr President, I am really delighted, in this plenary part‐ session of Parliament, to again be addressing you on the subject of Malta's accession to the European Union. Everyone here will be familiar with the history of this particular application. When it last came before us, in my report in 1995, Parliament gave a very favourable recommendation. Since then there has been a change of government in 1996 and the decision was taken to suspend the application and to look instead for a strengthened association agreement. The situation changed again in September 1998 with the elections and change of government, so the application has been reactivated and is before us again this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the application remained frozen for those two years, Malta remains in a very strong position. It has stable democratic structures and the economic indicators are quite close to our Community average. Although the Maltese authorities have introduced VAT, much new legislation is still required to bring Maltese law into line with the EU situation.</p>
<p class="contents">These reservations aside, I am very glad to be able to say that on this occasion also I recommend a very positive assessment of the Maltese application. In particular I welcome the fact that the Commission has recommended that the screening of Maltese legislation should begin as soon as possible, with a view to starting negotiations at the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">I do, however, regret that the Council and the Commission were quite slow in making progress here. Especially, I found, there was reticence on the part of the Council, in that it asked the Commission for a new opinion, an update of the 1993 opinion. It said it wanted to measure this again against the Copenhagen criteria. So there was much delay there but we did eventually receive that opinion from the Commission, in February of this year, at the stage when the negotiations were well under way with the first wave countries. I regret that delay.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the various amendments that we have received, on Amendment No 1 I will be looking tomorrow for a split vote. I can certainly recommend to the House that the application must take Maltese opinion fully into account. Indeed anybody who follows the Maltese media will know that it is the intention of the Maltese Government to hold a referendum on the issue. So I would agree with that particular section of Amendment No 1. However, I could not take on board the second part because to me it would be an undue interference in the internal affairs of the Maltese people.</p>
<p class="contents">I can certainly recommend Amendment No 2 and I will leave it to the judgment of the House as to how we should vote on Amendment No 3. I feel, however, that we should be consistent here with other accession reports.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I call on the Cologne European Council to take the decision to begin negotiations on Malta's accession by the end of this year. The Commission should draw up an accession partnership and provide for a programme of financial assistance for the pre‐accession period to help the Maltese authorities to bridge the economic gap that remains between Malta and the European Union.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Myller </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span><span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FI)</span> Mr President, I am delighted that my report on the environmental effects of enlargement was included in this Parliamentary debate dealing with the subject of applications for EU membership. It confirms the importance of one of the main themes of my report, namely that environmental issues must be a priority in negotiations for membership and that environmental questions must, in accordance with the principle of transparency, be an integral part of the whole negotiations process.</p>
<p class="contents">The forthcoming round of negotiations on accession will be very different from the previous one in terms of the emphasis given to environmental matters. The last countries to join the European Union were Austria, Sweden and Finland, at the beginning of 1995. Environmental legislation in these countries was in many ways even further developed than the legislation in the EU. The situation is now quite different, and the lack of environmental legislation in the applicant countries is one of the biggest barriers to accession.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the Treaty of Amsterdam we all now have obligations, furthermore, to integrate environmental policy into all areas of EU decision‐making, and Member States" compliance with these obligations is to be examined at future EU summits. As the accession talks proceed we must take stock of what progress the applicant countries are also making in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">There are enormous environmental problems in the ten applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe, and there are only meagre resources available to deal with them. However, the condition of the environment has been steadily improving since 1989, and there are large areas, for example, of unspoiled nature in these countries. As far as the diversity of the natural environment is concerned, too, the situation in these countries is either first‐rate or at least a considerable improvement on that in many of the current Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Accelerated economic growth on the one hand creates scope for improving the environment, but, on the other, will pollute the environment at an ever greater rate unless environmental legislation is tightened up at the same time. Furthermore, new investment in production must take account of the latest technology and should be undertaken now while these countries are negotiating their membership. In fact the greatest efforts to improve the environment must be made prior to accession. At the same time we must ensure that the resources made available for the applicant countries, <span class="italic">inter alia</span> under Agenda 2000, are put to best use in these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the responsibility for the EU budget is not equally shared: the greatest financial responsibility lies with the applicant countries themselves. EU funding through ISPA and PHARE can at best only act as a catalyst. The aim must be for these schemes to generate two to four times the funding set aside for investment in the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The environmental problems in the applicant countries arise from long‐standing shortcomings and neglect, particularly in the areas of water and waste management as well as emissions into the atmosphere from industry, energy production, and the present rapid growth in traffic. They also all face major problems in the areas of nuclear safety and the storage of nuclear waste. Solving this problem will also require a huge financial input, and the international investment banks also need to be involved here.</p>
<p class="contents">On the whole, however, it has to be said that eastward enlargement will have a positive impact on the environment of Europe, when accession results in the tightening up of environmental standards in the applicant countries, economic growth is placed on a sustainable footing, and the countries concerned are able to comply with international agreements on environmental issues. In order for this to be achieved, we must negotiate with each applicant country a realistic timetable based on the individual situation of the country in question, and the focal point of that timetable should be prior to accession. Transitional periods in respect of environmental legislation may be permitted only in exceptional circumstances and if the applicant countries themselves request it and also commit to a timetable for implementation. Nevertheless, transitional periods must not be allowed to exceed five years.</p>

All you would see is one crowded, complex, interdependent Cape of Eurasia. That is a salutary thought for all of us as we contemplate the challenges of enlargement. Our pollution is a common heritage which we all have.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly struck if you look at Europe in terms of its river systems rather than its political structures. I recall vividly the impact on myself of learning, during a floating symposium on the Black Sea last year, that a very high percentage of the pollution which is killing the Black Sea stems not from the riparian states but from run‐off from Austria and Germany of nitrogen and agricultural chemicals, pushed on to the land in the heart of Europe as a consequence of some of our malfunctioning environmental policies in the common agricultural policy and having a consequence hundreds and hundreds of miles away across the continent.</p>
<p class="contents">As we examine the environmental consequences and challenges of enlargement, we will not seek to enforce on those states which seek to join us in the applicant process the same kind of environmentally disastrous projects which we have often adopted in our own ignorance inside the Union over the last 40 years.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make just one other point. Despite my concern about the environment, I am an optimist and along with the author of the report I believe that much can be achieved in the environment in the process of enlargement. I am suspicious of those who would use the challenges of environment as an argument for delay in enlargement. In my view there is much that can be done. This is a solvable problem but we have to do it conscious that we do it as one continent linked environmentally and ecologically.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Theorin </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, enlargement is of course a huge challenge for the European Union. A major and pressing task lies ahead of us. Enlargement requires comprehensive change; this applies to the applicant countries – in this case Hungary – and to the European Union. Among other measures, we need a fundamental overhaul of the EU"s agricultural policy, which currently absorbs half its budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The applicant countries too will have to make adjustments in order to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria. Democracy and human rights must be consolidated, for example. In the case of a country such as Hungary, attention to its minorities – and their protection – will be important. The quicker the process unfolds the better, of course, but we can hardly set a date for the conclusion of negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">All applicant countries, including Hungary, need to strengthen their anti‐corruption strategies. It is vital that both the Commission and the Hungarian Government take account of the social costs of the economic and financial restructuring process. The price of getting fit for EU accession should not be paid by the least advantaged, with increased unemployment, a growing divide between people or the marginalisation of various ethnic groups. The negotiating process leading to EU accession needs to embrace the whole of society. It is therefore essential for the Hungarian Government to maintain an ongoing dialogue with both the opposition and the two sides of industry.</p>
<p class="contents" align="center">IN THE CHAIR: MR GUTIÉRREZ DÍAZ<br /><span class="italic">Vice‐President</span></p>
<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Poettering </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European People"s Party and also very much on my own behalf I would like to express the very sincere respect, esteem and gratitude that we owe to Otto von Habsburg. His speech here today is typical of the speeches he has made in the European Parliament over the last 20 years, since 1979. I remember very clearly when he talked of the former Soviet Union as being the last colonial empire on earth, with its annexation of the three Baltic states – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Mr von Habsburg, many people smiled when you said that, but I was always convinced that you were right. You had a vision that these states should be liberated, and today that vision is becoming a reality. They are now free to join the European Union, and you are an example of the fact that is visionaries who are the true realists.</p>
<p class="contents">We are discussing Estonia, Hungary, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Poland, Cyprus and Malta. But, as Otto von Habsburg has said, we should cast our net wider, towards Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia, and also towards Bulgaria and Romania. We in the PPE Group see the accession and negotiation as a single process, and we are convinced that we have to prove ourselves, and that the accession of all these countries associated with us by Europe agreements must soon become a reality. Of course, certain requirements have to be met. These countries need to speed up their reforms and actively pursue them. We are delighted to see that they are making great progress.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to encourage these countries and should not give them any discouraging signals. Because if we did discourage them, the reform process and the momentum in these countries would founder, which would be bad both for these countries and for the European Union. That is why we are telling these countries that they are welcome, that the people of these countries are welcome in the European Union, because they want to join our community and adopt its set of values. That is why we are calling for the Helsinki Council at the end of this year to start accession negotiations with Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, and of course also, as we are requesting, with Malta.</p>
<p class="contents">The Baltic states have suffered a great deal of pain in the course of this century, as Otto von Habsburg has already mentioned. As they have not been admitted to NATO yet, they are seeking security within the European Union. If we look at Kosovo today, we cannot fail to recognise that it is our duty to admit in particular the Baltic states into the European Union as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to make headway with the internal reform of the European Union. There is clearly a need for institutional reform if we want to remain effective. We also need to take certain practical steps. We have proposed for example that MPs from the applicant countries could attend meetings of our parliamentary committees as observers when accession issues are on the agenda. But in turn, we also have our own requirements. For example, we are calling on the Czech Republic to repeal laws and decrees still in force from 1945 and 1946 in cases where they refer to the expulsion of individual ethnic groups from the former Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p class="contents">We are faced with a great challenge. Back in 1989, we would not have dared to dream that we could be discussing such problems in 1999. But we are discussing them, and that is why we must now do whatever is necessary to ensure that this vision, which is edging closer to fulfilment, actually does become a reality in the foreseeable future, so that we can welcome the people of central Europe into the European Union and the European Parliament.</p>

And I believe that this is very important. When I visit the applicant counties, I am struck by their failure to understand our hesitation. For example, they cannot grasp why we are not full of enthusiasm once a date has been set for possible accession, 2002 in the case of Hungary. Of course, it is evident that meeting the criteria is essential for accession. And it is clear that they are making good progress in many areas, the economy for example, and also with the democratic and political criteria. Amazingly enough, the same cannot be said of other areas, such as administrative reform and above all legal reform. Sometimes it is not easy to explain to them that to have an effective legal culture prevailing within the judicial system and in the courts is simply essential for a properly functioning internal market, just as democracy is of course a requirement for political union. We must use great powers of persuasion here. On the other hand, we need to be extraordinarily careful about the kind of criticisms we make, so that they do not have the opposite of the desired effect. As it is, we often have the impression that not only do they not want to hear such criticism at all – and who does? – but that it even wounds their national pride and is counterproductive.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is no doubt at all about one point: we have to make it perfectly clear that we have every interest in these accessions taking place as quickly as possible once the criteria have been met. We should not transfer our difficulties to them and behave as if we were afraid of their economy and their people. That is the heart of the matter, and that is why we must make sure that these accessions happen as soon as possible once the criteria have been fulfilled. We need to make that crystal clear in all our discussions.</p>

<p class="contents">I am certainly in favour of enlargement to include these new countries. However, I am afraid that given the financial outlook and the fact that these countries are less wealthy than the existing members of the Union, there is a danger that certain regions, such as Galicia and Portugal, will become even more peripheral and marginalised because of reductions in the Structural Funds. This will make it difficult to achieve the economic and social cohesion Europe needs.</p>
<p class="contents">During the last parliamentary term I voted in favour of EU enlargement to include three rich countries – Austria, Finland and Sweden. The less wealthy countries now knocking at our door certainly deserve to belong to our community of economic and social interests. We should therefore cooperate in their development so that we can continue along the path of eastward enlargement, extending the route to Santiago de Compostela onward to Moscow and the Urals, a dream that could come true in 20 or 30 years" time.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also sure that these countries will be a perfect bridge for developing our relations with Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Generally speaking, the various rapporteurs from the Committee on Foreign Affairs have emphasised the difficulties that have to be overcome, have expressed their pleasure at the progress already made, and have insisted that reforms should be supported by accompanying measures designed to mitigate their consequences. It is for this reason that in countries like Poland there will be a particular need for thoroughgoing social, administrative and health reforms. Reforms of this kind will certainly have a special impact on more vulnerable people, especially pensioners.</p>
<p class="contents">With particular reference to Malta, I am pleased at the Commission"s recommendation that a critical examination of Maltese legislation should start immediately, so that negotiations with this country can begin before the end of this year.</p>

Mrs Myller"s report is excellent; her commitment to the issues is visible in every line. The environmental dimension is one of the main challenges of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps I might draw particular attention to two elements. The countries of Central and Eastern Europe seeking to join the Union are a true learning resource from our point of view. They certainly have an ecological head start in the agricultural sector. Their economic situation has meant that they have adopted farming practices somewhat different from those that we are used to in the EU. And I feel that we should be doing our utmost to support the most environmentally friendly forms of agriculture possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, rather than promoting the private car, we should be backing the well‐established and extensive public transport systems which exist in many of the CEECs.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also remember that it is not simply a matter of legislating from on high; local organisations need to be involved in what is going on. I am thinking of both the voluntary sector and bodies such as Urban Forum. The latter is active within the Union and needs to extend its outreach into Central and Eastern Europe.</p>

<p class="contents">We can all too easily forget that Slovenia used to belong to the Yugoslav Federation. Like Croatia, Serbia and Bosnia‐Herzegovina, it broke free and now would like very much to join the European Union. It has become a sovereign state and is, to use a Dutch expression, small but tough.</p>
<p class="contents">Psychologically the country would not appear to have any difficulty in becoming a part of the European landscape. Of all the applicant countries, Slovenia comes closest to fulfilling the conditions for full European Union membership. It will therefore be of great symbolic value if an agreement can be reached on this quite quickly. It could also serve as an example for the other candidates. What more must they do? Yet this report already refers to the next annual report.</p>
<p class="contents">So it looks as if it will be some time yet before we can talk of positive results. If I remember correctly, the conditions for entry were the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> , Maastricht and the desire to promote the further development of Europe, a market economy and human rights. My question is this: In the negotiations, what are we asking applicants to do about the common foreign and security policy? I believe that we now have an excellent opportunity for the Fifteen to decide a number of basic principles on this subject which consequently must also be accepted by newcomers. Now or never it must become clear just how serious we are about this common policy.</p>
<p class="contents">And how is the problem of solidarity discussed? What does convergence of opinions mean in the context of the negotiations? What is Slovenia"s position? I would also add: How do they view subsidiarity? Should we not be helping them to combat inflation, including by practical measures, and thereby boost the economy as quickly as possible?</p>

If successful, enlargement will place countries that have sought membership on a strong footing for economic growth based on sustainable development. This, however, will not come about automatically: we will have to get to grips with enormous problems in trying to achieve as much as possible with relatively few resources for development. For that reason we need to establish priorities, exploit the applicant countries" own resources, and implement tailor‐made solutions. It will be a process that requires capacity for change and adaptability according to circumstances. I would like to express my full support for the ideas set out by Mrs Myller, which reveal a sound and realistic grasp of the problem. A list should be drawn up of the most important points to focus on in environmental legislation, and the implementation of those points would serve as objective indicators. I would like to emphasise the importance of how investment in sustainable development is implemented in practice and monitored. Introducing environmental legislation into the administrations of the applicant countries will be an immense challenge, and for that reason the EU must provide the necessary support through training programmes and exchanges of information.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Titley </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, before I begin I beg your indulgence to join with Mr Poettering in paying tribute to the work of Mr von Habsburg in this House. As coordinator of the Socialist Group I should like to thank him for his help and advice over the time I have been coordinator, and for the quality of his work in committee. I am the last speaker of the Socialists and my job, therefore, is not to speak about individual countries, but to sum up the general debates.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to begin by quoting directly from the Czech application to the European Union. In the preamble to that application the Czechs say: ‘The construction of Europe has always been a matter of enlightened imagination, political courage, assiduous work, criticism, sober realism, solidarity and the art of cooperation, accommodation and compromise". I do not think we could find a better commentary on the process that we are currently undergoing.</p>
<p class="contents">We should be clear that if the challenge of the 1980s for the European Union was the creation of a single market, and the challenge of the 1990s was the creation of a single currency, the challenge for the opening years of the next millennium will be to enlarge the European Union so as to deepen it and also to create a zone of stability throughout the continent. This is our opportunity to reunite Europe, to build a whole continent built on the principles of peace, stability and prosperity. If we doubt the value of those characteristics we only have to look at the former Yugoslavia. Indeed the dream that should drive us is the dream of reuniting Europe. The nightmare that should spur our actions is what is happening in former Yugoslavia. Those are the alternatives which confront us.</p>
<p class="contents">To go back to the Czech application, they talk of sober realism. That has to be, without a doubt, a major motivating force. It is a difficult process. Let us not in any way underestimate the difficulties. We have our own difficulties which have already been outlined in the debate today about Agenda 2000. But the applicant countries themselves must go through a process of economic reform and keep that process on course.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular we must ensure that there is effective competition policy in all the applicant countries and that there is proper respect for intellectual property which will underpin inward investment, which is so important for them all. We have to ensure that their administrations are modernised.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said many times in these debates, in my view the biggest weakness of these countries is the administration and the judicial system and the lack of modernisation and investment. They must all take action against corruption because, as we know ourselves, corruption will undermine the political process. There can be no fudges whatsoever during that process. We have to be honest and realistic. We have to show solidarity and understanding for the difficulties these countries are going through. We have to ensure that we can take care of the social consequences of those reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">But the applicant countries must also understand that none of them is as yet in the European Union. They will all be judged on their own merits. They must continue the processes which they have been going through and show patience whilst they are going through the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">What is also needed, as the Czechs pointed out, is enlightened imagination and political courage. All problems can be resolved in politics if the will is there. Let us show that imagination and courage so that we can enlarge the European Union before the next European elections in 2004.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cushnahan </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Mr President, firstly I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs. However, despite my strong commitment to the process of enlargement, I acknowledge that we face real dilemmas during the process. On the one hand we have a political and, indeed, a moral obligation to honour the Treaty by admitting new members in accordance with it. On the other hand, we must be careful that the arrival of new members is not detrimental to the future workings of the Treaties. The jargon of the Union sums up the problem. Is it to be deepening before widening or widening before deepening?</p>
<p class="contents">We took a risk at the last enlargement by admitting three new members before any significant institutional reforms were in place to deal with the consequences of expanded membership. That risk was heightened by the presence in two of those countries of very significant anti‐EU minorities which, if they became majorities, could, under our present inadequate institutional arrangements, have stifled the very workings of the Communities. That risk, which I hope has disappeared, cannot be taken again even if it means postponing enlargement. An enlarged unreformed community has a permanently increased exposure to disagreements which could stultify progress to our ultimate goal of a United States of Europe. As an aside, I venture to suggest that this is the secret ambition of some of the supporters of early enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">There is now a new reason for hastening slowly on enlargement. The euro has had a successful birth and is established as a world currency but it is still an infant. Its continued health is an essential prerequisite, not just for the economic health of the Union and the Member States but to their economic viability. There can be no enlargement unless the applicant states are fit to join the single currency, posing no threat to its integrity and status, and are willing to join so as to avoid making the present two‐tier Union even worse. Hopefully, all existing Member States will have seen the light and be participants in the single currency before enlargement so that the applicants will have no choice on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement in the right circumstances will guarantee the benefits of the Treaties for new members. Enlargement in the wrong circumstances will certainly halt progress and will probably reverse it. We must get it right and I am confident that we can.</p>

This is therefore an appeal to overcome all the hesitations and uncertainties which up to now have characterised the attitude of the Council and the Commission. Above and beyond the size of the country, which is of course limited in terms of territory and population, Malta"s importance lies in the fact that it can help us launch and consolidate our policy in the Mediterranean area, which is one of the fronts on which tomorrow"s Europe will compete. We should bear in mind that new scenarios do arise and that overcoming the negative attitude, so to speak, on the part of Libya is a major factor in consolidating the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, from the forthcoming Cologne Council onwards, Malta should be considered in a positive light. I think all the right factors are there: the attitudes of the previous labour government have been overtaken by the determination of the current one, and the main macroeconomic indicators are good, as was acknowledged by the rapporteur herself, Mrs Malone. I hope things will move quickly, Commissioner.</p>

The same applies to Latvia and Lithuania. I was delighted at the result of the Estonian elections on 7 March. The winning parties were those who are most unequivocally working for EU membership and they have now formed a government. It is particularly gratifying that Mart Laar has been appointed as the new prime minister. Over the period between 1992 and 1994, he led the government which steered Estonia along what has proved to be such a successful course of reform.</p>
<p class="contents">25 March this year was the 50th anniversary of the day on which 20 000 Estonian citizens were subjected to mass deportation from Estonia by Soviet occupation forces. That tragedy was not played out on our TV screens as happens with today"s atrocities, so there is all the more reason for us to remember those people.</p>
<p class="contents">Even before enlargement takes place, the current Member States of the Union are benefiting considerably from the reforms and efforts undertaken by the applicant countries to meet the requirements which have been laid down. And we should be reminding voters of that when the elections take place in June. The switch‐over to a market economy in these countries has created new markets and jobs for us, and a high level of stability has enabled them to weather the Russian crisis better than might otherwise have been the case. As a result, we have been spared the need to intervene with a programme of assistance. First and foremost, however, their commitment to conflict‐resolution and human rights has meant that we have not had to endure ‘Kosovo crises" on our doorstep. This is the new dimension of the EU as a peace‐promoting enterprise.</p>

<p class="contents">One of the essential prerequisites for its success is maintaining a geographical balance when admitting applicant countries. Seen in this light, the accession of Cyprus takes on special significance. The fact that accession negotiations in this particular case have begun and are progressing normally is to be welcomed. These negotiations must continue until they have been successfully concluded. Impeding the negotiations, and linking their outcome to a resolution of the political and military issues that have afflicted the island for 25 years, as certain Member States of the European Union have unfortunately attempted to do, are diplomatic errors which go against the philosophy of the European Union and enlargement and jeopardise its successful completion.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Virgin </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, Mrs Myller has produced a sound and interesting report on the environmental strategies to be implemented in the run‐up to the accession of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. This is an important text, which fits in well with the commitment the European Parliament has consistently demonstrated towards environmental issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The report does, however, contain a number of points which I cannot support. It is stated, for example, that the ongoing privatisation processes in the applicant countries could jeopardise the status of conservation areas and the future of biological diversity. My view is quite the opposite. I believe that this privatisation thrust is essential to the interests of sound environmental policy. The countries of Central and Eastern Europe have a sorry history of totalitarianism, which left them with a legacy of severe environmental problems. It is now up to individual countries and the EU to embark on joint efforts in the interests of a better environment.</p>
<p class="contents">People care for the things they own. It is therefore paramount that legislation should safeguard the right of ownership. If someone pollutes my land, then I must have an incontrovertible right to claim compensation of some kind from the polluter. That is what the hallowed ‘polluter pays" principle is all about.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Myller also says in her report that increasingly intensive farming and forestry endanger the environment, as does road building. I disagree with her analysis. All human activity brings with it alterations to the environment. Such change need not necessarily be damaging, although human endeavour does sometimes impact negatively on the world around us. That is precisely why we need to set clear boundaries, but it does not mean that we should categorically condemn certain things. Normal agricultural and forestry activity does not in itself jeopardise the environment. It is therefore inappropriate to urge the applicant countries to abstain from the kind of farming and forestry practices that we view as normal. But it is essential that they comply with the environmental legislation we ourselves have agreed upon.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, let me highlight the huge environmental policy benefits associated with enlargement; the result will be a better environment for the whole of Europe.</p>

First, I would like to thank everyone who has helped to ensure that Malta is once again being considered alongside the other applicant countries, as envisaged at the Corfu and Essen Councils. I would also like to thank you in particular, Commissioner van den Broek, for the firm support you have offered ever since the present Maltese Government reactivated their country"s application for membership.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I have a few questions for the Commission on this. My first question is about the Task Force for the Accession Negotiations, which includes a special unit for each country. When will the unit responsible for Malta start work?</p>
<p class="contents">My second question is about the fourth financial protocol. According to this protocol the 1999 budget provides EUR 5 million each for Malta and Cyprus. But with the help of the Commission and before the recent elections in Malta, it had been agreed that the financial protocol for Malta would be extended by a further year. Now, several million euros are not available, because they were not included in the budget. Do you see any chance, perhaps by using the Notenboom procedure or some other method, of implementing this extended financial protocol now?</p>
<p class="contents">My third comment is on the report before us. I am very sorry that the rapporteur did not consider it necessary to be present for this debate. I am referring to the amendments tabled on the report. It seems to me that Amendment No 1, which takes the Maltese authorities and administration up on their promise to respect the vote in favour of membership of the European Union, is aimed at the wrong people. After all, with Norway we saw that it was ultimately the public who decided what would happen, without anyone making the authorities responsible beforehand. Overall, I am very grateful that we have had this debate here today.</p>

May I begin by again stressing, and this goes for all those responsible for preparing for enlargement within the Commission, that we are very much aware of the European Union"s historic and unique opportunity to extend peace and stability to large areas of this continent. I therefore fully agree with Mr von Habsburg and all those who have reiterated his message this evening that precisely during these weeks and months of conflict in Kosovo we are particularly aware of what it means to be able to live in peace and freedom and without repression within this community of values. We must therefore help all those who aspire to join this community during the difficult and complex integration process.</p>

<p class="contents">I should like to begin by saying that we are using all the pre‐accession instruments at our disposal in order to help these applicant countries with their preparations. The Commission will be drawing up further progress reports in the autumn, but we also intend to adapt, or rather adjust, the accession partnerships on the basis of the recorded progress and development in October this year, in other words before the Helsinki summit. At this point we can already report that all 10 Europe Agreements have entered into force and that the pre‐accession support agreed at the European Council in Berlin will double the financial aid granted to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Under the PHARE twinnings programme we expect around 100 experts from the current EU Member States to be in place in these applicant countries by the end of the year, and as far as we are concerned this figure of 100 needs to be doubled in the year 2000. These experts will be expected to transfer their knowledge about implementing the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> to the main ministries in the applicant countries. Officials will then be seconded for longer periods in the field of agriculture, justice, home affairs, finance and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Every applicant country has also approved a national programme for the adoption of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> which specifies the required personnel, budget and institutional resources. These countries are also being asked to make further adjustments to their programmes by the early summer in order to bring them into line with the latest developments.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I say anything about each of the six countries individually, I should perhaps say a word about Malta, which clearly finds itself in a rather special position as a result of the interruption in its membership application. Last December I was able to inform you that Malta"s application had been reactivated. As a result, the Council asked us to revise its 1993 opinion and we announced this on 17 February. The conclusion reached in this opinion was essentially that while there were no problems in respect to the political criteria for Malta, additional or structural economic reforms were still needed, while the two‐year break in Malta"s membership preparations had resulted in a delay in adopting the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> . The Commission believes the recommended screening should begin as soon as possible, as indeed will be the case, so that, as we say in the report, accession negotiations can begin at the end of this year. This may, as I hope, provide an impetus for the Helsinki summit in December. But at the end of the day it is the summit itself which must decide when to start negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, we are fully prepared. I can also reassure Mrs Günther that we have already taken steps to ensure that the task force negotiations can be enlarged at any time should the formal negotiations with Malta actually begin. I can also tell Mr Bertens, and on this occasion Mrs Malone too, that we will also be considering to what extent, for Cyprus as well as Malta, the present financial protocol can be converted into a financial instrument which is comparable to that for the other applicant countries. We are working on this at the moment and will return to it as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations are a complicated process in themselves, but I am delighted to be able to report that at the end of last year seven out of a total of 31 negotiating chapters had already been addressed. Faced with the need to determine their negotiating positions, the applicant countries succeeded in dramatically improving their internal organisation and coordination in a relatively short period of time. The questions we put to them about their ability to adopt the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> provided an extra stimulus for their preparations in this crucial area. I am saying this in reply to Mr Titley who made a comment about this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission for one also certainly plans to keep up the pace at which these chapters are addressed, which means that it should be possible to address another eight by the summer. The German Presidency itself has also announced this. This means that by around the middle of this year half of all the negotiating chapters will have been addressed, and if the pace can be maintained around three quarters will have been addressed by the end of the year. This says a great deal about the efforts made by both the applicant countries and the Commission presidency. This is a pace we want to sustain.</p>
<p class="contents">You know that the issues involved here are political criteria, economic criteria, the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> and administrative capacity. Before I comment on individual countries I should like to make a number of general points about these four important criteria which, as you know, were agreed in Copenhagen in 1993. Our evaluations set out in last year"s November reports were based on an in‐depth investigation of how democracy in these applicant countries works in practice. It was with great pleasure, not to say enthusiasm, that we were able to conclude that all things considered these are now well‐established democracies.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still a number of important aspects concerning the rule of law and democracy which still need attention and where further progress is necessary. I am thinking here of minorities, a particularly pertinent subject at this time, and also the need to strengthen the judiciary for example. In many countries, not only the applicant countries but in Member States too, there are major delays in the judicial process, usually because of staff shortages in the judiciary.</p>
<p class="contents">Now for a general comment on the economic criteria. All the countries with which we are negotiating have made considerable progress in moving towards a market economy, with particularly marked economic progress in countries such as Estonia, Hungary and Poland, which have made constant efforts to implement reforms since the opinions were published. In the report we also made no secret of the fact that Slovenia and the Czech Republic had made less progress and that they really needed to speed up the process. We told these countries this, which they accepted and they are now taking the necessary measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Next to the matter of the pace of adapting to the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> . The question is not only whether the countries are able to adopt the legislation but also whether they are able to implement it in practice? In this respect I believe the performance of the applicant countries remains very varied. In November we concluded that Hungary and Estonia had generally maintained a good adaptation rate, and that Poland had made major progress in a number of areas while falling behind in others. On this point too we had to conclude that the Czech Republic and Slovenia were lagging somewhat behind.</p>
<p class="contents">In the interests of the mutual trust which is also vital for European Union membership, it is crucially important for applicant countries to have the necessary administrative and judicial capacity. They cannot afford to neglect this area in their negotiations. This is also why we have devoted so much effort to the twinning operation under which experts from the Member States can be made available to the governments of applicant countries for longer periods.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now quickly comment on each of the six countries individually. Poland, for example, has achieved excellent results in meeting the political criteria by introducing a new Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure and by appointing a commissioner for the protection of civil rights. On the economic front, I would also inform Mrs Hoff that Poland achieved high annual growth over the past year, coupled with falling unemployment and inflation, a strong currency and an increase in direct foreign investments. A major effort was also made for the economic restructuring of the social security system, the iron and steel sector and the coal sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Less progress was made in adapting to the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> , particularly in the environmental field, and the legislative work needs to be speeded up together with efforts to attract investment to the environment sector. There have been delays in passing important laws on certification and conformity assessment, which has created problems – which is why I mention it – in terms of access to the Polish market. As for Poland"s most noted sector, namely agriculture, which Mrs Hoff also mentioned, I fully agree with her analysis that it is necessary to continue with reforms, especially in the field of rural development and improving veterinary and plant health facilities. On the other hand, I would praise Poland for the enormous work that has gone into the restructuring programme for the iron and steel industry. Nevertheless, greater efforts must be made in order to further clarify the entire privatisation strategy of the two largest companies and to set a clear timetable for privatisation and restructuring.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mrs Hoff"s recommendation to continue with PHARE support for social measures to accompany restructuring in the iron and steel sector. This will therefore also be taken into account in this year"s PHARE programme. There is a huge employment problem involved here.</p>
<p class="contents">Next the Czech Republic, which I talked about earlier. Only limited progress has been made in the overall process of adaptation and the implementation of the short‐term priorities for the accession partnership. Mr Carnero Gonzalez"s report lists a number of priority areas in which the Czech Republic must step up its pre‐accession measures, such as adapting its legislation to the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> in general, as well as reforming the apparatus of government and the judicial system, privatising state banks, policy on state support, protecting the environment and the further integration of the gypsy minority, the latter a point raised by Mr Gonzalez.</p>
<p class="contents">The new government"s programme includes many priorities which do indeed correspond to the accession partnership, but we hope that the government will also succeed in transforming these priorities into concrete results.</p>
<p class="contents">I can be quite brief on the subject of Hungary. There has been major progress in a number of areas, in particular the approval of a general reform package for the judicial system and the completion of the structural economic reforms. Another very favourable development is the strengthening of Hungary"s government apparatus by increasing the number of staff – something the Commission is naturally very jealous of – and organising training programmes for the medium term.</p>
<p class="contents">In some areas, such as environmental protection, the process of harmonising legislation is rather slow and regional development planning is also only in its earliest stages. Additional efforts are needed in setting up an effective service for controlling state aid, an important subject in itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now turn to Estonia, where there has been clear progress. This is a real front‐runner, with developments in the area of citizenship legislation particularly welcome. We know the political efforts this has required. We also hope, and I make no secret of the fact that I have some concerns about this, that Estonia will reexamine the language law and the law on parliamentary and local council elections which were passed following the publication of our last report. Our first impressions are that these laws could be at odds with international standards in this area. The Commission would be happy to work with Estonia to find solutions to this and shares Mr Donner"s view that more measures are required to ensure the integration of non‐Estonian speakers. Although it is no exception in this respect, Estonia must also make more effort to strengthen its administrative capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">Now Slovenia, which stands second to last in the line of negotiating countries. November"s progress report made it clear that Slovenia had not made sufficient progress on harmonisation in general. We discussed this at length with the Slovenian Government during a visit to Ljubljana, and I am confident that efforts will be made to catch up, as I agree with those who spoke about Slovenia, Mr Tindemans among others, that this is a country that has everything it takes for rapid and smooth integration. In this sense Slovenia"s performance has been disappointing, at least as things stood in November. But I repeat, I hope the government will be able to catch up. Slovenia knows exactly what is needed and what must be done, and we now need to give it the political encouragement to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, last but not least, Cyprus. Let me begin by saying that we much appreciate, and in a sense were reassured by – I say this to Mr Bertens – the fact that President Clerides had the wisdom to avoid creating tension on the island by reconsidering the decision to deploy defensive missiles. This certainly helped the island"s stability. I should also like to take this opportunity to express the hope that we will see new political initiatives which will restart the UN process on the island"s partition and dialogue between President Clerides and Mr Denktash. As I told Mr Dimitrakopoulos, I believe that in the meantime preparations for Cyprus to join the Union should continue unabated. President Clerides has made a generous offer to the Turkish Cypriot community to participate in the delegation to the accession negotiations. We also hope for better times in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say the following on the subject of economic developments. Since the 1993 opinion on Cyprus it still remains to be confirmed that the economy has the basic capacity to adapt to the challenges of enlargement. In this respect more attention needs to be paid to restructuring the internal financial sector to enable it to stand up to the pressure of competition as a result of the liberalisation of capital movements. The necessary progress has been made in adopting the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> , particularly in the context of the customs union, but considerable further efforts are required in the area of the internal market and more particularly in the area of tax and finance. Maritime transport, telecommunications, justice and home affairs are also points which require particular attention in the case of Cyprus. As regards Mr Bertens" request that we should come up with a proposal for a financial mechanism, I repeat what I said earlier on the subject of Malta, namely that we are working on replacing the financial protocol. This is a subject to which we will be returning.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I will end here. I would, however, just like to say a few words about Mrs Myller"s interesting and well thought‐out report. In May 1998 the Commission adopted a communication on accession strategy in the environmental field. The need for such a strategy stems directly from the Agenda 2000 proposals in which it is recognised that adopting the environmental <span class="italic">acquis</span> will be a huge task for the CEECs and one which can only be achieved in the longer term and at a very high cost. There was talk at the time of figures between EUR 100 and 120 billion. The communication looks at some of the practical questions which are relevant for drawing up national strategies allowing the CEECs to adopt the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span> without allocating funds from the pre‐accession instruments. Two of the main points in<span class="italic"> </span> the communication concern the efforts the CEECs must make, which are both considerable and expensive. It is, however, important to recognise that they not only serve environmental interests, but are also justifiable on economic grounds. The Union"s financial assistance provides just a very small part of the necessary resources, which is why a targeted, effective and strategic approach to the accession process is absolutely essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I have attempted to sketch, although perhaps at too great a length, the current state of affairs, as this Commission, or at least this college of Commissioners, will probably no longer be responsible for producing the next report. In any event I should like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank Parliament, and in particular the rapporteurs and all those who showed great interest in or were involved in the debate on the enlargement process, for the encouragement they have always given the Commission to take new initiatives in order to maintain the tempo of the enlargement process.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to end by saying to the enlargement countries themselves that our philosophy was and still is that each of the enlargement countries should be considered on its own merits and progress, even if this can result in a certain differentiation. It is therefore extremely important to make it clear that the enlargement family remains a family, even if at any given moment one may have made more progress than another. All‐inclusiveness is a basic principle and point of departure for all those involved in this enlargement process and will remain so.</p>
