It has become somewhat fashionable to attack the European Union project and its institutions. However, I want to pay a sincere tribute to those who work in the institutions and have made the registers and access to documents a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Today I looked at a briefing from an NGO which said that it was weary of congratulating institutions. That mystifies me absolutely. We need to congratulate where there is good work, and encourage good practice to spread across every department, DG and institution.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I make some pertinent comments on the report, I want to pay tribute to my colleague, Mrs Maij-Weggen, who leaves this House this month. I have worked very closely with her on this report from its very beginning when we were working on Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001, and without her contribution we would not have this outstanding regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me begin with some items in my report. I do not intend to use my full five minutes. As a rapporteur, it is important to listen – something politicians are often accused of not doing! Let me raise some issues that need highlighting.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to have greater and more succinct information on how our citizens can access this right to the information contained within the documents. We need common coding amongst the institutions so that the process of accessing information is simplified. In relation to the Commission at least, which has a number of registers, I would also welcome the establishment of a single register, even if it is only a single doorway into the other registers. We have yet again to reinforce the notion that we are making ourselves accessible to citizens, who may not know about this right or how to access it.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to talk about the case of exemptions. I wish to reinforce that there are no blanket exemptions on access to documents. Every request must be considered on a case-by-case basis. There have been some criticisms about the blanket refusal to give access to legal opinions. Where they fall within the legislative process there should not be a refusal, and, again, every request must be on a case-by-case basis. The European Parliament's committees – even the non-legislative committees – must apply the principle of transparency and at present the standard of transparency is not uniform from one committee to another. There are a number of sensitive documents which have not been registered with the institutions. This needs to be reviewed. I welcome Mrs Maij-Weggen's opinion and recommendations and, in particular, her view that the European Ombudsman should give an assessment of the regulation: how it is working and how the exemptions are applied. We need a common methodology to be applied by each of the institutions and the agencies – we must not forget that the agencies and organisations set up by the institutions must apply the regulation. They should use a common approach in assessing their annual reports, and then comparison will become fruitful and productive.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything I have said may imply that there is much to do. Of course there is, because we aspire within the European Union to perhaps defy our critics, to prove them wrong, to connect with our citizens and to prove that the European Union project is one that we should be proud of and should celebrate. We have not got it right. Sadly, perfection often eludes us in human endeavours, whether by politicians or anyone else. However, our commitment to try is there within Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 and in the spirit of those people who have worked to make access a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank Mr Cashman for his work and congratulate him on his detailed report on the issue we are debating today, namely transparency. All three of our institutions are firmly committed to transparency and are determined to honour that commitment. I am grateful for this opportunity to speak on behalf of the Commission and provide more detail on some of the key points raised by Mr Cashman.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cashman stated considerable progress had been made, and that this should be recognised. I agree with him. Our annual report has recently been released, and presents a fairly detailed overview of the situation. I also agree with Mr Cashman that there is scope for further improvements and that such improvements must be effected. In addition, case law is facilitating the interpretation of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001. Consequently, the use of this important tool facilitating transparency will improve, and democracy will therefore be strengthened. In this connection and by way of example, I should like to refer to the decisions handed down by the Court of Justice at Luxembourg concerning the non-disclosure of legal opinions. The decisions of the Court confirm our practice, which recognises the institutions’ need to preserve the independence of such legal rulings. In other words, time for reflection is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, therefore, progress is being made. According to this report, a further step towards the aim of maximum transparency should be the creation of a single register of documents to replace the current registers. Nonetheless, if what we are about is making it easier for the citizens to search for and identify documents, the crucial factor is not the choice between one or several registers. Rather, it is a point of entry to a unified portal, where clear information is given as to which documents are contained in each register. Mr Cashman rightly pointed this out. In any case, further consideration must be given to the technical solutions that will enable us to move towards better integration of these instruments in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to refer to the significant progress made with regard to the number of documents directly accessible. By way of example I could mention the Commission’s agendas and the minutes of our meetings. It goes without saying that it is our intention to strengthen this approach and develop it further. For instance, between now and the end of the year the register of documents concerning comitology will become accessible to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, the practice regarding access to documents concerning infringement procedures has been updated. This was another of the criticisms made by Mr Cashman. Now, when proceedings are completed, the assumption is that such documents may be released. In this connection, it should be borne in mind that Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 provides protection where it is required, namely for investigations conducted under such procedures. In this way, for ongoing, unfinished cases a balance is struck regarding the aforementioned assumption on non-disclosure.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I must point out that the Commission has never refused access to documents without providing suitable justification for its decision. The Commission always invokes Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001. Quite simply, the unspecified exceptions referred to in our annual report relate to cases in which access to documents was refused on the basis of a number of the exceptions provided for in the regulation, not on a single one of these. It was therefore impossible to be specific. Such refusals amount to 12% of the refusals to provide information. In other words, they amount to 38% of 30% of the refusals.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mr Cashman for his recommendations on how to improve transparency still further. His suggestions are useful for all the institutions, and due account will be taken of them.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall consider possible improvements to allow better integration of instruments for archiving and identifying documents. We shall also take up Mr Cashman’s suggestion and consider a common methodology for the drafting of annual reports. This would facilitate comparisons. Mr Cashman’s suggestions concerning the evaluation report, due to be presented by the Commission early in 2004 will also be borne in mind. The three institutions dealt with all these issues yesterday, at a truly productive and fruitful meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">Some problems remain. We have reservations concerning the possible creation of a directive harmonising national legislation in this field, as mentioned by Mr Cashman in his report. There is no appropriate legal basis for such a step. I am aware that Mr Cashman himself appreciates the difficulties and shares our misgivings. Mr Cashman made this clear at our meeting yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of all this, I truly believe that the assessment of a year of implementing Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 has to be very positive. The rapporteur indicated as much. Of course, this should not be an excuse for complacency. On the contrary, it should encourage the introduction of further improvements to the initiatives and measures adopted. All is not perfect, but I do believe it is fair to state that things are going well.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be emphasised that this is an important instrument of transparency. It grants clear and unequivocal rights to the citizens of the Union. It is worth highlighting, however, that as far as the Commission is concerned this instrument has been used mainly by law professionals. In particular, it has been used by law firms. This needs to be borne in mind. What this suggests is that, generally, the citizens tend to use conventional methods of obtaining good quality, clear, precise and relevant information on activities undertaken by the institutions. They favour this approach, rather than consulting specific documents. It is also true, however, that universities and non-governmental organisations, for example, have made considerable use of this facility. This is an area closely linked to transparency. We must maintain our efforts to ensure continued improvement of the information made available by the institutions on their activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Maij-Weggen is leaving the House. I would like to take this opportunity to thank her for the excellent work she has undertaken over the years. She has striven to ensure transparency and to improve the quality of the information available to our citizens. In so doing, she has helped to promote effective democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Cashman and I have worked together on openness a great deal in recent years. That cooperation has always been very positive, very constructive and productive, and that way you start to become good friends too. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs made a number of comments on the first assessment by the Council, the Commission and Parliament regarding the implementation of the Regulation in its first year. We observed that the number of requests for access to documents that were refused by the Council and the Commission is still too large to be readily acceptable. In fact, we should like to see another assessment of the situation by the European Ombudsman for 2004, so that it can be ascertained where further improvements can be made with regard to Article 4, for example, in order to bring about an even greater access to documents; including in the Council, in particular. An important point regarding the Council is that it differentiates between documents of Member States acting, on the one hand, in their capacity as Council members and, on the other hand, as individual Member States. That leads to unequal treatment, with significant restrictions regarding documents of Member States who themselves hardly have any legislation on openness. In the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, the most appropriate solution is to ask the Member States to adopt open government, too; the Commission would have to submit a directive on this. That is the appeal we make to the Commission: to see whether it can submit a directive that ensures that open government is the same in all the Member States. That would be a good thing for the citizens of those Member States, and also for the citizens who call on EU documents, because it would mean that they had equal access whether they requested them from Sweden, Greece or Portugal. That was my last intervention here in Parliament: I should like to thank Mrs de Palacio, and I should also like to thank the Presidency for its kind words earlier today.</p>

I would also like to pay tribute to Mr Cashman’s sustained efforts to promote transparency and access to documents. I have had the opportunity of working with him and serving as rapporteur for the group for other reports regarding access to historical archives. Throughout, Mr Cashman has always impressed me with his great commitment to these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also join with previous speakers in congratulating Mrs Maij-Weggen and commending her on the example she has set. A few minutes ago she was taking her leave of us outside the Chamber. Nonetheless, she is working to the very end of her time as a Member of the European Parliament, and is back on the floor of the House speaking on a serious issue, namely access to historical archives. I offer her my congratulations. Further, I am grateful to her for serving as a role model for a young politician like myself.</p>
<p class="contents">All of us working for Community institutions are concerned about access to information. We are also concerned about the image Europe presents to its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">We tend to be criticised for being distant. We also receive complaints that Community institutions are hard to understand. In my view, facilitating access to documents is the best way to bring Europe closer to its citizens and enable those citizens to understand us better.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe a suitable policy on public access to documents will prove a vital tool in bringing the institutions closer to all the citizens. The citizens need to be convinced of the transparency and efficiency of our institutions and even that they actually serve a purpose. As politicians, it is our duty to keep the citizens informed. Further, as European politicians, it is our duty to require the institutions to be as transparent and accessible as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur congratulated the Community institutions on their recent progress regarding access to documents, and on putting in place the technology required to facilitate access to information for the citizens. I would like to add my voice to his. It is true that much remains to be done. It is also true that our group endorses many of the complaints referred to by Mr Cashman in his report. There is certainly a good deal of work outstanding.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, it is important to strike a balance between efficiency in transparency and access to that information on the one hand, and the potential cost of such measures on the other. Allow me to mention an example of a measure I find too expensive. A number of colleagues on the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs asked for video recordings to be made of many parliamentary sittings and committee meetings, and for the recordings to be accessible through the Internet. The cost of this cannot be justified at present, though it might be in the future. I agree with those who advocate that the measures adopted should include the simplification, codification and unification of the registers of the three institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now turn to what is perhaps the most controversial point mentioned by the Commissioner, Mrs Maij-Weggen and by the rapporteur himself. It relates to access to Member States’ documents when the latter are acting as individual Member States and not in their capacity as Council members. Mr Cashman’s initial proposal is indeed too ambitious. It is not possible to go that far. Nonetheless, it would be appropriate to draw up some kind of proposal requesting Member States to be just as transparent as Community institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens would not understand why a Community document should be easier to access than one originating from their Member State. Consequently, we shall support Mr Cashman’s amendment to his own report tomorrow. I refer to the amendment deleting a few words from section 16 of the report, in the interests of clarity. This is all thanks to Mrs Maij-Weggen’s proposal in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I personally incline more to the ‘aggressive journalist’ tendency, and, in my professional life, have found, rather, that you only get anywhere by going straight to the point and really piling on the pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of their content, the points have already been explained by Mrs Maij-Weggen, who has once again gone into a lot of detail, this time in listing the information she possesses about who refuses access to documents – too little information on her part in the case of ‘who’ – where and when this has happened, and about who is requesting such access. Because we are almost experiencing something of a mood of celebration in the House, not least as we mark Mrs Maij-Weggen’s departure, we have also been thinking quite constructively in saying: please, Commissioner – and this applies still more to the Council – do not imagine that it is out of any lack of interest that so few journalists try to gain access to documents. Journalists have come to believe that they might as well be looking for needles in haystacks as trying to find the documentation they need. According to yesterday’s <span class="italic">Frankfurter Allgemeine</span> newspaper, ‘Nothing is more exciting to the public than what is supposedly not there’. Whereupon, the information enters the public realm through other routes and becomes, sometimes justifiably and sometimes completely unjustifiably, the subject of scandal.</p>
<p class="contents">Might it not be an idea – and one that you could take on board today – perhaps to take the trouble to visit <span class="italic">amazon.de</span> or <span class="italic">amazon.com</span>? The way it works is that, even if you have something and nothing in the way of information – just a clue as to a book’s title or an author’s name – you arrive at the relevant page and are immediately told: ‘Customers who bought this book also bought …’ With <span class="italic">amazon</span> you can go on to make and accumulate purchases, so it might be imagined that, in the case of the European Commission, documents in use might immediately be traceable. They are really very well managed, to the point of being childproof, youthproof and, if you like, with a guaranteed future. I therefore believe that a standardised portal along <span class="italic">amazon </span>lines – partly, but not exclusively, computer-driven and greeting people with the words, ‘Hello, you are now at our Brussels premises. What do you need? How can we help you?’ – would really help matters along, enabling a lot of what we are constantly talking about in this House to be achieved. The debate in progress today is, in many ways, reminiscent of the developments surrounding the Freedom of Information Act in the late sixties or early seventies. I personally remain an adherent of the principle that someone actually needs to have only an idea that something might be there and does not need to make a specific enquiry. That is something which still has to come about, and that is what the revision next year is for. This is something one can look forward to with some optimism if one hears as many good intentions as we have heard today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Progress has definitely been made. More and more documents have been put in the public domain. The question is, however, whether citizens can find them. Guaranteeing access is not sufficient. Accessibility is also chiefly to do with a clear structuring of the data. In this connection, Mr Cashman has called for Community codes and a register. I think that that is a good idea.</p>
<p class="contents">Accessibility of data is an outstanding means of remedying the negative image of the European Union as remote and bureaucratic. In addition, openness and accessibility of data are an important key to democratisation. This morning, we voted on the McCarthy report. That is an example of tremendous citizens’ participation in legislation. Citizens must be able to familiarise themselves with the early stage of legislation in order that they may influence it. The computer is an incredibly effective means of involving citizens in this. On a personal note, I was absent from Parliament for three years, and was able to retrieve a large amount of the data I wanted by computer. However, I also frequently ran aground in the soup of links, and ended up empty-handed. I think that a good deal more must be done in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">The computer also represents an environmentally friendly and paper-saving way of working. I think, therefore, Commissioner, that we have to set to work in particular on extremely user-friendly computer programs. In my opinion, there is still room for improvement there.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a crying shame, however, that the European Council, in particular, is defaulting. Countless complaints arrive at our door, especially in the fields of justice and foreign affairs. Nor does the lack of clarity over which Member State does what square with openness, or with the new Constitution, which extends obligations to all the institutions and agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the proposal on this issue was one of the last in a series of good ones by Mrs Maij-Weggen, and I shall gladly support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The result of the review carried out in 2001 is encouraging. Clear progress has been made, and the trend is towards a more open attitude which will hopefully also lead to people making better use of their rights. Mr Cashman’s report clearly shows, however, that there is still a very great deal to be done and that there are still serious deficiencies. One such serious deficiency is that, when electronic systems are created, this is in the form of more than one system instead of a uniform system. I am grateful that Commissioner de Palacio emphasised this, together with the fact that a uniform and coordinated electronic case handling system is needed, whereby cases might be monitored throughout the whole process. Otherwise, it will be impossible for people to acquaint themselves with such a process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council seems, however, consistently to interpret Article 4 of the Regulation too restrictively, that is to say where general security is concerned. Something must be done about this as soon as possible. In Amendment No 2, we have proposed a change to paragraph 4 in order genuinely to bring this about.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 16, which talks about a harmonisation of the legislation on open government in the Member States’ administrations, worries me a little. I do not believe that we would in that way obtain increased openness and greater access to documents. I propose, instead, that you vote in favour of Amendment No 3 by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my view, over and above the democratic deficit which we all condemn, this debate reveals the existence of a discrepancy between what it is possible to achieve and what is necessary. I fully agreed with the first part of Mr Oreja Arburúa’s speech, but then he appeared to take a step backwards regarding the need to make committee debates public too, which are much more like proper debates than the debates in the Chamber and are certainly much more of a political exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">Transparency and access to documents are not just a slogan – they mean, first and foremost, democratic control on the part of the citizens. If we look now at the possibilities for democratic control of the institutions’ work, we see that they are extremely limited.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of major policies – justice, home affairs, foreign policy, defence – the European Parliament is, as a general rule, merely consulted. The national parliaments are informed, the Court of Justice has limited powers and, lastly, of course, the citizens benefit from direct access to documents.</p>
<p class="contents">For example – as has been pointed out – there is no justification for banning the disclosure of which Member State has tabled a particular proposal in the Council or of how it voted. We see this as a serious violation of the citizens’ civil and political rights. The citizens, like we members of national parliaments and the European Parliament, are being denied the right to know what their governments are doing and to express an opinion. Thus, democracy is being prevented from working as it should.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it was the European Ombudsman who noted, in one of his special reports to Parliament, that it makes no sense to keep legal opinions secret when they are not like communications between lawyers and clients. I fail to understand why this step towards greater transparency is so feared by the institutions’ legal services and is, likewise, concealed by politicians.</p>
<p class="contents">Another positive aspect of the report is the criticism levelled at the Commission for bowing to Member States’ refusal to allow citizens access to their correspondence with the Commission in the context of infringement proceedings, whereas, in our opinion, the same regulation gives the Commission a facility to take independent decisions which it is refusing to use. Our fear is that, in this way, the Commission is covering up the misdeeds of the Member States and, in so doing, acting unlawfully itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, for instance, that, concerning what happened with regard to the requests for access to Spain and Portugal’s correspondence on the infringement proceedings which the Commission intended to instigate against these countries for violation of a taxation directive – given that the Catholic Church is exempt from paying VAT – there is no reason for the public not to know the grounds on which the two States convinced the Commission to file the case despite the fact that genuine infringement had clearly occurred.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that we need to look at practical cases in order to see what is necessary, not just what is possible, in this attempt to reconcile genuine needs and make good the democratic deficit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact is, however, that it can now be observed that the three institutions have undergone a minor revolution when it comes to openness and public access to documents. If we take 2001 as our starting point, when we began with quite a closed culture, we can now observe how Parliament hands out 90% of all documents requested and how the Commission and the Council hand out 60% to 70% of them.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, still something to reflect upon in this context, namely the basic principle that it is openness that is the rule and secrecy that is the exception. We all know this, but it has probably not percolated right down through the organisation and to the people. I am convinced that it will happen, but we have a responsibility to give some impetus to the process.</p>
<p class="contents">Further analysis is required of quite a few issues that are topical right now. I am extremely pleased that Mr Cashman is expressing a wise position – one which Mrs Schörling has also put forward and with which I agree. I should like to thank him. It concerns harmonisation of the Member States’ legislation. I do not believe that anyone in this House really wants to contribute to there being less public scrutiny. I therefore believe that this is an issue that must be reviewed carefully before the positions are established.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain areas really must be discussed. One such area, which we have discussed at length, is the sensitive issue of the statements from the institutions’ legal services. Where these are concerned, we are now awaiting a court decision. I hope that it will soon be possible to open up certain areas and that we shall not see the systematic classification of documents as strictly secret. A first step may perhaps be for a time limit partially to be imposed upon secrecy. Certain expressions must be defined more clearly so that they cannot be misused, for example concepts such as the overarching general interest and issues that are sensitive in terms of the legislative process.</p>
<p class="contents">Openness and access to documents is, however, a long way from just being a question of giving people formal rights. It is just as important that the institutions and their documents genuinely become accessible. There is clearly now at last an increasing interest in EU issues around Europe. We are beginning to see a growing debate, but the institutions appear still not to have succeeded in fully turning this increased interest to good effect. I hope that we shall be more successful and manage to make the institutions people-oriented. The legislation on openness is preparing the ground in this connection. At the last meeting of the interinstitutional committee, we discussed possibly producing material showing the successful work that has been done and the opportunities available to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and its institutions are sometimes very distant from the people. No advanced computing expertise and specialist knowledge of how the institutions operate should be required in order for people to be able to benefit from the regulations on openness. There is still a good deal to do where these are concerned. As many speakers have emphasised in the course of the debate, simple user-friendly registers are required. There must be simple ways of keeping track of the legislative process. There is a wealth of computer portals and home pages and various other ways of obtaining information, but what are required are focus, consolidation, user-friendliness, simple language and, of course, a simplified procedure for finding material. It must not be too difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">Changing the EU’s institutional culture takes time, but we have achieved a lot in a short time. I am proud of the fact that the European Parliament is the institution that is setting the pace where issues of openness are concerned. In this connection, I wish especially to address Mr Cashman and thank him not only for his report but also for the considerable amount of work he has done over many years and the friendship to which all this work has given rise.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to address some sincere words of thanks to Mrs Maij-Weggen now that she is to finish and say what a real pleasure I have found it to work with her, what an incredible amount I have learned and how much knowledge I have acquired. I have also learned a lot about flexibility from Mrs Maij-Weggen, something that is an important feature of European cooperation. We have also developed a friendship. I wish to conclude by sincerely wishing her success in her continued work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A few rooms away from us, fellow MEPs are sitting reading the reports on what has happened in Eurostat, but they have been gagged. As a sincere Europhile, it pains me every time I come across this culture of secrecy. Why do so many people within the EU institutions continue to believe that it is acceptable to carry on public activities without total and comprehensive public scrutiny? An exhortation to the Commission: do not let the Eurostat scandal sully the good work you have done during the historic years when Europe was being reunited.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank Mr Cashman for his report and the excellent work he has done in order to open up the EU and its institutions. I should like to make a few brief comments. It is true that a lot has obviously improved, but that is not enough. We are not here to stand around hugging one another. The rules on transparency should apply to all the institutions, including, for example, the ECB and Eurostat. It is worrying that the Council has begun to discover its own methods of classifying documents as strictly secret. Simpler and more comprehensive registers are needed. The Commission should have one register, not several. All documents must be registered, something that does not happen at present.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of refusals of requests for documents has increased. That is a completely wrong road to go down and is not in the right spirit. Openness must be the rule rather than the exception. It is important for the culture of openness to be established before enlargement. With this in view, the staff of the EU institutions need to be educated about the regulation and convinced of the advantages of openness.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the report should have shed more light upon Parliament’s deficiencies. We need to improve in this institution too. Thank you, Mr Cashman, openness is emphatically democracy’s best defence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I endorse the Vice-President’s statement. We have engineered a revolution. The Vice-President provided most of the leadership in this field in the course of her parliamentary duties. Today, we are debating the Cashman report. Yesterday, internal discussions were held between the three institutions to consider the progress achieved. The Cashman report is certainly helpful in identifying areas where there is scope for improvement. We have indeed accomplished a great deal, but we should set our sights still higher.</p>
<p class="contents">I expressed my views at yesterday’s meeting, but I believe it is appropriate to reiterate them before the House today. Commission records refer to the refusal of 30% of requests for information. It should be stated that the Commission only records requests requiring implementation of Regulation EC No 1049/2001. By contrast, Parliament records all requests. If the Commission recorded all direct consultation of information available to citizens where recourse to Regulation EC No 1049/2001 is not required, the percentage of requests refused would be minimal.</p>
<p class="contents">As stated in the Cashman report, it is very important for us to agree on the methodology for recording results. It may prove appropriate for all requests for information to be recorded. If that were done, the Commission would appear outstandingly successful in making information available to the citizen, as I said earlier. Well over 90% of requests received positive responses.</p>
<p class="contents">We have provided information only on the number of requests for information coming under Regulation EC No 1049/2001 that it was necessary to refuse. In each case, individual reasons and justification were provided, with reference to the provisions of the regulation in question. No information was provided for other requests.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the process needs to be improved. A better quality of service is needed, as the Cashman report rightly points out. This too was discussed at yesterday’s meeting with the Vice-President. All three institutions must adopt a common approach when responding to requests for information and invoking exceptions. Yesterday’s discussion should prove most helpful in this regard. We are to research and assess the feasibility of actually running a joint training programme for officials, especially regarding archives.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, at the end of the day, some information simply cannot be provided and is not provided. That is the case here and in all countries. It even happens in countries boasting of maximum transparency. Some documents are not really documents as such. Rather, they are instruments supporting the exercise of the right to think and reflect. They cannot be released. The same applies to issues involving the rights of third parties. These rights could include the right to defence, in criminal cases, or economic rights in business cases. There needs to be protection in such situations, and they are provided for in the aforementioned regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should like to thank the whole House for its interest in this subject. I do not know if Mr Cashman or Mrs Cederschiöld will be present when the next report on the subject is presented. I might not even be present myself. Nonetheless, I trust the House will then be able to agree that a step forward has been taken. That is our shared ambition and we shall do our utmost to achieve it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
