<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stefano Zappalà (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall try to summarise very briefly the content of a directive that is of particular importance to many tens of millions of European professionals, and above all to all EU citizens, who have to deal with professionals every day.</p>
<p class="contents">This extremely important directive relates to a fundamental theme, namely the completion of the internal market. National autonomy means that each Member State lays down rules and procedures for the practice of the professions, whereas under the Treaties every EU citizen should be able to enjoy the right to work in any other Member State of the Union, either temporarily or permanently, on a par with any citizen of the host country. National autonomy means that each government decides on the minimum standards of education and training required for access to the individual professions and also establishes who shall authorise and control the practice of the professions.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this context of respect for the Treaties, respect for national autonomy and the principle of subsidiarity, we need to harmonise the system. Countless directives have regulated this area over the past decades, but with this directive Parliament is unifying them into a single provision within the framework of an overall macrosystem – while respecting certain special features and certain professions.</p>
<p class="contents">The points contained in the directive are fundamental. For the sake of brevity I shall highlight just a few of them. The Treaties mention liberal professionals but never define them. In this directive we define liberal professions for the first time, albeit within a recital. This is a remarkable step forwards, partly because, by referring to certain specific articles in the Treaty, Parliament is laying down a definitive framework to form the legal basis for future provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive introduces a fundamental definition – that of competent authority – meaning those national bodies and soon, we hope, according to the preamble to the directive, European ones too. Such a definition should put an end to the debate that dragged on during the last legislative term about orders, colleges and associations. All those bodies can at last be included either in the context of national legislations or within the framework of European law.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive covers a raft of other fundamental new ideas: ‘qualifications shopping’ is avoided; those exercising public authority – notaries in particular – are excluded from the area of free movement; and the possibility of acting according to the country of origin principle is precluded – we shall try to delimit this point in another directive. In addition, it establishes that representatives of the individual professions shall be consulted in future at a European level in relation to any other innovation that concerns them.</p>
<p class="contents">I still have two more points to mention. Some European professionals – German craftsmen and Italian engineers, for instance – feel that there is no room for them in this directive, but that is not the case. In conjunction with the Commission, we shall try in future to solve specific problems through common platforms and other instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I shall conclude by thanking Parliament as a whole. Parliament is in perfect agreement on this directive, and I am also very pleased at the exceptionally good relationship that we have had with the Presidency and the Commission. That understanding has enabled us to reach a compromise on which everyone agrees, one that ennobles the work of the European Union, puts an end to daily bureaucracy and opens the door to a more certain and less bureaucratic future. The directive we shall be adopting tomorrow is certainly a major innovation for our Europe, for the Europe that we all want. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also wish to thank the shadow rapporteurs, Mrs Weiler, Mrs Rühle and Mr Lambsdorff for their cooperation and constructive attitude in working towards an agreement with the Council on this vital piece of single market legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">As you all know, this directive is an important practical contribution to skills mobility. It covers a large variety of issues of great interest to the professions and also to their clients. A reasonable compromise on the text provides us with a major success story in the field of the internal market. The final result strikes a balance between the right to free movement of fully qualified professionals and the need to protect consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I welcome the maintenance of the five levels of qualification, which have played a central role in the operation of professional recognition at EU level over the last 15 years. This solution ensures the transparency necessary for the application of the system and keeps existing guarantees for migrants.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive improves conditions of free movement for professionals through simpler and clearer rules, in particular for the temporary provision of cross-border services. I am happy to acknowledge that Parliament has played a constructive role in achieving the right degree of flexibility for the provider of a professional service who wishes to exercise his activity elsewhere in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In an enlarged Europe, more effective systems for managing our legislation have become an absolute necessity. The mechanisms and procedures provided for in the directive update the existing ones and should ensure its efficient implementation in the years to come. In particular, the new regime for the automatic recognition of medical specialities reconciles the need for simplification with the legitimate demands of the profession. For its part, the consultation of professional associations will provide the Commission with the technical advice necessary for the proper running of the system. Toine Manders’ suggestion, in this respect, at last week’s trialogue was particularly welcome. It enables us to ensure a proper and effective consultation of professional organisations and feed in the results of that consultation in the decisions to be taken through comitology. Professional associations will thus be closely involved in the implementation of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Last, but not least, I appreciate the additions to the common position suggested by Parliament, such as those regarding: firstly, the possibility for professional associations to create professional cards; secondly, the possibility of further harmonisation for additional professions in the future; and, thirdly, the anti-abuse clause which will preclude so-called ‘qualifications shopping’.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I wish to pay tribute to the members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for their constructive approach that has enabled an agreement with the Council without the need for conciliation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would thus very much like to congratulate the Commission on the initiative it has taken, and Mr Zappalà and the other groups’ shadow rapporteurs on the work they have done. Virtually on a daily basis, we have to explain to the people in our Member States that the free movement of goods has a concrete, positive benefit for many people. It takes even greater effort to emphasise to them the importance of a good services directive, but people come to us to complain about the excessive barriers to mobility that they – whether as students, workers, self-employed, or in some other category – have to negotiate if they wish to work or move across borders. It is therefore high time that we consolidate the fifteen directives on the recognition of professional qualifications which we have approved one by one over the years, and that we give this a cohesive legal framework with five levels, which moreover, should be easy to adapt.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats fully supports the result presented by the rapporteur today. We cannot address all its aspects, but are pleased with the content nevertheless. We are particularly pleased that an agreement has now been reached with the other institutions, at least that is what we hope, and that this issue can therefore be brought to a speedy conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group has responded favourably to the recognition of the specificity of professions and the individual character of the notary’s office, of the role of professional organisations and to the way in which we are finally being allowed to know the content of this important directive and, on the basis of this, to deduce which areas are left over for the other important directive – that on the services market – with which we have yet to deal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This new directive covers employed persons and self-employed professionals in what are termed the regulated professions, that is to say, those in which skills are attested by qualifications, ranging from architects to heating engineers by way of nurses and pharmacists. While incorporating ECJ rulings and making them permanent, it will also simplify matters, and that is precisely what we wanted – a balance between the right to free movement and settlement in Europe on the one hand and secured standards for professional qualifications and in consumers’ interests on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner has just said, this directive can be seen as one of the services directives, and it is indeed meant to make the internal market simpler. In terms of European internal market policy, then, it is the positive side of the coin, and my description of it as ‘positive’ is meant by way of comparison with the notorious services directive. For the benefit of those who do not yet believe me, let me quote: ‘Migrant professionals shall be made subject to the same conditions for exercising a profession as the nationals of the host Member State’, or, even more specifically: ‘The qualification requirements of the host country must continue to be met’. That shows how important it is to us that the rules and regulations of the destination country or host country should be taken seriously and should not be allowed to be devalued in other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">We have achieved a great deal; among other things, we have managed, together with all our fellow Members, to get it stipulated that checks are carried out in the destination country, which may, if necessary, require guarantees, liability insurance, or even further training.</p>
<p class="contents">The polemics of various newspapers provided for a regrettable interlude and resulted in some people being unsettled. Between first and second readings, there was division within the Council, which – and I stress that I am talking about the Council as a whole rather than about Luxembourg – showed itself somewhat hesitant. It is not true to say that three months of evening classes are enough to equip heating engineers to do the job.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, despite the polemics of certain newspapers and certainly of certain trade associations, we have the result we wanted.

Let me, then, take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur, Mr Zappalà, and the Members from the various groups – Mrs Weiler, Mr Wuermeling, and also Mr Manders from my own group. There really has been very constructive cooperation, including, in the final stage, on the part of the Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it should be stressed that this directive now enables us to achieve three essential things. The first is that we are closer to completing the internal market. Secondly, we are doing something to protect the consumer. Thirdly, we are helping to reduce bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start with the completion of the internal market. The directive on professional qualifications is a vital step towards overcoming the barriers that exist in practice to freedom of movement and the freedom to provide services on our common internal market, and, in consequence, quite crucial in terms of making the EU’s citizens more mobile. It must also be borne in mind, in connection with the freedom to provide services, that EU citizens will in future be acquiring a kind of driving licence, with which they can set off, with no fear of hindrance or discrimination, into the countries of the European Union, whether to settle down in one of them or to offer their services on a temporary basis. At the same time, everything that is subject to the special provisions of this directive is removed from the scope of the services directive, about which there has been much discussion. This leads me to hope that our agreement today will serve to objectify the debate on this important project.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may turn, secondly, to consumer protection, let me say that, whereas the services directive will govern the conditions under which service providers may operate, this directive is intended to ensure the necessary standard of professional qualifications. This is in itself a significant achievement in terms of the protection of European consumers, in that they are given a guarantee that service providers do only those things that they are recognised as qualified to do. We have therefore managed, by doing away with ‘qualification shopping’, to build in a safety mechanism to obviate the obtaining of entitlements by false pretences and this, too, is important in terms of consumer protection. I might add that I am very pleased that it has been possible to bring the professional associations on board for the comitology procedure. Their expertise will be very valuable. It will, however, also be very important to include most of the artisanal crafts and trades in Annex II, enabling their particular qualifications to be given the recognition they deserve.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point has to do with the cutting back of red tape. Over the past years, the existing rules on professional recognition became a rag rug of multifarious parallel regulations in different versions, all of which the public found complicated, baffling and, quite simply, scarcely manageable. What we see happening with this directive, the objective of which is to bring together these various pieces of legislation, is a necessary paradigm shift from a bewildering multiplicity of approaches to regulation to one single general approach, finally subjecting various professions to a single legal regime that, being anchored to certain standards of qualification, helps to promote deregulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of the proposal for a directive, scheduled for tomorrow, is therefore a crucial step towards the completion of the European internal market, and one in favour of which my group will be voting. I would like to add that I believe we should be conducting this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new directive replaces a hotch-potch of 15 old ones, thus ensuring greater transparency and legal security. This directive will make it easier for EU citizens to seize the opportunities they have to work in other European countries, something that the problematic state of the labour market in many Member States is making ever more important. Although it removes unjustified restrictions on mobility imposed by an excess of bureaucratic regulation in Member States, there is no reason to fear that there will be a rush to ‘dumb-down’ qualifications.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who settle in a Member State on a permanent basis may be required to have passed an aptitude test or to have completed further training. They register in their new country, rather than – as originally planned – in the one that they left. This directive also stipulates that the right to monitor them remains with the country in which they have settled, and establishes minimum standards applicable across Europe for professions with which certain risks are associated, such as doctors, pharmacists, midwives and architects; the level of qualification is guaranteed by five levels dependent upon the length and standard of training. It also imposes the obligation on professionals of informing clients or consumers about their qualifications.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that this directive does a good job of striking a balance between the freedom of movement and quality protection, and I hope that the planned services directive will do nothing to interfere with this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, however, this principle is not always adhered to, as can be seen from the huge number of complaints received by both Parliament’s Committee on Petitions and the SOLVIT system.</p>
<p class="contents">Many European countries have put in place various types of restrictions and deliberate obstacles that inhibit competition, hold back the development of the common market, prevent prices from falling and contribute to a reduction in the quality of labour. I am in favour of introducing the simplest and quickest possible system for recognising professional qualifications, in order to ensure that the citizens of our countries can move about as freely as possible. I am in no doubt that the compromise reached by the Council and Parliament will make it possible for this directive to be adopted, but it is a shame that Parliament appears once again to be putting the brakes on much-needed and courageous reforms proposed by the Commission. Amongst other things, I refer to Parliament’s proposals regarding the five levels of professional qualifications and the division into various professions that was mooted during the Commission’s deliberations. A system should be introduced for cases in which different rules are in force regarding the length of time it takes to gain a qualification in the country of origin and the country where the individual in question is working, so that either qualifications can be verified or any necessary and additional qualifications gained.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise that the directive on the recognition of professional qualifications dovetails with the proposal for a directive on services, and in my opinion it would be in the best interests of the European Community as a whole if these directives were to be adopted as quickly as possible. I find it regrettable that the Commission’s initial proposal to allow experts to provide services on a temporary basis without completing the necessary formalities, pursuant to the country of origin principle, did not find favour.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the report that Parliament will adopt tomorrow will be another step on the road towards simplifying the provision of labour and services in different Member States, and that it will make it easier to move from one country to another. It is my belief that this directive, along with the services directive, will bring us another step closer to the completion of the common market and to creating economic growth and new jobs throughout Europe, provided that the country of origin rules are observed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are a number of colleagues here who worked in the last Parliament; I see many familiar faces. Many colleagues have worked together on this and it is a tribute to Mr Zappalà’s persistence that we now have a very good result. I am delighted that we have managed to reach agreement without a need for conciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is sometimes easy to forget that mutual recognition of professional qualifications within the European single market has been one of the foundation stones of the whole of the internal market project. This is a much-needed reform of the whole package. It has been necessary to deal with the frustrations that have been felt by many professionals about some of the difficulties in accessing their rights under internal market legislation. It is important we deal with those issues now, as part of our overall strategy to open up the internal market for services.</p>
<p class="contents">These are part of the same proposals. There is no question, Mrs Rühle, of one frustrating another. They are all parts of a clearly integrated approach. If you look at the Danish economic study on the opening-up of the internal market for services, it identifies professional qualifications as the area with the most potential for growth.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of timing and linking these proposals together, I am really pleased that we now have this major reform, because it will be an indispensable building block of our overall approach. I am sure that by the end of this year, or early next year, we will also have agreed a substantive proposal to open up the market for services. This will allow qualified professionals to take advantage of the single market and use their skills to drive home the advantages for growth and jobs that an internal market for services must deliver. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is very important, and I am very glad of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very glad that both this House and the Council have managed – and who would have thought this possible? – by means of this legislative document, and with such overwhelming consensus, to bring to nought the Commission’s original approach, which relied on the country-of-origin principle. I have heard a lot of people today expressing approval of the way we did this, with this law making a very clear statement that it was not the country-of-origin principle that would apply, for it is un-European, but that we were working on the basis of mutual recognition and wanted to continue to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to legislate with any consistency – just as the Commission was consistent in twice proposing the country-of-origin principle – it is now time for this House to be consistent and do the same thing with the services directive too. That would be a good job of work, and we should do it. I also saw it as significant that the new Commission, this time, accepted the proposal I had put forward at first reading for the adoption of European professional identity cards. That is the right way to really drive forward mobility, the opening-up of markets, the opening-up of the borders that still, alas, exist in the European Union and to ensure that this works. I wish us every success in the vote, which is to be held tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The purpose of the directive is to remove the factors restricting the free movement of people and services between the countries of the European Union. In practice, the aim is to make it possible for people to practise their profession in a country other than the one in which their professional qualifications were obtained.</p>
<p class="contents">It is perfectly reasonable that the qualifications criteria that apply to a professional in the host country should be the same as those that apply to the nationals of that country. The professional needs to show that he or she has the adequate level of education. The host Member State, for its part, must be able to insist that the professional should have adequate language skills. Language proficiency is of particular importance in the healthcare professions, where serious health and safety problems can result if patients cannot communicate in their own language. We cannot promote the liberalisation of markets and free movement at the expense of patient safety and consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to focus attention on the quality of the education received, and not merely the length of time taken, when we are determining the levels of professional qualifications. The recognition of professional qualifications in another EU country cannot be allowed to hang on a matter of a few months if the education systems and quality of education are otherwise equivalent.</p>

In Europe, it is often easier to get an American qualification recognised than one acquired in a neighbouring country.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise we now have is well thought-out and a significant success, introducing as it does minimum standards for vocational and professional qualifications at five different levels, while, at the same time, preventing any devaluation of standards. I will repeat what has already been said by previous speakers, that it is the host country principle rather than the country-of-origin principle that has been laid down as a minimum requirement for the various professions. It is intended to be the basis for unambiguous rules intended to facilitate, if at all possible, the automatic recognition, in all Member States, of the professional qualifications of all EU citizens, whether they be employed or self-employed. What has come out of the trialogue sessions is a comprehensive and good compromise, one that we Greens, too, are happy to recommend. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every time a qualification is not recognised, it is an individual who is left facing a problem and who suffers unfair treatment. Of course, each and every one of us suffers whenever this happens, as the assistance we give the trade associations, guilds, trade unions and institutions in protecting their selfish interests makes the EU institutions less competitive. It is the people whose qualifications are not recognised who suffer most, however, and who are prevented from taking up jobs for which they are qualified.</p>
<p class="contents">As Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, I am well aware of the extent of this problem in Europe. We only see the tip of the iceberg, but it is the tip of a very large iceberg. A great many people out there have been treated unfairly, including doctors, veterinarians, nurses and even lawyers and butchers, as the interests of these professions are being protected by professional associations. The aim of the Commission directive was to remedy this state of affairs, and it did in fact largely succeed in doing so. I should like to congratulate Commissioner McCreevy on this score.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an unfortunate fact, however, that this directive has been ruined by Parliament. Although we will vote in favour of it, as it is still better than nothing, we regard it as a failure. I must add that I found the comments by Mrs Weiler, who said that the directive does not lay down European standards for recognising qualifications gained in the country of origin, quite unacceptable. I have absolutely no idea how she came up with her ideas of what is and what is not European. Ladies and gentlemen, in the interests of Europe, and in order to ensure that Europe can really compete with the United States and the Far East, we must make it possible for people and institutions to be competitive. There is an urgent need for this directive, and I find it regrettable that the version with which we have been left has so many shortcomings. I should like to thank Commissioner McCreevy for all he has done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following the Lisbon European Council of 23-24 March 2000 the Commission presented its Internal Market Strategy for Services, aimed mainly at making the free provision of services within the Community as simple as it is in the individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the key directives, closely linked to the Service Directive, is the directive on mutual recognition of professional qualifications. It was drafted by means of a complicated inter-institutional legislative procedure that the Commission launched as early as the beginning of 2002. It is encouraging to note that after sustained efforts of Member States extending over several years, this directive will finally establish a system of mutual recognition of professional qualifications that will enable the citizens of one Member State to look for employment in another Member State under the same conditions as the nationals of the host state. The directive will establish rules for the performance of all professions, except for civil service positions in Member States and the positions of public notaries, that will be as broad as possible and that will facilitate the use of one’s qualifications in a much broader space in the European labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, the Union applies uniform rules to diploma recognition of only eight professions, including medical doctors, nurses, lawyers and architects. There has been a notable omission of the profession of civil engineers, which has not been recognised with the relevant status at the European level. This directive should remedy the situation. As a result of adjustments introduced by the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, five reference levels have been established, corresponding to a certain level of education and enabling comparisons between qualification requirements of individual Member States; they are welcome by such professional associations as the Chamber of Civil Engineers and the Chamber of Architects. The procedure also should be simplified by the committee composed of the representatives of various professions that will deal with the recognition of professional qualifications.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Zappala, for his dedication and endurance in writing this report, and to congratulate him on its unanimous adoption by the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has made more progress in the last three months than in the previous three years. That is, I believe, a happy augury. The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection is now seeing the fourth successful conclusion, at second reading, of an important piece of consumer protection. I hope our fellow Members will recognise that.</p>
<p class="contents">The free movement of professionals is an important step in achieving the Lisbon Agenda. It opens up opportunities in other Member States for dentists, doctors, construction workers and gas engineers that were often closed as a result of an effective ‘closed shop’ among the professions. I am very grateful that our three German colleagues directly address the reservations in their own Member State on this issue. This is in unmistakable terms in the light of the progress we should make.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an advance to balance free movement and competition, and ensure health and safety and consumer protection at one and the same time. I commend it, and I hope the Commissioner will give it speedy effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission listened carefully to what the options were and eventually adopted a few elements, without holding onto the rigid principles on which the Commission usually insists, for which I am grateful. Mr Whitehead, our chairman, has already indicated that Mr Zappalà has been a true strategist. At times, I saw a likeness to Caesar who was equally capable of delaying battles. I was convinced that this directive would never see the light of day, but we have only worked on it for the past three years and have already finished it. I would therefore like to congratulate Mr Zappalà for the strategic approach which I had failed to see in the first three years. My apologies for this. I have nothing but congratulations and praise.</p>
<p class="contents">The definition is clear. I think that the professional card proposed in the first round by Mrs Gebhardt is an excellent addition to clarify qualifications using modern technology. What I considered crucial, and that has also been adopted by the Commission and the Council, is that a liability scheme will in any case be put in place, particularly for the medical professions, because it is unacceptable for people employed in that sector on a temporary basis to be able to escape all disciplinary provisions and liability because of the temporary nature of the job. I would therefore like to congratulate all those who have worked on what is – to my mind – a fantastic directive. It is a cornerstone of the internal market which offers young people, in particular, scope for the future and by means of which, something which I also consider to be important, particularly women are still given the chance, even if they have started a family, to cash in on their professional training on the market by finding a good job.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that mutual recognition has been mentioned, and in connection with the principle of the country of origin, I think that, if we do not stipulate any criteria, we are talking about the same definition. After all, no conditions are prescribed in this directive, because training is provided in the country of origin. Call it a licence: people with certain qualifications can work in other countries. I consider this worth a debate. It is very important to my mind that the Commission has adopted this and that there is now a duty to justify one’s actions. It is essential to obtain a legally sound Europe, but above all in order to obtain a democratically strengthened Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that with this directive today, we have demonstrated, and have given a very clear message, that we are all prepared to work on a stronger and prosperous Europe. I should also like to thank our chairmen, Mr Gargani, the previous chairman, and Mr Whitehead, for their patience in this connection, and extend special thanks also to Mr Zappalà. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Achieving a result like this in such a problematic subject area is something to which one must draw attention. Our task is to make the four freedoms a reality in the European Union; our objective, to build the internal market, making it a domestic market for all – employers, workers and consumers alike. This is a directive in the service of the Lisbon strategy, in the service of the internal market and in the service of the Constitution, and it is a directive in the service of ‘unity in diversity’.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive also testifies to the European Union’s desire that quality standards should be maintained rather than downgraded, and to our recognition of specific professional criteria. For the first time, this directive modernises the Community’s system for recognising professional qualifications. It demonstrates the respect we have for what the liberal professions do for the common good; by it, we are visibly simplifying regulations and making them more transparent rather than adopting new ones, and demonstrably promoting the free movement of skilled workers, while affirming the bodies – such as professional associations – that represent their interests, rather than simply suffocating them in European red tape.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive is also, of course, evidence that, even now, the services directive’s country-of-origin principle applies to none of the provisions of the directive on professional qualifications that apply in the destination country. This means that this directive complements the services directive. As they complement each other, I believe that the work we have done on this directive should be a good example for future work on the services directive. Let us hope that our success will be just as evident when this debate is over. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I consider this to be an important step in terms of simplification and an important step forward. You yourself, Commissioner, stressed that it is an honourable compromise in which we have struck a balance between the operation of the internal market with the highest possible level of free movement of professionals on the one hand, and quality training and respect for consumer interests on the other. I think that with this debate, we have shown that these can be reconciled. An example of this is in paragraph 3 of Article 5, where we replaced disciplinary provisions with rules of conduct. The fact that a destination Member State can continue to impose national rules in this respect is not a protectionist measure at all, but no more and no less than proof of this balance. I should like to echo the hope Mrs Gebhardt expressed, that we may follow the same path for the services directive where we also need to find this desperately needed balance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This debate has shown that it is possible to find a broad consensus on an issue that provoked a good deal of controversy at first reading. This makes me optimistic for other initiatives before this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Members raised the question of the craftsmen or <span class="italic">Meister</span>. Let me clarify that. The new directive in no way affects the national regulations on qualifications in the craft sector, nor does it entail any levelling down of national quality standards. Two existing regimes for the recognition of professional qualifications in this sector are maintained: fully qualified craftsmen can apply either for recognition of their professional experience or for recognition of their formal qualifications, where appropriate, subject to an aptitude test or a supervised traineeship. Moreover, the special structure of certain courses, amongst them the German <span class="italic">Meister</span> qualification, is fully acknowledged. I confirm that this special status can be extended to further courses through the adoption of implementing measures within the framework of the committee set up by this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to underline again that the valuable efforts made by the European Parliament and in particular by the rapporteur, Mr Zappalà, and the shadow rapporteurs have been essential for the successful outcome of this negotiation and the final adoption of this important proposal.</p>
