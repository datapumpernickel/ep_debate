I think we should try something new in Parliament today. What I envisage doing is dividing my five minutes in such a way that I am allowed to talk for four minutes to introduce the debate and for one minute to conclude it, once the Commissioner has made her speech. I propose this in the light of two factors. First of all, I understand that the Conference of Presidents had an ‘away day’ last week, when they decided to have more lively debates here in the House. The second factor is Rule 121, paragraph 4 of the Rules of Procedure. I asked the Sittings Directorate, before I came here today, if what I propose was possible. I was told flatly it was not, but I want to ask permission to do what I propose, given that there is nothing in the Rules of Procedure to prevent such a procedure. I therefore assume that you will be sympathetic towards organising matters in this way today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am now, then, embarking upon my speaking time.</p>
<p class="contents">Noise is a major problem in European workplaces, and I believe it is important to emphasise that this directive is good for workers and that it does not affect anyone else. As has been discussed, there are many misunderstandings as to who is affected by this directive. We know that noise can have incredibly harmful effects. The possible effects of noise are very well documented. We are talking about tinnitus and permanent loss of hearing. I believe that combating noise in the workplace is the best thing we can do to prevent injury at work and to prevent employees being permanently excluded from the labour market. It has therefore surprised me a great deal during the debate on this issue in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that, for example, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, which normally attaches incredible importance to doing something for handicapped people in the EU, has not shown greater interest in efforts to prevent people from being handicapped by damage to their hearing, for that is at all events the best strategy of all. We also know that the existing noise directive from 1996 is out of date and does not provide employees with sufficient protection. The common position with which we are now being presented is far better, for an actual limit value is being introduced for the first time. It is an important step that such a common minimum level should be established for the whole of the EU. The amendments adopted by the committee improve the common position on a range of points, and I am pleased about the support which many have said they will give. The biggest improvement can be achieved if we set great store by the preventive strategy, and I believe that that is a right and proper principle.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn now to the music and entertainment industry. This is a much discussed subject in connection with which the Group of the Party of European Socialists has entered into a compromise, by which we stand, with the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats. I must not, however, disguise the fact that this is an impairment of the common position, and it is interesting that we now see a European Parliament that attaches less importance to protecting employees than the Council of Ministers does. This is a new development, and I would ask the public to note the fact. We support the compromise proposal because it has been important to us to avoid having the common position rejected in the European Parliament. And, as we heard, there was a real risk of that happening. That would have been clearly unacceptable for, then, employees would only have been protected at the 1996 level. We have therefore accepted the compromise, and that of course also shows that we have been incredibly sympathetic to what the music and entertainment industry has told us in connection with this matter. I would also say to my fellow MEPs in the House that we have perhaps sometimes been too sympathetic. By that, I mean in fact that some MEPs have not been critical enough of what the industry has said. Rumours of the worst kind have circulated about this matter. I have been accused of wanting to close down the whole of the pop industry in Great Britain and of wanting to prohibit the bagpipes in Scotland. It is all complete and utter nonsense, of course. Naturally, we must listen to what society around us says, but that does not mean we simply have to roll over. We have a compromise proposal I can live with. I am in actual fact extremely satisfied with it. It will mean that the entertainment industry will only be covered by the directive after five years and, in the intervening period, we shall call upon the Commission to carry out an investigation of how the directive will affect the music and entertainment industry. The Commission will subsequently assess whether it is necessary to exempt the industry from the directive or to regulate it in some other way. I believe this compromise proposal will make it clear how much exaggeration there has been in this matter and also make it clear that even people in the music industry are very seriously affected by the damage to their hearing that we are in actual fact trying to combat.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to emphasise that I should like to have seen us achieve more in terms of improving workers’ protection. That has not been possible, but what is now crucial is that, tomorrow, MEPs support those proposals which in actual fact improve the common position and ensure that we attach more importance to the preventive side. I urge all my fellow MEPs to support the proposals now tabled by the committee, together with the compromise proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The harmful negative effects of noise exposure are scientifically documented and we do not need to discuss them in detail here. Noise-induced deafness is one of the most common occupational illnesses. Measures to protect workers from noise thus have a high priority. Everyone involved – workers, employers and legislators – should therefore seize every opportunity to keep noise pollution in the workplace as low as possible. With regard to reducing the noise levels which people voluntarily submit to during their leisure time, however, there is little we can do, other than appeal to the individual to exercise common sense.</p>
<p class="contents">In agreeing protective measures for the workplace, however, we must also take account of the scope for their practical implementation – and especially the impact on small and medium-sized businesses. There is little point in adopting highly complex rules at European level if they cannot or will not be complied with in practice. In striking a balance, I believe that the amendments proposed by this House generally offer acceptable solutions. I would also like to thank the rapporteur particularly for her willingness to compromise, which was already evident in the committee. This defused a potential conflict over a significant change to exposure limit values and action limit values, without sacrificing the justified interests of employees.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the assessment of the noise exposure level, too, the provisions of the Council's common position on individual hearing protection should be maintained. We also endorse Amendment No 8, which states that Member States may lay down values which are lower than the exposure limit values and the action limit values laid down in this directive where this is necessary with regard to the health and safety of workers. This is entirely in line with the principle of minimum standards in European social policy. We also make it clear that the employer is responsible for enforcing the wearing of hearing protectors<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>and the provision of individual training. As ‘prevention is better than cure’, a worker whose noise exposure exceeds the <span class="italic">lower</span><span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>exposure action values<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>will also be entitled to appropriate audiometric testing.<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>The use of a weekly noise exposure level in place of the daily noise exposure level under certain conditions is sensible, as envisaged in the Council's common position.</p>
<p class="contents">The aspect of this directive which triggered the most heated debate concerned the treatment of workers who are exposed to music, from classical/orchestral music to disco. In my view, we take adequate account of this special area in the compromise proposed in Amendment 23. I hope this is a solution which the Council can also endorse, for an immediate and unconditional inclusion of these events will hardly do justice to the general belief that music – whether in the concert hall or the night-club – is noise and should therefore be treated restrictively from the outset.</p>

She has produced a very well-balanced report. It proposes sensible amendments which will not impose unreasonable burdens on firms, but which will improve the directive and reduce the risk of hearing loss resulting from exposure to noise at work.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what this proposal is all about. Too many workers within the European Union continue to be at risk of hearing loss due to exposure to noise at work. Mrs Thorning-Schmidt has shown herself to be reasonable and willing to listen to reasonable and reasoned argument and evidence. She did, after all, withdraw many of her initial amendments, tabling new ones which move closer to, or back to, the common position on a number of elements including key action and exposure limit values.</p>
<p class="contents">But others in this House are straining to carve a new and retrograde path in the social field. For the first time in conciliation in the social field we are seeing moves, particularly on the right and centre groupings of the House, to weaken significantly common positions established in the Social Affairs Council, and even, at times, to exclude significant sectors of activity from the legislation altogether.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen this in relation to this proposal on noise and the parallel proposal on vibration. Compromise Amendment No 23 on the music and entertainment sectors is a response to such a danger. Do not get me wrong: it might conceivably be necessary to weaken the common position when new information or evidence previously overlooked comes to light, but in my view that has not been the case in the examples I mention. We have instead seen something tantamount to a panic response to concentrated, manipulative lobbying and adverse media coverage fed by deliberate disinformation and misinformation. These developments are to be deplored.</p>
<p class="contents">At least two factors seem to be at work. Firstly, lobby groups have woken up to the pressure points in the codecision procedure. They know how to apply political pressure, much of it far from evidence-based, on Parliament. They think we are the weakest link, and the signal we are sending them is that they are absolutely correct.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, too many Members of this House delight in issuing press releases seeking to trivialise legislation that is entirely necessary, justified and proportionate. They will not let facts get in the way of seeing their own name in print and it is not hard to see why so many ill-informed articles have appeared concerning this proposal. They have been fed by grossly misleading or totally factually incorrect press releases and briefings from Members of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we can all grow up quickly and bring a little more dignity and integrity to our role as co-legislator. My own father finds it difficult to converse with my infant son because of industrially-induced hearing loss. That seems to me a very good reason to promote sensible legislation like this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yes, by all means protect workers, but do not throw workers out of work! It was essential that hearing protection should be taken into account, and I congratulate those industries and everybody else who convinced the rapporteur of the need to do so. If this had not been the case, with the exposure limit set at 87, hammering steel at 95-100 decibels, bottling at 98 decibels, and pig-feeding at 100 decibels would have ceased to exist, as would the construction and mining industries. Cement works and part of the engineering industry would have been decimated.</p>
<p class="contents">I recognise that the rapporteur has moved and I welcome that. I welcome the fact that she has moved from daily measuring to weekly measuring in exceptional circumstances, but I would like her to move further to weekly measurements, to go back to the main body of the text as in the common position. I am very pleased that we have got the compromise amendment on music and leisure, whatever the rapporteur says: to have five years' exemption for the music and leisure industry, for the Commission to do a report, and then to come back to this House, but to consult with both sides of industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope it goes through and I hope all MEPs will vote for it. Otherwise, we will have the ridiculous prospect of bar staff wearing ear-muffs when people go in to order a pint of beer. I am also glad that we have a chance to debate this because if it had been rejected on a second reading in committee, we would have had no chance to debate this today in the plenary session – no chance to put forward the amendment to exclude music and leisure for five years, and Parliament's view would not have been taken into account. So I say to those people who voted against the report in committee: if you had got your way, there is no way we would be standing here today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are simply carrying out our task as parliamentarians and we listen to everyone, including people who are not directly involved in the process that leads to directives. In my view, this Parliament is not indifferent to the cause of health and safety, nor to objections concerning the implementation thereof. I am therefore delighted that we can conclude the second reading of the noise directive – forgive me for not using the correct title of the directive – this week.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Dutch official dictionary, noise is defined as a harsh, unpleasant sound, including background noise, din, racket, roar and commotion. In other words, it is a noise which any right-minded person will experience as disagreeable and which we can do without. I am therefore astounded, even dismayed – and many a composer will be turning in their graves – that Beethoven is being likened to a drill. According to the Council, the Commission and a number of fellow MEPs, being subjected to the noise of a hefty circular saw is actually worse than Tchaikovsky. I do understand that this is not merely about whether the noise is irritating, but also whether it is harmful. What I should like to point out is that different types of noise justify a differentiated approach. I am of the opinion that the music and entertainment industry should fall outside the scope of this directive and be regulated in a separate directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The fundamental difference between noise and Vivaldi is as follows: in the music and entertainment industry, sound is the ultimate product, or at least an important component thereof. Sound plays a central role in this industry. Noise in a factory is a negative side-effect, which makes no difference to the end result of the activity – quite the reverse, in fact – if it is not there. Music involves customers; it involves activities of great cultural value, especially for young people. We would not prevent professional footballers from playing in excess of 45 minutes per week, would we? That is the difference; that is what matters; we found a response to it other than levelling unjustified criticism at this side of the House, as though we have no care for musical technique. We have, but we also care about the people concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have the impression that this has often been forgotten, especially in the context of this public debate. The ignorance of the press – sometimes the quality press – also confirms this view. In addition to the usual objections from industry, massive lobbying was, of course, carried out by the music industry as well – not the dark forces, but quite specifically the music industry. This outcry raises three interesting points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly: The general public's lack of awareness that since 1986, employees in the music industry have been covered by a directive which is still in force. All employees are covered, except for seamen. This is now being rectified.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: It reveals the lack of monitoring in the Member States, for if better monitoring had been carried out, the groups affected – employers and employees – would not be in such a state of shock today.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: It also shows, of course – and I say this critically – the very poor representation of employees' interests. I would like to send the Commission a copy of a letter which I received from the Swiss Musicians Federation about a hearing in 1996, which shows very clearly, Mr Pronk, that damage to hearing is always to be taken seriously, regardless of whether someone works in the construction industry, ceramics, or a music company or orchestra.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interjection: Or even in Parliament!)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Or even in Parliament, but fortunately, most of our colleagues are not as noisy as that!</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there are rules at national level. As a left-wing traditionalist, too, I believe that the state and the employer have a duty to protect workers from workplace hazards. This is precisely our task, and in my view, with this directive, we have achieved this goal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I take little comfort from this. I hope the rapporteur will not take this personally, as I know how much thought and work she has put into the report. However, in my view, the amendments that remain are neither necessary nor helpful. This is not just my own view. I am delighted to see the extent to which Mrs Lynne echoed this view so powerfully a few moments ago.</p>
<p class="contents">In the words of the UK Health and Safety Executive, the body set up to give the UK Government the expert and impartial scientific advice so necessary when dealing with such issues, these amendments provide "no benefit for health and safety and their sole effect will be to place unnecessary and unwelcome burdens on industry, particularly on small firms". The Executive advises us to oppose most of the Socialist amendments. Independently, UK Conservative MEPs had come to the identical conclusion. One of these is Amendment No 18, which I see the trade unions are supporting, while curiously claiming that many employers support it, too. I have not come across a single employer who supports this. It will be interesting to see whether UK Labour MEPs vote as their government has advised or their trade unions have instructed. I suspect the answer will be no surprise.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall be supporting the amendment to exempt music from the directive, an amendment originally conceived by my colleague Mr Pronk. However, that still leaves us with the problems facing industry if other amendments also pass. It is very telling that in the week EU leaders are in Barcelona, calling for EU businesses to become more competitive, and on the very day that the UK Prime Minister, Mr Blair, is spinning the line that he is so much against red tape, his Socialist MEPs continue to pursue the same old agenda, regardless of the impact on jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge them, even at this late stage, to vote against these amendments, to vote for jobs, to vote for reform and to vote for Barcelona. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Having said this, I will express my views on certain points of the report which, in my humble opinion, could have been dealt with differently, and on amendments and proposals which are difficult to accept, above all by professionals in the field of prevention; of course on the basis of the view that there is no such thing as zero risk and that work is an unpleasant activity.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur that combating noise in the workplace is the best thing we can do, but I do not agree that collective protection measures should always have priority over individual protection measures. In any event, I believe that they are complementary or supplementary, or that individual measures should be applied rather than collective ones. We must consider the distribution of responsibilities; it clearly falls to the employer to provide the means, and it is they who have the disciplinary policy measures to ensure they are complied with, but the worker is no less responsible, and cannot ignore their responsibility, since they are the first to be affected if they do not adopt individual and personal protection measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I also disagree with you somewhat with regard to the scope, since I believe that, rather than talking about including the self-employed within the scope, it would be preferable to include them by means of the concept of workplaces and the person responsible for them, particularly in view of the increasingly frequent externalisation of many activities in numerous work sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 15 deals with an issue which is perhaps purely grammatical. Where it speaks of hearing protection measures ‘likely to be used’, I believe we should say ‘of mandatory use’. Furthermore, there are activities involving a different intensity of sound at different times, which must be considered and resolved. I liked what the rapporteur said about music.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this, Mr President, Mrs Thorning-Schmidt, must be done from the point of view of providing quality employment with less risk to the health and safety of workers, and this objective demands legislation which is clear in its principles and in its wording. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Just how difficult this issue is can be seen from the fact that the amended proposal has been pending before the Council since 1994 and the first part of the proposal on mechanical vibration is only now ready for discussion by the joint legislators. We put health and safety at the top of the social agenda and we have undertaken to improve protection for workers' health and safety by bringing the directive which already exists – 86/188 – into line with Framework Directive 89/391 and updating some of its provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out that some of the proposals we have heard take us behind the current framework and the specific directive which already exists. Loss of hearing is clearly the most widely-known harmful effect of noise. It is the most serious, but not the only effect. And as far as compensation for workers who have suffered the consequences of occupational illnesses are concerned, one-third concerns hearing problems.</p>
<p class="contents">In five countries in which studies have been carried out – Holland, Portugal, Spain, France and Germany – compensation for hearing problems costs EUR 96 billion a year. The Commission has accepted the Council's common position in that it enhances the level of protection set out in the Commission proposal. The reduction in the exposure limit value from 96 db to 87 db is clearly good progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission fully accepts Amendments Nos 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 17, 18, 20 and 22, which improve the quality of the text and clarify its meaning. The Commission partly accepts Amendments Nos 4, 15, 16 and 19 and rejects Amendments Nos 3, 5, 13 and 21, together with Amendments Nos 23 and 25. Although I agree with the idea behind Amendment No 3, the second part of Amendment No 4, Amendment No 5, Amendment No 13 and the second part of Amendment No 16, the Commission cannot accept them for reasons of consistency and legislative procedure. The Commission also rejects Amendment No 21, because it feels that the manner in which the Member States obtain access to the relevant medical and scientific advice is a question of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally on the question of compromise Amendments Nos 23 and 25, which temporarily exclude music and entertainment from the scope of the proposal, the Commission is strongly opposed to this derogation because there is no scientific justification for it. Applying health and safety measures to the music market will affect 3 to 5 million workers in Europe. Factory noise has been compared with the noise from music or concerts. I think the figures speak for themselves. Musicians constantly performing in concert are continually exposed to noise levels as high as 130 db. Constant exposure to this noise gradually gives them problems with their hearing, without which they cannot do their job. I should also like to remind the House that HINDREC, the European Association of Industry, Hotels and Restaurants, agrees with the proposal currently on the table. And there is another statistic I should like to give you: the noise level in small pubs is in the order of 75 db, that is, well below the limit value of 90 already set.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally to ear protection available on the market. If you surf the Internet you will see all these new aids, which are very different from standard ear muffs. Basically what they do is to reduce the sound to which each worker is exposed to a level set by the worker, so that they can do their job without suffering this gradual deterioration in their hearing.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to remind the House that there are another two physical agents in the workplace, optical radiation and electromagnetic fields, and that we need to start work on the next two directives, which are also very important and affect large numbers of workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, I should like to tell the Commission that I am pleased about the amendments that are being supported. I am rather annoyed that the Commission has not thought along the same lines as the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs regarding Amendments Nos 3 and 5, because they specifically emphasise the efforts at prevention I tried to emphasise in my speech. I therefore hope that the Commission will reconsider them. I would also ask the Commission to give us a little help today in responding to something said by Mr Bushill-Matthews and Mr Pronk. Could the Commission first of all explain to these gentlemen that there is also something called sustainable development within employment and that, when we talk about wanting a proper working environment and proper health and safety regulations, what in actual fact we want is a sustainable labour market from which people are not excluded? Mr Bushill-Matthews must also agree with me that, in the long term, what is economically most sustainable is not to have a whole lot of people sitting on the ‘reserve bench’. And, talking about a ‘reserve bench’, I also wish to address Mr Pronk and ask the Commission to help me a little. Could the Commission explain to Mr Pronk once and for all that people who play football or go to football matches will not be affected by this directive? And perhaps we could also, once and for all, have the lobbyists locked out of this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
