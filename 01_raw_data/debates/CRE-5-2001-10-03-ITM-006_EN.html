<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> As far back as the introduction of the single currency, it was decided to bring about reinforced, economic coordination among the then eleven, and now twelve, Member States belonging to the eurozone. This coordination materialised via the Eurogroup which Belgium is chairing throughout this year and in which finance ministers of the Member States which have adopted the euro are represented, together with the European Commissioner responsible for economic and monetary matters, as well as the President of the European Central Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, this reinforced coordination has an informal and structural dimension and does not prejudice the responsibilities assigned to the ECOFIN Council by the Treaties. For the first few years when the single currency came into being – and I am talking about 1999 and 2000 – the bulk of the activities were aimed at the development of, and familiarisation with, this reinforced economic coordination among the Member States taking part in the eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">Pursuant to, and with due respect to, the subsidiarity principle, this coordination faces the most important challenge of marrying the practice of economic authorities of each individual Member State involved, with the common monetary project to which these Member States have subscribed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the task of the European Central Bank to adopt an independent monetary policy, the key objective of which is to maintain price stability.</p>
<p class="contents">The decentralisation of the economic policy and the centralisation of monetary decisions are, as it were, a basic contradiction in terms within the Economic and Monetary Union. The Eurogroup’s first task in this reinforced, economic coordination, is to outline the mainstays of the eurozone’s economic policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the message which was formulated in Nice last year by the Heads of State and Government is very much along the same lines. In its conclusions, the European Council is delighted at both the improved operation of the Eurogroup and the reinforced coordination of the economic policy of the Member States in the eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">All efforts by the Belgian Presidency of the Eurogroup are channelled into reinforcing the role, the visibility and the credibility of the Eurogroup.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Belgian Presidency is also drafting a reference framework and the working method for the coming years, especially in connection with the coordination of the economic policy of the different Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The key instruments of a macro-economic policy, especially the monetary and budgetary policy, must be combined in an optimal policy mix, as it were, to achieve the pre-supposed objectives, such as promoting price stability and bolstering economic activity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the interests of the Eurogroup it is important firstly to develop an effective and lasting budgetary policy for the entire area, and also specifically for each of the Member States. This must be done in line with national constraints and special considerations. This budgetary policy must dovetail with the monetary policy of the European Central Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it will not be easy to finalise the details of this type of budgetary policy for several reasons. Firstly, the results of any budgetary policy depend on the time scales established. For example, in the short term, pro-cyclical budgetary policies should not be used. In the medium term, the objectives of the Growth and Stability Pact to establish a balance or surplus of public finances should be maintained. In the long term, it will be essential to ensure the viability of public finances. This should take account of the different elements involved, including the difficult and important problem of the ageing of populations.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, what I have just said clearly demonstrates the extent of the challenges before us. Do I really have to highlight just how difficulties with planning and methods, and the inevitable economic uncertainty, make it very difficult and complicated to define and implement budgetary policies? We are confronted by statistical problems, the uncertainty surrounding economic forecasts, even in the short term, and the diversity of the many situations. There is also the fact that the effects of budgetary policies are only felt after a certain period of time. All this makes it difficult to determine a budgetary policy <span class="italic">ex ante</span>. The long-term analysis of budgetary policy is also an essential part of structural policies. The strategy combines a number of approaches as regards the ageing of our populations. The strategy aims to step up the reduction of public debt. It also promotes the adoption of measures to increase employment levels. This involves the gradual elimination of obstacles to employment, particularly by reducing the fiscal burden on employment. Lastly, the strategy provides for the in-depth reform of pensions systems, in order to ensure their viability.</p>
<p class="contents">The Belgian Presidency is seeking to examine public finances in greater depth on an ongoing and long-term basis. Particular attention will be paid to examining public finances in relation to the stability and convergence programme. Member States and the other interested parties agree on the long-term objectives and the instruments to be used. However, as regards the short and medium term, recent economic deterioration has created some confusion. Clearly, we need to hold an in-depth debate on this matter in order to define and establish a strong common position. We must hold such a debate during our presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we must keep to the terms of the Growth and Stability Pact. Member States stated this commitment during the informal meeting of ECOFIN at Liège on 21 and 22 September. Therefore, there can be no question of Member States being faced with deficits in excess of the convergence criteria of 3%. The Extraordinary European Council of 21 September also reaffirmed its commitment to the framework, regulations and full implementation of the Growth and Stability Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">However, budgetary balances do not necessarily have to be set in stone. Instead of a purely nominal approach, there should be the ability to make adjustments in relation to changes in economic circumstances. The broad guidelines of economic policy for 2001, adopted at Gothenburg last June, are very clear on this point. The principle is accepted without discussion in a favourable economic climate. Hence, better than expected economic growth inevitably leads to a greater improvement in nominal budgetary figures. For this reason also, a pro-cyclical budgetary policy, together with a decrease in spending which could lead to overheating, is not permitted.</p>
<p class="contents">The question that now arises is to establish whether this allowance for cyclical variation can be implemented in a similar way in periods of poor growth or recession. The Belgian Presidency is convinced that this is indeed possible. The broad guidelines of economic policy for 2001 confirm our belief.</p>
<p class="contents">In a less favourable economic climate, the balances already taken into consideration within the framework of the Pact, should also be adjusted in line with changed economic circumstances. Nominal balances can therefore be affected by worsening economic conditions. However, they can only fluctuate according to those same economic conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances, a pro-cyclical policy should not be used. Consequently, a decrease in revenue should not be then compensated for by an equivalent reduction in spending. Cyclical adjustments must be reliable in order to assess the budgetary positions correctly. The agenda of the Belgian Presidency therefore allows some time for us to refine effective methods to calculate the disparity between production and potential growth. These methods should be used in future stability programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, all these issues will doubtless lead to some long but interesting discussions at the next meeting of the euro area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall also endeavour to analyse two issues confronting us, namely the Growth and Stability Pact and the informal ECOFIN Council and shall attempt to report on both during my first speech.</p>
<p class="contents">The Liege Council on 22 and 23 September 2001 focused on the economic impact of the terrorist attacks on the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to refer to three aspects of this impact discussed at ECOFIN. Firstly, the economic situation. The opportunity was also taken to discuss the Growth and Stability Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the financing of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the problems airlines are experiencing with regard to insurance.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall also comment on two other important matters raised at Liege, namely preparations for transition to the euro and issues related to globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the first point, I should emphasise that the attacks on the United States have strengthened our conviction that international cooperation on financial and political issues is essential. Further, coordination of economic policies within the European Union must be strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">As from last year, the slowdown of economic activity in the United States and the rest of the world has been having a greater impact on the European Union than was originally anticipated. The tragic events in the United States have increased uncertainty and the negative risks for anticipated general growth. We cannot act as if nothing had happened, but at the same time it is very difficult to produce an accurate estimate of the potential impact of those acts.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the European Union, growth will be well below 2% this year. We are however still hoping for a gradual recovery of internal demand in the coming quarters. There are a number of reasons for this: lower inflation, recent tax reductions and more favourable monetary conditions. The risks should therefore be manageable. We must, of course, monitor economic changes very closely so as to adjust economic policies as necessary, both in the Union and in each of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the events on 11 September, political leaders showed their determination to act swiftly and appropriately to eliminate the risks of a lengthier slowdown. To this end, we must also maintain our medium-term objectives, and move through our agenda more swiftly. I have in mind in particular the Lisbon agenda. We need to modernise our economies quickly so we can reverse the slowdown as soon as possible and increase our capacity for growth.</p>
<p class="contents">As I stated earlier, the declaration following the informal ECOFIN confirmed the commitment of Member States to the framework, rules and implementation of the Growth and Stability Pact. As the presidency has pointed out, slower growth will affect the nominal value of budgetary positions. Departure from the objectives ought, however, to be limited.</p>
<p class="contents">The Growth and Stability Pact is a suitable framework for budgetary policy in times when the economy is developing well and in less good times. It makes it possible to implement the most appropriate budgetary policy for each set of circumstances. It is possible to resort to all the possibilities provided in the pact. The automatic stabilisers will be more effective if the slowdown is greater than anticipated. The manner and extent to which these stabilisers operate will depend on the situation of each Member State. Those states closer to balancing their budget will obviously have more room for manoeuvre.</p>
<p class="contents">Current budgetary situations result from compliance with existing budgetary rules, and have enabled the European Central Bank to adopt a flexible monetary policy. In particular, they have made it possible for the Bank to take the right decision quickly and reduce interest rates by fifty basic points on 17 September. An increase in deficits over and above what can be justified by the operation of the stabilisers would reduce the options open to the Central Bank as regards possible future cuts in rates of interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council requested the Commission to submit a study of the likely evolution of the economic situation together with the recommendations it envisages to the forthcoming European Council at Ghent. The report will have to be viewed as an ongoing systematic exercise allowing for adjustment of the assessment of the evolution of risks and the possible consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment concerns action to combat the financing of terrorism. The ECOFIN statement gives prominence to a number of specific actions. Firstly, the matter of the review of the directive on money laundering. This is currently under negotiation, as you are aware. I should like to emphasise once again, on behalf of the Commission and in line with the ECOFIN statement at Liege, that we attach great political significance to the swift conclusion of this process. It will send out a clear signal of the Union’s commitment to stamping out criminal activity supported by money laundering.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to highlight the Commission’s approval of the draft regulation on specific measures to freeze the assets of individuals or entities involved in the financing of terrorist activities. We hope the Council and Parliament will deal with this as a matter of urgency so that it can be implemented immediately. It gives a clear indication of our political determination to grant no respite to those who attack political coexistence and the freedoms of all citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The ECOFIN Council also agreed general guidelines on government intervention concerning the insurance problems facing airline companies. The ECOFIN statement invites the Commission to broaden the remit of the <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> group set up in the framework of the Transport Council to include insurance problems. The statement also specifies that the Commission must be notified of any measure taken by governments, including financial amounts. This will enable the Commission to discharge its responsibility of ensuring that such measures are compatible with Community legislation and to ensure consistency between the responses by the various Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is drafting a report on the impact of the attacks on 11 September on the air transport industry.</p>
<p class="contents">There was also an opportunity at the informal ECOFIN to pursue the discussion on preparations for the introduction of the euro. Such discussions have been held at regular intervals. The Commission is drafting a report on the subject for the forthcoming European Council at Ghent on 19 October.</p>
<p class="contents">At Liege I appealed to the Member States to pay particular attention to three aspects which seem to me crucial at this juncture. Firstly, the problem of supplying small traders in advance. They need to be informed and convinced of the commercial advantages of advance supply. It is also important however to find ways of helping them to work with the banks. The latter should offer fair debit conditions for the amounts in euro received by small traders before 31 December 2001. In addition, it is essential to provide specific training for small traders and for all those working on the tills in any kind of business.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue causing us concern is monitoring of the prices of goods and services over the period of the changeover to the euro. We cannot go through the process of calculating the harmonised consumer price index every week, nor would it make sense to do so. Nonetheless, we can however provide the citizens with information on the evolution of certain key prices in a transparent manner. As this exercise is to be undertaken by government agencies, transparency and objectivity will be guaranteed, and the sample chosen will be appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">The informal ECOFIN also agreed with the Commission’s proposal to establish a common European network to organise exchange of information during the period when notes and coins are to be introduced. This network will start to operate at the beginning of December in close cooperation with the European Central Bank’s Cash Changeover Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The last issue I would like to deal with is the debate on globalisation. The Commission has followed the public debate on globalisation closely, including the debate on the so-called Tobin levy or tax. We have taken note of ECOFINs interest in receiving a report on these issues. This debate focuses on two clearly relevant objectives on which we share the concerns expressed by many of the participants in the debate on globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, to avoid excessive fluctuation in the rates of interest which could prevent the hoped-for economic development of developing countries. Secondly, to find sources of additional finance to combat poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no single instrument allowing us to attain both these objectives at once. The Union and other countries, international institutions and other groups have developed a range of instruments and policies in an attempt to work towards these objectives. More and better action could of course be taken, and the Commission is prepared to explore new possibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">As originally defined, Professor Tobin’s idea of imposing a tax on foreign currency transactions was intended to put a damper on international monetary markets. It was put forward as a second best solution to put the brakes on short-term speculative movements.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already made its point of view clear on a number of occasions. A tax on monetary transactions is not an effective way of dealing with the problems arising from excessive volatility of financial flows or with inequalities between countries. A wide range of instruments should be drawn upon. The Tobin levy or tax is not the magic wand allowing us to deal with all the challenges which have arisen.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to consider a wide range of instruments in our efforts to attain financial and monetary stability. A global approach to the financial edifice is called for, both at internal European Union level and at international level. This should include regulatory frameworks, institutions and the problem of money laundering.</p>
<p class="contents">A wide-ranging approach to the financing of development is also required. Different instruments can be used to deal with poverty, debt reduction, the supply of international public goods and the protection of the environment. The Commission is prepared to make an active contribution to the debate on the instruments to ensure coherence between globalisation, sustainable development and world governance. I am sure we can also count on support from Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">These issues are of course beyond the Union’s strict sphere of competence. We should tackle them together with other countries and institutions. The Commission is ready to respond to the Council’s invitation to continue working on how best to respond to the key objectives I referred to. In any case, part of this work is already under way within the Commission. We are currently preparing a report on the external dimension of sustainable development. This is due next January and is aimed at the Río+10 conference to be held in Johannesburg next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, these are the key issues I wanted to share with you.</p>

The reason given was that we were disturbed by certain utterances we have heard emanating from the ranks of socialist governments in the past weeks and months. The statements made by Mr Eichel, Mr Jospin, Mr Fabius, and other things that were said, all went along the same lines. For a start, they asserted that it was necessary in the present situation to soften the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact. That was the first demand. The second was that the Heads of State and of Government must be accorded the right to prescribe annual stability objectives to the European Central Bank. We take the view that both these proposals are extraordinarily dangerous, for the Stability and Growth Pact and the independence of the European Central Bank are the twin pillars on which rests the European Union's monetary system. These pillars must not be shaken. My group will always speak up in favour of maintaining the independent European Central Bank and the Stability and Growth Pact in their present forms.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us turn now to the resolutions on the table before us. Jointly with the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party, we have submitted a motion for a resolution. We negotiated with the Group of the Party of European Socialists, which stated that it was unable to agree to our resolution. What, though, is so bad about our resolution? It states that the Stability and Growth Pact should, in quite simple words, be 'retained'. Why can they not agree to that? Then they said: We want to put its principles fully into practice. Why not just agree to it then? We need measures against money laundering. You spoke about that, Commissioner. We need measures to destroy the financial background for terrorist acts. Why not agree to that? We must also be consistent in reducing monopolies in order to strengthen the competitiveness of our European economy. Why can they not agree to that?</p>
<p class="contents">Now for the second question: what counter-proposal does the other side have to offer? They put forward essentially the same ones over and over again: that the European Central Bank should cut interest rates. Or, on the other hand, that the Stability and Growth Pact, or the Member States' budget policies, should be relaxed. That is the Socialist policy mix. That is the potion concocted by druids to cure all the ills of our economy at a stroke and without effort. It would be nice if things worked like that, my dear Christa! But in reality they do not. Take a look at Japan, where this policy was applied and where it does not work. Consider the stock exchanges in the United States today, where it can be seen that it does not work. Look at economic history, where we see from the past that it has never yet worked. So I would like to urge you to reject these demands and support our resolution.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Goebbels (PSE). </span></span>  – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the light of the grave global situation, I have no desire to enter into a puerile argument with my fellow Member, Mr von Wogau. Mr von Wogau has just accused the Socialist Group of having the worst of intentions. This is certainly not the policy we are defending here.</p>
<p class="contents">We must bear in mind that the attacks of 11 September have not only caused great human suffering. They may also have far-reaching consequences for civil liberties and for the global economy. Before 11 September, the United States was clearly already experiencing a slowdown and Japan was already in a bad way. However, before 11 September a slowdown was already evident in Europe. It had proved necessary to revise some forecasts downwards. Furthermore, it is clear that the situation in Europe and worldwide will be worse during the third quarter than it was during the second quarter.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need to do now is prevent a recession. As we are all aware, a recession is defined as negative growth for two consecutive six-month periods. According to Mr von Wogau, we must now wait six months to see if we are really in a recession. However, I believe that we must respond by pursuing a pragmatic policy. I think that Europe owes it to herself to respond to this threat of a recessionary spiral with a proactive economic policy. This should be achieved within the European Union by improving the coordination of economic policies. The Council representative said just this to the House. The European Union should also increase political cooperation with all its economic partners, including developing countries. We would like to establish a pragmatic policy like that of the United States, although, as far as I know, the United States does not have a Socialist government…</p>
<p class="contents">We should of course take account of the Growth and Stability Pact. We should not encourage Member States to exceed budgetary deficit limits, especially the 3% threshold. Nevertheless, as the Council representative has said, we must assess the long-term viability of public finances. The Growth and Stability Pact states that public finances should be balanced, or almost balanced. We must also respond in the short term. Economic stabilisers can have a role to play. We are experiencing the consequences of a negative external event. The Growth and Stability Pact allows for us to respond to negative external events. I do not wish to engage in ideological debate. Mr von Wogau’s interpretation of the Growth and Stability Pact is merely theological. We are not calling for state aid. Nor are we calling for quick-fix solutions. We are calling for selective measures to support sectors badly affected by the current economic situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, lastly, I would like to stress that we are not facing a war between different civilisations. Terrorism does not represent any civilisation. Terrorism negates everything that is human. We need a coalition against terrorism, but we also need a coalition against poverty. The World Bank has recently published information on the consequences of the attacks on New York for developing countries. We must not only deplore the loss of thousands of lives in New York and Washington. We must also lament the fact that there are tens of thousands of other victims amongst the children of the poorest countries in the world. These are the people we must respond to.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Huhne (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, on behalf of the Liberal Group, I wish to say that we believe the Stability and Growth Pact is an essential pillar of economic stability in the euro area and in the Union more widely, and should be respected in letter and spirit. We do not recognise the view, apparently emanating from the Socialist Group, that the SGP currently incorporates unnecessarily restrictive fiscal rules.</p>
<p class="contents">For the 11 countries whose budgets are in a sustainable position – those which, in other words, can face a normal recession with a fall in tax revenue and continue to respect the 3% limit on budget deficits – there is no need to raise taxes or cut public spending and the automatic stabilisers can and should be allowed to play. Moreover, for many of these countries, this is the first slowdown since the first oil shock in 1973 in which the automatic stabilisers have been able to work fully. Previously, financial market worries have been a serious constraint on governments. So monetary union, the Stability and Growth Pact and fiscal consolidation have given back to Member States a useful policy lever which has been out of the policy box for too long.</p>
<p class="contents">For the four euro-area Member States whose budgets are not yet fully compatible with the Stability and Growth Pact – France, Germany, Italy and Portugal – it is wholly reasonable that they should continue the process of putting their underlying budget positions right. This means allowing some effects of the slowdown on the deficit, but certainly not all.</p>
<p class="contents">In our joint motion with the PPE-DE Group we urge the proper respect of the SGP. We point out that it would be particularly useful in a year like this one – in which many stability programmes were drafted in expectation of 3% growth, but the out-turn is likely to be less than 2%, as the Commission has said – if there were a commonly agreed measure between the ECB, Ecofin and the Commission of the underlying budget balance, stripping out the impact of the slowdown on taxes and cyclically determined spending and, perhaps, interest rates as well. Such an underlying budget balance would allow better between-years monitoring of the fiscal position, underpinning the discipline of the Stability and Growth Pact and reassuring the financial markets that the fiscal stance is not being eased, even if the nominal deficits are inevitably somewhat larger.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, such an underlying budget balance would discourage finance ministers from fiscal easing in upturns, merely on account of cyclically buoyant revenue.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge us to respect the Stability and Growth Pact and add to its ability to check finance ministers' discipline. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jonckheer (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Madam President, Commissioner, much has already been said about the issue of the Growth and Stability Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the main difference between the two joint motions for resolution submitted to the House is the fact that the motion for resolution signed both by my group and the Socialist Group lays greater stress on the possibility of implementing a contracyclical policy. This policy would promote growth, while keeping within the limits of the Growth and Stability Pact. If I understand the declaration made by the presidency correctly, it seems that the presidency supports this idea that the Growth and Stability Pact should allow the European Union to implement a contracyclical policy to promote growth.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, we must not be under any illusions. There is relatively little room for manoeuvre within the terms of the monetary and budgetary policies. I would now like to comment on one aspect of the debate. This has not yet been mentioned but I, at least, am concerned about it. As you know Commissioner, Madam President, practically all Member States have engaged in a structural reduction of government revenue (as a percentage of GDP) through fiscal reductions. This is being done within the context of fiscal harmony between Member States, especially through corporation tax, and within the context of weak growth. This type of policy entails the risk of downward pressure towards a structural reduction of public spending. This could lead to insufficient spending, given the solidarity mechanism we endorse. Alternatively, it could lead to inequitable public spending. This is why it is important to debate the development of other tax bases. It seems that the presidency has alluded to and taken heed of this possibility. In this regard, the Tobin tax may also contribute to widening the range of tax bases. However, Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to find out from you about the progress of work within the Prima Renault group, and about the state of discussion on the issue of corporation tax. I believe that it is urgent for the fifteen Member States to find a way out of the impasse they have got themselves into. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is no longer informed on how this work is progressing. When we do hear rumours on this subject, all we hear is that no progress has been made. When growth is slowing down, I believe that, as a matter of urgency, the European Union should pull itself together and coordinate work on the development of corporation tax.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to comment on the problems of terrorism and money laundering. The principal elements concerned are the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) and the issue of the directive on money laundering. Experts in this field judge progress made so far on international cooperation on this area to be limited and not very effective. Signatory countries are not obliged to implement the series of recommendations the FATF has produced. In October 1996, European magistrates signed the Geneva Appeal, which called for certain international conventions to be ratified, and for banking secrecy to be lifted when proceedings have to be started. One of these magistrates has recently repeated this appeal, calling for an international conference to consider these matters. The conference would define the rules on economic transparency, including lifting banking secrecy and abolishing tax havens. It would also increase judicial cooperation between states and set up a system of sanctions to be imposed on countries that failed to comply with these provisions. I urge the President and the Commission to see that the Belgian Presidency acts upon these requests magistrates are making. Indeed, the head of FATF has reiterated these same demands, as I have read in the press this morning. Work on these issues should proceed more quickly and FATF recommendations should be made binding.</p>
<p class="contents">This would be a very useful role for the European Union to play, both in its capacity as the Chair and a key member of the FATF. I believe that we will be able to turn words into actions. I also believe that, as regards the fiscal package, which includes binding provisions to regulate tax havens and low-tax areas (some of which can be found within the European Union), we can combine the fight against financial crime and the European tax on savings programme. I believe that we must seize this political opportunity to step up work on these issues. Unfortunately, the informal meeting of ECOFIN had to announce, yet again, that no progress had been made in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unemployment is rising once again, there is a threat of recession and the conditions for lasting growth are not in place. However, so far, the Council, the Commission and the European Central Bank have come up with platitudes and have convinced themselves that everything is fine. The euro does provide protection against currency speculation but it offers no protection whatsoever from financial crises. We are involved in financial globalisation up to our necks.</p>
<p class="contents">The main cause of the current apathy is the fundamentalist approach of those opposed to state intervention. Those who subscribe to this view try desperately to promote fiscal competition, as Pierre Jonckheer reminded us. They reduce public spending but welcome turgidity on the stock exchange and its requirements to produce financial returns. This results in a lack of public and private investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Another reason for this apathy is that social-democratic visions for Europe are somewhat lacking. I think it is time we recognise this. You advocate strengthening coordination between national policies. I am in favour of this, but we must recognise that basically this has come to be equated with the Growth and Stability Pact. I am sure you will confirm this. The debate must not remain polarised between the ‘fundamentalists’ and those who want to make the Growth and Stability Pact more flexible. We advocate an action plan to get us out of this rut.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, as elected representatives at a European and national level, we must come to a consensus and call for a revival of the European economies. We must send a message along these lines to a meeting of the European Council in Ghent and to the Commission. In order to achieve economic revival, we must favour public spending and credit as opposed to tax cuts. Funds to promote investment should also be established.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we believe that we must carry out an in-depth revision of the Growth and Stability Pact. This Pact has remained unchanged since 1992, although the global situation is now very different and the euro has appeared. I appreciate the idea of starting to make it more flexible, as mentioned by Mrs Neyts. However, we want something more than this. We want reform. Two principles should guide us in this. Public or mixed economy choices should balance market forces. Must I point out that President Bush used Keynesian policies to revive the American economy, after President Clinton refused to cut taxes to increase his popularity? Furthermore, the criteria of state intervention should allow for decision-making at national level and for solidarity. Restricting public deficit to a maximum of 3% in no way succeeded in preventing the exacerbation of differences.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the new Growth and Stability Pact would be based on common criteria for effectiveness, relating both to taxation and public spending. Taxation should combat the volatility of the financial markets and government stocks by taxing financial products and revenues. Spending should create the necessary conditions for lasting growth, employment, security and solidarity. We also want the Pact to include taxation and budgetary tools appropriate to the European Union. Fortunately, the Belgian Presidency has suggested this.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Laeken declaration must include a commitment to establishing Community powers in relation to macro-economic policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a role for economic policy coordination, but it must be applied in a sensible and balanced manner in all Member States. There are, however, serious policy differences between what the Commission is now proposing and what was agreed at the Ecofin Council in Helsinki in 1999, when it was agreed that Member States ‘determine their budgetary policies in consistency with the Treaty’, but that this commitment leaves room for domestic policy choices.</p>
<p class="contents">This week the Commission published a welcome White Paper on European governance, the thrust of which reflects the need for EU institutions to listen, rather than dictate. There is a clear signal coming from EU citizens that while they continue to support the thrust of EU integration, they want it to happen in a manner which reflects the independence and the integrity of each Member State and its citizens. There are those in this House, and indeed within the administration, who are blindly rushing towards the creation of a federalist Europe. They are in my mind doing a disservice to the vision of Europe's founding fathers and will, I predict, be stopped in their tracks by citizen reaction. Events in the real world can rarely be dealt with by means of a predetermined, prescriptive set of rules. Over-regulation stifles initiative and, therefore, progress and prosperity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know that the criteria of this Pact are now completely obsolete.</p>
<p class="contents">The Growth and Stability Pact is dead, Mr Von Wogau; it did not die in New York. It was killed off by the European Central Bank. The Bank’s policies were always out of line with reality. Its forecasting errors are now legendary, and it has an irrational fear of inflation. We are all aware of the results. We have to contend with the highest interest rates in the world, a consistently weak euro and the threat of recession. The outcome of pursuing monetary policy in the manner of a frightened old man is clear. Sooner or later, governments will be forced towards budgetary expansion. It would be ridiculous now to blame them for doing this. Many members of the committee have made this abundantly clear in all our conversations (if you can call them that) with Mr Duisenberg.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, the European Union is unworthy of the powers it has assumed from legitimate governments. It has proved this by failing to order (this is a euphemism) the European Central Bank to make available to the countries of the euro area the resources entrusted to it by Member States. As far as we know, the ECB does not own Europe’s currency and should not act like Scrooge. I would also like to point out in passing that it is unacceptable for the ECB to decide whether or not to issue euro notes and coins before 1 January. I have to say that I really cannot understand why some governments do not wish to take the initiative and bring the date of distribution forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet again the European Union cannot keep pace with its ambitions and assertions. It has failed to take up a position at the forefront of the drive to promote economic growth and employment. This is the only battle that matters to the people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Commissioner, Madam President, let me add that the hypocrisy surrounding the issue of the Tobin tax added nothing to the intellectual standing of the European Union. For once, the European Union had the opportunity to show that it intended to have an effect on world affairs, to become more than what it actually is, simply one more piece of the jigsaw of liberal globalisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Della Vedova (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the Italian Radicals supported the resolution of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party because they consider it of vital importance that Parliament confirms the validity of the Stability and Growth Pact and its principles.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that rigorous budgetary and monetary policies are not incompatible with growth, provided that we have the courage to act in the areas of structural reform, privatisation, liberalisation of the markets – particularly the labour market – and public spending, and provided that we have the courage to resolve the complex issue of pensions expenditure, which is an excessive burden on the budgets of many European countries and, because of the way these systems are organised, creates situations which are extremely unfair towards the young generations of workers.</p>
<p class="contents">I am quite aware that the European countries – I refer to my own country, Italy, in particular, but also to others such as Germany – rested on their laurels during the economic boom, putting off reforms which were necessary in order to consolidate public finances and make businesses competitive and giving way to pressure from trade unions and employers’ associations demanding more State aid. Thus, they failed to prepare the European economies for the inevitable subsequent slowdown, which will be particularly severe in the wake of the events of 11 September.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in my opinion, the fiscal burden in Europe is still too high: although it has fallen somewhat, it is true, the figures show that the fiscal burden in Europe is still significantly higher than it was in the early nineties, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Derogating from the constraints of the Stability and Growth Pact now and resorting to deficit spending means storing up fresh tax increases for the coming years which, in my opinion, the European economy, the European workers and the European unemployed can on no account afford.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one danger which must be highlighted – Mr Goebbels mentioned the confusion following the events of 11 September – and that is that Europe will use the current economic crisis and the crisis in the United States as an excuse to go back to expansionist, deficit spending policies such as those experienced by Europe and its citizens in previous decades. This is not the right response to the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The argument that the United States is also reacting with an expansionist policy and that it is going to spend an additional 1% of its GDP disregards the fact that the United States is supported by healthy, buoyant public finances and therefore has the capacity to do so reasonably effectively. The same would not be true if we were to implement similar policies in Europe or to support State airlines which have drained public resources and hampered the liberalisation of the European markets.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress one last point relating to the fight against terrorism and its funding. Something which is now increasingly being emphasised by expert analysts – recently even by the winner of the Nobel Prize for Economics, Gary Becker – is the fact that the multinational terrorist organisations are financed by drug trafficking, particularly where Afghanistan and Pakistan are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also explore the possibility of cutting off this channel of terrorist funding at source through drugs policies not based on prohibition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berthu (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, the debate taking place today on the supposed choice between the Growth and Stability Pact and budgetary expansion seems somewhat bizarre. In fact, we do not have a choice between these two alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, the Growth and Stability Pact is too rigid an instrument, despite offering some opportunities for derogation, because it does not make proper provision for the time-lags between the economic cycles of the various Member States. We have consistently pointed this out. However, the Council has just suggested that it might eventually be possible to make adjustments according to the economic climate, and using a bit of skill and the excuse of the attacks, we can therefore expect the Pact to be more flexible.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, budgetary expansion in countries that have suffered the biggest slowdown, like France and Germany, has had three main effects. Firstly, these countries already have significant budgetary deficits. This limits their margin for manoeuvre and has already acted as a stimulus. As is the case with drugs, a greater stimulus is needed to achieve the maximum effect. However, eventually the dose will have to be reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">The second effect of this expansion is that the excessive undervaluing of the euro has led to an increase in exports. This is due to the fact that the euro is an artificial currency. This has been unfair on our partners but has boosted internal growth. However, I am not sure that this might not have contributed, to a very small degree, to the slowdown in the United States over recent months.</p>
<p class="contents">The third effect of budgetary expansion is the dispersal of cash people have been hoarding, prior to the introduction of euro notes and coins on 1 January next year. No one ever mentions this, but it is nevertheless happening. This laundered money has been reinvested in the economy in very significant amounts. The figures for France total FRF 50 billion this year.</p>
<p class="contents">This is already causing revival. Further budgetary expansion would have no purpose. It would only lead to the eventual introduction of new taxes which would make the situation even more difficult in future. The real question we should be asking ourselves is: given the three linked elements necessary for economic revival I have mentioned, why are we not experiencing an economic boom? Apart from the unexpected effects of the attacks in America, which have yet to be firmly established, I think there are two reasons for this.</p>
<p class="contents">The first reason is that the economies of Europe are overburdened with many different taxes and rigid regulations. The policies of the Socialist French government, especially the absurdity of the 35-hour working week, made these problems particularly acute in France.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason relates to the perverse effect of the euro. I have said this before, but I will mention it again. The euro may to some extent prevent some fluctuation in internal exchange rates, as supporters of the currency take great pleasure in explaining time and again. However, on the other hand, it imposes a single monetary policy on countries which find themselves in very different situations. This ‘one-size-fits-all’ policy, to quote one economist, is not suited to the present situation of France and Germany. It is having a recessionary effect in these countries. It seems clear that the recessionary effect of standardisation today rather outweighs the benefits of eliminating internal exchange rates. If we consider the situation as a whole, the euro is not protecting us from recession but rather encouraging it. Should we put up with greater budgetary deficits to compensate for the euro? That would be truly paradoxical!</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, Mr President, given the direction Europe has taken, we will have to endure several more years of problems and tension before governments recognise this essential truth: all countries fare better if each can benefit from an economic policy suited to its individual requirements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why economic policies to create confidence will perhaps have an unparalleled impact on the behaviour of consumers and investors, and, hence, on how long the period of slower growth will last. There are also certain positive signs, from the point of view of restraint and the stability of currency values. The price of crude oil is falling rather than rising and the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have, since 11 September, been taking prompt action and acting in accord with one another. Now, after the Federal Reserve’s drop in interest rates yesterday, all eyes are on the ECB. It is no good waiting. May the approach to the solution remain in the hands of the independent ECB, but the future of the policy on interest rates in Europe must also be made clear quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">Firm commitment on the part of every country to the Stability and Growth Pact will create just the sort of confidence the pact itself seeks and the economy now needs. Budgetary discipline must not be allowed to slacken in the EU countries on any pretext, not even on account of any possible expenditure to increase internal and external security. Equivalent savings will have to be found: we cannot rely on some hoped-for continued growth of income.</p>
<p class="contents">Switching to the euro will mean slightly increased costs for all points in the production chain. There is no denying that. However, they will be one-off increases and will only raise prices slightly. They should not be used for scaremongering and thereby increase inflationary pressures.</p>
<p class="contents">The best long-term policy for stability and growth now is to adhere closely to the decisions of the Lisbon Summit and make the European Union the world’s most competitive area, removing internal barriers to competition and giving encouragement to innovation and research and development. The commencement of a new round of WTO talks is now vital for international cooperation in matters of the economy to steadily gain strength. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The success, of course, is the euro, the failure is the actual economy, where there are two, interconnected problems. The low rate of growth and the high rate of unemployment. The reason for both is the same and lies in the low rate of investment in capital equipment during the last decade of the last century, accompanied by the collapse of public investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people maintain that this collapse is a virtual collapse because it is due to a simple change of name, in that the private sector is investing where the public sector used to invest. But how are we to believe this when overall investments have fallen so low? Did public investment have to be throttled in order to support the euro? Did unemployment have to reach its present rate, albeit not as high as just two years ago, although it will no doubt rise again, Commissioner, in order to support the euro? I do not think so, but although no one admits it, this was the official policy up to the European Council in Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">That was where the line was taken to adopt the new economy which is supposed to find a modern solution to Europe's economic problem and bring back full employment on the new basis of more advanced technology, the most advanced technology in the world. Nice words, nice ambitions, nice vision. Unfortunately it failed because this was when the bubble burst on the American stock exchange, especially in the new technology and telecommunications sector, which was supposed to lead us into a new era and which is now threatening to drag us into one of the biggest slumps of the twentieth century.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that these events have drawn a line under the Lisbon vision and that we need to go back to the drawing board. There is no way someone can have a full plan to present to you, not when all our study institutes deny the need for us to change our economic policy. But some things seem to be self-explanatory. The European economy needs investment, the private sector is not investing enough because we insist on preventing the public sector from supplementing its investments – is that how we are going to revive the private sector's interest? By refusing to make use of the possibilities offered by the Treaty and exempt investments from the definition of deficit in the Stability Pact? I heard Mr Della Vedova refer in trepidation to ‘deficit spending’. Things may have got out of hand in the era of ‘deficit spending’ but, let us not forget that, in that era, the rate of growth was 5% and unemployment never exceeded 1 to 1.5%, while our current economic policy, based as it is on a high degree of liberalisation of the markets, is a long way from being such a success. America came close in the last five years of the last century in a climate of excessive speculation and look where that has got us now.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, I should like to ask you, Commissioner, as you did me the honour of allowing me to ask you in private: what is the scientific criterion for refuting your position that will make you tell us that our position has been refuted and that we need to change economic policy? As I am sure you know, without refutability there can be no scientific standpoint. We keep getting caught in a huge tautology and I am afraid that this is precisely the economic policy which you support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, that is not the issue. Are we forecasting a slump, yes or no? Some say, wait and see what happens. But if it does happen, then it will be too late. Others say, wait and the problem will resolve itself. Some take cold comfort in the belief that our economy will rally once the economy rallies in the United States and totally ignore the fact that, with globalisation, if that happens, others will benefit from the recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">All the wrangling, as a number of honourable members have already said, is about avoiding the notion of public intervention in the economy. I fail to understand why. What is the point in being dogmatic, when you have specific problems and, more to the point, the problem of a slump in front of you? Some of us can imagine various scenarios which marry public intervention with economic stability, that is, increased earnings, without creating the alarming fiscal competition which some people are projecting?</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is, we need public expenditure, we have the potential to generate public earnings which do not affect the productive structure or development of the economy or its competitiveness. Surely you do not mean to tell me that you would have a problem if someone somewhere did something about annuities or the international speculators throwing hot money around on the stock exchange, or even about the excessive wealth and the frantic consumption of our inflated upper middle classes. We have no scientific answer. We are dogmatic. No to the public sector and no to a Europe which, if it did all this – because only Europe can do all this – would be a federalist Europe.

No country will remain immune to the economic impact of the horrendous terrorist attacks in America. Those attacks were so severe that it will be some time before the extent of the economic fallout is fully known. We are already seeing the first economic ramifications of 11 September, a day that will be etched on the memory of us all for evermore.</p>
<p class="contents">Job losses are mounting in the airline industry. The jobs shed at many European airlines will never be filled again. These job losses in turn affect nearly every aspect of an economy. Consumer and investor confidence is waning, the value of global and stock markets is down too.</p>
<p class="contents">The one encouraging sign is that the euro currency is surviving strongly. We can now all see the importance of the single European currency and the fact that there are 12 currencies participating within the single European currency regime is lending stability to the European economy. There could be nothing worse than having 15 independent floating currencies operating within the European Union at the moment. This would be a recipe for international speculators to come in and play one currency off against another.</p>
<p class="contents">We all recall the devaluations which took place in 1992, when the international currency speculators played havoc with the European stock markets. Thankfully they are not in a position to do so again now, because we have a stable currency operating in Europe and surviving the recent economic shocks. The terrorist attacks will not affect the timetable for the introduction of euro notes and coins, which will proceed as planned.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also clear that the European Central Bank and the various national euro changeover boards have done an excellent job in marketing the new euro economy. While I have no doubt that there will be some teething problems, we shall overcome them and by the end of the changeover period the citizens of Europe will be fully cognizant of the value of the new euro notes and coins. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have always been in favour of strict compliance with the criteria of the Stability Pact. In this time of uncertainty, extra alertness is called for. Various Member States are entering the danger zone. A major advantage of budgetary discipline is manifesting itself: room for automatic stabilisers. I would like to note in this connection that increasing expenditure is no solution.</p>
<p class="contents">What will prove decisive is the quality of the Stability Pact in combination with the necessary reforms in the economy as a whole. The resolution mentions that the distribution of authority between the Member States and the Union leads to negative action at Member State level. The reverse is also true. The Union’s monetary decisions can adversely affect a Member State, for example, in the form of high inflation due to an unwelcome drop in interest rates. I welcome the attention that this area of tension is receiving.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to the EMU’s favourable effect, the European economy can become more stable. Time will tell whether this is proportionate to the loss of custom-made solutions for the Member States.

<p class="contents">Firstly, we know that the European industrial sector is currently experiencing a graver crisis than the one it went through as a result of the 1998 financial crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we know that the crisis currently afflicting the world economy is far more serious than the one it underwent in 1993, after the Gulf War. This is because for the first time since 1929, the three largest economies are affected, namely the economies of the United States, Europe and Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, except for Mr Abitbol we all know that nowadays the European economy is far better prepared to cope with such a crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">As stated earlier, we now have a single currency to protect us from exchange rate crises. We also have a policy to protect us from exorbitant price rises. In addition, we have a Stability Pact to safeguard us against the munificence of public administrations.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not know for certain but we suspect that this crisis is not demand led, like the post-war crisis. Nor is it a supply driven crisis like the one following the <span class="italic">Yom Kippur</span> war. Rather, it is a crisis of confidence. As such, what distinguishes our motion for a resolution from the one put forward by the left is not that they wish to grow while we do not. Obviously, we all want to grow. Nevertheless, some recipes will move us forward whilst others will put us into reverse. We believe that our recipes will move us forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to explain the reasons why I think as I do. If this is a crisis of confidence, it would be a fundamental error to relax monetary policy and allow price rises. That would hole consumer confidence below the water line. Secondly, because revising the Stability Pact would amount to indicating that we wish to pass this burden on to future generations, and that is certainly not a confidence booster. Thirdly, if we relax the budgetary policy enshrined in the Stability Pact we shall prevent interest rates from being lowered, as the Americans are doing.</p>
<p class="contents">A vessel is not assessed according to whether there is a storm around or not, but according to how it weathers a storm. In my view, it is now clear that we should change the way we navigate. The European Central Bank may be driven to reduce interest rates, but it must bear in mind that its ultimate aim is to maintain the dogma of price stability to maintain consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">It is likely that some governments who have done their homework will be able to allow the automatic stabilisers to operate. They will not need to compensate for fiscal reduction by increasing taxes or reducing expenditure. Unfortunately, governments who have failed to do their homework and behaved like prodigal sons will not find themselves in such a fortunate position.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, as the Commissioner has said, though previous speakers failed to mention it, it is time for Europe to move ahead and take a determined step forward to get the Lisbon process under way. This process aims to create a modern, innovative and competitive society.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the Tobin tax, the Commissioner was far more convincing in the interview he granted the <span class="italic">Vanguardia Digital</span>, when he said it was a useless tool, than in his speech today. Today the Commissioner stated it was one more potential tool. Previously the Commissioner stated it was not possible. Now it begins to appear probable.

I think this symbolises Europe's ability to close ranks when the chips are really down. I believe that this policy should also be pursued further in relation to aid policy. However, it should also give us the flexibility we need, so as to demonstrate that Europe does not want the economic downturn to be further exacerbated.</p>
<p class="contents">We do in fact have a Stability and Growth Pact that gives us many possibilities, because on the one hand we wish Europe to be a Community of stability, and on the other hand we also want to promote growth and employment. It is no accident that when applying the convergence criteria, exceptional circumstances have sometimes been applied and approved which allow the definition of an excessive deficit to be deviated from. I do not mean by that to speak in favour of a ‘Community of instability’. Just the opposite in fact, I wish to call on the Belgian Presidency and the Commission to contribute to further coordination in this area, by taking advantage of the fact that stability programmes can be updated. I would like to see updated stability programmes for the euro countries which make it clear that the data has significantly changed. What is needed in this context, as you quite rightly said yourself, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, is for us to avoid procyclical policies in Europe, in both the expansionist and restrictive senses. However, we can only do that if we can compare cyclically neutral budget data with structural deficits in updated budget figures. I think that it would be helpful if the excitement that this debate has generated in this House led to further progress being made both in economic policy and in stability policy. I say that because the European Union needs both monetary stability and employment and social stability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, I cannot remain in the House for very long as I have a meeting at 4.30 p.m. with your contact group to debate the development of the Members’ Statute. I regard this as an important subject and this is an important meeting. I requested it myself. I will be back here in the House at 5.30 p.m. to respond to the many questions you wish to put to me. I would therefore like to thank you very much for listening to what I have to say now. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure that you all appreciated the importance attached to every word of my speech, and the significance of every adjective I used when I spoke on behalf of the Presidency of the Council and the Council itself. Please excuse me if I do not now try to interpret my previous speech further. I was speaking on behalf of the whole of the Council. Consequently, I think I explained clearly how our thinking is developing. I also defined the limits ECOFIN and the ministers themselves have already set. I then described the nature of the ongoing debate. Those of you, you are all here, will certainly wish to have experts available to monitor the development of this debate closely.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the conclusions of this debate are considerably more important. I believe that we are, at last, more or less in agreement with the objectives we wish to achieve, even if there is less agreement on the best means of achieving them.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that this debate will continue. However, I would like to make two brief observations of my own. Mr Berthu, a longstanding colleague of mine, said that everything was so much better when each country had full control of its financial and economic instruments. However, I must disagree with you on this point, Mr Berthu. I have been around long enough to know that the reality was very different, and it was at that time too. Europe has experienced very serious financial and economic crises, and has found it extremely difficult to overcome them. This is my first point.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to move on to my second point. I shall not quickly forget the time in the 1970s when people sang the praises of the deficit spending policy. This was a time of economic slowdown in my country, and those in positions of responsibility praised the policy of deficit spending to high heaven. It took us fifteen years to recover from the effects of this policy. I do not wish this policy to be implemented in the European Union. However, everything I have heard here goes quite in the opposite direction. I am sure that you will make it your business to monitor this situation very closely and will be extremely vigilant. Thank you very much for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In various countries and from different sources warnings are being issued regarding the need to amend the Stability Pact and the priority being given to the monetarist policies of neo-liberalism. This situation is being felt both in the more developed countries and in those where situations of the greatest inequality prevail and/or where threats of social tension are emerging.</p>
<p class="contents">In a country like Portugal, which has the lowest salaries, pensions and reforms in the European Union and the highest rates of premature school-leaving, accidents at work and poverty, the application of rigid timetables and deadlines and major restrictions on public spending and investment is unacceptable, because this will impede the country’s development and obstruct the way to economic and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">The need for the immediate suspension of the Stability Pact is, therefore, very topical. In a European Union that claims to be concerned with social problems, committed to the creation of jobs and the fight against social exclusion and poverty, maintaining monetary stability at any cost cannot continue to be considered as a priority, when we know that the consequences will be more unemployment, more salary restrictions and more poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not a question of merely calling for some flexibility in the criteria of the Stability Pact and the implementation of the growth and stability programmes, which each country has had to present. It is essential to engage in an in-depth revision of the objectives, criteria and foundations of the Stability Pact, starting from the premise that the budgets of the Member States must reflect the needs of each people and each country and not the interests of the financial groups that the European Central Bank is seeking to convey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a complex and anomalous tool, not found in textbooks and universities; in fact, it replaces a true economic and budget balance policy on a federal scale. But in order to be effective, such a tool must be credible and based on definite rules and obligations that are respected by all. Changing the rules during the difficult process of convergence, less than one hundred days before the birth of the euro proper, would therefore be a serious mistake.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stability Pact must not, therefore, be relaxed or have its deadlines or targets changed; any such approach would be merely short-sighted opportunism and disastrous for the building of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stability Pact should, rather, be strengthened, improved and made more efficient; targets that only refer to budget balances are no longer enough. Budget balances are a necessary but not sufficient objective, because there will be a growing need to aim at quality in public spending and the medium to long-term sustainability of public finances in the individual euro countries; in this connection, it is sufficient to think of the pension deficit.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, even a Stability Pact interpreted in the most responsible, far-sighted manner possible would do nothing for the credibility of our currency if there were not a massive acceleration in the process of completing economic union at the same time, with greater genuine convergence, greater social cohesion, greater development, greater liberalisation, and a greater market for services and energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Though we need therefore to comply with and value the Stability and Growth Pact, as much attention should also be devoted to the subject of the Lisbon agenda. Unfortunately, the Stockholm European Council was a step backwards in this respect. Commissioner, Minister, for the sake of the euro and our Europe, let us avoid similar steps backwards in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Within this framework, many people are questioning the validity of the restrictive and fundamentalist way in which the Growth and Stability Pact has been interpreted and the consequences that this interpretation may have on the very process of development and cohesion in Europe. The Stability Pact is a global commitment, which combines the realism of a specific macro-economic scenario with a healthy concern for the consolidation of public finances. The Pact should be interpreted in its entirety and, obviously, if one of the terms of the equation is altered, the other term must be adjusted and made flexible.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to get into an argument with the followers of the school of single thought, who have, unfortunately, come to play a leading role on the European economic policy scene. But I cannot refrain from stating that any true defence of the Growth and Stability Pact requires, first and foremost, an understanding of it. Now, understanding it means that it is correct to agree, in an unfavourable international situation, to accommodate the unavoidable loss of income and the consequent increase in the public deficit, provided it does not exceed 3%, as Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck rightly stated. This cannot and must not be confused with any laxity or inefficiency by the revenue authorities, much less with relinquishing in the medium term a policy of adjustment supported by budgetary procedures and a serious and ongoing effort to control public spending and improve administrative efficiency at every level. Controlling and streamlining public spending are worthy objectives. We are not, therefore, talking about a revision or cancellation of the Stability Pact. Consolidating spending does not mean irrationally demanding a linear reduction of deficits. It does mean considering that in the medium term budgetary balances from one year should be balanced with those of the next. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, when it comes to defining these concepts and in particular when it comes to how we should achieve these objectives, then there are considerable differences between us. A purely fiscal interpretation will not help us to solve the present problems, which are reflected in falling economic growth and consistently high unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">The market economy as an economic concept is fine, but it is unacceptable as a social policy tool. Or to put it another way, the market can and should regulate the economy, but not society. We see the priority as being not a supply-oriented economic policy, but a demand-oriented one. We do not believe that liberalisation is a panacea. We need not only commercial competition, but also a linkage with economic and social criteria, in order to achieve the highest possible level of social security, sustainability and justice. Balancing budgets is fine, but not at any price.</p>
<p class="contents">In contrast to the President-in-Office, I wish to call for an anticyclical economic policy. In times of recession, increasing public expenditure on investment in new capacity and in education and training are essential.</p>
<p class="contents">We have the euro area, but we do not have a European economic, fiscal and social policy. That cannot work. It is not just a matter of achieving price stability alone, which is the ECB's remit, we also need to achieve socio-economic stability.</p>
<p class="contents">A more flexible approach to the existing convergence criteria will not solve the problem, it will just shift the burden to those who meet the criteria. We need a new version that takes into account additional parameters such as the employment rate, the value-added ratio and the investment ratio, because these indicators reflect economic strength and development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The US Federal Reserve has now dropped the federal funds rate to 2.5% – a 39-year low. This is the ninth rate cut this year. The ECB may respond shortly, but almost two years since the euro's launch, there is as yet little enthusiasm for its future role as the major international reserve currency.</p>
<p class="contents">This is in part the result of exchange-rate weakness and, in part, because the notes and coins are not yet in circulation, so it cannot yet be heralded as an unqualified success. It remains to be seen if the one-size-fits-all model of interest rates will work in all the countries of the Union, in particular countries like Ireland. These concerns and the added concerns about constitutional implications and loss of sovereignty leave my country, the UK, happy to remain outside for the time being.</p>
<p class="contents">Although clearly we all wish the project well, it has frankly confounded many pessimists including our former Prime Minister John Major. Some years ago, the Commission in its McDougal report concluded that central tax-raising powers of at least 7% of GDP would be needed to allow counter-cyclical spending and transfer payments to make a single-currency zone function properly.</p>
<p class="contents">This would, of course, have been anathema to Member States, so they decided instead on strict spending, borrowing and inflation limits in Dublin in 1996 as an alternative. Recently, there have been calls to make these Stability and Growth Pact ceilings more flexible. This is unwise in my opinion, as I believe firmly that a prudent approach to public finance and borrowing is a good thing. Furthermore, the British economy is linked to and becoming more convergent with the euro zone, so we all have an incentive to stick to the guidelines and we must not allow the US crisis to be an excuse for new, big government tax-and-spend policies. The Stability Pact includes mechanisms designed to operate in recession and Article 2.1 on the excessive deficit procedure could be used in exceptional circumstances to justify higher military or security spending. But Member States should concentrate on structural reforms, particularly in their labour markets, as the way ahead. Otherwise, we would only have high inflation and massive increases in the mountain of national debt. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To refuse to see the 15 billion given to the airlines, to refuse to see that, for both political and economic reasons, international movements of funds need to be controlled somewhere along the line if we are to have both economic and political stability, to refuse to see that governments need to stop being petty and to take things in hand.

Around the summer recess, a few finance ministers considered it necessary to express as their own personal opinion the fact that more scope was required in the Pact as a result of a declining economy. This was apparently not an official government view because the requirements were not repeated on the platforms eminently placed to deal with this, including the ECOFIN Council. Quite the reverse, in fact. On those occasions, warm words were spoken about the Pact. Despite these fine words, President Duisenberg considered the talk of relaxing the rules very worrying. Commissioner Solbes Mira even addressed Italy, France, Germany and Portugal in a stern manner and urged them to translate the agreements into action. And he is right.</p>

If all Member States, when economic growth allowed for this, had taken the required structural measures, the Central Bank would now be able to be more flexible in its interest policy. After all, there is a direct link between the budgetary policy and the interest policy in the policy mix.</p>
<p class="contents">Various MEPs have spoken about 11 September and Mr Herzog even went so far as to claim that the euro does not protect us against financial crises. I think he is very much mistaken. After 11 September, the Central Bank took action in an admirable manner and has most definitely shielded us from a financial cash crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Some time ago, Ireland was severely punished when it gave another stimulus to an almost overheated economy, contributing further to high inflation. As far as I am concerned, Ireland might serve as an example, but we should also be courageous, and level criticism at large countries. We should especially target those countries that fully deserve the criticism. And let us be aware of the fact that the financial markets are closely monitoring the way in which the Member States are currently handling their government budgets in a declining economy. The current situation is a test of how sound the euro construction really is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have gradually been sensing that this debate has made it clearer and clearer how justified the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats was in taking the initiative to table this motion, and how important that was. There are 89 days to go until the euro notes and coins come into circulation, and on top of that challenge we are living in very uncertain times. At the same time there have been reactions in some governments around making the Stability and Growth Pact an issue. We have already heard the names of certain people in some governments who have not done their homework properly when it comes to the Stability and Growth Pact. For that reason it is particularly important in these uncertain times and with 89 days to go before the euro comes in, to convey a sense of clarity and calm to the markets and also to consumers. Europe's Stability and Growth Pact will not be shaken.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is necessary to counter the idea that weakening the Stability and Growth Pact is a way of acting to prevent a recession. It is simply not true that inflation can create jobs. And it is not true that the Stability and Growth Pact did not allow enough leeway for hard times. The Member States that have the greatest leeway are the ones that have done most of their homework. So I can only urge you not to play with fire. It is irresponsible to add to uncertainty at a time when things are already uncertain, and the Stability Pact is a requirement for the stability of the euro. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Radwan (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, the object of the Stability and Growth Pact is to achieve lasting stability in the financial markets, which have remained a national responsibility since the beginning of the single currency. This means that the Stability Pact is a necessary counterpart in financial policy terms to the policy of monetary union and it is a financial policy substitute for political union, which did not come into being at the same time as monetary union. The objective of the pact is to ensure that there is sufficient leeway in budgets when times are good and to make provision for bad times. Some Member States, including Germany, have failed to do this recently.</p>
<p class="contents">However, no sooner have the first difficulties appeared than people have started talking about how the criteria are interpreted. The usual criticism is that although the pact promotes stability, it also acts as a fiscal straitjacket and thus exacerbates weakness in monetary growth. This criticism fails to take account of the facts. The commitment made is to balance budgets in the medium term and to limit deficits, and it cannot therefore be thrown up in the air as soon as growth subsides.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why a clear signal is needed from ECOFIN, especially after the discussions that have taken place. With just three months to go before the euro comes into circulation, as Mr Karas mentioned, we need a sign of stability. The problem is that we have failed to achieve the Lisbon objective of becoming the region with the strongest growth in the world. But we can only achieve that objective if the Member States do their homework. They cannot blame this on the European Central Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to take issue with Mr Tannock for suggesting that the ECB has not met its objectives during this period of crisis. The ECB in particular has reacted very well since 11 September, and the euro has held up. However, the fact that we were already discussing the Stability and Growth Pact before 11 September meant that we were playing with fire, as Mr Karas put it, and causing uncertainty. If we had not done that we would be able to debate the future of the euro in a far calmer way now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Bearing in mind the implementation of planned and existing automatic stabilisers, I think the objectives set in the Stability and Growth Pact should not be presented or seen as obstacles to growth or the need to respond – politically too – to the consequences of a downturn in the economic climate like the one we are now going through.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I believe it would be just as wrong to present compliance with the Stability Pact objectives as being a sufficient or, worse still, the only possible reaction to a context with a clear risk of recession. I believe that in such circumstances there is once again a need especially to speed up progress towards two goals. The first is to specify and perfect tools of analysis and control, to ensure that public finances are used consistently and concomitantly in support of selective investment programmes that are strictly targeted and as such useful in an absolute sense – and even more necessary when compensating for the economic downturn. The second goal, confirming the positive nature of the Stability and Growth Pact, is to adapt and consolidate it so it remains in operation beyond the time when it should have reached its objectives, thus improving the conditions and strengthening the tools for an effective Community economic policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to echo that call for both colleagues across the European Parliament and governments across Europe to reach an agreement on this directive as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">This has been made all the more crucial by the tragic events of 11 September. Terror that day struck at the heart of the global financial system. The terrorists were clearly prepared to use all the mechanisms and tools that the global financial system gave them in planning that attack. Let us turn those tools against them. Many bankers and finance workers died in that attack. Let us enlist the help of those bankers and finance workers in responding to it and preventing a repetition thereof, because this is a concrete step that we can take in the war against terrorism. No-one is going to ask us to go and die on an Afghan hillside, though others will be asked to pay that price. But we too can – and should – make a contribution, because the bankers, brokers, cleaners, IT technicians, investment advisers, lawyers and caterers who spill off our trains into city centres in Frankfurt, Paris, London and Brussels are just the same as those 5000 or 6000 people who turned up for work in New York one day and will never ever come home.</p>
<p class="contents">The time has come to stop quibbling about lawyer confidentiality. I call on this Parliament to agree to a directive which will help starve the terrorists of funds. I call on it to agree to the freezing of assets of terrorist organisations, because someone, somewhere, is banking bin Laden's money. We can help starve him of funds, which is as important a task as the military operation which we know will soon follow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Any idea of waiving or relaxing established plans would undermine the future development of the whole of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">There is now an aspect that should also be given due consideration: the massaging of budget balance data so as not to reveal any anomalies that may still persist in certain public accounts. Unfortunately, in this respect, we in Italy have had to face a sad legacy from the centre-left.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not the right attitude, certainly worse than that of failing to bring the economy into line with the required parameters. While the former case involves fraudulence, the latter is, it is hoped, just a momentary, temporary difficulty. Such massaging of data should be clamped down on with no half measures and penalties can be imposed where appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of the Pact and the general awareness that it should be observed, it cannot be ignored that certain areas or even entire regions – southern Italy, southern Spain, southern and part of northern France, and eastern Germany – are certainly behind the rest. While the Member State as a whole must observe the pacts it has signed, it is also true that special relief measures for these areas – I refer to differential taxation, the use of unused Structural Funds for tax credits, new types of aid after 2006 for countries excluded from Objective 1 – should not only not be considered censurable but should be seen as desirable by all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I shall start by pointing out that our economic situation is different from that of the United States. The European Union’s point of departure is quite other from the United States’: our balances are not the same either, what has taken place in the United States has not taken place in Europe and, furthermore, our institutional framework is not the same. In my view it would be unrealistic and undesirable to try to apply the American model to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It has emerged from the debate that some of you feel our main concern is to prevent public sector involvement. That is not at all the case. We have never conceived of this issue in terms of a public sector versus private sector debate. There is scope for more public investment. There can be more public involvement, always of course within the rules laid down in the system we have created for ourselves to ensure more effective operation of the balance between monetary and fiscal policy. The ECOFIN decision on airlines and insurance cover as a result of the political risks involved is a good example of the swift effect of public action.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate then moved on to focus on the Growth and Stability Pact. Some of you are of the opinion that those of us in favour of the pact are adopting a fundamentalist position, others find it dogmatic. Some of you have even mooted the possibility of doing away with the pact altogether.</p>
<p class="contents">I would be inclined to side with the presidency and with those of you who have referred to something I consider crucial. The Growth and Stability Pact is intended to serve as an instrument to facilitate anticyclical action by the public finances. That was its original aim and remains its essential nature. Hence there is no question of dogmatism or fundamentalism.</p>
<p class="contents">We could discuss whether our past experience, gained from implementing the pact during periods of growth, has led us to the conclusion that it is only applicable to that end. True, in times of growth we were not particularly dogmatic as far as exhausting the possibilities of the pact with regard to reducing the public deficit in certain Member States. We may well be regretting that just now.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning to the logic enshrined in the pact, the pact does allow anticyclical actions. There is no doubt that the pact’s flexibility is due to two fundamental elements. The first concerns exceptional circumstances and it is not relevant to analyse these now, as exceptional circumstances are only invoked in times of deep recession or when growth has fallen below certain levels. The second element concerns the normal implementation of the pact through the operation of the automatic stabilisers.</p>
<p class="contents">In the specific case of the automatic stabilisers, the element of flexibility is contained in the pact itself. I can state quite clearly that in no way are we amending any position. Rather, the nature of the pact provides accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">In the code of conduct adopted by ECOFIN last July it was already stated that one of the fundamental elements of the Growth and Stability Pact is the medium-term objective for the fiscal position. It is made quite clear that assessment of the objective for the various countries should take explicit account of the cyclical position and its implications for the budget. Clearly, as some of you have pointed out, this element will therefore have to be taken into account when adjusting Member States’ stability programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">On occasion, the Commission has insisted that the cyclically adjusted deficit position should be included in information on the stability programmes. You are well aware, ladies and gentlemen, that we are experiencing technical difficulties. The latter relate not only to the concept but also to the method of calculating this structurally adjusted position.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, rather than making us more flexible, this will allow us to apply the pact to a reality different from that which prevailed when the various stability programmes were defined. It further implies as I said in my first speech, that in the Commission’s interpretation nominal objectives must not be considered set in stone. The nominal objectives are linked to certain assumptions on growth. Consequently, as I stated, there are no problems, there is flexibility and no dogmatism. Rather, we have moved on to a different stage as far as implementation of the Growth and Stability Pact is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Would an approach involving greater spending resolve the problems? I do not believe it would. Our position is that given the European experience in recent years, involving a rather procyclical approach to this type of decision, and having observed the difficulty experienced in regaining balance, it is not a wise option. As I said in my opening speech, we therefore remain of the opinion that the best choice is to opt for more Europe. Some of you have argued along the same lines.</p>
<p class="contents">More Europe means Lisbon. In the context of Lisbon, more Europe means increasing our potential growth. More Europe means more efficient systems. More Europe also means taking greater account of the impact of the crisis on the international markets. It also means taking into account factors as significant as international commercial negotiations on development aid, and all those related factors which will doubtless allow us to improve the context.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, more Europe can also mean progress on issues linked to fiscal competence which some of you have referred to, ladies and gentlemen. There is no doubt about that. More Europe will certainly mean progress in the fight against money laundering. All this is undoubtedly essential if we are to cope successfully with the tasks we have set ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">A debate such as today’s warranted a much longer reply. Unfortunately however, we are running out of time. Nonetheless, I was anxious to comment quickly on these ideas to make the Commission’s position on this final item quite clear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
