<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gemelli (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> I would like to start by thanking the Commissioner, for this report has come back to the Committee on Development and Cooperation a number of times and this has contributed to enriching the debate within the committee. I would also like to thank the Chairman of the committee and all the group coordinators, and all the Members who have contributed to the preparation of this report, taking up, with great sensitivity, my invitation to make this report a document which compels broad consensus and a broad majority in Parliament, reflecting all the positions expressed by the European Parliament. Lastly, I would also like to thank the draftspeople of the other committees: Mrs Carrilho of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, Mrs Haug of the Committee on Budgets, Mrs Lucas of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and Mrs Sörensen of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, who have contributed their opinions to this report.</p>
<p class="contents">The report is based on a number of fundamental principles: restoring the balance of nature in order to protect the environment; protecting the food chain as a way of protecting the ecosystem; developing a self-sufficient, sustainable economy; restricting exploitative industrial monocultures; and then, restoring the balance of nature also in terms of anthropological progress and responsible relationships between man and woman, adult and child, workers and elderly people, based on a unit of society made of a man, a woman and children.</p>
<p class="contents">Another principle is that of responsible, self-administered development, as a cultural factor, of the need for, and the development of a higher standard of living: projects which are self-created, in order to promote the development of local culture and help people to look beyond customs originating from local culture; then awareness of the role of the institutions and the need to involve the private sector<span class="bold"> </span>in programmes encouraging development; lastly, great, very great attention to the world of children, who, in the political world, are an invisible group of society with no voice or rights; moreover, a powerful role for women, recognising the role that women have always had in society, starting with the family and the work place.</p>
<p class="contents">It was with on the basis of these guidelines that the debate on the European Commission's communication took place. We found the debate somewhat simplistic compared to what ought to be the European Union's perspectives within this world of development. And so, since it has not been possible to produce a coherent report on such a complex work, I feel simply that I must say that the conditions of poor people are worse today than in 1960, that is 40 years ago, that the number of children in school has fallen and that people are not being considered as individuals, as individual people, but that all the poor people in the world are being lumped together as one economic statistic.</p>
<p class="contents">Debt is also an issue which can and must be tackled, provided that we succeed in monitoring the States' budgets in order to reclassify budget items and dedicate them to the eradication of poverty. Similarly, rural development must be improved, properly valued and increased, apart from anything else to offset the rush to build huge cities.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, with regard to conflict prevention, I feel that this issue has been dealt with more or less exhaustively in Mrs Carrilho's opinion on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and that it too can be tackled through the regionalisation of development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would stress one further point. It would appear that there is a tendency to attempt to deal with the issues of development and eradicating poverty by entrusting this task to the multinationals. I do not feel that the multinationals are the right organisations for the task. Rather, the role of the NGOs, who should have a direct relationship with<span class="bold"> </span>the peoples of developing countries, should be strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I do not know whether this report will enable us to deal with these issues, but I do know that there are many children, women and men in need of our help, and we must protect them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, this Commission document is to be welcomed, and not only because it seeks to put right specific aspects of the way in which development and cooperation policy is implemented. It also endeavours to place this action in a broader framework with wide-ranging scope, in line with what was laid down at the Helsinki European Council. Mr Gemelli’s report has added depth and consistency to this objective and therefore warrants our approval.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I wish to draw your attention once again to the advantage to be gained from greater intracommunity coordination of development and foreign policy. We all know that European participation plays a substantial role in supporting developing countries and that we provide more money than any other donor. These facts are not sufficiently appreciated, however, either for what they mean in financial terms, specifically in terms of commitments and the expectations that are raised, or for the responsibility that they require with regard to the political influence exercised on the development processes in the countries involved. A common strategy to confirm the international role of the European Union, given legitimacy by the principles of cooperation and human rights, can only benefit those countries that wish to progress from the level of the helpless or even of victims to the status of partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly and finally, we must make development policy more effective, principally through a more reliable system for the monitoring, control and assessment of programmes and their results on the ground. This would probably involve the creation of new management bodies, but it will certainly have to entail a better use of existing resources, specifically the delegations, and a genuine reform of the Community’s external service. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It deserves the same accolade from the House.</p>
<p class="contents">It is fair to say there was considerable input from all the political parties in this House, as Mr Gemelli accepted a number of amendments during the committee stage. It lays down the foundation for development policy for the coming decade. Some of the statistics it throws up are frightening in their nature, for instance the number of people under the age of 15 in developing countries; the utter poverty in which most of them live; the scourge of diseases such as AIDS, malaria and TB; the huge and widening gap between developed and developing nations; the predictions, which I believe will never be reached in the timescales laid down. Lastly, there is the enormity of the task we face as a European Union to help eradicate these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">It is encouraging that the Commission, of its own initiative, has realised we cannot continue as we have in the past and that new structures and formats have to be found to close the gap between commitments and payments and that better use must be made of developing funds. Trade is the key. I applaud much of its thinking. We in Parliament must support its efforts. Decentralisation is a must to make better use of our delegation offices and cut red tape and wasted time.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur for regional cooperation and integration last year, I am pleased to see progress being pursued in this direction with ECOWAS in West Africa leading the way. Only by strengthening internal regional trade will many nations be able to face globalisation and WTO rules. ‘Everything but Arms’ is a major step forward. But to make best use of development aid there must be closer cooperation between nation states, financial institutions and the Commission. The Commission should be acting as overall coordinator to cut out duplication and not be involved in the day-to-day development issues which should be contracted out to organisations that specialise in these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">While budget support to national governments may spend more money quicker, it is much more difficult to police and monitoring will have to be of a high calibre. Small-scale help for entrepreneurs must not be abandoned. It is here that the members of the Committee on Development should be more active in keeping the Commission alert to its responsibilities. The Commission has laid down its six priority principles, all of which we can strongly support. The priority within the six is also important. We should never forget that without peace, stability, good governance and the rule of law none of the other five priorities can be acted upon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This report deals with a field of action – globalisation – which is increasingly complex, especially when it comes to environmental problems and the problem of migratory flows, which is becoming more and more important in defining the European Union’s role in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist Group has always argued that development policy should be an essential element of the external action of the European Union and its Member States. And this is for two fundamental reasons: firstly, because the underdevelopment in which at least 800 million people live strikes us as intrinsically perverse, socially unjust and economically inefficient. Secondly, because we believe that the principles of solidarity and cohesion on which the European Union is based must guide the management of globalisation, so that it may be sustainable. To this end, I recommend that anybody who is not convinced should read the latest essay by Susan George.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we do not support just any development policy. Commissioner, if the objective of development policy is to eliminate poverty, as you and the Council have stated on numerous occasions, you should not, in your preliminary draft budgets, take funds away from the least-developed countries for the benefit of other external commitments. If this means that you have to increase the ceiling of the Financial Perspective, then do so, and if you do not, then change your tune. If we follow the model of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD for the rationalisation of strategies to combat poverty, we will also have to follow the DAC on the structure of the budgets, so that we can assess the effectiveness of our policy in relation to our objectives. That is what Parliament approved and what we want to see.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission wants new forms of governance for Europe in which dialogue with civil society plays a fundamental role, we must help those organisations which are more representative in the development of the European Union. In summary, we cannot manage this policy in the erratic way that we are doing at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Gemelli’s report is good. The Commission’s communication is also good although it suffers from a lack of specific points and quantifiable objectives, as the report says. Both documents are worthless if they are not applicable in practice. In the coming months various world conferences are going to take place and the debate will be reopened on the great development issues: the World Conference against Racism, the United Nations Conference on Least Developed Countries, and the first AIDS Conference. All of these issues affect our everyday policy. Racism, for example, is closely related to the problems of immigration, which in turn must be analysed from the point of view of the development of the countries of origin, and AIDS is closely related to the whole policy of patents and the pharmaceutical industry.</p>

The main question at issue at present is whether we support the six areas of special interest as formulated by the Commission. The answer is yes, with the proviso that communication and energy should be added to transport.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must concentrate as far as possible on those areas in which it has value added. A crucial element in this is a properly functioning government apparatus in the developing countries. If the essential tasks – maintenance of the rule of law, health care, education, infrastructure – are not effectively carried out, participation in the free-market economy is not really feasible. In my view therefore, the building up of administrative capacity should be at the top of the list of priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Even more important than strengthening the institutions as such, is the combating of abuse of power, corruption and unlimited force. The promotion of regional cooperation should also be given new impetus. It is better for us to do less very well than a great deal badly. It is a question of effectiveness. This is why the policy of the Commission and that of the Member States should complement each other. That is, it must not be a matter of Europe following the Member States or of Member States following Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The much-discussed internal coherence is also crucial to the success of this policy. In addition it is of the utmost importance that we can actually implement the priorities that we are now establishing, with the help of well-qualified staff.</p>
<p class="contents">Reducing poverty in the world is more important than increasing one’s own wealth. Development cooperation must therefore be a major component of European policy. That will only be possible if this Parliament itself also establishes clearly defined priorities and does not get carried away in amending the sound report of Mr Gemelli. The Commission’s proposals now need to be elaborated further into a clear strategy. That must also be given absolute priority by our Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission’s current approach, however, will not give rise to a fair policy because it is still dependent on the market’s operation and the rules specified by the WTO, the IMF and the World Bank, which are still unfavourable for developing countries. Liberal globalisation to promote development has admittedly been a failure. Mr Gemelli’s report quite rightly denounces the deterioration in the economic, social and environmental situation of developing countries, the worsening of poverty and the negative impact of globalisation on these countries. It advocates a review of the WTO rules so that account is taken of developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We should reiterate, however, the basic principle of a sustainable development policy. The beneficiaries of the aid should set out their development strategy themselves, with their own needs in mind. Here, however, we have exactly the reverse – the European Union gives itself the right to dictate to its partners how to use the aid in the six areas that it considers to be priorities. We must take away this fundamental ambiguity. Are we acting in the interests of the countries that we apparently want to help, or in the interests of the European Union and its Member States? Where does the European Union stop having a direct interest and where does its development policy begin?</p>
<p class="contents">Developing countries are obviously experiencing difficulties in protecting their interests within the international community. For example, in terms of health care, a court case was brought against South Africa by pharmaceutical multinationals. Brazil was condemned by the United States because it manufactured or imported cheap generic drugs for combating AIDS, a disease which is killing millions of Brazilians.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Community must make its voice heard in the international courts in order to defend the principle of potentially granting free licences to developing countries that have pressing health care problems. I am asking my fellow Members to do this by adopting an amendment that has, moreover, already been adopted by the Joint Parliamentary Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">The continued reduction of the Community budget for development, which is 1.1% smaller in the draft budget for 2002, is also incomprehensible, whereas development cooperation is one of the priorities of the Commission’s Work Programme for 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a long list of deviations from the development policy that the Commission has, up to now, been conducting. We shall therefore vote in favour of this report, since it highlights the gulf between political statements and the progress that has actually been made, even if it does not always follow our logic to the letter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I too doubt that it will be possible to halve the number of poor people by 2015. The new-liberal policies of the northern countries, which have made the rich richer and kept the poor in the poverty trap, are also shaping development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The new motto ‘Everything but Arms’ sounds fine but misses the mark. First, the arsenals are so full, as the result of arms exports from industrialised countries, including Germany, that war can be waged and will be waged with the weapons already available. Secondly, it is hypocritical of the European Union to preach liberalisation of the markets as a universal panacea while bemoaning the fact that the 48 poorest countries have been allowed to export all their products to the Union duty free since the year 2000. Thirdly, I think it is cynical of rich countries – including Germany – to encourage a brain drain from developing countries, thereby pulling the rug out from under a self-perpetuating upswing. Development policy is not just altruism, it is self interest. It is striking that areas which provide raw materials are defined as areas of interest and, according to the new NATO strategy and the rules of engagement for the future EU strike force, areas of interest can also be secured using military force. If we want a new European Union for the twenty-first century, then we need a radical change in development policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is good reason for joining Mr Gemelli in reminding both the Council and the Commission of the rules which are contained in Article 178 of the Treaty but which neither the Council nor the Commission is following. In paragraph 7 of the motion for a resolution, Mr Gemelli splendidly draws attention to the fact that there must be coherence between development policy objectives and decisions taken in the commercial and agricultural spheres, that the EU’s agricultural policy must be revised and that the EU’s markets must be opened to all goods from the least developed countries. Nonetheless, we have just experienced the incredibly embarrassing fact that, in the ‘Everything but Arms’ agreement, the EU has postponed free access for sugar right up until the year 2009 and that it has also postponed opening its markets for rice and bananas, in short the most important export goods from the world’s 48 poorest countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Combating poverty is the primary goal of the EU’s development policy. In order to combat poverty in the developing countries actively and constructively, there are a number of areas which must seriously be taken care of. There are, in particular, three very important points with which the Commission’s communication has not dealt particularly thoroughly. The Committee on Development and Cooperation has adopted a range of amendments on all three of these points, namely reproductive health, the involvement of developing countries as cooperation partners and the involvement of NGOs and civil society in the decision-making process. Bearing in mind the fact that women, and especially women of child-bearing age, are the mainstay of development and the fight against poverty and the fact that reproductive health also includes the fight against HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, it is significant that, in general, the Commission rarely refers to health, including women’s reproductive health rights, other than in an aside. It is of the very greatest importance that the EU should help combat these life-threatening diseases that are partly responsible for halting the development process. As is well known, George W. Bush has recently suspended all aid to organisations which, in any way whatsoever, offer advice on contraception and abortion. This is a step which, in the first place, discriminates profoundly against women. Secondly, it is a real threat to public health – or, rather, the absence of public health – in developing countries. That is why it is that much more important for the EU, in future, to make a determined effort in the health field. I therefore hope that the House will adopt those amendments also adopted by the Committee on Development and Cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission’s proposal represents an important step forward when it comes to presenting a more focused programme of development aid. The activity can only be effective if it is more concentrated and results-oriented. The six priority areas listed in the Commission’s report are well chosen. At the same time, Parliament’s resolution contains a number of important additional paragraphs and remarks. Parliament places more emphasis than the Commission’s proposal upon the environmental aspects of all development. Parliament highlights, for example, the fact that a large proportion of the poor majority in the countryside is heavily dependent upon basic natural resources and that the nurturing of natural resources, forests, pasture-land, agricultural land and water resources must therefore be an important component of any strategy on poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Another of Parliament’s important remarks concerns the Commission’s priority number five: transport. Parliament’s comment on this is important, namely that the focus should be broader and therefore not only be upon roads but also include access to information and communications technology, as well as to modern energy resources. Poor countries were never given any real chance of participating seriously in the development of the industrial society. There is now a great risk that large regions will end up outside the new economy that is growing up around information and communications technology. Helping to develop capacity around these forms of technology must be an important component of any development strategy. In general, there is a tendency not to attach enough importance to technology issues in combating poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Commission will be constructive in accepting the various recommendations of the Gemelli report, above all on those points where we indicate the need to look more broadly at the priorities. We shall, in any case, have the opportunity to return to these issues in connection with the budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I oppose that. In essence the international commitments that we made at the Poverty Summit in Copenhagen, are commitments between North and South. It is our social task to try to make them operational and primary education and health care play a large part in this.</p>
<p class="contents">The underlying idea is that anyone who has no chance of basic education or health care in his own country, has no chance of personal development and therefore of getting a decent start. Of course, sensible interaction is required between the Member States, the European Union, the countries concerned and civil society. On that point we have set important targets, both with the six priorities and with the priorities of the European Parliament for the 2001 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">In practice, however, that is not easy: too few well-trained people, an organisation that is not yet effective, underfunding. Still I believe that the Commission has taken an extremely important step – and the Commissioner deserves every credit for this – by putting the emphasis on the problem of poverty and coherence between it and other policy areas. Of course, the Commissioner does not have an easy job: first Commissioner Fischler wants to give the wrong food aid again, then Member States grant Mr Lamy insufficient support when he wants to give extra aid to 48 countries. But gradually you can nevertheless see that a modest step forward is being taken. I believe that in the next few months the main point will be how all those fine words will be put into practice. If these fine words can create a climate in which we can not only well formulate a broader policy together, but can also implement it, and if we support the Commission in a coherent way, we have a good chance of succeeding.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation at this moment is definitely not a simple one. Those people involved in the changes in the various services are also very uncertain about the organisational changes. It is not easy, because the people in the delegations are not there yet and sometimes the necessary experience is missing. But we must build up this side of things; if the Commissioner really shows us that he and his Commission, with the support of the Council, are taking a first step in the direction Parliament wishes, then I believe we have the opportunity to enter a new phase together. Let us not look only at all the misery in the world, but also at the positive proofs that we can achieve something together. And if people in the developing countries have a good project of their own that deserves support, then we must take that route.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to see us try to convert all that misery into a positive policy on poverty and to show that with our European help – the EU is the largest donor in the world – we can really make a difference. I wish the Commissioner every success: we shall judge him by his actions, as he will us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So are we, although we are aware that things are not going too well with development cooperation in the world, including European cooperation. For that reason we actually consider it a good idea that a new policy is being constructed. In statistical terms aid from European countries is considerable, but the number of poor people in the world has increased in the last ten years. So there has definitely not been a success in combating poverty. That is why it is a good thing that that priority should be established, with the proviso that we are prepared to acknowledge why we have failed hitherto, that we intend to do things differently in future, that a plan of action is agreed and that we are prepared to incorporate benchmarking in that plan.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that we are absolutely unconvinced that liberalisation of world trade leads to the abolition of poverty, though world trade can of course increase prosperity. But if corruption continues unchecked, if governments are not prepared to redistribute even the new wealth, then not much will be achieved. However, we must be prepared to cooperate fully with those partners that want to. Our lack of coherence has already been pointed out and I add my voice to those calling for coherence. I wonder if we can talk of coordination and complementarity if countries go on thinking that they must continue to pursue a strictly personal cultural, economic, and geopolitical approach. We are prepared, though, to give credit to the reform of European development policy, since reform is a must after so many years of inefficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should like to ask a few questions. Why is aid not concentrated to a greater extent on the poorest countries? How much will the poor in those countries really benefit? And a question to which Mr van den Berg devoted a great deal of attention: are people prepared for true partnership? Actually we have the impression that out texts still emanate to a large extent a feeling of one-way traffic, a feeling that we know so much better. Will we have any say in the expenditure of the European Development Fund? Is the Council prepared to stop intervening in concrete implementation plans? I could go on asking questions. I shall not do so, Mr President, but they are questions that preoccupy all of us here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we take that into account, we can no longer debate in a non-committal way on the Union’s development policy. We must do our utmost to make development policy in such a way that the divide between North and South is bridged. That means first and foremost great emphasis on the coherence of trade and aid. I am gratified by the attention paid to this in the Commission document and should like to express the wish that all our trade measures should be assessed on their consequences for the developing countries. In fact, that applies to other policy fields too. The creation of a special budget line is not sufficient to counter negative effects of EU policy on developing countries. I am thinking of agricultural subsidies, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to remark that I have a problem with the term “reproductive health care” in recital aa) and Section 33. I should like to hear from the rapporteur whether funding of programmes for abortion also falls under this heading. Only recently it emerged that in financing such programmes Europe was showing a high profile in contrast to the United States. When the Dutch minister Herfkens asked Commissioner Nielson for a budget for these programmes, he was given a positive answer without further ado. Quite apart from the ethical aspects involved, I do not think that it is the task of Europe to respond to every change in US policy. The European Union has its own limited political priorities and responsibilities. Such a reactive strategy does not benefit the coherence of our policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The setting up of a permanent task force to coordinate the development policy of the Union and the Member States and to strengthen the European position in international bodies, is a laudable idea. In addition, the Gemelli report adds precision to the Commission’s document on a number of important points. Information and communications technology must indeed be a major priority. The same applies, for that matter, to conflict prevention, which unfortunately is only mentioned indirectly in the Commission document.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is health policy. There is certainly an urgent need for affordable and more efficient drugs for basic developing world diseases, such as TB, malaria and sleeping sickness. The Commission’s action programme on pharmaceutical drugs is commendable but inadequate. It may encourage research into tropical medicines, but it is mainly the European taxpayer who is likely to foot the bill. A more fundamental requirement seems to me that the poorest countries should obtain cheaper licences for the production and sale of drugs against basic diseases. It is also a more fundamental requirement that an end should be put to so-called “heritage piracy”, that is, claiming patients via the heritage of developing countries by making use of the knowledge of local healers.</p>
<p class="contents">In the almost two years that I have been a Member of this Parliament I have already voted for five reports arguing for greater coherence in development policy. You won’t mind my asking today when the Council and the Commission are finally going to make this a priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Howitt (PSE).</span></span>   – Can I begin by being self-critical of this Parliament. We support the Commission in drawing up a clearer and concise set of development objectives and then produce a resolution that numbers 68 separate paragraphs in response.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, there is much in this report on which the Commission should reflect. Our objective should not be poverty reduction but poverty eradication. Integration in the world economy cannot be an end in itself in comparison with bringing the poor themselves to market. Poor people frequently depend on fragile ecosystems and therefore conservation and sustainability should be prime objectives of our policy. EU development policy should be guided by all UN international development targets and not just poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has a key responsibility, for example, in promoting access to education for all, especially girls. However, while supporting this resolution, let us recall previous statements in the Maastricht Treaty, in Horizon 2000 and then in Agenda 2000, all of which included fine statements of goodwill on development policy. The test is implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us also recall that the Commissioner’s response in this Parliament last year that a communication on coherence had to wait until the overall development policy statement had been agreed. The protectionist backlash against the ‘Everything but Arms’ proposal demonstrates only too clearly the need to raise the profile of development objectives in our trade, agricultural and other policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we will only manage to focus on poverty if we reallocate properly our use of resources. The Commissioner and his services have been working closely with me and Parliamentary colleagues in recent weeks to ensure agreement on how to deliver this through the budget. I thank him for that.</p>
<p class="contents">We are very close to an understanding which will ensure that Parliament and Commission move forward together. However, a failure will seriously undermine the principles in this development policy communication and I appeal to him from the floor of the House to continue the dialogue before we reach a set of difficult votes in forthcoming weeks. I ask him to work with us so that we can turn our mutual desires into a common commitment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such failure has left many countries poorer today. Fortunately, and I disagree with the last speaker, the Gemelli report strengthens the Commission proposals. Commissioner Nielson and his team have done a great job and Mr Gemelli’s report – an excellent report – reinforces those new proposals. The acid test will be whether the next ten or twenty years of EU aid will reduce poverty substantially – I disagree with the last speaker, we will never eradicate poverty. The aim is to reduce substantially the poverty and misery experienced by so many.</p>
<p class="contents">The Gemelli report attempts to take a fresh approach, a bold approach. Out with theory, the models which did not produce results. In with practical ideas to promote real development: development of human resources, so that indigenous people acquire technical skills; development of vocational skills for rural production, so that people can grow, harvest, process, package and sell their goods for added value with which they can then buy their education, health and homes; building capacity through transfer of technology to SMEs, promoting use of sustainable energy, application of information technology, enhancing awareness of social education, health and human rights. These are the ideas in the Gemelli report which support Commissioner Nielson’s report and good work.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, this important report should be fully approved by this House because it should improve the efficacy of EU aid. It will be a blueprint for other donors and I hope that all Members from all sides will support this report and the Commission as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Imbeni (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, I voted for the Gemelli report in committee and I will vote for it in this Chamber. I fully support the report and, like all the Members, I can find no fault with a work that I feel has been carried out conscientiously with a great deal of commitment, and with the cooperation of all the members of the Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take advantage of this time available to me to raise two or three points of a different kind. Whenever, either here or elsewhere, I discuss development or development cooperation, the question that springs involuntarily to my lips is, as some of the Members have said, "How can this be?" If we consider the situation of 40 years ago and then we look at the way things are today, we realise that the North-South divide has widened, that the gap between the poorest and richest countries is wider. How can this be?</p>
<p class="contents">We must endeavour to respond to this question or we will be in danger of never being able to make any headway when we discuss the subject. Why is it, as Mr Gemelli asked, that there are more poor people, fewer educated people and new illnesses, and that the conditions of children, babies and women have deteriorated. What are the reasons for this?</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, there is one basic reason. We talk about development policy and we talk about public resources: these represent a tiny, tiny stream flowing from North to South; but then there is a very big stream, a huge river of private resources which flows from South to North. Therefore, the problem is whether the Member States and the European Union and the other rich countries will succeed in establishing a development policy capable of promoting coherence between public and private policies. Of course, this would not mean depriving the private sector of the ultimate goal of its initiative but putting more pressure on it more than we have done thus far. This is the point. If we do not do this, then we will be like King Canute trying to stop the waves.<span class="bold"> </span>So what is the risk now, Commissioner Nielson? You know better than me: it is that, in the current globalisation and in the information society, those who are excluded from wealth are also excluded from knowledge. In other words, they are twice excluded. This is a serious risk and that is why we need to take radical decisions now, at this historic time.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue of debt and of whether our countries have made good the commitments undertaken 25 years ago to allocate at least 0.7% of their respective GDPs to development policies: well, only one country out of 15 – Sweden, which has the honour of holding the Presidency of the Union – has stood by this undertaking. We need fresh support for development policy, support which has thus far not been forthcoming, from all the economic systems in which we live, not just from the States or public institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">One last point, Commissioner Nielson: I have also read the Commission's action plan, but we are not talking about that. We requested an information campaign in Europe on cooperation policy and public aid policy. I have seen no sign of this. There can be no support for a development policy without the backing of the European public, and how will we obtain such backing if an information campaign is not staged within the European Union, not outside it? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – I could be tempted to start an information campaign here and now in the light of Mr Imbeni’s remarks about only Sweden being at 0.7% or above the ODA. In fact, there is a group of countries which actually are above 0.7%. Sweden is about 0.8%, as is the Netherlands. Luxembourg has just made it above 0.7%. Denmark is at 1.0%; Norway, not a Member, but still the closest competitor to Denmark. Norway is around 0.9%.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is fine that we have the G7. Fortunately for development cooperation we also have the G0.7. Ireland has decided to reach 0.7 at the latest in 2007 so things are moving and some of the bigger countries are, in fact, also trying to increase the level.</p>
<p class="contents">To add one more remark on this quantitative aspect: working at European level we should recognise the fact that Member States have accepted that the Commission can continue working at the level of ambition that has been defined. For the ACP countries we have the money promised for the ninth European Development Fund and for the rest of the world we also have, as part of the Financial Perspective, clarity and certainty as to the budget level for development cooperation. This is quite important, when we look around the world, that we have the availability of resources. One big element in the complex equation of what we do is to be considered stable. Member States have said that they are giving the Commission the benefit of the doubt to see if we can do this better than we used to and they are not squeezing us on funding. We have to be quite humble against that background and it is a challenge to live up to this.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mrs Sauquillo, I would just give the information that on 9 February we had a very good meeting with a whole range of different development NGO networks in Europe and at that meeting they asked us about how to organise future discussions. I can tell Parliament that I immediately accepted the idea of regular meetings on substance with the different development NGOs and this will be very useful.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I find it more important to have a substantial debate, an ongoing discussion, with Parliament than with anybody else. One does not exclude the other but it should be remembered in any discussion about the role of NGOs that this House has the legitimacy and representation which gives any opinion from here a somewhat bigger weight than any from anywhere else. This is also part of my approach in dealing with these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rod pointed out the problem of whether we or our partners are deciding what we are supposed to do. This is in any case a complex issue. We can only offer to do those things in the developing countries that we know how to do. We have had to limit ourselves to some extent because there are many things we do not know enough about to be delivering good assistance in those fields. There are some limits to what we can make our obligation and we also have to ensure that it fits in with what other donors can offer. It is not correct to say that we have designed our priorities by thinking how we could help ourselves by doing these things in the developing countries. This is simply not fair, especially when we look at the new policy and the very strong focus on poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rod also mentioned access to medicines. It should be noted that the Commission has recently taken a number of steps in the follow-up to its communication on AIDS, malaria, TB. We decided two weeks ago in the Commission on a programme of action which follows up what we did in the autumn. This actually includes some very strong ideas on opening up for a more focused attention on tier pricing and also opening up for bidding and becoming a supplier across the geography for non-OECD companies from, for instance, Brazil, India, South Africa, China which should have access to bids on all our agendas relating to malaria, TB and AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Sandbaek, the opening up for exports from LDCs has been an issue which I assume everybody is well informed about now. I listened carefully to the different evaluations concerning how Member States finally decided on Monday. There was very little doubt as to the Commission’s views and its original proposal. The Member States have now decided. I take some relative satisfaction in looking at comments from everybody outside the EU, as well as comments from Third World representatives, that they now sincerely hope that other big trading partners and players in the global trade policy discussions will now do something as good or comparable to what Europe has done. There is absolutely no doubt that Europe is now in a better position than before the LDC conference and in the effort of creating a basis for a new global round in the WTO framework. We can always discuss whether we have done our part and whether it is good enough. But what we have done is something which the others now have to match. Relatively speaking, this is very good at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Sandbaek also questioned what Europe is going to do in view of President Bush’s announcement of cutting US support for organisations involved in family planning activities. We are strongly engaged in this area and the relationship between poverty, conflict, AIDS and gender equality is so strong that we have absolutely no doubt in our mind as to the need to react strongly and immediately to the threat coming from the US Administration in this field. I announced in the UN in New York in January that Europe is able and willing to fill the decency gap and we will do that.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a misunderstanding, and I noted Mr Belder’s remarks here, that this is about abortion programmes. The reality is that the work of UNFPA, and of the International Planned Parenthood Federation, even looked at in a very narrow, yes or no perspective, is clearly a part of the solution and not part of the problem. They are reducing the number of dangerous and illegal abortions carried out in this world and not the other way around.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mrs Maes, I would say you are right that the battle against poverty is not over and has not been won. One of the reasons why development assistance has not worked is, quite simply, because there has not been enough of it. Some of it has not been good and the crazy conflicts, the problem of corruption, all these problems are there. But we are in a situation where, for once, it is reasonable to say that more of the same is part of the answer. We know what good development cooperation is and the sigh of relief, the sense of getting things in order now for the EU, reflects that fact that there is a global consensus to relate to. Otherwise we would have invented something very new and exciting which we could choose to call a wheel or whatever, but the interesting thing is that there is not really much new in what we have done. But we have become mainstream. We are hooking into the priorities and the ways of working which reflect best practice in the understanding among donors and partner countries in the south.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I feel so confident that the priorities that we have listed, the policy paper and the support it has got is strong, real stuff that we can use. Getting it done will be quite a challenge but we will face up to it.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr Howitt and Mr van den Berg I would say, on the issue of priorities, that it is pretty well established that we agree on the aims of actually being able to deliver something that more than lives up to the 20-20 principles from the Social Summit in Copenhagen for instance. Giving priority to health and education agreed and so on. But our problem, and this also comes back to what Mr Imbeni said, is strangely enough the fact that we do not know what we are doing. To some extent we do know what we are doing but we have no record of the composition of the different activities. We are not able to say how much we are doing on environment because the labelling of our different projects was never organised in such a way that we can take out the files and say, “Well, this is it”.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not able, as of now, to say how many kilometres of roadway we built last year. This is something I am trying desperately to produce – clear, tangible, real, down-to-earth statistics, telling people what we are doing. But it is all obscured by commitments and long-term programmes etc. and there is no link between the spending and the commitment. This is where we are now. So delivering, technically, in the manner that Parliament would like will require more homework than we are able to perform in a very short time. This is the core of the discussion that is still outstanding, not an issue of substantial disagreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Honestly, at the beginning I myself had some doubt as to the importance of writing the overall policy statement for development cooperation because in my view it was not really that new. Today, almost a year after we did it, I am of a different opinion because first of all the actual process of writing it and having it accepted showed that it was definitely worth the trouble and that debate was necessary to create real ownership in the Commission throughout the different services with regard to these principles. The next thing was that Member States were much more enthusiastic about having one paper covering the whole geography saying what our policy is. We never had that before. So, even if it is not revolutionary, I see a strong meaningful value in having it and certainly, as I sense in our discussions over the months between the Commission and Parliament in this field, we have real value in having this shared framework of what it is that we think about when we talk about the development policy paper. So it is valuable.</p>
<p class="contents">The next thing now is that we are going to use it and the moment is important because together with the launching of the Cotonou Agreement, the hammering out of country strategy papers for each and every one of the 77 ACP countries, we are in business, and we are going to use these principles. For the rest of the geography we are going to move from country to country applying the same rules. This is where we will be calling the bluff on the reality of the acceptance of focusing on poverty when we come to middle-income non-ACP countries and start looking at the real distribution of what we are spending our money on in these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">So, we will have tons and tons of work and a lot of political challenges to correct the course of what we are doing in the coming months and years in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Another big drama will be the actual delivery. I will continue being very open and frank with Parliament, not to reduce our own responsibility for executing the budget but rather to make sure that there are no misunderstandings as to the size of the challenge and its nature. We now have a good policy and we are fortunate to have the backing of this House for that policy. The next thing is to move forward hand-in-hand and implement it and make sure, as I have said before in this Parliament, that we change the situation from what it is today, where we can say that as Europeans we are proud that we do this, to some years from now when we should also be proud as to how we have done it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
