<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Blokland </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (NL)</span> Mr President, the report now before us deals with the directive on waste incineration and is important for two reasons: firstly for the health of people living close to waste incinerators, electricity generating plants and cement kilns; and secondly for air quality in the European Union as a whole. The main culprits are the pollutant substances sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, small particulates, dioxins and furans. When fully implemented, the European Commission proposal will cut dioxin emissions from 2 400 g to 10 g per year. The new Commission proposal is a good one, but can be improved in one or two respects.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission"s proposal for the incineration of municipal waste covers both hazardous and non‐hazardous waste. Given that there is still a Commission proposal pending to amend the directive on the incineration of hazardous waste, it makes sense to combine the two directives. The clear advantage is consistent emission standards, because the distinction between hazardous and non‐hazardous waste is based primarily on criteria applying to the collection, storage, transportation, management and processing of waste materials prior to incineration. During incineration, ‘non‐hazardous" waste may be transformed into hazardous substances which pollute the air. By and large, these are the same compounds as those generated during the incineration of hazardous waste, in other words what goes out of the plant is more important than what goes in. Clear rules are needed for what goes out, in the form of emission limits.</p>
<p class="contents">Combining the two directives will not lead to a different regime for incineration from what we have at present. It will not be the case that hazardous waste previously incinerated only in specialist plants can suddenly be incinerated in just any plant. Certain hazardous wastes have to be incinerated at a temperature of 1 100°C to prevent the formation of dioxins. Keeping these directives separate will be of no benefit at all to the environment. On the contrary, if we do not combine the directives, this may lead to less rigorous standards for hazardous wastes than for municipal waste. Amendments Nos 7, 9, 15, 18, 19, 56 and 61 are needed to make the new directive applicable to hazardous waste as well. These amendments are derived from Directive 94/67/EC on the incineration of hazardous waste.</p>
<p class="contents">The Environment Committee urges the European Commission to do its utmost to persuade the Council to adopt the common position on a single directive in June. Care must also be taken over emissions where waste is co‐incinerated. Ultimately, the same emission standards must apply to any plant which burns waste. The committee takes the view that electricity generating plants and cement kilns should be able to co‐incinerate waste, provided they meet the relevant emission standards. The new Commission proposal lays down sound rules for the co‐incineration of municipal waste in cement kilns. The same rules must apply to hazardous waste burned in them. This means that cement kilns will for a time be subject to standards which are less strict.</p>
<p class="contents">The necessary investment for cement kiln fume cleaning can be funded by the large profit generated by taking in hazardous waste and savings on fuel costs. Given that NO<span class="sub">x</span> emissions must be kept as low as possible, many plants will need a NO<span class="sub">x </span> reduction unit. These units use ammonia to remove the NO<span class="sub">x</span> . This process needs to be tightly controlled to prevent ammonia being released into the atmosphere. The Environment Committee is therefore proposing a standard for ammonia in Amendments Nos 24, 36, 38 and 41.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I hear reports that there are still a lot of incinerators which do not comply with the 1989 directives, particularly French combustion plants. These plants thus need to invest in order to meet the new requirements of this directive. One advantage is that these plants only need to make the investment once, in other words it can all be done at one fell swoop. I would urge the Commission and the European Environment Agency to be strict in monitoring compliance with the current and future directives.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, Mr President, Commissioner, in order to ensure better health for people living close to incineration plants and also to ensure better air quality throughout the European Union, it is necessary to have one directive for the incineration of hazardous and municipal waste, which provides tighter rules on co‐incineration and applies realistic standards to the emission of pollutant substances.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Jensen, Kirsten </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, waste is not an aim of production, although the amount of waste produced might well give that impression. We dump waste and we incinerate it, neither of which is good for the environment. I would like to thank Mr Blokland for the excellent work he has done on the report and the firm stance he has taken for the good of the environment. It is clear that pollution has a great effect on human health. One example is dioxins, which are a typical emission from incineration. Many women in Europe have high concentrations of dioxins in their breast milk. There is also some concern that dioxins interfere with hormones. This proposal on incineration brings the hope of a higher level of protection through a fall in dioxin emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by the Committee on the Environment combines two directives – on incineration of municipal waste and incineration of hazardous waste. The idea of combining these directives is that the incineration of waste can create a pollution problem regardless of the type of waste being incinerated. In addition, there was a risk that Europe could have had tougher limit values for the incineration of municipal waste than for hazardous waste, if we had allowed the Commission's division of the areas to continue as presented to us. There could perhaps also be a risk of cheating in the classification of waste. The Commission's proposal on municipal waste mentions kinds of waste which to the best of my belief are hazardous, such as waste oil and hospital waste.</p>
<p class="contents">Emissions from waste incineration, such as sulphur, nitrous oxides, dioxins and soot, should be treated in the same way, regardless of what is being incinerated. There has been a great deal of concern about co‐incineration and the cement industry, and as a compromise we have chosen to maintain the three categories: dedicated incinerators, co‐incineration and cement kilns. But the point is that they should all comply with tighter emission standards. We will not allow a loophole for a kind of waste tourism which could undermine the economy of the dedicated incinerators. So co‐incineration, including in the cement industry, must comply with the requirements for tough emission values.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me stress that we are still in favour of treating different kinds of waste differently. That is why critics who say that the combining of these two directives will lead to less protection for the environment are mistaken. You only have to read the text to see that different demands are made within the framework of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should also follow up the waste strategy which has been adopted, where we stress the importance of recycling and reuse. If there was a requirement for the pre‐sorting of waste through waste management plans, we could save raw materials and have less air pollution.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Florenz </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I wish to thank the rapporteur for his dedicated work. In 1994, I had the good fortune to be rapporteur for the directive on the incineration of hazardous waste. At that time, we proposed some extremely strict limit values, as I still believe we should be doing today. Results now show that of the 15 Member States of the European Union, 13 have not incorporated the strict values decided upon at that time into national law. Two countries have transposed them, with the result that these countries and these companies have invested a great deal of money and will probably have to do so once again if we reach different conclusions today. I therefore believe that it is absolutely right to set strict values, but that we have to do this seriously, and that obviously the concerns about health, which I fully share, must also be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not, however, consider it to be a particularly good thing that some countries and therefore some incineration plant operators abide by the rules and obey the laws in Europe and have spent a great deal of money, for example in France, but in my own country too – and I would be happy to show you this, Mr Blokland, after all you do not live so far away – while others have done nothing at all, and I do not see why, with these new values, some of which you want to halve, these others should now be able to save themselves the cost of the first investment. That is a competition policy which I cannot support. I therefore believe that we should adopt a cautious but strict approach here. That is why I am very much in favour of the best available technology being used. But Mr Blokland should please define the ‘best available technology" in Europe for me. It will not do for some to define it in one way, and others in a different way.</p>
<p class="contents">That is also why I have criticised the issue of measuring methods. If we prescribe figures here, then we must also prescribe how we measure, when we measure and where we measure. Here too, there are enormous differences in Europe. Co‐incineration is a good thing, if it is carried out properly – I support it. But different values must apply here, because there are two combustion components: on the one hand the combustion of oil or waste, and on the other hand that of ores. There must be a rule for this. The old mixed formula was not too bad. The present Commission proposal is more stringent, and I support it because it makes sense.</p>
<p class="contents">If we go along with Mr Blokland"s proposals, I believe that in the long term the sensible process of co‐incineration in cement kilns will be banned, and that does not make any sense at all, precisely from the point of view of environment policy, because they will still have to use gas or coal, and you want to ban that too. Proper co‐incineration in accordance with strict standards is therefore the right way forward. In this context, I would like to see not only standards but also measuring procedures, because we do not have any of these in Europe. In this respect, we are back in a federalist system where everyone does what they want. That is precisely the point which I should like you to bear in mind, Mr Blokland, and which I would ask you to reconsider.</p>

That is of course an enormous quantity. So we shall need a lot more incineration plants. Incineration must not be the ultimate aim. As we all know, the priorities are first to prevent waste and then reprocess or recycle it, and only then to incinerate it. But the bottom line is that we shall have 50 million tonnes of waste to deal with in the year 2000. I think the Commission proposal makes sense, but above all, we as Liberals welcome Mr Blokland"s proposals to tighten things up. I have two comments to make.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur that the two incineration directives should be combined, that is to say non‐hazardous waste and waste which may be hazardous must be combined, but only of course on condition that Amendments Nos 7, 15 and 18 are adopted, and I hope the European Commission will respond positively to those amendments. If they are adopted, existing legal loopholes will be closed once these two directives are combined.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I turn to the cement industry. Everyone has been talking about the cement industry. Everyone has been busy visiting cement kilns. At the moment, the cement industry processes a lot of waste, hazardous waste. It is highly profitable for cement kilns to co‐incinerate waste. And I agree with Mr Blokland that this additional income and the savings on fuel costs can be put to good use to fund cleaner working methods. The cement industry too must comply with the strict emission standards. I do not think derogations are appropriate, especially in view of the fact which Mr Florenz mentioned just now, that this standard of 500 mg NO<span class="sub">x</span> per cubic metre is already met in the Netherlands, Austria and Germany. Why not encourage the other countries to emulate these three countries which have already met the standard?</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cabrol </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the incineration of waste has already been the subject of various European directives, the most recent of which is Directive 94/67/EC, which deals in particular with the incineration of hazardous waste.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a Council directive concerns the incineration of waste that is not covered by this directive, that is, non‐hazardous waste, such as urban waste and certain other types of hazardous waste that are excluded from the scope of the previous directive.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall not dwell at length on the numerous amendments that were tabled, but we would like to protest strongly against those tabled by the rapporteur which seek to merge the two directives on hazardous and non‐hazardous waste into one. The rapporteur bases this proposal on two arguments. The first of these is the desire to ensure an administrative simplification of the texts, and therefore have one directive instead of two. As Mr Florenz said, the directive on hazardous waste has not yet actually been transposed into the legislation of all the Member States, and in amending it, by merging it to some extent, we would ensure more confusion rather than simplification.</p>
<p class="contents">The second argument put forward is that the limit values, the quantities of emissions from residues, are very similar. In actual fact, it is not just the limit values that are important. The handling, management and treatment of both categories of waste – hazardous and non‐hazardous waste – vary a great deal. A genuine waste treatment policy requires selective sorting and treatment, rather than an anachronistic and anarchic mixing of waste. If waste were to be mixed in this way, it would result in hazardous waste being incinerated in incinerators used for household refuse. This is all the more likely since some Member States have equipped themselves with oversized incinerators for household refuse, and they would be tempted to make use of this extra capacity by filling the incinerators with hazardous waste. Such a course of action would be unacceptable, because it would represent a serious risk to the health of the people living in the vicinity and to the area that surrounds the incinerators.</p>
<p class="contents">The text presented by the rapporteur is quite vague about the need for and the specific nature of the controls for incoming waste, as well as the specific nature of its reception and storage, staff training, and so on. This is to say nothing of the difficulties for manufacturers of monitoring the treatment of their waste and clarifying their responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish by saying that the proposal to merge the directives on hazardous and non‐hazardous products contained in the rapporteur"s text seems to be completely unreasonable and a source of grave danger. We should also like to point out that if we fail to distinguish between the specific nature of co‐incineration plants, co‐incineration would be banned, which would be catastrophic for the industries involved and the fossil fuels saved as a result of using this waste as fuel.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are against certain amendments that call for controls that are too stringent with regard to emission standards. These measures would require significant and costly investments but would not have any real benefits for the environment.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lannoye </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, on behalf of my group, I should like to thank the rapporteur who has produced an excellent piece of work. We have complete respect for the political line he is proposing with regard to both co‐incineration and linking the two directives. However, we believe that some of our amendments that have been rejected by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection are essential and I should like to say a few words about them.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I would like to mention the problem of discharges into the aquatic environment. It is abnormal not to demand zero discharges into the aquatic environment. The European Commission already proposed such a measure in its draft directive on the incineration of hazardous waste in 1992. That being the case, we might wonder about the reasons for a backwards step in this area and the fact that the main political groups in this House have not supported our proposal. In fact, all the evidence points to the need for such a stringent measure. I would point out in particular that when Mr White"s report on the framework directive on water was adopted a few months ago, we agreed to eventually – and by 2020 at the latest – make a zero rate the requirement for discharges of any dangerous substance into the aquatic environment. An initial step would consist of adopting a measure to that effect for plants which cause as much concern as incineration plants.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect I should like to mention is the problem of dioxin. We know that dioxins represent the main problem posed by incinerators, whether they are used for hazardous waste or household waste. Less than a year ago, the WHO published new recommendations on the acceptable daily limit values of substances that can be ingested by human beings. This means that 10 picograms per kilo of body weight would be reduced to a minimum of 1 picogram – that is, ten times less – and a maximum of 4 picograms. I would point out that in many European countries, and particularly in my own country, Belgium, these limits have already been exceeded.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore take the view that for new plants we must aim from the outset for dioxin emission limits that are below the detection limit. Naturally, this requires some improvements to be made to the older plants, but we need to set ourselves a target of zero dioxin emissions.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pinel </span> <span class="bold">(NI).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, it is clear that incineration capacity requirements are constantly increasing, but it is wrong to automatically present the burial of waste as an anti‐ecological concept. In fact, there is no such thing as beneficial incineration and harmful discharges.</p>
<p class="contents">Incineration which is not controlled properly is just as dangerous – and even more so – for our health and for the environment as the random dumping of waste. An example of this is PVC, which is completely inert when it is buried, but which releases highly toxic by‐products of chlorine when it is burned. It also contains dioxins and a long list of molecules whose effects on the human body we are not even fully aware of.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, one thing is clear. By its very nature and for reasons of profitability, incineration conflicts with recycling. In order to function properly, whether it be technically or financially, it needs to burn more and more fuel. This is obviously not the way to combat the use of excess packaging or save raw materials.</p>
<p class="contents">Conversely, technical burial is entirely in keeping with a genuine recycling policy, all the more so because there are not many possible sites and they can therefore only be used for a limited period of time.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we do not look on energy recovered from incineration as recycled energy. It is a matter of making the end waste products viable, and nothing more than that. For example, the energy conserved when recycling a plastic bottle is ten times greater than the energy saved when incinerating the same plastic bottle.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Blokland"s report is an excellent piece of work, and we shall be voting in favour of it, but incineration must remain first and foremost a method of processing final waste, once all the possible operations for sorting and recycling it have been carried out.</p>
