<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Danielsson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome this opportunity to comment on a topical and important issue. On Friday 16 February, as we all know, American and British warplanes attacked military targets outside Baghdad. As we also know, the background to these attacks was said to be an increase in Iraqi anti-aircraft fire aimed at the British and American war planes patrolling what are known as the no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq. The Americans and the British have made statements emphasising that the actions were taken in self-defence, as well as the fact that they were routine and must not be seen as an escalation of, or change to, the policy. We also know that several countries have been critical of the actions.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN Security Council briefly discussed this issue in informal consultations on 20 February when statements were also made reflecting expected positions. The UN’s Secretary-General has also commented on what happened and said, ‘Obviously, the timing is a bit awkward for the talks I am going to have on 26 February’. That was the Secretary General’s reference to the high-level talks which have just now been concluded between the UN’s Secretary-General and Iraq’s Foreign Minister and which therefore took place last Monday.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency notes that there are different views within the European Union about the basis in international law for these military actions, including the maintenance of what are called the no-fly zones. We know that one Member State took part in the actions and that other Member States have complained about what happened. At the same time, we know that the common foreign and security policy implies a common position.</p>
<p class="contents">The common foreign and security policy is being developed gradually at the pace decided by the Member States and will obviously be that much stronger if the EU’s Member States hold a common view. At the same time, we must respect the fact that there are issues we view differently. In this connection, I would nonetheless take a positive view of the dialogue embarked upon in New York between the UN’s Secretary-General and the Iraqi Government. We obviously hope that the talks can help break the deadlock and that Iraq will make up its mind to cooperate with the UN and the UN’s weapons inspectors on the basis of the current Security Council resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">It might also be noted that the American Secretary of State, Colin Powell, has recently come out in favour of an overhaul of the American policy of sanctions. Mr Powell has also expressed the hope that, within a couple of weeks, the United States might present its ideas on such an overhaul in more detail.</p>
<p class="contents">The conditions under which the Iraqi people have to live, together with lasting security and stability in the region, are the most important issues for the Council when it comes to the latter’s policy towards Iraq. The Council is at present investigating the EU’s opportunities for making humanitarian and cultural contributions, especially to the ‘oil for food’ programme, within the framework of the UN Security Council’s existing resolutions on Iraq. It is important for the Iraqi Government to cooperate if it is to be possible to implement such a programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Security Council Resolution No 1284, adopted on 17 December 1999, allows for a suspension of the sanctions, provided that the Iraqi Government cooperates fully with the UN’s inspectors responsible for disarmament in Iraq. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not wish to go over the same ground so let me just say that I agree fully with the assessment of the situation which we have just heard. I agree very much with the distinction, which I thought was nicely made, between the first efforts to create a common foreign and security policy and the ambition that many have for a single foreign and security policy. I also agree very much with what was said about the differences between Member States on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a few words about the wider picture. I would like to say a word or two about the sanctions and the efforts to improve the miserable lot of the Iraqi people. We all agree that the stalemate over the Iraq sanctions and the suffering which that stalemate has caused is extremely unsatisfactory and we should do all that we can to avoid it continuing.</p>
<p class="contents">We must bear in mind, however, that the sanctions were put in place originally for a purpose. As a result of the Gulf War the UN Security Council established through a number of resolutions that Iraq should dispose of all weapons of mass destruction and that this should be verified by UNSCOM, the UN Special Committee with responsibility for dismantling Iraq’s arsenal of weapons and maintaining a monitoring programme to ensure that it was never rebuilt. Until this was achieved it was agreed that Iraq would be subject to various economic sanctions though exceptions were allowed for essential humanitarian supplies. Although they could have done it straight away, back in 1991, the Iraqi Government did not take steps to set up an arrangement with the UN before 1995, when Iraq agreed to the ‘oil for food’ facility as set out in the UN Security Council resolution that year. The ‘oil for food’ facility has since then been extended every six months with improved conditions. In principle the ‘oil for food’ facility should provide basic humanitarian aid without recourse to outside assistance. However, the management of the programme and cooperation with the Iraqi Government in implementing it, is not effective. There is no shortage of funds available to the Iraqi authorities through the ‘oil for food’ facility to buy food and medicine for their people. It is the Iraqi regime which has chosen not to do this, not to use the opportunity offered to them by the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of sanctions, worsened of course, when UNSCOM was expelled from Iraq in November 1998 and it took a year to agree to a common approach to deal with this problem. The UN Security Council adopted Resolution No 1284 in December 1999 which allowed for a suspension of the sanctions against Iraq following arms monitoring. However Iraq did not accept the resolution and resisted any cooperation on verification of dismantling of weapons of mass destruction. Iraq has not therefore complied with the UN Security Council resolution, a point made I recall in the European Parliament’s resolution of April last year.</p>
<p class="contents">We have now reached an important point in our dealings with Iraq. The sanctions which have been in place for 10 years have clearly not achieved their desired objectives. They are perceived to be exacerbating the humanitarian condition of the Iraqi people. The recklessness of Saddam Hussein and his regime has resulted in malnutrition, ill-health and widespread degradation of the physical and social infrastructure of the country. This policy will have consequences beyond the present which will be borne by future generations of Iraqis.</p>
<p class="contents">These dire circumstances have brought into focus the plight of the Iraqi people and the problem of dealing with a regime which is as ruthless as it is reckless. We all agree that there is clearly a need to re-think the whole Iraqi issue and to identify the best course of action to take. The new US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, has said as much.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not lose sight of the basic objective. We must make sure that we will never again give Saddam Hussein the means to pursue aggression against his neighbours, or indeed against his own people. The sanctions remain in place but we should look at how we could make them more effective in pursuit of the basic objective. We want to focus on the Iraqi leadership and their weapons, not on the Iraqi people and Iraqi society. The international community should explore the possibility of replacing the present sanctions regime by, what is called in the jargon, “a smart sanctions programme” and other appropriate measures whilst seeking to ensure that weapons of mass destruction are not manufactured.</p>
<p class="contents">The suffering of the Iraqi people is very much a concern of the European Union. Since the Gulf War in 1991, Europe has been the major donor of humanitarian aid to Iraq with over EUR 250 million. For the last two years, the European Union has provided assistance of between EUR 8 and 10 million on an annual basis. For 2001 the amount may be somewhat higher at around EUR 12 million. The assistance, through ECHO, focuses on provision of clean drinking water and health facilities, with special emphasis on institutions for the handicapped, for orphans, and with emphasis as well on street children. The ECHO assistance is provided through international non-governmental organisations and through the appropriate UN agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the resumption on February 26 and 27 in New York of the dialogue between the United Nations and Iraq. Although no significant breakthrough has been reported from the two-day meeting between the UN Secretary-General and the Iraqi Minister of Foreign Affairs, it is encouraging that there is an agreement for further talks. Signals should be sent to the Iraqi Government of the importance of continuing the talks and of reaching an agreement with the United Nations that allows the improvement of the economic and humanitarian situation in Iraq, while at the same time respecting the various UN resolutions on Iraq, particularly on the question of weapons of mass destruction.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, beyond the polemic to which these military interventions may have given rise and quite apart from the fact that the allies might have been consulted, I believe that what our debate today is really about is how, on the one hand, to pursue a coherent policy of respect for international law by the international community – and I am thinking here of the twelve resolutions approved by the United Nations Security Council – and, on the other hand, to take account at the same time, as Mr Patten said, of the suffering now being endured by the Iraqi people.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the position from which I should like to tackle this problem, but not without first laying a very secure foundation. I believe it has been wisely said that no-one has caused more suffering to the Iraqi people and Iraqi society than the country’s present regime, and I believe it would be correct to recognise too that no-one has derived as much personal profit from this suffering as the Iraqi regime itself.</p>
<p class="contents">From this perspective, I should like to address a number of questions to the Commission and the Council. Mr Patten has stolen a march upon us this morning by suggesting a line of thought we might pursue concerning the way in which we should proceed, and I should like to ask the Council of Ministers whether it thinks that an embargo is or is not essential in order to achieve the objective – which my political group shares one hundred per cent – of preventing Iraq from acquiring weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that – as Mr Patten has just explained – the Commission and the European Union as a whole can have a very clear conscience in the sense that we are the major donor of humanitarian aid to Iraq, but I believe that we should carry out a serious analysis and ponder the results of the ‘oil for food’ programme, given that many Arab countries believe that the Iraqi authorities are committing fraud to the tune of more than USD 1 000 million per year.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to ask the Presidency if it thinks that the problems created by the embargo might instead be solved by replacing the system of United Nations sanctions with an international verification committee focusing, as Mr Patten said, upon the flow of cash and arms. I share the view expressed by the Presidency that the easiest solution of all would be for Saddam Hussein’s regime to apply United Nations Resolution No 1284 which, subject to cooperation with the United Nations, would in fact enable the trade embargo to be suspended for a period of 120 days, subsequently extendable for further periods. Saddam Hussein’s regime has obviously been defeated without, however, having been destroyed, and I therefore think that to say that these military interventions are the acts of an imperial power against an unprotected people is a rather simplistic interpretation. That said, I believe it is also legitimate to ask ourselves whether these actions by the international community and this policy of sanctions are really helping to weaken Saddam Hussein’s regime or are instead helping to reinforce it, because everyone knows perfectly well that, in order to consolidate their power, dictatorial regimes of this type invoke the spectre of foreign enemies.</p>

The sooner he disappears, the better things will be. However, democrats and democratic countries must discuss in a worthwhile manner how to achieve this aim. Some very legitimate doubts have been expressed as to the timing and even the legal basis of the recent bombings of Iraq. The United Nations Security Council must make a clear statement on this issue. The Security Council, rather than one or other of its members, even if they are permanent members, is the only legitimate authority that can determine which coercive steps are to be taken against a country.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue remains as to how effective the current economic sanctions are. It must be acknowledged that the economic sanctions have not destabilised Saddam Hussein, something that Commissioner Patten has indeed just confirmed; they have instead caused the Iraqi people very great harm and suffering.</p>
<p class="contents">I also drew this conclusion from a recent hearing on Iraq before our Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy. I was extremely impressed, particularly by the speech by Mr Viénot, who is the President of Caritas Europa. He concluded that, to put it briefly, the sanctions are catastrophic from a humanitarian point of view. Politically speaking, they are ineffective. Legally, they can be called into question. Morally speaking, they are intolerable. I can only hope that this respected Caritas representative will not be let down by the Members of the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats in the European Parliament and that the Council of the European Union will, at its level, draw the necessary conclusions from this speech. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He went out into the street and saw his friend’s body. When he put his hands down he saw that he was dead. He found that he was touching almost a piece of jelly. The Iraqi soldiers had broken every single bone in that man’s body.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about the Iraqi people let us not forget the 750 or so Kuwaiti prisoners of war still inside Iraqi prisons. We do not know what has happened to them. We have to keep looking.</p>
<p class="contents">I visited Iran. I have talked to the families of prisoners who are still in Iraq from the Iran/Iraq war of 1981-1988. A million people were killed because of Saddam’s assault and predatory efforts inside Iran. Maybe 25 to 30,000 prisoners from Iran are still inside Iraqi prisons. Let us not forget those people either.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been to Kurdistan. I have seen the results of the chemical weapons. Do not let us forget the half million Kurdistani people whose lives have been taken away from them by Baghdad since they were invaded in the north with chemical weapons in August 1988 shortly after Saddam was driven out of Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been to the marshlands of Iraq many times, the antique heritage of the world, the marshlands of Mesopotamia. I have seen year after year the steady drainage, the reduction of the water, and the fact now that over half a million marsh dwellers, reaching right back beyond the beginnings of civilisation of our world, have now had their livelihood, their lives destroyed, their place removed from under their feet by the Iraqi marsh drainage. And why? So that Saddam can get his tanks closer to Iran and closer to Kuwait so that he can invade more easily next time.</p>
<p class="contents">The no-fly zones have been effective in protecting the lives of at least some of those people but we should do more; we must do more. It is within our power to restore the marshes of Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">This man is a monster. When we talk about the no-fly zone, when we talk about the collateral damage, do not let us forget that point. In 1989, he earned USD 15 billion from oil and he spent 13 billion on arms. In 1999 he earned USD 16 billion and at least, legally, he could not spend any on arms.</p>
<p class="contents">I recommend that we look at taking the food distribution of the “oil for food programme” out of his hands, that we look at tearing down those dams that have wrecked the marshes and that we work to set up a criminal court where he can be tried at least in abstentia. When we talk of a policy on Iraq, Commissioner Patten spoke about the recklessness of the Iraq regime. It is not recklessness it is ruthlessness. This man is indeed a modern Hitler.</p>

Let us start with the legal basis, which is extremely dubious, to say the least. My group is in favour of maintaining the no-fly zone, but without a new statement by the Security Council, there is no legal basis for the present air strikes. The air strikes are wrong because they are counter-productive: Saddam is the hero of the Arab, and also the Palestinian, people, and this will only make it more difficult to find a solution to the Middle East problem.</p>
<p class="contents">That does not mean that my group questions the fact that there <span class="italic">is</span> a problem or that nothing should be done about it. We share the view that Saddam still forms the main threat to stability in the Middle East and that Iraq is a country where human rights are being violated systematically and on a massive scale.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that Commissioner Patten has already mentioned that he is in favour of changing the current regime. We could talk at great length about this issue. After ten years of sanctions, it is not Saddam who has suffered the most, but the Iraqi people. Saddam has applied extreme cynicism to benefit his own PR at the expense of his own people. I am therefore pleased that most of you appear to be in favour of changing the sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">The embargo on weapons and strategic goods must remain in place and might even have to be tightened, whilst the current regime must be replaced by what are known as smart sanctions. However, we must continue to insist on weapon inspectors being admitted. We should not allow the regime to keep developing biological, chemical and even nuclear facilities. As the previous speaker has already mentioned, we should not forget Haladja. The international community must have access to Iraq and be able to control arms development in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the action to be undertaken, I would like to urge the Swedish Presidency to implement the resolution of the European Parliament of November last year, which requested an ad-hoc international tribunal to be established for Iraq. In this way, Europe would be able to play an autonomous role in world politics by exercising a restraining influence on the United States without giving in to the demands of Iraq and Saddam. It will also be able to exercise a restraining influence on Great Britain which believes that, through its action, it can act as a bridge between America and the European Union but which, at this rate, will be more of a hindrance than anything else. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wurtz (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I was one of the Members who had requested that a debate on the bombings of Baghdad by the United States and Britain be included on the agenda of this sitting. I did this in the same spirit as when, at the Conference of Presidents, I suggested that Mr von Sponeck be invited to attend the European Parliament. He is the former coordinator of the UN oil for food programme who had the courage to resign from his post in the light of the appalling consequences of the Washington-inspired strategy in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">My conviction, which is shared by everyone in my group, is that the European Union has everything to lose if it is tentative or indecisive in this matter and everything to gain if it takes a clear stand. I believe that the latest air raids on Iraq illustrate with startling clarity what is at stake. I believe that the main thing at stake is our approach to international relations. These air raids on Baghdad are, in essence, totally illegal, deeply counter-productive and ethically unacceptable, as were the previous raids that have taken place since Operation Desert Fox in 1998, which is recalled with some horror. They are in direct opposition to the principles that we stand for. None of the UN resolutions provides for this sort of use of force. These continued bombings have enabled Saddam to get rid of any international inspection of disarmament measures. Lastly, whilst Saddam Hussein is continuing to tighten his control on Iraq and his neighbours, most of society, on the other hand, is utterly devastated and is suffering terribly.</p>
<p class="contents">This alone should be enough to put the European Union on the offensive so that it can help Iraq escape its shameful, dramatic downward spiral. If it fails to do this, the Euro-Mediterranean partnership might as well be dead and buried – it has already been heavily compromised.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I believe that the nature of relations between Europe and the United States, led by George W. Bush, is also hanging in the balance following this new series of bombings of Baghdad. Let us remember that Iraq is one of the ‘rogue’ states, which the US Government uses to justify its antimissile defence programme. The new US Administration undoubtedly wants to test the vulnerability of the EU by playing the Iraqi card again, in order to quash or, at the very least, to soften Europe’s opposition to the National Missile Defence programme, that irresponsible strategy championed by the White House.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the third and vital thing to be endangered by the European reaction to the British and US bombings is the credibility of the European project itself. Basically, this is because it is unusual for one of the leading Member States, one of the pillars of what some call the vanguard or hard core of the future Union, particularly in terms of security and defence, to commit itself instantly to support of Mr Bush. Today, the political affinity that existed between Mr Blair and Mr Clinton is no longer even applicable. This can no longer be termed the ‘third way’ – these actions blatantly overstep the mark. We have already said this about the Echelon affair. Nonetheless, at a certain point, choices have to be made. It is impossible to be in two places at the same time. What a poor example to give to the leaders of the applicant countries, who are encouraged to make gestures to the more powerful countries rather than to contribute to a common project with their neighbours and partners! Poland has already given Washington its support, but it is virtually the only country in the world to do so. Is this what we really want to see as we prepare for enlargement?</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, Mr President, although I welcome the odd criticism made here and there in the European Union about the bombings, I believe that we need a much more willing attitude from Europe towards the whole Iraqi issue, which could be achieved by providing, if need be, a kind of enhanced cooperation by most of the Fifteen, including considerable support to the democratic opposition in Iraq and the lifting of the embargo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Iraqi Government will have to abide by the rule of international law. So too might I suggest should the United States and Britain.</p>
<p class="contents">As an admirer of the ancient civilisation of the Iraqi people, I find it hard to accept that the population has been allowed to suffer so much in the economic interests of others and been attacked both from within and without.</p>
<p class="contents">First there was the Iran/Iraq war; a war sponsored by the West in the main. Iraq was given technology and weapons to pursue that war. US President Reagan was famously quoted as saying about Saddam Hussein “he’s a sonofabitch, but he’s our sonofabitch”. The technology for chemical weapons flowed to Baghdad. The Western military/industrial complex had a field day and poured its weapons into Baghdad. Kuwait encroached on Iraqi oilfields and the US Ambassador gave the Iraqi Government the impression that the US would not object to an invasion. That was an enormous misinterpretation by the Iraqis and they suffered the consequence.</p>
<p class="contents">It was right to impose sanctions in the immediate aftermath of Iraq’s expulsion from Kuwait, but it is certainly not right to continue them in their present form. It is estimated that 1.5 million people have died since the introduction of sanctions. The former US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, considered 5,000 children a month as a price worth paying to get rid of Saddam Hussein. He is still there. But all those children who have died are not. What did they know about sanctions?</p>
<p class="contents">Sanctions hurt the citizens, as has been said already here. They do not hurt the elite of the state on which the sanctions are imposed. The Islamic world is outraged, and rightly so, at the genocidal policies being pursued in Iraq. They are storing up resentment and even hatred among the people in the Middle East and the Islamic nations throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">UN sanctions are applied with a ferocity that tears apart the fragile consensus of the region. It also plays into the hands of Saddam Hussein who has remained unchallenged for the past thirty years. He is more popular among the Arab people now than ever before. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dupuis (TDI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we should, first of all, thank the Americans and the British for showing such a sense of responsibility. Mr Wurtz, who believes that we could and should entrust any decision regarding this matter to the Security Council, has, if I may say so, a bit of a nerve. Since we are aware that two other members of the Security Council, namely the People’s Republic of China and the Russian Federation, are currently supplying arms to Iraq, it is, in my view, irresponsible to say the least, to think that we can take decisions in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">However, though we are grateful to the US, we should not let this prevent us from considering a new form of sanctions but we should certainly not lift them. I believe that these sanctions can be effective, as General Powell himself acknowledged. I would also like to say that I am astonished that, apart from Mr Wurtz, no one has mentioned American interests today. Mr Wurtz presented us with an excellent analysis of American interests, which would justify the US strategic defence programme. Everyone can draw their own conclusions from this. In other debates, however, we have certainly always attacked the Americans for their underlying economic interests in this region. Today, I suspect that there are possibly one or two Member States – perhaps one of them is your own, Mr Wurtz – who might have similar interests, the same sort of interests that you most strongly condemn where the US is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">If we wish this discussion to be in any way constructive, I believe that all these issues must be laid out before us. We must also go back to the heart of the problem, as Mrs Nicholson has done, which is the regime in power – we should have no illusions about this either. We know how difficult it is to overthrow this sort of regime, how hard it is to introduce a system of sanctions. After ten years, we have some experience of the sanctions imposed in 1991. I believe that we must consider a new form of sanctions, but it will be difficult to remove the military element from them, and we will certainly even have to step up the military pressure, as we will certainly have to consider increasing the size of the no-fly zone over Kurdistan. It is precisely the lack of protection of various Kurdish regions of Kurdistan that has brought about the recent waves of Kurdish immigrants arriving in France. These no-fly zones must be extended, and so that their protection is guaranteed, we will unfortunately have to use some military means that, currently, only the British and the Americans seem to be able to provide.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also have to consider putting more pressure on the People’s Republic of China and on Russia to put an end to their military collaboration with Iraq, but, above all, we will also have to consider a different type of bombing which consists of bombarding Iraq day and night with information, using satellite broadcasting and bombarding the whole country with leaflets, so that the citizens are aware of the international community’s policy but, more importantly, so that they are aware of Saddam Hussein’s policy, which allows him to misappropriate most of the aid that he receives from the oil for food programme. We must, therefore, have an information policy that provides the Iraqi people with knowledge, so that this regime can finally be overthrown. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If this is done in front of a ruthless enemy, it can have disastrous implications. I would like to outline my view on the divided European reaction to the recent American/British action against Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq. With regard to their Iraq policy, the EU Member States deserve criticism on three critical points.</p>
<p class="contents">To begin with, how can the CFSP’s goal be reconciled with the disturbing lack of consensus in the most recent Iraq crisis? I fully share the opinion of the German commentator who noted last week: ‘A European foreign policy? How wide the gulf between ambition and reality still is has been demonstrated in the way the EU’s Fifteen handled the most recent Iraq air attack: the Brits joined in, the Germans ran for cover and the French launched a verbal attack on Washington.’ And who had the last laugh? Saddam Hussein, of course!</p>
<p class="contents">It is exactly this Iraqi President who, after two lost Gulf wars, remains the main destabilising factor in the Middle East. After all, Saddam is forever fanning the flames of the unholy conflict in Palestine/Israel, the very region, incidentally, where the European Union claims to be making efforts to resume the peace process. How do the Council and Commission reconcile this ambitious goal with the conflicting European signals which are being sent out in the direction of Baghdad, where a self-confessed opponent to the same peace process is continuously stirring up Arab sentiment and is even threatening to destroy the Jewish state?</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude with my third, and probably most fundamental, criticism of the divided European policy on Iraq. Saddam Hussein is being backed by the EU in his efforts to erode the UN resolutions on Iraq. And what is at stake? The risky revitalisation of Mesopotamia no less. Instead of reminding Saddam’s regime of the crucial arrangement whereby the UN would supervise the dismantling of his weapons of mass-destruction, including production capacity, in exchange for the lifting of the sanctions, the Europeans, the Russians and the Chinese have chosen to enter into a pact with a despot who has turned his country into an aggressor externally and a republic of terror internally.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore urgently call on the Council and Commission, in proper consultation with the Bush administration, to arrive at a consistent European policy on Iraq. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra put a number of questions to the Council, for example concerning the sanctions. I believe it is extremely important that we should have a common view of the purpose behind the international community’s action against Iraq. The purpose is to make Iraq comply with those instructions and commitments that are mainly to be found in Resolution No 687, which is of course the major and basic resolution governing the international community’s relations with Iraq. It is there that our demands upon Iraq are stated. Those demands do not, for example, include any change to the government in Iraq – that is a matter for the Iraqi people – but Resolution No 687 states very clearly what is required if it is going to be possible to lift the sanctions against Iraq. That is the basis for our entire discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra went on to raise a number of very relevant questions about whether we need an embargo against Iraq and about whether consideration might be given to changing the sanctions regime currently imposed upon that country. Issues he mentioned included those relating to an international verification committee and to the currency flow.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the framework of the reforms being worked on by the UN Security Council, there is intensive discussion of the effectiveness of sanctions as a tool. The European Union is actively participating in that discussion. These are difficult issues. For example, the issue is being discussed of whether time-limited sanctions ought to be introduced so that, right from the time that sanctions are first imposed, it is determined when and under which conditions they are to be lifted. As was mentioned here in the debate, the issue is also being discussed of whether what are called smart sanctions<span class="italic"> </span>should be introduced which, by being more specific and more clearly directed against those whom they are intended to affect, would be aimed at minimising the suffering of the civilian population.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is important that the European Union should actively participate in that discussion. I also believe it is important that Parliament should contribute to this important discussion about how we get the world to comply more readily with international law.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lagendijk addresses the issue of bringing Saddam Hussein before an international tribunal. Clearly, this may appear to be an attractive idea in itself, in view of what that man has done. I would say once again, however, that I believe it is important that any action against Iraq should be taken within the framework of the UN’s resolutions. To act outside that framework would, I believe, damage all of our common efforts in the long run. These efforts – and on this issue I can see that this House is completely unified – are aimed at ensuring that we get an Iraq which can again be incorporated into the international community. That is, unfortunately, impossible with the current regime.</p>
<p class="contents">I note what Mr Lagendijk has to say about the European Parliament’s resolutions from last autumn. They are important. They also serve as an important guide for subsequent actions on the part of the Council. I look forward to a continued exchange of views as to how we can strengthen international law even where Iraq is concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Brok (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have the impression that the bombing of military targets in Iraq has once again shown the continued extent to which the European Union and in particular, the Council of Ministers have no voice in the matter of foreign and security policy. We must also point out that the way in which the United Nations operates, whereby actions are only implemented when the Security Council has reached an appropriate decision, would mean that, in order for UN resolutions to be executed and implemented against a regime like that of Saddam Hussein, dictatorships such as China would have to give their consent in each individual case. As a result, it becomes impossible to take action against dictators such as Hussein.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it is not right that the Security Council should decide in each individual case. Rather, cases should be handled in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. I believe that it is imperative to make a distinction in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">We all agree that Saddam Hussein is a mass-murderer who is carrying out a renewed rearmament programme in nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, that it is in the interests of the safety of the European Union and the world to prevent this, that this also lies within the framework of the UN resolutions and that, at the same time, the protection of minorities in southern or northern Iraq also falls within the remit of these resolutions. Action against military targets must therefore be permitted, particularly since aerial inspections are otherwise impossible due to the risk presented to the aircraft themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">However, a great debate is raging in the region which may ultimately culminate in the elevation of Saddam Hussein, a prolific violator of human rights in this region, to hero status in the Arab world. Therefore any military action must take this situation into account and consequently it is also necessary to weigh up the situation; what can be done on the one hand to benefit the civilian population, to promote their survival and to ensure the provision of medical supplies and food, and what can be done, on the other hand, to ensure the fight against this regime. For this reason, Colin Powell’s proposal that there should be modified types of sanctions should be welcomed. I believe that we should constructively and actively participate in defining these. This must involve using every instrument to destabilise Saddam Hussein’s regime. At the same time, however, we need to make a distinction in this regard so that the burden is not borne solely by innocent people in Iraq. For this reason, that is for humanitarian reasons, we should attempt to adjust our actions, but at the same time to use these as an instrument to conduct the PR battle currently underway in this area and designed to promote our interests in enforcing international law, democracy and human rights in this region.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we must put this policy into action in such a way so as to enable Iraqi people to move away from the threat of Saddam Hussein’s regime and into the free world and also in such a way as to prevent Saddam Hussein from becoming a hero of the Arab world. In this respect, therefore, I feel that a heavy military operation against Saddam’s military installations and the curbing of the rearmament programme is the correct path to take. At the same time, however, I feel that the Iraqi people should be given the chance to survive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This observation is made repeatedly and Iraq is further proof of it. Yet, everyone in Europe is united in condemning Saddam Hussein’s regime. Past experience has taught us that embargoes or blockades never work. The evidence of this can be seen in Baghdad, where the current regime is strengthened with each passing day, where each air strike is shown to have no effect other than to divide Europe somewhat further. Whilst Saddam Hussein may have cause for celebration, the Iraqi population, his people, are sinking further each time into crisis and poverty. Hospitals can no longer provide care. The number of deaths is rising at an alarming rate. Schools can no longer remain open. Most of the population is illiterate. Finding food is an achievement. Access to information is controlled. In short, everything is done for, apart from Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p class="contents">So, let us admit it, the current measures are unsuitable; the air strikes are excessive, given the situation in Iraq – they change nothing and still solve nothing, here or elsewhere. We need to change the content of some UN sanctions now, if we are to help the people of Iraq. They need to be clarified and included in a timetable specifying when they can be lifted and that is as soon as we see that, under UN control, the Iraqi regime is respecting its commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">Humanitarian aid should be encouraged, cultural and commercial exchanges should be developed, freedom of circulation for people and, thus, for ideas should be re-established, access to information should be restored, as these are all ways which could lead the Iraqi people down the path to freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">For the time being, however, the Iraqi people can only consider how they are to survive against the West, who they hold accountable for all their problems, because of what they witness but mainly because they are manipulated. Nowadays, we can no longer make peace by waging war. The Iron Curtain and the Berlin wall were brought down by information provided by the international community and the consequent need for freedom. Let us put an end to the isolation instead of continuing with the blockades. Our principles of freedom and democracy will cross frontiers all the better when conditions conducive to dialogue are restored. Let us move in this direction. The Iraqi people will then be able to find the path to freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sure that we all agree. The problem is how to do it.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment the CFSP is a mixture of national attitudes and European attitudes and the particular subject we are debating today of course only involves one single Member State of the European Union. So how do we provide the democratic legitimacy when we are all involved?</p>
<p class="contents">Two or three weeks ago there was a Conference in Stockholm of the chairmen of the defence committees of the fifteen national parliaments and the European Parliament to debate exactly this question – how to exercise democratic control over European policies and foreign affairs and defence. Although no conclusion could be reached in a single day, I can tell you that they have set up a working party between the chairmen and intend to meet again and to come up with a conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament has proposed various mechanisms for introducing this legitimacy. We have proposed setting up an interparliamentary body between members of the NATO Assembly and our Foreign Affairs Committee. Another proposal has been a joint interparliamentary body between national parliaments and Members of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much welcomed the statement just now from the President-in-Office saying that this Parliament must play a role. But what I would greatly appreciate from the Presidency is a statement of how precisely they plan to do this, because in the various treaties we have had recently and the European Councils, there has been no suggestion of how this might be achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Changing, but certainly not abolishing; there are also reasons for abolishing it, according to Mr Salafranca, but abolishing the sanctions against Saddam Hussein today would mean declaring him the winner in his own country and throughout the Arab world and holding him up as the victor in this psychological war, just at this sensitive time in the war between Israel and the Palestinians, and this would make his dictatorship even more permanent and even more brutal.</p>
<p class="contents">So we ask ourselves: what of the children, the people who are suffering in Iraq; what is happening to them? They, Mr President, are victims of Saddam Hussein and not of the sanctions, as Commissioner Patten said rather more diplomatically, and I fully agree with his analysis. They are the victims of a despot who – and I refer to Kofi Annan’s denunciation – deliberately withholds millions of dollars earned from oil and does not spend it on food and medicines, in order to starve his people and, as is happening here today, to arouse our sympathies and our solidarity and to transform every child that dies into a propaganda weapon; a despot who exports food from his own hunger-stricken country to neighbouring states to increase his prestige, who finances the Palestinians, who go to demonstrations with his portrait, who gives ten thousand dollars to every family that has had victims in the <span class="italic">Intifada</span>, who builds himself huge palaces – I saw them with my own eyes when I was in Iraq a month ago – right on the ruins of Babylon.</p>
<p class="contents">Iraq is the victim of Saddam, not of the sanctions. But the sanctions must be changed; agreement on them is weakening and Saddam Hussein is taking advantage of the divergences of opinion in the West on this point; he is taking advantage in order to split the West even more. The economic sanctions must be eased but those on arms and technology must be tightened, at least until Iraq allows the UN inspectors free access. Iraq is in fact rearming with chemical, biological and probably even nuclear weapons, and the danger it poses is becoming greater all the time.</p>
<p class="contents">This latest air raid on Baghdad should, in fact, have been better prepared, with an attempt to gain consent from neighbouring countries and perhaps also consultation of the Western allies. However, it was a useful signal, I think, to make Saddam Hussein understand that, even with the new American administration, the vigilance will be maintained and, we hope, even increased, and I would even go so far as to say that we can already see the first fruits of this action. In connection with this, I should like to direct a question to the President-in-Office of the Council: do you know whether, during the current mission in the Middle East, Colin Powell obtained Syria’s agreement to United Nations control on the use of the oil pipeline linking Iraq to Syria? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, Colin Powell says that the US administration is considering a system of sanctions which will hit the Iraqi regime rather than the Iraqi people. These last few days have nonetheless served as a reminder that this is precisely what President Bush senior said ten years ago when the theory was floated that, thanks to the sanctions, the tyrant of Baghdad would be overthrown by his own people.</p>
<p class="contents">With a few exceptions, the Arab states nowadays share the position of those countries that are more concerned about the risk of extending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict than about applying sanctions against Iraq, as well as the position of those other countries which wish to resume relations with Baghdad. And all this exactly coincides with the new Anglo-American bombing. Frankly, I believe that, with the increasing bombing of Iraq, comes the further radicalisation of what is already radicalised public opinion in both the Arab states and Palestine. We should also remember that, at the same time, a favour is being done to Saddam who – at least according to a particular conception of morality and politics – is being morally and politically strengthened both within his own country and in the opinion of the majority of Arabs. This may lead to Arab public opinion’s being characterised by a growing sense that Arabs are enduring a war on two fronts: on the one hand, the United States against Iraq and, on the other hand, Israel against Palestine. I hope that such public opinion does not believe that there is an Anglo-American war against Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to say that it is not only in the Arab countries that the West is considered to be responsible for the prolonged suffering of Iraqi children. Many in the West, including myself, think the same. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should more properly be entitled “How can Saddam Hussein be controlled more effectively?” What a tragedy for the people of Iraq to have a ruler such as Saddam Hussein, a brutal dictator who has exploited the wealth of the country for his own ends and ambitions and oppressed his own people. Saddam is not just a threat to his own people but to a wider area, including our friends and allies in the Middle East, and potentially our own citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Estimates vary about the success of Iraqi efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction and delivery systems but few analysts doubt Saddam’s determination to acquire such a capability and many expect him to achieve some success within the next four years. There is then a real and current threat over which some degree of international control is exercised, really by two means: the economic sanctions and the maintenance by Britain and America on behalf of the international community of the no-fly zone covering about a third of the territory of Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">The sanctions are controversial in that Saddam has been able to persuade some significant elements of international opinion that it is sanctions that are the cause of the distress of the Iraqi people rather than his own actions. Sanctions will be suspended when Saddam complies with certain conditions, primarily in relation to the monitoring of his weapons of mass destruction capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, it is right that the sanctions regime should be reviewed and that they should be focused more precisely. The main purpose of the no-fly zone is twofold: to prevent Saddam using his helicopter gunships and other aircraft against the Kurds in the north and the Shia marsh Arabs in the south, and to carry out reconnaissance, bearing in mind that there are no UN inspection teams operating in Iraq at the moment. Ground targets are only engaged if there is a threat to coalition aircraft. There is no bombing campaign against Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an element in this House which seeks to distort all these facts. We heard this during the hearing on Iraq the other day in the Foreign Affairs Committee, and there is a subtext of anti-Americanism. But I am rather reassured by the overall tone of this morning’s debate. We need to close ranks to ensure that whatever new regime is put in place for sanctions is not breached by those seeking commercial or political advantage. If EU Member States really have aspirations to play a greater role in security policy, then let them contribute to enforcement of the no-fly zone, and ensure that whatever sanctions regime is imposed is rigorously enforced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are simply to restrict Saddam Hussein’s ability to kill and terrorise his own people. The no-fly zones are in support of Security Council Resolution No 688 which demanded an end to his brutal repression. They are justified under international law as a legitimate response to prevent a grave humanitarian crisis. Without them, we would have seen the continued brutal repression of the Shias and the Kurds. We would have seen once again as we saw in 1991, the use of helicopter gunships and aircraft to murder, to gas and to displace. So the no-fly zones are vital in avoiding humanitarian disaster. Yet those enforcing the no-fly zones have themselves come under constant attack. Since January 1999 there have been 1 200 attempts to target aircraft with surface-to-air missiles or anti-aircraft weapons. This year alone, there have already been more attacks than there were in the whole of the year 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">The coalition aircraft are legally authorised to respond to these attacks in self-defence, and they have done so entirely in accordance with international law, attacking only those units which are threatening them. We cannot allow the pilots who are trying to protect humanity to be themselves endangered. That would be irresponsible, and would also be a betrayal of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on sanctions, we should not forget a simple message: the sanctions are not causing the suffering of the Iraqi people. Saddam Hussein is causing the suffering, as he has done from the day he came to power, and it is entirely in Saddam Hussein’s hands to lift those sanctions, by meeting the requirements that the UN are making on him. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
