I would like today's debate to be another step forward along the road we are to travel in 2001. It is a road which will clearly be marked by a number of events and priorities, which I shall mention shortly, but, most importantly, it will be taking us already – and I am tempted to say at last – in the direction of the Europe of tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission of which I have the honour of being President has always asked to be judged by what it does. That is why it is extremely important for me that cooperation between the Commission and Parliament, and the Commission's fruitful relationship with the Member States in the Council, lead to substantial, practical results. This is why I hope that this annual debate will become a valuable forum for free, open, common debate in which we can discuss our successes and problems in a constructive atmosphere, with a view to accomplishing the projects which are of real concern to the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that, on these occasions, the tradition is for the Commission President to present a detailed review of the policies implemented, but I am sure that nobody will object if I depart somewhat from that tradition and confine today's discussion to our main priorities for 2001 and to the longer-term question of Europe's future.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not dwell on the last 12 months. When I stood before this House, a year ago, I announced the four strategic objectives that my Commission had set itself: one, to promote new forms of governance on a European scale; two, to stabilise Europe and consolidate our influence in the world; three, to set new economic and social priorities; and four, to improve the quality of life for all.</p>
<p class="contents">With a view to improving the quality of life of the European citizens, we published our White Paper on Food Safety and a proposal for a regulation laying down requirements and basic principles in the area of food safety. We also proposed to set up a European Food Agency, which will come into operation next year.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to this, we proposed to set up a European Air Safety Authority and prepared new, tough legislation on maritime safety following the <span class="italic">Erika</span> disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">To promote a new social and economic agenda for Europe, we put forward detailed, ambitious proposals to the Lisbon European Council. As a result, the EU now has an integrated strategy that will allow it to become the most dynamic, competitive knowledge-based economy in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The key to stabilising our continent is our strategy for enlarging the European Union. Throughout 2000, the Commission resolutely pursued accession negotiations with the candidate countries, and we also launched the public debate on a genuine migration policy.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Finally, to promote new forms of European governance, we set to work on a White Paper which is scheduled to be published before the end of the summer.</p>
<p class="contents">Essentially, ladies and gentlemen, my Commission delivered on its commitments during 2000, seeking clear, simple solutions. Today, before this House, I want to say how proud I am of my staff, for whom 2000 was a year of far-reaching internal reforms. My fellow Commissioners and I are aware that we have made considerable demands of our colleagues, not only in terms of workload, but especially because they have had to adapt to changes in working methods and to taking greater individual responsibility for their action.</p>
<p class="contents">Internal reform, while clearly not a political objective in itself, is nevertheless one of the Commission's ongoing tasks for 2001. Indeed, every organisation of every kind has to adapt continuously to a changing world. That is what we are trying to do right now. However, no administration can be expected to cope with so much stress for very long, however genuinely necessary the changes are. I am therefore determined to bring the internal reforms to a swift conclusion, in a climate of consultation and transparency, while fully complying with all our undertakings.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's political decisions are set out in the work programme for 2001 which was adopted at the end of January and immediately forwarded to Parliament. The key elements of this programme are structured around a number of major events. These are not a random collection of disparate items. They are linked by the constant guiding principle that our action must meet the practical needs of Europe's citizens and protect their interests. The debate on the future of the Union, which I shall be saying more about shortly, is also based on that principle. But first, let me describe the Commission's major initiatives for this year in greater detail.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, all our work since the Lisbon Summit and in preparing for Stockholm has had one constant aim: to create and preserve the conditions in which we can leave to our children a dynamic, just and prosperous Europe whose citizens have the latest skills, good jobs and an active role within our Community.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the Commission's input, the Lisbon Summit last year produced a strategy for achieving this goal. Next month, at Stockholm, on the basis of the Commission's reports, the European Council will review progress to date – the areas where we have forged ahead, but also the areas where we are lagging behind.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the key goals of our strategy is to restore the right conditions for full employment. We are already seeing some encouraging progress: last year, 2.5 million jobs were created, more than two thirds of which taken up by women. This is a truly high figure, although it will clearly have to be repeated over a number of years to resolve the issue of unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in some sectors, as our Stockholm report makes clear, progress has been far too slow. European leaders therefore need greater political will and to be aware of the urgent requirement to fulfil the promises made in Lisbon on, for example, the Community patent, the Galileo programme and the liberalisation of gas and electricity, programmes which are vital for our future.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor, as yet, do we have a coherent strategy on lifelong learning. What we need now, therefore, is fresh energy to accelerate action in some key areas. We identify 10 key areas in our report for Stockholm, in particular – although I will not list them all – frontier technologies, integrated financial markets, and the new skills and mobility provided by the new European labour markets. At Stockholm, I will urge the Heads of State and Government to seize the opportunity and not to rest on their laurels: we need to push ahead resolutely with the reforms already agreed upon in Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">To give you an idea of our report, here are three important recommendations it contains. Firstly, to eliminate barriers that discourage people from entering the work force or restrict the mobility of workers. To do this, we need more efficient tax systems, more investment in education and lifelong learning and, lastly, specific measures to address the skills gap. We also need action to guarantee the portability of professional qualifications and pensions between different sectors and countries. Secondly, also by way of example, we need to accelerate economic reforms. Services represent three quarters of our gross domestic product but there is still no genuine internal market in this sector. Thirdly, Europe must be at the forefront of innovation if we are to be able to create a European Research Area. I do not need to say any more about this.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there has to be a stable balance between our policies to ensure that all Europe's vital assets, our economic assets but also our social capital and our environment, are preserved for future generations. If we are to get that long-term balance right, we need a strategy for sustainable development. The Commission is working on just such a strategy, which will be discussed at the culmination of the current presidency, the Gothenburg European Council. We are aiming to translate the rather abstract concept of sustainable development into practical, comprehensible terms and concrete, visible action which will affect the citizens' working and everyday lives. It will therefore be a strategy for innovation and increased investment in that area, which will also exploit the opportunities provided by frontier technology: a strategy fixing prices at a level which better reflects the costs of environmental degradation.</p>
<p class="contents">A long-term political project of this kind clearly requires effective prior consultation. In order to promote this discussion, Madam President, I have already written to you, proposing a major debate in the European Parliament on these issues. The views expressed by this House will, indeed, be valuable to the Commission in developing its strategic proposal for the Gothenburg Summit, a proposal which, I repeat, must be practical, or it will be a weak summit.</p>
<p class="contents">We intend, moreover, to stimulate lively discussion not only within the European institutions but, more generally, with our citizens, by issuing a consultative document. Our aim is to achieve an all-encompassing, coherent, long-term orientation for the management of European affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the Union's relations with the rest of the world: we are receiving clearer signals from our citizens every day, telling us that if we really want to harness the potential of globalisation for the good of us all, we must be willing to take decisions in this area as well. In the short term, this means including a new round of trade negotiations in our priorities for 2001, although that is not wholly up to us. Indeed, a new round would be the best way of strengthening the multilateral system with further trade liberalisation and new rules that meet the demands of civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also negotiate in crucial areas such as competition and investment, and focus more sharply on the interests of developing countries. Indeed, the developing countries are the key element in the whole process. Trade policy cannot just be concerned with the interests of the business world: we have to ensure that it benefits the world's poorest peoples. We therefore call upon Parliament and the Council to accept, this month, our proposal to allow the 48 poorest countries in the world to export everything but arms to the European Union quota free, tariff free across the board.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, I received a telephone call from the United Nations Secretary-General, who has just returned from the Middle East. At the end of the conversation, he specifically asked me to call upon you and upon the Council to proceed with this project, advocated by Commissioner Lamy, the entire Commission and the presidency, which, despite all the problems it will bring us and our countries, does represent a change. We are also ready to cooperate with the new US Administration and Congress on trade issues. Naturally, President Bush has his regional priorities, but I know that he and his colleagues understand the importance of the multilateral system.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, another major milestone on the road ahead is, of course, the introduction of euro notes and coins at the end of the year. As soon as it takes the form of coins jangling in our pockets, the euro will become a tangible everyday reality for the citizens. Over the next ten and a half months, the Commission will be working hard together with the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies to complete the preparations for this extremely important event: a historical event which will have a permanent effect on the lives of Europeans. This will require a huge and – in particular – unprecedented organisational structure. However, not everyone welcomes the idea of giving up an old, familiar currency for a new and unfamiliar one, and there are bound to be some teething problems. We must therefore make every endeavour to make the public understand the advantages the euro will bring us all and that it will be the symbol of a vigorous, modern economy. In any case, it is already the symbol of a typically European project, carried through on time, as planned, by Europe for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to conclude by returning to the issue I raised earlier: the debate on the future of Europe after Nice. Despite all the limitations of the Treaty of Nice that we have already discussed, it does, to my mind, have two merits: firstly, its very existence, which is no small achievement. As far as we are concerned, there are now no further obstacles to enlargement. Secondly, it opens up the broader, post-Nice debate on the future of the European Union. As I said to you in January, and in line with the declaration annexed to the Treaty, the first stage of the process will be one of "open reflection". This will enable the December European Council to initiate a second stage, which I have termed "structured reflection", leading ultimately to a brief, decisive Intergovernmental Conference. I am convinced that this is the right approach and there seems to be widespread agreement on it.</p>
<p class="contents">What I want to talk about chiefly today in this Chamber is the first stage, because it relates to 2001. The open reflection stage, which we have already entered, is, in my opinion, crucial for three reasons: firstly because of the paradox that the words and actions of the European citizens are making more obvious every day, that Europe is increasingly necessary but also seen as increasingly remote. We therefore need a debate which will involve everybody and all levels of society if we are to relaunch and complete the great project of establishing a European Union. Secondly, the disappointing outcome of the Nice Conference. What was missing at Nice was, above all, an in-depth discussion in the preparatory stages about what we want from Europe and for Europe. The talks went on and on, but they never touched on the fundamental issues. This debate can be postponed no longer. Thirdly and finally, there is an increasingly widespread impression, which I share, that the method common in the past of constructive ambiguities, of leaving things unsaid, is no longer appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">We have now entered a new stage in which the basic issues are staring us in the face and cannot be ignored. Since 1981, first the Community and then the Union have been going through a continual process of adjustment, restructuring, enlargement and adaptation. For almost a whole generation, a constant earth tremor has been shaking our institutions, and it has swept away the landmarks familiar to the public in our countries and sown doubt over the wisdom of our decisions and of the direction in which we are headed. We have taken decisions of historic dimension which will unite the continent. It would be both absurd and dangerous to build this unity around a vague agreement, around fuzzy undertakings and conflicting hidden agendas. So what public debate are we talking about? It has to be a constitutional debate on the fundamental nature of the Union. I trust the judgment of our citizens and their elected representatives provided the debate is pitched at the right level: this is not about the curvature of cucumbers or Euromyths and distortions but about genuine issues, issues of concern to the citizens, most of whom want Europe to do more, not less.</p>
<p class="contents">The questions the European citizens ask are not about cucumbers, but we have to admit that they are not chiefly about the institutional debate in which we have been engaged since Maastricht and which is now – we cannot deny it, especially after Nice – going round in circles. I think the real problem is that, somewhere along the way, we lost the thread of the agreement between our Member States on which direction we should be taking. Our disagreements are less and less easily hidden behind the hair-splitting protocols and the complex formulas. These disagreements arise partly, I feel, because the debate has been poorly conducted in recent years. Too often it has been an argument purely about power. We must get to the heart of the issues.</p>
<p class="contents">There is bound to be some disagreement on the ultimate purpose of the Union for, thankfully, we are all different, but I find some consolation in the thought that we can at least agree on the essentials. This brings us to the heart of the matter, to the fundamental questions I want publicly discussed. For example: are we all clear that we want to build something that can aspire to be a world power? In other words, not just a trading bloc but a political entity? Are we all aware of the vital issues at stake here and upon which the future of our communities depends? Do we realise that our nation States, taken individually, would find it far more difficult to assert their existence and their identity on the world stage? Another question: how much social and economic solidarity are we prepared to show one another? Not just to prevent monetary shocks or to prevent the internal market breaking up but because we believe that our peoples should help one another, taking part in a joint enterprise. And again: are we prepared to show the same solidarity when it comes to internal and external security? Then: what sort of environment shall we leave to future generations? Finally: what are the most effective ways of enabling the European peoples to protect and uphold the values of democracy, solidarity and justice?</p>
<p class="contents">To my mind, these are the sorts of questions we should ask in this year's debate. They are specifically political, not institutional, and it is in answering them that we will decide the level at which we wish to live and work together.</p>
<p class="contents">By opening this great debate on these subjects, I am not asking you or the citizens to embark upon a discussion with no fixed parameters. It is not a case of ‘back to the drawing board’. We are talking about a Europe that has achieved many great, useful things during the 50 years since the Community and Union were founded, a Europe that has achieved peace and prosperity and, most recently, established the single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, these are the questions that you, together with the members of our national parliaments, and our governments, must start to ask and answer. Let me be clear on this: I am not confusing the public debate, which must be completely open to civil society, with democratic representation. European and national parliaments have the legitimacy of being elected. When the time comes for a structured debate leading to concrete results, the method we follow must take account of that.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall then be entering the second stage, following Laeken. No one now imagines that this stage can proceed without European and national parliaments being closely involved, firstly because Europe is not just a matter of cooperation between States – it is also about relations between peoples and has long been so – but also because the deadlock between nationalistic positions will not produce the vision and imagination needed for a fundamental rethink of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">After Laeken, once suitable preparations have been made, the structured debate will have to be based on a formula which unites all the key players – the European Parliament, the national parliaments, the governments and the Commission – a formula which will be increasingly refined by Laeken itself and the subsequent European Councils in 2002. It is from this ongoing dialogue between the European Council and the convention, or conference or assembly or forum, whatever we choose to call it (let us not get into the dangerous territory of terminology) that the right questions would be able to emerge. Finally, all the institutional implications could be drawn from it.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, then, there can be no question of limiting the scope of this exercise to the four topics listed at Nice. I fully endorse what Mr Michel Barnier said to your Committee on Constitutional Affairs, namely that what must emerge from the post-Nice debate is a coherent, durable design for our enlarged Union. The Commission will, of course, contribute its share of the work and take a number of initiatives. It has already done so by proposing, in particular, the reorganisation of the Treaties, which is already on the table. It will do so again by helping Parliament and the successive Presidencies to organise the "deeper and wider debate" called for in the Nice declaration. It will also do so through the White Paper on governance.</p>
<p class="contents">Do not expect the White Paper to deliver a ready-made definition of the competences of the Union and the States. It will not take up positions on constitutional questions. What it will do is help by proposing ways of genuinely decentralising the administration of the Union and ways of applying our common policies at the most appropriate level, that is, as closely as possible to the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is sometimes said – and I tend to agree – that European integration was the most important event in the second half of the twentieth century. And with dependable regularity, at every stage of European integration, certain critics have decried the project as an impossible, or even laughable, utopian dream. When the European currency was first conceived, comments were made which I cannot bring myself to repeat. Instead, at the end of 2001, we shall see coins and bank notes being issued. We have got to where we are, and we should be proud of it.</p>

But we trust that, in coming years, this debate will be held in the autumn of each year preceding the year to which the programme being debated relates, as agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">I must, however, address a few words of severe criticism to the Council: ladies and gentlemen, I think it is scandalous for the Council of Ministers and the presidency not to be represented here during the Commission's presentation of its programme of work. It is absolutely unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">But it shows where the shortcomings lie. The Foreign Ministers are off trotting the globe, which I have nothing against, after all it is their job; but, at the same time, they are also responsible for European affairs. Clearly, European policy is no longer foreign policy and making Foreign Ministers responsible for European policy – and their absence is proof of this – is no longer in keeping with the times and we need to change these arrangements. We need people in government dealing solely with Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Which is why I call for a Council of Ministers for Europe who will always be free to attend Parliament. It takes more to shape Europe than a few high-flying speeches by Foreign Ministers; it means working day in day out on Europe as our project for the future. Which is why we want structural changes in the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We were delighted to hear that the President of France, Jacques Chirac, has followed Commission President Prodi in calling for a public debate on the post-Nice process. We want a broad, public debate on the future of our continent and, Mr President of the Commission, we as a group – I cannot speak for the whole of Parliament – are on your side, we are your allies, when it comes to the future of Europe. We want to strengthen you as a Community institution, because the Council appears at present to be unable to muster up the strength to act as a Community institution and representative of the common interest.</p>
<p class="contents">You referred to the European Parliament's involvement in this process. We should like to be more specific. Our family of parties, the European People's Party, passed a resolution at its congress in January of this year recommending a reform conference modelled on the convention, i.e. involving the European Parliament, the national parliaments, the government, the Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We want Stockholm, then Gothenburg, and finally Laeken under the Belgian Presidency to send out signals in this direction, so that this sort of conference can start work in 2002. This conference should form the cornerstone of broad public debate in Europe, which should be given a structured start at this sort of conference.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment concerns asylum and immigration policy. Mr President of the Commission, we call on the Commission to make a common asylum and immigration policy a focal point, because national policies are obviously not getting us anywhere. Only a common policy can resolve these difficult issues. The Head of State of an important country – I refer to the chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany – said that, if we agree on an asylum and immigration policy in principle, we will be able to switch over quickly to qualified majority voting. I call on the Commission to push ahead, so that, once we have reached agreement in principle, we can switch to qualified majority voting on asylum and immigration policy as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">But we also call on the Commission to take account of the consequences in its initiatives. We get the impression, for example when it comes to reuniting families, that your concept of the family is somewhat ill defined. We call on you to restrict reunification to the core family, otherwise the repercussions will get out of hand. Asylum and immigration policy as a whole must be a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">My third comment concerns Europe as a financial centre. As you all know, we shall have a common European currency in our pockets as of 1 January 2002. This historic event – as the President of the Commission rightly pointed out – will change Europe. But we must also improve Europe's competitiveness by enabling small and medium-sized enterprises to invest, because that is where the jobs are created. I think we need to step up our efforts here.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the enlargement of the European Union is concerned, we are committed to welcoming the first wave of members to the European Union by 2004. Mr President of the Commission, I call on you to conduct a public information campaign, so that we can convince our voters back home that the European Union needs to enlarge and that it is in the historic interest of Europe to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">My last comment is this: we want a strong, democratic Europe which has the ability to act. Mr President of the Commission, let us work on that together. We shall support you in strengthening the Community institutions. We call on the Council not to be stand-offish and to make its contribution to Europe as our project for the future. If we work together, it will succeed. But the Council needs to play its part, now that the Commission and Parliament have moved ahead.</p>

The biggest potential for the Union to cement a state of peace in our immediate surroundings and to acquire new economic partnerships lies with Russia and the Ukraine. Unfortunately, this is not yet visible in the work of the Union. We like to find excuses for it, saying that these countries themselves still do not have the right economic conditions or political will to find suitable forms of cooperation. But we have already invested a considerable amount of money and resources in cooperation with the southern Mediterranean region, and we are still waiting for the results to materialise there.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need a long-term approach to the East. I did not notice any mention in the President’s general report of our relations with the East, which perhaps was not possible within the framework of a broad overview. In recent years, the Union’s investment in Russia in terms of finance has been one tenth of what is being spent in the Mediterranean region. Just half of what has been spent on cooperation in the Mediterranean has gone to all countries of the former Soviet Union. This is out of all proportion with the relative importance of these two neighbouring regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Forms of economic cooperation in particular must be concrete and feasible. Waste water from St. Petersburg and the surrounding area, with its population of some nine million, is flowing either untreated or via waterworks that function badly into the shallow, relatively salt-free and ecologically vulnerable Gulf of Finland. This has already resulted in harmful and lasting changes to the balance of nature, and the situation is continuing to deteriorate. President Prodi called for environmentally sustainable development. A sewage works for the Leningrad region would be one tangible and excellent example of a Nordic area of cooperation, and one which should now be got under way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, on behalf of my group, I wish to welcome the Commission’s work programme for 2001. This complements the legislative programme which, on my group’s initiative, Parliament requested as a condition for approving the Commission’s appointment. </p>
<p class="contents">The programme has not been short on proposals: there are 485, 155 of which date from last year and which have been carried over. It must be pointed out that last year 50% of the programme was successfully concluded. You do not need to make many proposals; instead, you should try to bring those that you do propose to a successful conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out, once again, that an agreement was in place, establishing that the programme would be presented in January, following consultations with Parliament’s committees. It is to be hoped that next year you will be more successful in meeting the deadlines. </p>
<p class="contents">I repeat that the crucial question raised in this programme is undoubtedly the involvement of Europe’s citizens in the European project, which is the mark and the essential prerequisite of its success. This means that together we must address the issues concerning our citizens, such as the economic and social agenda, which we shall be discussing in March, food safety, the introduction of the euro as the cash currency, and the fight against organised crime, not forgetting the Millennium Round. I wish to state that my group firmly supports the Commission’s everything but arms initiative, which will enable the 48 poorest countries in the world to export a limitless range of products. These are the key aspects of the programme. </p>
<p class="contents">We have, nevertheless, been the target of criticism, which we must accept and address. One criticism that has been made concerns the way in which the bureaucrats in Brussels have dealt with the mad cow issue. I think that here too we must defend the Commission and Parliament and say that for several years we have done our duty, we predicted this crisis and we must continue to insist not only on the investigation into those responsible, but on the need to respond to the concerns of our fellow citizens. Creating a single market is not just a matter of deregulating and of eliminating rules that protect citizens, in a quest for limitless profits. Creating a single market is also about endeavouring to guarantee essential services and also, in a context of greater competition and freedom, to do so in a civilised way. This point is worth remembering, because it appears that at the moment, the only aspect being discussed is the virtue of deregulation and not the virtues which must also feature in a civilised society. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to governance, Mr President, what is required more than a reflection, which is currently very fashionable and rather ethereal when it comes to new forms, is to take up the tried and tested democratic practices which enable us to understand the messages of Pericles, 2500 years ago, for example. I would ask you, instead of speaking to us in very general terms, to put forward a specific proposal in this context of reflection on the debate, in which the Commission, on the basis of the work by the University Institute of Florence, proposes treaties that are simplified, simple and comprehensible. We need proposals that will save President Havel from having a suitcase full of treaties, protocols and annexes in his office. This is what we need. We also need a Commission proposal on the distribution of competences and on how the Charter can be incorporated. This means talking about everything, in other words, putting forward a very wide-ranging proposal. Mr President, I would like you to make fewer generalised appeals to civil society and to speak more with us, its elected representatives, both in the European Parliament and in the parliaments of the Member States. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I think that what is crucial this year is not to stage a cosy, round-table discussion, or some kind of chat show; what we need to do when we reflect is to see what procedure and what method we should be using. Here, Madam President, I feel I need to make an observation. We regret the fact that no Member of the Council is present. Nevertheless, we do not feel that it is good parliamentary practice to allocate five minutes extra to the European People’s Party in the person of Mr Poettering, because he will have to thank those Members that voted for there being a question to the Commission this month rather than to the Council, as we ourselves had proposed and as it seems will be done in March. This is a fair parliamentary debate and we are seeing a situation in which the terms of the debate are being falsified and the allocation of speaking time between the groups and Members rendered meaningless. We therefore believe that the Council more than anyone should be represented here, as we proposed, in order to explain under what terms it drafted the Annex IV Conference, so that it is neither playing to the gallery nor launching some kind of spontaneous or Soviet-style trial with no legal basis. We therefore feel that it is extremely important, with regard to the structural reflection mentioned by President Prodi, to call for his last proposal to be enacted. In other words, there must be a forum, a conference or a convention with the participation of the Members of the European Parliament, the Commission, the Council, governments and also members of the various Member State parliaments. We need such a conference, not only to discuss the issues, but also to make proposals that can finally be decided on and resolved. </p>
<p class="contents">I shall end, Madam President, because I have run out of time, by saying to the Commission, which is equipped with the necessary machinery to make proposals, to do so. We will then be able to strengthen an alliance that we consider to be absolutely essential to taking the debate firmly forwards and to providing solutions for the future of European integration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cox (ELDR).</span></span>   – Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ‘empty chair’ of the Council, colleagues, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Prodi and his colleagues in the Commission on the considerable progress that has been made in the past year, in particular the work that has been done on reform, which is not one of the high political priorities of the Union but is, nonetheless, one of the inescapable institutional requirements. On behalf of my group I salute the progress which has been made there.</p>
<p class="contents">We note with particular concern the Commission's report of last week – the pre-Stockholm report – about the Lisbon process. Although we have set the very high aspiration that within a decade we should become the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, we are moving towards it at a lesser pace than ought to be the case. I do not exclude Parliament from this, I am not a sore loser but I was part of the minority which lost in the postal services liberalisation proposal. We are all in this together.</p>
<p class="contents">I am reminded of a story which is told in the United States about the famous Mayor Richard Daley, who was mayor of several Chicago administrations. In launching one of them he gave a speech and wanted to talk about new plateaux of achievement. But he made a mistake, as we are wont to do when we read our speeches quickly in politics. He committed his new administration to achieving ever-higher "platitudes" of achievement! It seems to me that we must ensure that is not the commitment we bring to Lisbon, rather that we really drive forward. There is a message for Stockholm that our commitment is real and deep and must be prioritised to deliver.</p>
<p class="contents">Progress on giving real credibility to food and consumer policy has been substantial in the past twelve months. Much remains to be done, but very substantial progress has been made.</p>
<p class="contents">On trade and development: my group supports the everything but arms proposition. I hope that as the Commission itself contemplates the sensitivities in agriculture relating to the World Trade Organisation and to the agricultural reform debate, the sequencing of those debates will not be allowed to get in the way of the trade-related initiative. It is an important European initiative and I hope the College will go for it, notwithstanding some of the sequencing difficulties to do with other negotiations which may arise.</p>
<p class="contents">The ELDR believes that we need to focus more urgent attention on asylum and immigration. I congratulate Mr Vitorino on the work that has been brought forward, but Tampere set an agenda and I wonder why, so long after Tampere, we are still struggling to define what that agenda should be.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding enlargement: my group is deeply committed to that process but I would say to the Commission – and I say it also to this House and to Mr Solana – that we really need to focus quality time and attention on Cyprus. It is not simply the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> – they are doing very well on that. It is not simply their ability to implement the <span class="italic">acquis</span> – they can deliver on that. Yet surrounding it are grave and serious political issues that are not getting the quality time and attention that we believe they need if this is to be a success.</p>
<p class="contents">On the legislative programme: as regards its form I am glad it is going to the committees within the House. I am glad we get a chance to reflect on it and to look at the priorities. Mr Prodi has said that it is not simply an assembly of disparate ideas and indeed he has offered some priorities here. But I have looked at it. It is 49 pages of high-density non-communication. It is 49 pages covering 593 different initiatives. It is very difficult to find in this methodology which are the real priorities, where there is political passion and focus, and which are merely the issues that we have to deal with because they are part of due process. We have to move away from this.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We have to change the way we do our business. I would hope that next September we will have something where each initiative, in methodological terms, is justified. I do not mean that everything here is not justified – but tell us the story. Maybe we asked for some initiatives but, on reflection, we would say that they are not such a priority after all. How much of this came from the European Council inviting the Commission to take initiatives? We do not find the answers in here. I would like to see them. It is not a question of interfering with the Commission's right of initiative in relation to the treaties, but a question of quality control.</p>
<p class="contents">If I could say one last thing, it seems to me it would be very useful if we did this next September and completed the debate by December and that you, Madam President, as President of this institution, and Mr Prodi, as President of the European Commission, could go to the European Council and tell them <span class="italic">ex ante</span>: this is our priority for Europe. Is it yours? That is how we need to do our business, to put a drive, a focus and an energy behind it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally on Nice – on après-Nice – just to make a point. We in the European Parliament should be involved in encouraging a wide and open debate as a prelude to a full institutional participation après-Laeken. My group would insist in the post-Laeken period on some convention-style method with deep involvement for the European Parliament and the national parliaments to include the active engagement of Council.</p>

<p class="contents">Right at the start I wish to say that the fact that the Union lacks the tools to work in such a way that it is actually able to answer the challenges of increasing globalisation, for example, and the tools to enable it to protect its citizens from the chaotic effects of this globalisation, is becoming a major problem. I am now referring to the fact that at the Nice Summit it proved utterly impossible to take the decision that, in future, matters to do with taxation might be decided upon by means of a qualified majority. This means that we shall be leaving this area of taxation to market forces. We are to allow market forces to shape our tax system, and this will obviously be a major obstacle to our being able to build what we here call the European social model, in which we want to steer the development of society by means of taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">Population growth was mentioned here. It is absolutely clear that we must combat growing racism, as we will not otherwise be in any way able to deal with immigrants and asylum seekers. In this we all have a great public responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, very often strong words are uttered in this House on the subject of our citizens. Here today, too, it has been said many times over that the public must be included in the decision-making process, although, unfortunately, this very often gets forgotten in practice. I will take one very topical example of this. The institutions are at this very moment trying to put together a regulation on transparency, which would safeguard the right of the public to acquire information on decision making in the Union. I would like to warn my colleagues and all those present that now it appears that this regulation on transparency is turning into more of a regulation to shield the confidentiality of the work of the institutions, or, in other words, it has precisely the opposite objective. We cannot accept this sort of thing, and we also need more public debate on this issue. Neither can this matter be discussed entirely <span class="italic">in camera, </span>as is happening at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, sustainable development was mentioned by President Prodi in his opening address, and this is a major objective as far as my group is concerned. If we do not succeed at Gothenburg in achieving a real programme of sustainable development we will have wasted an opportunity that perhaps will not return again. It is here, if anywhere, that the Commission must demonstrate leadership and set forth its views. But it would seem that there are always problems with this in practice. Today the Commission will publish its White Paper on policy on chemicals, but I have reason to suppose that the Commission’s approach to this too will be to protect the short-sighted financial interests of industry rather than guarantee that we would actually be rid of hazardous chemicals. This is something we cannot possibly accept as we are speaking about sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">Environmental competitiveness is something that should be taken seriously, and the Commission would be better off listening to companies and financial players that have realised that sustainable development can also be good business.</p>
<p class="contents">Major reform in agriculture is at present under discussion, and we want to encourage it, and we insist that the Commission take a comprehensive view and not just content itself with taking small steps forward. In this we can look forward to a real change in the paradigm.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Madam President, if you will allow, Annex IV of the Treaty of Nice is certainly the best thing about this agreement. It states the enormous obligation of Parliament, the Commission and the Council also, and the Swedish Presidency, to take seriously our re-evaluation of the process that underlies the structure of the European Union. My group fully supports your initiative regarding our obligation to include civil society in this debate over the next six months prior to the Laeken Summit, as well, obviously, as the national parliaments and indeed those of candidate countries. It saddens me when I hear that my colleague, Mr Barón Crespo, wants to point out here that we must be mainly satisfied to listen to national parliaments. No, civil society is very much a reality. We will have to take it seriously finally and we should no longer have to witness any Intergovernmental Conference in which just the national interests are safeguarded, with all this happening behind closed doors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Negotiations with the candidate countries will proceed following the “road map” proposed by the Commission, in the words of the Commission document, which mentions, I quote, “18 additional chapters” which can be “brought to a close” this year. How, on the basis of such abstract and indeed bureaucratic utterances is it possible to get any grip on the problems to be solved, the contradictions to be overcome and hence the political decisions which must be taken?</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I consider the idea of “policy towards neighbouring countries” to be a great oversimplification. This term is used to describe EU strategy in the Balkans, its relations with Russia and the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, all of which is covered in just seven lines of text. Some policies undertaken by the European Union in these areas have indeed been criticised, as we saw only last week on the part of the second Euro-Mediterranean Forum. What conclusions do you draw from such assessments?</p>
<p class="contents">What indeed remains of the EU’s development policy? For the very poorest countries, aside from the trade measure you have just mentioned, you have created the Europe Aid Cooperation Office, on the model of US Aid, and have, for the most part, replaced development with aid. For the other countries, you have traded in the Lomé-style philosophy for a WTO-style logic. What has become of Europe’s ambition for the South of Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">The second major priority I wish to ask you about is the new economic and social agenda. The Commission must prepare the ground for the decisions to be taken in this context on the basis of a range of criteria dubbed “structural indicators”. In these indicators, what allowance is made for social concerns and all that the United Nations Development Programme most sensibly terms “indicators of human development”? You do not, for example, propose even the slightest social consideration in the Commission’s approval of merger plans between major groups. Why not? What do you plan to do in future to prevent a proliferation of cases like the Michelin, Danone, Alstom, Valeo, Aventis and other scandals, where redundancy plans are announced alongside excellent financial results? Why are you postponing the revision of the directive on a European works council, etc., until next year?</p>
<p class="contents">That is the context in which you announce a White Paper on governance incorporating a form of partnership with civil society. Returning from the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, I should wholeheartedly approve this, yet I must refrain, for its almost libertarian-looking political approach is a front for all sorts of economic tendencies that are traditionally liberal in essence. In order, however, to overcome the present crisis of confidence felt by the citizens of Europe with regard to the European Union, we must, I believe, play fair right down the line with the citizens themselves, their elected representatives, their trade unions and their associations, in other words, before taking decisions we should agree to expose the options to the light of day, enable transparent pluralist assessment of the effects of these decisions once implemented and we should dare, if necessary, to change our heading if, perchance, society’s priorities happen to upset the agenda of the Community’s elected officials.</p>
<p class="contents">What steps, Mr Prodi, would you be willing to take along this road in 2001?</p>

This was the central objective that needed to be achieved during these treaty negotiations and I now believe that the way ahead is clear for candidate countries to join the Union in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">The most immediate objective for the 15 existing Members of the European Union is to ensure that the Treaty of Nice is ratified across the Union as soon as possible. The provisions of the Treaty of Nice cannot come into effect until the ratification process has been concluded within the 15 Member States of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I note with interest that the agenda for this debate which we are having today is headed "follow-up to Nice". I would caution all interested parties against discussing broader developments within the Union before the ratification process has been comprehensively concluded within the European Union. This is really the central dichotomy that exists within the Union at this time. Those who talk about broader political integration within the Union take for granted that the ratification of the Treaty of Nice is a done deal. It is not a done deal. It is a deal that has to be sold to the 370 million citizens of the Union in a manner that is easily understood and in a manner which commands the public support and good will of all our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a criticism I would level against those in particular who propose putting into effect complete federal structures within the European Union. There is at times an attitude in some European quarters to the effect that ‘we know best; we will bring about the appropriate changes and the people will thank us for them later’.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not how political persuasion operates. We put forward proposals. We then persuade the people of Europe to support them, whether within our respective parliament structures or by referendum. It is up to us, who support enlargement of the Union and who recognise the absolute right of candidate countries to join the Union, to convince our voting citizens of the importance of the provisions of the Treaty of Nice and of its broader political implications.</p>
<p class="contents">What the European Union should not do is to carry out any further debate on new political developments within the Union before the Treaty of Nice has been ratified within any of our respective Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bigliardo (TDI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened with some amazement to the speech of the leader of the European People’s Party, which stressed the absence of the Council and the institutional detachment which, to some degree, has been observed in this Chamber, and which also strongly criticised the sectorial policy of the Foreign Ministers of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is symptomatic, with regard to what President Prodi has just shown, of the programme: a programme which, in a way, closely resembles a catalogue of dreams but which – and herein lies the difference – is characterised by the search for a debate, as President Prodi has illustrated in his report. There has been talk of market liberalisation, of privatisation and, more recently, of sustainable development and environmental damage, and one can see the clear contradiction when we talk of liberalisation on the one hand, and sustainable development on the other: contradictions which are revealed by a Commission and a Europe which, for too long, have been associated with the lobby whose only concern may well not be to create the Europe we were talking about but increasingly a Europe for businessmen, which I do not want and, nor, I believe, do many of us.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is therefore fundamental, one which is increasingly forming the subject of debate on modern Europe, one which some – using an American term I do not like – call the <span class="italic">welfare state</span> and which we Europeans have always called the social state.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic problem is and remains: social State or liberal State? More State and less market or more market and less State? There has been talk of two and a half million jobs created last year and we have heard President Prodi say that two thirds of these went to women: I believe that what President Prodi has shown us is an excellent result, which should however also be evaluated on the level, dear President, of territorial distribution within Europe. Of these two and a half million jobs, for example, I do not know how many went to Italy and, in particular, to southern Italy, where unemployment is extremely serious and where, if we wished it, we could maybe – this is my suggestion, but it is worth careful consideration – combine the problems of sustainable development and those associated with resolving the question of employment: I refer to the possibility of providing incentives to promote the access of young people to the world of work in the form of a minimum starting salary, with the aim, for example, of achieving hydro-geological redevelopment of the region. There are a great number of people who are idle and Europe could find a solution of this kind to solve two problems simultaneously.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also thinking about your words, Mr President, on the internal reform of the Commission. I know that you are working on this with conviction, and this conviction with which the Commission is working is having an influence on, for example, the internal job situation, on the employees of the Commission, who are worried by job cuts and a reorganisation which could have repercussions for the job situation of Parliament employees. It is a widespread concern in this regard: I therefore call upon you to initiate a final debate, no longer on roles so much as on the political content of Parliament and the Commission’s initiative: definite, clear-cut choices which describe a Europe in which the memory of the cucumbers – to which President Prodi referred – is increasingly faint and remote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some federalists are in favour of it because Eurosceptics are opposed to it. However, both groups may well have good reasons for opposing it. Eurosceptics are necessarily opposed to shifting power from the national parliaments to Brussels. Federalists are necessarily opposed to decision making’s being taken from voters and elected representatives and put into the hands of EU officials and ministers. In short, Nice means less democracy. We all have a common interest in securing a democratic debate prior to the next treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">There must be an end to treaties behind closed doors. The next treaty must be negotiated openly by elected representatives, and it must be discussed not only openly but also with the direct involvement of citizens and, in the end, be approved in referenda in those countries where referenda are allowed. Against this background, federalists and ‘Euroroyalists’ will be able to discuss the way in which the future Europe is to be organised. What is to be discussed in Brussels, what is to be decided in Strasbourg and what is to be decided in the national parliaments? The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities is campaigning for open, slimmer and freer European cooperation. We want to see the majority of all decisions taken in the Member States and in local areas. The wealth of Europe lies in its diversity, and we cannot, for example, see any compelling need for the EU’s being able to alter a decision taken by Århus city council about the organisation of local bus services. That is a matter we are well able to decide for ourselves. Finally, I hope that the information tools that the Commission is now going to be using will be used in a pluralistic way to promote discussion between all those holding different points of view about European integration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For these people, particularly for the Commission – as the Commission President has just stated – this is supposed to be, at long last, the great European constitutional process that the Nice Council denied itself, a process which should be set in motion forthwith by means of a European convention inspired by that which, last year, drew up the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Such unseemly haste, such over-excitement, must not, however, be seen as a substitute for due consideration. The concept of a European Constitution makes reference to the concept of a European State, which is something that the nations of Europe do not wish to see. Moreover, the Nice Council, please note, refrained from including this idea in the objectives for the future IGC. What the Europe of the future actually needs is not the status of a future European State with its own constitution but a network of nations that is respectful of the national democracies and is enshrined in a fundamental treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">In the short term, we must consider the method of the future debate. Let us be honest, the convention which framed the Charter of Fundamental Rights was a failure because it continually muddled areas of jurisdiction and confused areas of responsibility, and came up in the end with a text which, although it might have been music to the ears of those advocating the European superstate, was not acceptable to the members of the Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that in future we shall have to have a different procedure for preparing for IGCs, but it will certainly not be through bodies such as the convention existing in a state of perfect weightlessness. That would only force us into new deadlocks. In the first instance, debate with regard to the forthcoming IGC, must be organised in and around the national parliaments and on their responsibility. In the second place, the forthcoming IGC should negotiate only credible proposals, i.e. those supported by at least one in four of the national parliaments within the European Union following votes in their parliaments. In this way we would be sure of not wandering off track and we would remain firmly anchored to the national democracies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall therefore limit myself to only two, and I should be grateful if these could be looked at again. </p>
<p class="contents">We can see what is going on in the agricultural sector: we, as the European People’s Party, feel that there is an absolute necessity to review the terms of the common agricultural policy and, above all, to understand the scope of future strategies. Consider the financial burden the agricultural policy places on our budget. However, we must also consider the political cards which will be played on agriculture, and the issue of globalisation. You yourself recalled the Lamy proposal, an extremely important proposal but one which will have major implications for agriculture. Let us also think about what will happen on the food production front in terms of safety, what will happen in the fields of typical productions and biotechnology. If we then add the issues of enlargement and the relaunch of agriculture in some areas such as the Mediterranean basin, we shall want to know what Model of European Agriculture the Commission intends to create and, above all, we shall certainly want assurance that this agricultural model will not be placed on the foreign policy table and regarded as a bargaining counter in situations arising out of international requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue concerns the Mediterranean, whose importance was shown by a forum in which we took part last week. Well, as regards the Mediterranean, substantial problems still remain unresolved. On this issue, we want a policy to be agreed which guarantees the same privileges for the South as those granted to other areas of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have said a great deal today about programming aspects. I should like to refer to your closing words, in which you spoke about Parliament and the excellent role played by parliamentarians. Fine words, Mr President, but too vague. I therefore call on you to make some sort of concrete statement. The fact of the matter is this: we want a strong Commission, because we believe that intergovernmental cooperation is no basis for a Europe of tomorrow – at least not primarily. We therefore expect you too to bear in mind that we need to strengthen parliamentarianism and parliamentary debate. As a general precept, I am sure you agree with that. It is just, Mr President, that when your Vice-President, Mr Barnier, states during a recent discussion in committee that we should propose a sort of forum for the post-Nice process in which everyone is involved – members of parliament, civil society – then I say no, not if this forum is in lieu of a convention. Mr President, we want a convention, a convention of Members of the European Parliament and the national parliaments. That is what we want and it is here that we ask for your clear, unequivocal support.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I know, Mr President, that the Commission is critical – both directly and indirectly – of Parliament's weaknesses. Parliament does have its weaknesses, it is true. But the weaknesses of this Parliament and of parliamentarianism at European level need to be overcome by strengthening this Parliament, not weakening it still further.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to my next point: you proposed again today – and I admit you are right, something must be done – to publish a White Paper on the question of good governance. The concept of good governance is somewhat of a problem in itself. I would rather refer to democratic governance. The democratic decision-making procedure needs to be strengthened, I agree with you there. It must also be broadened. Democracy also includes dialogue with civil society. I admit that one hundred per cent. And this is where we, as parliamentarians, must do more. But, here again, the sixty thousand dollar question is: is civil society being involved at the expense of stronger parliamentary democracy? Is civil society the guardian, so to speak, of parliamentary debate and the decision-making process? Here too you must make a clear, unequivocal statement in support of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to the question of self-regulation, another new buzz word. Self-regulation is sometimes euphemistically referred to as a "cooperative decision-making model". No, Mr President. Parliament must take decisions, the Council must take decisions, the parliamentary committees must take decisions. Of course, we must ensure that this decision-making process is transparent and public and not, as is the case at present, opaque and private – that applies in particular to the Commission and lobby groups. We must engage in dialogue and debate with these interest groups, we must accept their advice and take account of their arguments, that we must. But we can hardly expect the fox to guard the chickens. Are those whom we perhaps want to control to be allowed to set their own rules in the future? I take a different view. That is like saying that the feedingstuffs industry and agricultural lobby should decide on the organisation of the agricultural markets. It is out of the question and that is not our position.</p>
<p class="contents">Another brief comment in this context: there is a growing trend towards so-called interpretive Commission communications. In other words, Council and Parliament decisions are subsequently interpreted by the Commission, where possible, in the way which the various interest groups perhaps want them interpreted. That too is a slippery slope. The Commission submits proposals. It has the right of initiative. I admit that. But it is the parliamentary committees which must take the decisions and there should be no ex-post corrections in later communications. If there are, then the matter should be referred to the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, President Prodi, we expect to be inundated with Commission proposals. But we also expect the Commission to respect parliamentarianism, just as we respect the Commission. We expect you to be as keen to strengthen Parliament as we are to strengthen the Commission.</p>

If we need to improve the quality of governance of the Union, we might make a start with the Commission's work programme itself. We should be focusing policy-making on areas where EU-wide action is indispensable. We should be ensuring that the principle of subsidiarity is fully respected. Is this really the case with the Commission's recommendation on a common European format for curriculum vitaes: No 379 on their list of measures to implement this year? Each new legislative proposal should include a justification of why action at Union level is necessary and we might help, as my colleague Mr Clegg has suggested, by establishing a standing scrutiny committee in this House to ensure that measures proposed meet the criteria for subsidiarity and proportionality. Your state of the Union speech, Mr Prodi, should be accompanied by a detailed list of proposals individually justified and explained, not hidden away in annexes to the document. The proposal should be the outcome of serious debate in the College of Commissioners, not passed on the nod as A points.

That is by definition what parliaments are for.</p>
<p class="contents">President Prodi, the Commission's attitude is unclear and extremely vague, especially on the question of the post-Nice process. You have criticised the Treaty, but I hear that the Commission is starting a huge run of newspaper advertisements hailing the Treaty of Nice as an historic breakthrough and success. You find reason to criticise, but your Commissioner Barnier is outlining a mere forum for debate, rather than a constitutional process and a convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the Commission, I call on you to give a straight answer to a straight question: are you on Parliament's side when it comes to demanding a constitutional process and a convention and for decisive democratic principles, such as the division of power, checks and balances, public legislating and so forth, to be added to the list of Nice leftovers? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thirdly, we need to convene a reform conference modelled on the convention, which has the credentials and authority to propose reforms and, fourthly, if an Intergovernmental Conference is preferred, it should not, in my view, be held in 2004, when the terms of office of the Commission and Parliament expire and they are unable to participate fully. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The problem of employment and the dignity of working conditions and of standards of living is still unresolved; as for enlargement, our capacities to tackle this adequately with regard to our own peoples and the peoples of the candidate countries, the necessary structures, the economic adjustments and the political and social relationships require further development and greater consistency. It is not a question of speeding up enlargement or slowing it down; it is a question of achieving it in a manner which is appropriate to the situation and according to timeframes which are compatible with the time needed to ensure that a morally correct choice is not turned into a disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against illegal immigration, organised crime, the exploitation of women and children, drugs and the trafficking of weapons and human organs must be constantly at the centre of our focus, but we have to say that documents which are flawless in form are not being matched by meaningful progress on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">We are awaiting European regulations on the use of the Internet. In fact, without rules, there is no freedom, only infringement of national and international laws.</p>
<p class="contents">The reinvigoration of the Mediterranean policy, as decided by the European Parliament in the last part-session, must be implemented – and quickly – as must the initiatives for peace in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">But of all the urgent situations there are, one is currently an absolutely top priority: food safety and security for the citizens. In the name of false progress and the illegal profits of some, we are irreversibly destroying both the present and future health of the consumer and entire farming and food production sectors. The consequences will be disastrous if we cannot give a firm, frank, timely response. Already, there have been too many delays in governments’ interventions after the first reports, many years ago, of mad cow disease, gelatine-coated beef, and dioxins in chickens, in short, in respect of all the food frauds which have been shown to be not only commercial swindles but environmental and health time-bombs.</p>
<p class="contents">We ask you, President Prodi, to urge the Council to set up a control and verification committee immediately, but, in the meantime, we would like to see an increase in monitoring by your presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They concern the dividing line between national and European powers, simplification of the Treaty, the legal status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the role of national parliaments in the architecture of the European Union. Why should the final responsibility continue to rest with the Member States? This question relates closely to the definition of the purpose of the European Union. We should be clear on one point: remits need to be clearly defined if we expect people to accept legislative and political decisions at European level. Our top priority must therefore be to ensure that national parliaments are more involved in the run-up to the planned Intergovernmental Conference.

It is not enough to depict this year as a full-blown discussion forum involving the civil society, which Mr Swoboda rightly criticised in his analysis. The question which needs to be asked here is: what clearly defined method is there for involving the European Parliament and the national parliaments? And this then begs the question: will it or will it not be a convention and what role will the convention play in formulating the documents adopted post-Nice? The question is: will it just be a folkloristic declaration adopted in a convention and will the 15 again behave in exactly the same way on the night?</p>
<p class="contents">I think we need to clarify where we are heading, as regards both the methods and the objectives. This should not be kept under wraps. For the rest, we need to consider, now that nearly all the Heads of Government have said that the decision-making structures decided at Nice are poor structures, what we can do to put things right, perhaps even before the post-Nice process starts – for example in connection with enlargement agreements, which always clarified this in the past. In any event, this is the way forward if we are to avoid delaying enlargement. Enlargement is the second major issue on the agenda and we must carry out our historic duty here.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to the third point. We must ensure that transatlantic relations are not smothered by new security policy debates, with the Americans failing to understand us and our security and defence policy initiative, and with our failing to understand the Americans and their rocket defence system. The first thing we can say, I think, is that enlargement is our own major security policy achievement. Secondly, if we develop our own capabilities, they will form part of the Atlantic Alliance, which will continue to be responsible for collective security in Europe. I think that, thirdly, this will enable us to create the right conditions for a transatlantic market place. The American president's current negotiator, Robert Zoellick, wrote the 1990 transatlantic declaration. I hope that we can re-establish this tradition and reduce the Atlantic Ocean to a pond once again.</p>

First, the initial stage should involve both public debate – I agree with the comments made on this by Mr Swoboda and Mr Brok – and it should involve the planned Laeken declaration. I have a very straightforward question to put to you: are you – the Commission – ready and will we manage this year, in 2001, to present a common Commission and Parliament proposal for Laeken on the subsequent structure of the post-Nice process? That is my first question, which concerns the method.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards my second point, I was delighted to hear you say that we must set up a committee to involve governments, the Commission, the European Parliament and the national parliaments. We want a convention to move the post-Nice process forward, a convention which is the centre of gravity for public debate, i.e. which sends and receives proposals and, at the same time, presents a clear proposal for the Intergovernmental Conference and for the issues which will need to be negotiated in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point relates to the subjects. Four subjects are planned, which is both fine and feasible; but we all know that it is not just these subjects which need to be clarified and that much more is and must be at stake for 2004. I would advise each and everyone of us to get away from this strange ‘post-Nice’ concept. Post-Nice is not what it is about. Nice is not only the end of a method, Nice is also the end of an era , the era of the European unification process of the 1950s, the 1960s, the 1970s and the 1980s. Now what we have to do is to prepare the ground for a new European Union, a European Union of the twenty-first century. It is not about the post-Nice process, it is about standing on the verge of a renewed European unification process and we must make this clear. If we want to convince public opinion, public debate, the people and the citizens of the merits of our objective of European unification, then starting a post-Nice process is not enough; on the contrary, we must ensure that the people understand that we are talking about a new European Union in a new Europe, a Europe which has changed since 1990.</p>

<p class="contents">President of the Commission, as the mist clears following the Nice Summit, it is clear that the last-minute compromise behind closed doors has its obvious limitations. Now, sobriety has returned, and a broad civic debate has been promised on Europe’s goals, future and responsibilities. That is the way it should be. The promise is binding. But <span class="italic">how</span> is that to be arranged? If the citizens of Europe really are to take part in the discussion about the future of the common European project, they are also going to be able to exercise influence. Is the Commission prepared to take proposals and ideas on board and also put them into effect? In that case, the EU will be transformed, opened up and simplified.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that many citizens want to see a clear constitution. When are they to obtain one? We also know that issues concerning the environment, asylum and cross-border crime are important issues in connection with which our citizens want the EU to be strong, vigorous and willing to act. Are the Commission and the Council prepared to give the EU these tools? The outcome of the Nice Summit puts people off, unfortunately.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that there is a general feeling of irritation about the fact that the EU meddles in all too many questions of detail. Is the Commission prepared to give the celebrated subsidiarity principle real substance and to find a method of limiting the eagerness for regulating detail which characterises all of us in Brussels and Strasbourg?</p>
<p class="contents">Citizens of the EU and of the candidate countries, as well as national parliaments and, of course, <span class="italic">this</span> Parliament, must be given real influence over the agenda for, the decisions about, and the method for shaping the EU’s future.

Judging by your programme, we might believe that the extremely serious and crucial problem of mad cow disease does not exist. Your proposals speak in idealistic terms of the new economy and of millions of new jobs without considering the need to create them as a matter of priority in the least developed regions. These regions suffer from the highest rates of unemployment and from the emigration of their most highly qualified technical specialists. Your proposals do not consider the economic and budgetary problems inherent in the necessary enlargement to include new states or the terrible situation of immigration from the developing world. They ignore the crisis caused by ultraliberal globalisation which has been challenged, specifically in Porto Alegre, and say nothing about the huge disappointment that was Nice. No mention is made in this context of the fact that the States can, historically, no longer prevent our citizens taking direct democratic decisions about the Union, and no mention is made of the emergence of stateless nations and of bodies with political and legislative personality.</p>
<p class="contents">President Prodi, the Commission should not turn a blind eye to the fact that a process that must be concluded by the adoption of a European constitution is taking shape in European society.

They find it difficult to conceal their own failure, which is in direct proportion to the political arrogance that they showed and which they have unfortunately rushed to assume once again, having learnt nothing from their past mistakes.</p>
<p class="contents">It is exactly the opposite that an enlarged European Union requires if it is not simply to move from the leftovers from Amsterdam to the leftovers from Nice and then, in 2004, to new frustrations. Europe requires a different strategy, a different idea. The majority must be prepared to understand the reality of the situation without preconceived ideas. Their failure in Nice is quite enough. What is important now is that they understand the test of truth that occurred there: the clash of whimsical abstraction with the reality faced by the people of Europe. There is the question of what direction to take, but there is also the question of pace. Trying to impose a state-led political superstructure when there is no such thing as a single European people or even a single European public can only lead to further disasters. What is required is more centralism and less democracy. Of course the people of Europe will resist. No one wants to give up the democratic essence of their own country, their own language and culture, where they are close to the power that they have elected, that they understand and that they control. Unless we understand this, unless we are prepared to listen more instead of speaking so much, unless we try to open up the way for leadership by the national parliaments and unless we stop discussing Europe in such dramatic terms, casting aside certain obsessions that serve no real purpose, the post-Nice debate will fail, just as the pre-Nice debate failed, and this would be a shame.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be a shame if the federalists continue to prefer their ivory tower to the real situation faced by the people of Europe, if they persist in repeating the frustrating experience of Nice and to weaken Europe. The path that has been prepared cannot succeed. What is happening now is not underpinned by any doctrine. We need a completely different strategy for Europe, a strategy in which nations are led by their citizens, not another strategy which sets citizens against nations. Furthermore, what we need more than a European debate is 15 national debates on enlargement and 27 national debates on Europe, free from euphemisms and ambiguity, with the issues laid clearly on the table. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It seems that we will have to await the Laeken guidelines in order to get under way. But the debate on the future of the Union has been under way for months now, with speeches by various Heads of State and Government, and Parliament is already working actively.</p>
<p class="contents">Passivity on the part of the Commission, if confirmed, would be very serious in this preparatory stage, because we all know that it has a great responsibility: to act as a guardian of the Community spirit. And this responsibility has to take the form of concrete proposals and not of vague references to a White Paper or other such matters.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I am genuinely pleased that this morning President Prodi has reaffirmed his support for the comments which Commissioner Barnier made in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. In other words, I am pleased that he has reaffirmed that the proposal for a forum is not a step backwards in relation to the previous convention, but an ambition for a convention which functions better.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, if that is the case, why change the name? The Europeans already know what a convention is and have been able to observe its results, which have been transparent and fruitful, compared to the shameful achievements of the last Intergovernmental Conference. Its opponents do not reject the name. They reject the convention itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us therefore look to public opinion, and forget name changing, so that Parliament and the Commission can fight side by side. Let us not back down in the face of those people who do not want a democratic and transparent Europe, but an opaque Europe made up of diplomats.</p>

If you do, furthermore, take on board the proposal from our fellow Member, Klaus Hänsch, the proposals you presented this morning should enable us to re-establish the natural complicity which there should be between both our institutions in order to have successful dialogue within the institutional triangle. If we wish to pursue this route, however, it is not useful to condemn the behaviour of the Council in this or that instance. We need a strong Council; we need a Council that participates fully in the institutional triangle. There are reforms which could be undertaken without revising the Treaty. Let us support any such initiatives within the Council rather than resorting to procedural arguments to deplore the non-attendance of the Council, as Mr Poettering did earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I would like to discuss, Mr President, is the White Paper on governance. This is something we are impatiently awaiting. We suppose that this will foreshadow the debate to be held on one of the items in Annex IV, on the distribution of competences. I should however at this early stage like to draw your attention to one point. This morning you stated your wish to see a Europe that was closer to its citizens. We feel that there is indeed room for improvement in this respect, if we wish to make progress. We hear all too often in our constituencies and in our own countries of the problems that people have in getting their projects validated by the Commission. The unwieldiness of the procedures and the concentration of projects do not make a useful contribution in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point relates to the debate on the future of the European Union. I feel that, this morning, you have introduced the elements which make it possible for us to approach dialogue under acceptable conditions. We must indeed raise questions as to content; institutional matters will come after. The issue of the political clout of the European Union in the world and the issue of solidarity, or what I prefer to call the issue of the social model, are indeed critical matters on which we must again find the resolve to live together within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of method, we welcome the fact that you have taken on board the idea that, in the structured dialogue phase, the four partners participating in the convention will have to again find their capacity to work together. We need to distinguish between bodies that are dedicated to debate and bodies that are dedicated to deliberation. The convention should remain a forum for deliberation because experiences in Amsterdam and Nice have proved that the representatives of the European Parliament are not allocated enough of a place at the IGC and because we prefer the convention model and we are convinced that all proposals may be drawn up in this context. There is no divide between issues relating to human rights which might lie within the jurisdiction of political bodies and issues relating to institutional aspects which would lie within the sole jurisdiction of diplomatic bodies. Nice showed that the convention model makes it possible to advance more quickly, in a more structured manner, and enhancing much more our collective mode of operation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would thank the Commission for its determined efforts. Now comes the difficult part, however. Now, it is a question of keeping the impetus going. The first wave of enlargement <span class="italic">must</span> be completed in one and a half year’s time in Copenhagen in December 2002. That is the Commission’s objective, and we shall hold them to it. I would call upon the next countries to hold the presidency to maintain very close contact with the candidate countries and to help by removing obstacles from the path in time. However, it is not only, of course, the candidate countries which must adapt to <span class="italic">us</span>. We too have to adapt. An EU of 27 Member States <span class="italic">must</span> learn to concentrate its forces upon the major and cross-border tasks. That is not, of course, what we are doing at present. A year ago here in Parliament, you said yourself, Mr President of the Commission, that the European Union should be freed from all the, and I quote, “things that are absolutely ridiculous” which the Council of Ministers and Parliament have got you administering. You repeated those words several times, and you are right. Now is the time to do something about it. Let us have a slimmer, but at the same time stronger, EU. Let us stop trying to keep far too many balls in the air. I propose that you appoint a bold Commissioner to the task of combating trivial extra tasks and petty regulations, and I propose that the Conference of Community and European Affairs Committees of the Parliaments of the European Union, COSAC, be given the ability to stop legislation that violates the subsidiarity principle. In return, the Commission must be strong so that the European Union is energetic in the other areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the spirit of intergovernmentalism. It is creeping intergovernmentalism – encouraged by the Council – which led Europe into the Nice impasse and on this, President Prodi, we are the Commission's natural allies. The Commission and Parliament must work together closely on this issue. If, President Prodi, Parliament occasionally criticises the Commission's administrative behaviour, it is not meant in a spirit of enmity towards the Commission, but as an expression of our democratic duty of scrutiny. In cases of doubt it brings us closer together rather than rending us asunder.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of national parliaments has been addressed. I am very keen on having a convention rather than a forum to prepare the next stage, because the negotiators at a convention, such as the Council representatives, the Commission, parliament and the European Parliament, have democratic credentials. We should not espouse the arbitrariness of so-called socially relevant groups. This understanding should also be clearly formulated at the Commission. For the rest, we must consider the role of the national parliaments in the European process. At the end of the day, it is the national parliaments which control the Council. That is their job. They have no authority over Community institutions, such as the Commission or even Parliament. So when we talk about involving national parliaments, we need to put them on the Council's side in the legislative process. They cannot restrict the role of the European Parliament. It is extremely important to us that this be clarified.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the focal points of the Commission's work will be asylum and immigration. We do not want to elaborate a European asylum and immigration code, we want – as Mr Vitorino rightly said – individual directives. But we need a common concept. It is this which is still lacking and which the Commission has yet to formulate.</p>

<p class="contents">The way that this should be done – and my views are very close to those of the Commission – is to have a first-year wide-open debate – let a thousand flowers bloom – then move to a broad, deliberative body that will draft the changes that are necessary. This could be composed in the same way as the convention that produced and composed the Charter of Rights with representatives of the European Parliament and national parliaments and governments. Finally, there would be a short, sharp IGC to approve the results at the end.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, we will be dealing with the four issues that were mentioned by the European Council including one issue which overlaps very much with the Commission's White Paper on governance. I would be interested to hear the Commission's views on how these two processes are going to tie in to each other, because there is a degree of overlap there.</p>
<p class="contents">There will also be other issues that should be addressed. The future of the High Representative, the question of extending the codecision powers of Parliament to all legislative procedures, taking in those few that are now by anomaly left out. We must also look at the issue of codification of the Treaties. I would plead for a special procedure. This year, why not set up a committee of experts from the Member States and the institutions to complete the task that was started in Florence of codifying and simplifying the Treaties so that the political work next year can start on the basis of a text that is already simplified and codified? The technical work would thus be out of the way before we move on to the political work. I would advocate that way forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The topics are intended to allay the people’s fear of an intangible shift of power towards Brussels at the expense of national jurisdiction, but all they will do is increase the sense of alienation. It is impossible for there to be a definitive distribution of competences between the European and national levels. The cooperation process is dynamic not static. Things that are taboo at first, such as the euro, may appeal later on. This is determined by social need, which cannot be predicted. It would, of course, be marvellous to have a broad forum on the future of Europe, but the outcome is a foregone conclusion. There are fundamental differences of opinion on this matter amongst the countries, across the political divide, and even within the political parties themselves. If we want to restore the confidence of the people then we must introduce a culture of greater openness and decisiveness in Europe. So what we need is a political unit which does not stand for re-nationalisation of policy, but which strengthens the political European institutions. That is what we need to see on the agenda, and that is what would testify to courage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The case for the EU to do less and do it better has never been clearer or more pressing. The European Parliament should say so in the coming weeks as the committees look into this programme. With some 600 initiatives, of which almost 200 are legislative measures, there is a lot of work to be done on scrutiny and on setting our own priorities, which we look forward to doing.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the question of the post-Nice process, I would rather see it as our European future. We look back into the history of the European Union over the last generation and the continent of Europe over the last century. I should like to recall some words by Milan Kundera in his book <span class="italic">The Book of Laughter and Forgetting</span> where he says: "People are always shouting that they want to create a better future. It is not true. The future is an apathetic void of no interest to anyone. The past is full of life, eager to irritate us, provoke and insult us, tempt us to destroy or repaint it. The only reason people want to be masters of the future is to change the past."</p>
<p class="contents">Well, we have changed the past and Europe is a different place from what it was in the post-war era. The four Nice leftovers are not small or casual affairs. Our view on the core issues is clear. We want to see a bigger role for national parliaments, on a systematic and constructive basis. We would welcome a clearer delineation of competences, as the Berlin Declaration by the European Democrat Union last month favoured, provided that it is not an excuse to strengthen the centre.</p>
<p class="contents">Likewise, simplifying the Treaties would serve the public interest, but this must not be the pretext for introducing a fully-fledged European constitution, especially if the latter were the founding document of a federal state whose preamble was a legally-binding charter of rights.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these issues need and deserve the widest possible public debate. But despite lip service to open consultation in the past, the Nice IGC process, like Amsterdam and Maastricht before it, was ultimately the preserve of national civil servants negotiating behind closed doors. The next consultation must be different. It needs to involve real and wide consultation throughout civil society, reflecting the open culture and open politics which we claim to favour.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Corbett quoted Chairman Mao. I would rather quote George Bush Senior: society is "a thousand points of light", not "a thousand flowers blooming". Our debate on the EU's institutional future must draw on all of society, harnessing not just the resources of a closed Brussels policy world but the democratic potential of the Internet and – yes – of opinion polls. The EU must sustain a truly open society. The people must have their say, including those in the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also reschedule the next IGC. In 2004 we will see a lame-duck Commission on its last legs and the European election cutting across the IGC. Better to schedule the conference for 2003, with the 2004 European Parliament elections allowing a popular verdict on some of the key choices being made by governments with enlargement under way.</p>
<p class="contents">There are important questions. In Britain, as in other countries facing general elections in the next couple of years, one of the central issues will be: in whose hands is the future of Europe safe? With the Council of Ministers and the Commission firmly in socialist hands, Europe today is going down the wrong track. In Britain the choice could not be clearer in our coming election: to guarantee a decentralised Europe that works, only the Conservatives offer an agenda which can get the post-Nice process right.</p>
<p class="contents">To secure our European future, like the British, most people in Europe want to be in Europe but not run by Europe.</p>

George Bush talked about “points of light”, but Berthold Brecht said: “<span class="italic">die im Dunkeln sieht man nicht”</span> (you cannot see those in the dark), which brings me straight to the heart of my short speech.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact of the matter is that one in five people in this world do not have access to clean drinking water, primary health care or primary education. Europe, which is not only a trading bloc, but also one of values and standards, is an area that could make a huge impact on that level. Last year, we sealed an agreement with each other, on the other side of that table, on which occasion the Commission, the Council and Parliament put their signatures to Budget 2001. In this budget, they doubled the appropriations in all regional programmes for external aid, both for primary health care and primary education, not over and above but within the scope of the budget. Targets were set and extra staff were made available. It is of the utmost importance to our Socialist Group for the Commission to actually take steps now in its work programme for this year in order to instruct the EU delegations in the regions, and our counterparts, with whom we jointly do business, as well as our own service. We also want the Commission to make additional staff available for the purpose of acquiring expertise in health care and education, so that we can actually make rapid progress in this respect too. If the Commission takes this line, it will lead to a more results-orientated style of working, with less emphasis on the open-ended hoarding of budgets. It will mean that more effort will be made to achieve direct results in fields that are also extremely fundamental to development. It could be a fantastic signal for Europe to give out, i.e. that we are not just concerned about the fabric of society within our own borders, but also about what is happening overseas. I hope the Commission will deliver some sound results on that score this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So it comes as no great surprise to learn that a broad post-Nice discussion is now underway. It seems to me to be absolutely crucial for the Commission to keep the upper hand in this discussion, particularly as it will now culminate in a number of procedures to be established at the Laeken Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has now taken the initiative to produce an interim report by the summer and a definitive report by the end of the year, i.e. shortly before the Laeken Summit. Despite this preparation, it would be useful to set down a few markers now. Our group would also like to do the same in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, we must establish what the most serious shortcomings of the Treaty of Nice are, so that the post-Nice agenda has the right content. We believe we should be chiefly concerned with improving the democratic quality of the Union. The mistake made in Nice, i.e. the go-ahead that was given to start deciding on certain issues by qualified majority voting but without affording Parliament codecision rights, is indefensible, because it puts the national parliaments, as well as the European Parliament out of the picture. This will have to be rectified.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the highly complex decision-making processes will have to be reformed. The new rules can no longer be explained to the people, which surely cannot have been the intention. In this debate, I do not find the discussion about producing a clear demarcation of the areas that form part of the policy of Member States and those that fall within the Union’s remit, to be threatening. On the contrary, I feel it is step in the right direction. It would be better still if such a clear division of labour could be linked with the European constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must put a stop to the endless series of IGCs, which largely consist of officials. It would be far preferable to adopt the convention model, as used for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights. It is my fervent hope that the Commission will withdraw its idea to set up a forum, because a broad body of this kind is not suitable for reaching sound decisions. Moreover, a convention has the advantage that the national parliaments can take part as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We were the biggest provider of aid and support to Palestine and the region as a whole in the past and will hopefully continue to be so in the future. I am not satisfied with funding a process while others decide on its political content. We need a different role, a stronger role in the Middle East negotiations. We expect this to be understood not just as the job of the Council and the High Representative of the CFSP; we also expect an important, creative initiative on the part of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the content is concerned, we need the Commission's presence to be felt in the common European security and defence policy. Our Parliament welcomed the development in this area in Mrs Lalumière's report but – and here I should like to pick up on Mr Nassauer's Marxist digression – a spirit is abroad in Europe, especially in this area: the spirit of intergovernmentalism. Parliament wants a common, not an intergovernmental European security and defence policy. The Commission is duty bound, Mr President, to reinforce the Community dimension of this policy. You want to do it by making a contribution to crisis management and conflict prevention and I think that is a good thing.</p>

I would also like to highlight the important role which this report attributes to the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights, on which I would like to congratulate Commissioner Vitorino for his great contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">The Fundamental Rights of the European Union, Mr President – and now we will have to see how we can include this Charter in the Treaty – also have another side. To defend fundamental rights means to attack those who violate them within the European Union. And I therefore believe that all initiatives relating to the third pillar are of paramount importance to this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">This has been said today by Mr Poettering and many other speakers. For us, the communitisation phase of the issues, which, in Maastricht, were in the third pillar, is paramount. And I believe there is an initiative, Mr President, which the Commission has highlighted in its six-monthly scoreboards, to which we attach great importance: I am referring to the European arrest order.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that there can be no place in the European Union for terrorists, for those terrorists who yesterday placed another bomb in Madrid and who have tried to end the lives of people, of European citizens. I therefore believe that if we do things for real, if they can be done, if they can be made tangible, if they can be seen, such as that idea of putting the alleged terrorist before that judge who has issued an arrest order in European territory, European citizens will understand that this is what integrating Europe is about and that this is something useful. This is how we will make a real contribution to bringing Europe closer to the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I am sure that this initiative, which is one of the Commission's priorities, will soon be a reality. I would therefore like to encourage you to continue along these lines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I do not say this as a rebuke to President Prodi or the Commission, because the Commission is most certainly working or, should I say, making itself busy. Indeed it is almost making itself busy with too many matters. No one could possibly keep up with all the Green Papers, White Papers, communications and reports that the Commission and the Commissioners keep presenting, and it is impossible, more particularly, to find in all this a main theme, or a clear plan for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence, my first conclusion is that we should do less and we should do it better. As President Prodi quite rightly said this morning, we should not be expending our energy on measuring the size of cucumbers and gherkins. As a matter of urgency, we should be defining who is responsible for doing what within the European Union, in other words defining the principle of subsidiarity. And the Commission, even with good legal reasons to do so, cannot obstruct the decision of a national parliament to have a motorway built, a regional parliament decision to have a new railway built or a town council decision to build a golf course: that is what subsidiarity is.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission President appreciated as much this morning, he asked good questions, but his role is not to ask questions. The Commission has the right of initiative and must present proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not have time to go into matters in greater detail, but I have to say that if we wish to build the new House of Europe, then we do not just need joiners and plumbers, what we need as well, and more importantly, is an architect. My hope, Mr Prodi, is that, as President of the Commission, you will be this architect.</p>

I think that it would be right, if we are reading the signals correctly, to want to move towards a more collective, more democratic Europe; to want to move towards a more peaceful Europe, which seeks to resolve differences peacefully; to want to move towards a more ecological Europe, which respects and cherishes the environment; to want to move towards a more secure Europe; to want to move towards a Europe with a more highly-developed social conscience; to want to move towards a more efficient Europe, especially in the face of the challenges of the twenty-first century.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this debate, I think that the role of the European Parliament, which is where all the currents and all the trends in Europe officially exist side by side, must be an important one. And because today's debate, apart from anything else, has been full of poetry, drama and references to the axioms of older civilisations, allow me to close by referring to a political figure in Europe who is familiar to you all. I refer to Antonio Gramsci who, in his letters from prison, outlined the objectives which men and nations need to pursue in order to safeguard a better tomorrow.</p>

We need balanced progress in the internal market, in competition policy and in social policy, but again I do not see much evidence of that in the Commission's work programme. I would like to see, for example, a recognition of the interdependence between these areas of policy. In competition policy and internal market rules we need an amendment to the merger regulation to include considerations related to employment and social rights and the inclusion, for example, of social clauses in the public procurement framework. I would have liked a recognition of these inter-relationships, but I do not see it. I see far faster movement in the economic and internal market sphere than in the social sphere and there are real dangers of a growing imbalance in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore I do not see much evidence in the Commission's work programme of the social agenda agreed at Nice last December. We will see further progress in areas of open coordination, in employment – well established now – and the first steps in relation to social protection. I should mention the fundamental problem that key Commission documents are not made available to Parliament and its rapporteurs in good time. We need to have respect for parliamentary procedures in relation to these new forms of open coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on a specific issue, the Commission's work programme misses the point by a great distance when it promises a Green Paper on a corporate sense of social responsibility in the middle of this year. A Green Paper on such a code is a sick joke to the many thousands of workers who have been affected by restructuring in recent weeks. We need a complete overhaul of the legislation framework in this area and I hope the Commission will move quickly in that respect.</p>

However, I should like to call for a few basics; we expect the consequences to be evaluated and we expect you to think your initiatives over carefully so that they do not contradict any aspects of previous initiatives. This care – and I have an example to illustrate this – is sometimes missing, as for example in the draft which the President referred to on so-called family reunion currently being discussed in the context of immigration policy.</p>
<p class="contents">If, when we talk about family reunion, we mean the core family, i.e. spouses and dependent underage children, then it is an excellent measure, which is in the interests of integration policy and it has our full support. But if you then extend the circle of people which qualify as family far beyond those who would normally receive the right to move to the Union a year later, then not only have you clearly failed to consider the consequences, you are also contradicting your communications on future immigration policy. If you go ahead and extend the definition of family to unmarried partners, grandparents on both sides or students' live-in partners, give them the right to move here a year later, classify them as asylum seekers and also give them the right to work, then the immigration system will become unmanageable and uncontrollable and, in certain circumstances, all cases of immigration will come under your so-called family reunion system. Plus, you are depriving the Member States of the right to decide which and how many workers can move to the Union and you risk negating all the good points as a result. Mr President of the Commission, we want to continue to give you our support, but we can only do so if your initiatives do not contradict each other and if the initiatives solve the problems rather than create new problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am glad that Mr Prodi emphasised the overriding importance of sustainable development, which has implications well beyond the natural environment. We welcome the acceleration of the energy market, though there is a risk of that aim clashing with the aim of sustainable development. I hope you will pursue rigorously a policy of encouraging renewable energy sources and rational use of energy.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as trade is concerned, we agree that a new WTO round is desirable, again subject to the constraints of sustainable development. I wish to convey to Mr Prodi our very great disappointment at the lack of involvement by the European Parliament in trade matters, which could have been rectified at Nice, but which was not. I strongly urge you to work on an Interinstitutional Agreement which involves the European Parliament in trade matters.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe in reform and democratisation of the WTO. We believe the everything but arms move is a good step, although some of us regret the delayed timetable which sends a message of less than complete commitment to the least developed countries in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as innovation and research are concerned, we look forward to a detailed Sixth Framework Programme. If you present us with very vague proposals, that will certainly delay implementation and lead to concern and disappointment throughout the EU.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Ferber (PPE-DE)</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, it is your job to chair the debate, not proclaim your astonishment. Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has presented us with a tough programme of work for 2001, leaving us in no doubt as to the fact that it is hard-working and that it wants to be hard-working. But just seeing what else has to be done this year, merely in order to clear the backlog from 2000, i.e. from last year's programme of work, and I am already worrying that we will have carry-overs at the end and hardly any time left for new initiatives. In other words, you should have anticipated the need to focus on the fundamental issues to be worked out in the post-Nice process, namely the division of powers, and seen if you as the Commission, as the institution with the right of initiative in the European Union, could set a good example here. That way you would not need to carry so many subjects over to the following year, or even the year after that, and the people would realise just what important decisions are taken in Europe as a whole. I really would urge you – and I have read everything that you have proposed very carefully – to check if any of the subjects within the framework of a sensible division of powers are perhaps not absolutely necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a second point that I should like to touch on because I am a dyed-in-the-wool supporter of representative democracy. I am a little concerned about your approach to new governance<span class="italic">.</span> What I should like to know is what role an elected parliament, which must answer for itself, including to its citizens at home, has in relation to associations which have no such responsibility. It is here at European level that endless representatives of associations keep popping up and beating a path to our offices and one sometimes wonders exactly who has accredited them back home, whom exactly they are representing here in Europe. Surely the purpose of this new approach cannot be to give those with no credentials a say and to undermine those with credentials, namely us here in the European Parliament, in the process.</p>

I do not intend to say anything about the plethora of proposals presented in my area, i.e. on environmental policy and consumer protection. I do not intend to say anything about them because I assume that half of them will not be implemented and the other half will be carried over to next year. A German reference would read: tries hard. But you would not want to use it to apply for another job, because you would not get it.</p>
<p class="contents">When you talk of good governance, Mr Prodi, good governance also means self-assessment, evaluating your Commission and deciding what you have the time and staff to achieve. And while we are on the subject of good governance: what does good governance mean? What exactly is good governance? Is it transparency? Fine, Mr Prodi. We are all very keen on transparency, but is more involvement by interest groups selected by you and with which you alone negotiate more transparency? Not in my book.</p>
<p class="contents">And what about cutting red tape, Mr Prodi. Yes, I am all for cutting red tape, including red tape between Commission services. I am also all for cutting red tape in Parliament – she says self-critically – but are voluntary undertakings towards industry the solution? Are they any faster? And who controls them? Who imposes sanctions when they do not function? Is that more democracy, I ask you? You, Mr Prodi, were selected by the Heads of Government and your appointment was confirmed by us. But we here in the European Parliament were elected – directly elected – by the citizens of the European Union. This European Parliament has, by definition, a central role in civil society, as you so nicely put it, and I trust that you too can see that from your understanding of democracy. I warn all of you in the Commission not to tinker with the crucial role of the European Parliament, Mr Prodi. At the moment, good governance appears in the Commission's book to mean, first and foremost, governance on its own or governance alone and I urgently advise you not to pursue that course and call on you to confirm that it is the European Parliament which takes the decisions and also controls you.</p>

Last year there were 500.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi talks about bringing the European Union and its institutions closer to the citizens. I believe that the issues which relate to the creation of a European area of justice, freedom and security are, without doubt, very sensitive issues for the citizens of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to this issue we are in a very strange situation. The Commission's legislative programme is good; Mr Vitorino's proposals are good, they are clearly structured in the scoreboard, a timetable has been laid down for their application and we can talk about them and debate them. There is good communication on immigration – and I hope that Mr Poettering realises this – underpinned by a consensus on moving forward with a common policy. This also applies to asylum and judicial cooperation, for example, as the honourable Member said, in relation to combating terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">However, since Tampere and until last week in Stockholm, the Council has insisted that we have to make progress, has insisted on putting the emphasis on what was decided at that European Council in Tampere. In my view, however, it is acting in an incomprehensible way. There has been no agreement on any of the proposals that are on the table, not on family reunification nor on any other proposal. We are making very gradual progress but at the same time we are seeing a proliferation of individual State initiatives, which disturb the balance of the legislative programme. We are also seeing bilateral or multilateral initiatives and agreements which will lead us goodness knows where, in relation, for example, to the issue of Schengen in the Treaty. We do not know what is going to happen, nor how the work will be done. Schengen has been hijacked by the Member States for the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, you told this House that there are going to be delays in implementing these policies. You said this before Nice and you added that they were not going to be the fault of the Commission. I would like to ask you: whose fault will this be? What is your Commission going to do to defend this part of the legislative programme which, I repeat, I believe to be a good programme?</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the space of a few minutes I should like, not to answer all the relevant speeches, but to make a few observations on just some of them to reiterate our general approach. Above all, the speeches of all the Members who spoke after Mr Cox illustrated the problem of always working with priorities, taking them all together rather than one by one. It is clear that, if taken out of context, the huge number of 495 points in our detailed programme might seem an absurd proposition, but sometimes we have to break things down in order to show that we are being practical and then, as this morning, we need to outline practical priorities in order to present the right idea of what we are actually doing. I also believe that a government needs at times to be pedantic, at times tedious: we try to be both as little as possible but it is part of the job. </p>
<p class="contents">Today and in recent sittings we have presented a strategic scheduling programme. I am sure that Parliament will appreciate that I have pointed out the strict priorities, but these strict priorities will then have to be followed by detailed documents which will be extraordinarily tedious. But this is politics: first comes the vision, then the practicalities. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, everyone – including Mr Hänsch and many other Members – said that the Commission/Parliament report should be a question of working together. Mr Hänsch even talked of producing a single document. I do not know if this would be useful; of course, we will have to work together exceptionally well if we are to reach a common will, a single decision. Moreover, it does not matter whether the standpoints from which these decisions are taken are different or whether they can coexist in a single document; the truth of the matter is that we – in our committees and in our daily work – constantly perform a task of convergence, study and analysis, of laborious recording of the issues, something we are doing now.</p>
<p class="contents">For the moment, this must be carried out within a full agenda. This is the third problem which emerged this morning, as was pointed out by Mr McMillan-Scott, Mrs Maij-Weggen and many others. We do indeed have a complicated calendar: we all speak of 2004, but 2004 will be a year of radical change for Parliament and the Commission. If we really want this process to go ahead in an integrated, organised manner, it is clear that it will need to be completed by the end of 2003. I am only bringing this up as a problem we must think about but, clearly, in the spring of 2004 the electoral campaign will begin, in June the elections will be held, and then there will be the installation of the new Commission, which will not assume power until January 2005. It is therefore a year of change, and I believe that Parliament will want to play a full part in this major political change in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I am bringing this problem up, therefore, because I feel that it is now inescapable. I also feel that such a change cannot be carried out over two parliaments or at a time of transition or a time when the Commission has no power or, at least, is having its powers drained or gradually exhausted.</p>
<p class="contents">I am raising the issue as a problem which does not yet have a solution, but I think that it is only right to discuss it, because a date has been set - 2004 - which must be taken into consideration; it will lead to inconsistencies and problems which must be taken into account if we are to come any closer to finding a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Swoboda, Mr Hänsch, Mr Voggenhuber and Mr Corbett have pointed out another major problem area, upon which I would like to avoid any misunderstanding, regarding the structuring of the vigorous debate on Europe. We are all basically in agreement regarding Laeken; it remains to be seen whether we shall manage to make a success of it and to genuinely involve civil society in the debate as we have promised. In any case, we agree that Parliament and Commission must work together to guide this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Laeken, I would really like to avoid any misunderstanding: in my view, the time has come to establish the full structure of the debate on the future of Europe. I reiterate what I have said and I would like to specify that we must create an interinstitutional body with a similar structure to that of the Convention which worked on the Charter of Fundamental Rights. I repeat: it must be similar in structure but otherwise different, probably smaller and more practical. I am speaking now only of the model. But we must go further than that previous model. I go along with the suggestion made by Michel Barnier and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. This body will have to make proposals which do not necessarily require unanimity because there will come a time when we will have to make such far-reaching proposals that it will be difficult to achieve unanimity. We must therefore envisage a different body having the same objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">There are - and we must work on this - some points that are essential. Let me repeat them: that the European Parliament is involved and that the national parliaments, the governments and the Commission are involved as well. This is the essence and the strength of Europe. Of course, I agree with the objections I have heard - that it cannot be a very large body – and, given that there are four administrative structures to be represented, it will therefore be difficult to keep the numbers involved in this institutional structure, this decision-making body down. However, I believe that this is the great task we must take on: broad representation of all four administrative structures but a sufficiently manageable size to be able to take decisions; moreover, working on a majority basis and not unanimity, or we shall be paralysed. In this direction, I believe that we shall be able to work together and produce more definitive proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one more observation. We have undertaken to achieve two things: to associate the candidate countries – although even the meaning of the word 'associate' has not been defined, but it will probably not include voting rights; we do not yet know. This we must do, and we must accordingly think about the procedures necessary for achieving it.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, we agree that we have to go beyond the four Nice points. Let us therefore first sort out the nature of the task in hand, and then we can find a name: I would be very happy to call it an assembly, a council or a committee, I do not mind. In any case, I believe we must be guided by the nature of the task ahead of us.</p>
<p class="contents">Another set of concerns has emerged concerning the issue of subsidiarity and proportionality. I can assure you that this is a firm commitment of the Commission and it is not incompatible with the fact that, sometimes, we also have to make more specific recommendations<span class="bold">.</span> An interesting example has been given. For goodness’ sake, we do not have to standardise <span class="italic">curriculum vitae </span>forms, which differ from country to country, but it is a help which we very often need to give our young workers for their careers. This does not have to be compulsory but it is undoubtedly a tool which helps them to move from country to country more easily. So there we are: it is having the good sense to see that some of the things we regulate may even appear absurd, but they are done in support of the decisions we take. Then there are others, many others, which are completely pointless.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the emphasis was placed - by Mr Fiori and Mr Sakellariou - and this gives me great pleasure - on the Mediterranean. We have not discussed this topic much this year, which is understandable because we have been fully occupied with enlargement and the Balkans – and rightly so. However, there is a very specific programme for the Mediterranean: last year I went to Israel and Palestine; this last month to Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia; last week to Jordan, Syria and the Lebanon. I can assure you that there is a desire, a need, a call for Europe, not only to solve economic problems but also with a certain gratitude for the support we have been giving these peoples. However, there are two new important points which are being requested by everyone: the first is the change from a bilateral approach to something more, a multilateral approach; this will help regional cooperation, although it cannot be extended to the whole area but will have to operate in groupings, the Maghreb on one side, the Mashraq on the other. What is coming through is a strong desire for a Europe which is seen, by its very nature – precisely because it is Europe - to have relinquished all traces of a colonial past and any legacy which could cause tension, and which is seen as a new proposal and, above all, a model of cooperation they can follow.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point: a desire for Europe to be involved in their peace negotiations. Clearly, international issues will dictate whether there can be an answer to this question. I place it before Parliament, because it has affected me greatly: the request was clear, explicit, motivated by the fact that we understand their problems, that we encounter these problems every day. I have very strong feelings about the Mediterranean, not because I was born in that region but because I want to remind people that coexistence, peace, war, and compatibility between regions and cultures appear, in the main, to originate there. I would like to remind everyone of this, both because it is already a well-defined path and the Spanish Presidency is planning - we have had extensive discussions about it with the Prime Minister – a Summit on the Mediterranean during the Spanish Presidency next year. The preparation of this year, therefore, is a perfect opportunity to integrate this policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding sustainable development, I agree with what has been said. I would like, once again, to emphasise that this is an extraordinarily important but extremely difficult matter. Very often, in fact, we use this expression simply to save face, but sustainable development means taking decisions which are extremely complex and difficult, decisions which concern industry, our daily way of life, housing, or the use of energy. It is something of great importance and consequence and our great responsibility, which we cannot avoid if we want to do more than – I repeat – merely save face, something which can be done in other ways.</p>
<p class="contents">I have the same concerns over emigration and internal and external security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I strongly welcome the appeal made to me by some Members not to delay enlargement. I have to say: we are not delaying it. The Swedish Presidency has given great vigorous and personal impetus to this issue; Commissioner Verheugen has put an enormous amount of energy into organising the negotiation groups; they are relentlessly working through the various chapters. The great political decisions – agriculture, environment, structural funds – are now reaching the critical point, which will involve a very difficult period, a period in which political wisdom will have to come strongly to the fore, for it is this that will give the final impetus to the great process in progress. Earlier on, I quoted Kofi Annan, but, in fact, the process of enlargement itself is regarded by the United Nations and by everyone as a supreme message of peace and civilisation to the whole world. We must resolve the practical problems to make this possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish with a word on the invitation made to me by one of you, Mr Goebbels. I will say that the Commission is here not only to give opinions but also to make proposals on these matters and, if at all possible, also to take up Mr Goebbels' call to be the architects of the new structure: naturally with your help, your cooperation and also your scrutiny.</p>
