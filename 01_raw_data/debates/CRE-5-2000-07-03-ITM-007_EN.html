<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lehne (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we have here a very good example of cooperation between the European Commission and the European Parliament. I should like to begin with a few words about the history of this proposal for a directive. Since as early as 1991 there has been a directive to combat money laundering in Europe. This anti-money laundering directive essentially forms the basis for national legislation to counter money laundering, which may incidentally be something which people at home in the Member States had not realised, because they always assume that this is the work of their own legislator. He will also have had a hand in it, but the origins of the fight against money laundering lie in the 1991 directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the submission of a whole series of reports to the European Parliament – including from the Commission – it held a hearing on this subject in December 1995. The result of the hearing was that cooperation between the Member States suffered from grave shortcomings because the standard of anti-money laundering legislation was extremely varied. There are states, such as the United Kingdom or Germany, which have gone much further than the directive. Others such as Luxembourg have implemented the bare minimum, and inevitably this has caused serious problems. Even at that time Parliament called on the Commission to draw up a new proposal for a second anti-money laundering directive. This has now been done. We are grateful to the Commission for this, and I think that this is a good example of the Commission responding to initiatives emanating from Parliament and acting on them.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I must also make a number of critical comments. I believe that the Commission has overshot the mark somewhat in its proposal. It has, as it were, extended the scope of the rules which apply to providers of financial services and banks to other professions, which are also to be covered by the second money laundering directive and which are to be obliged to combat money laundering. But rules which were intended for banks are simply not so easy to apply wholesale to advocates, tax advisors and auditors because, for example, lawyers have a particular duty of discretion towards their clients and a special relationship of trust. It was our task therefore to rectify this in our consultations at the first reading. I believe that we have succeeded in doing so. Today we have created a situation in which the principles of the rule of law are still upheld, but in which legal practitioners remain bound to secrecy if they are either representing their clients before a court or advising them on a legal matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Only when lawyers fulfil the same functions as banks – that is, to administer property or money – is it clear that the same rules should apply to them as to providers of financial services, and I believe that this is also achieved through the amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we have made the identification requirements which were laid down more practical. It makes no sense for an estate agent to have to first have proof of a customer's identity before entering into business relations with him. This would make the job impossible. The amendments have also made this provision more practicable and realistic.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with the list of predicate offences we are critical of the fact that the European Commission has not defined the concept of organised crime. We rectify this in the amendments. Where fraud affecting the European Union is concerned, we have restricted the list of predicate offences to the really serious criminal offences, and we have not included any of the minor offences which appeared in the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage I should like to express my grateful thanks for the constructive cooperation which we have enjoyed with the Finnish and Portuguese Presidencies, and I am sure that in our further discussions we will also cooperate fruitfully with the French Presidency. With this directive we tried for the first time to make use of the new procedure in the Amsterdam Treaty which makes it possible to conclude a codecision procedure in one reading. Unfortunately we did not succeed. But it was not Parliament's fault. It was the fault of the individual delegations in the Council working group which had not brought definitive instructions from their capitals, making it impossible for the Council to submit to us definitive texts which were ready for negotiation.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we decided in the committee even before the summer break that we would enter into detailed consultations now in the first reading, complete the normal procedure of first and second readings and then await the Council's common position. This should not, however, prevent us from continuing to seek to cooperate with the Council on this issue because the Tampere summit made the fight against money laundering its very top priority, and rightly so. That is why we must all endeavour to achieve improved anti-money laundering legislation in Europe as quickly as possible. I think that this evening in this plenary debate we are also making a contribution to doing this, and I think and hope that good progress will be made so that we will have a second directive to combat money laundering in the European Union very soon, which will then I hope also be swiftly implemented by the Member States! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since the 1991 directive was adopted many external factors have changed. Firstly, we have had experience with the existing directive and secondly, we need to take account of the changes in the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the growing awareness that money is the main objective and driving force behind organised crime, appropriate measures also need to be taken which target the profits from organised crime. The financial interests of the Community also fall victim to organised crime, as the reports about combating fraud in the Commission show. This is to the detriment of the budget of the European Communities. The Member States protect their financial interests in accordance with their laws, but the Communities do not have a police force or judicial authorities with which to bring defrauders before a judge so as to recover the lost money and impose punishments. That is why the Community budget needs to be protected by means of directives, regulations and other measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 280 of the EC Treaty clearly states that, “The Community and the Member States shall counter fraud and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Community through measures to be taken in accordance with this Article, which shall act as a deterrent and be such as to afford effective protection…”. The Commission proposal should be seen in close connection with this article of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the crime which harms the Community budget is also organised crime. The rapporteur is right there. But there are also exceptions. Furthermore it is not always international organised crime, and here the Committee on Budgetary Control would have preferred the Commission proposal. However, we do recognise the delimitation problems and, if there is simply a reference to Article 280 of the Treaty, we are prepared to go along with the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, we believe that the money laundering directive is firstly about prevention and providing a deterrent and secondly about gathering evidence. The Member States need to have a legal base for their own and the Union’s sakes. All appropriate evidence ought to be used to punish fraud and other illegal activities which are to the detriment of the EU budget. It would certainly be in line with the Presidency Conclusions of the October 1999 European Council to proceed in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, for the cooperation which we have enjoyed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From an economic point of view, it represents an extremely unhealthy addition to the international money supply and helps to distort aid and reconstruction policies. This has happened in numerous cases which have already come to light. We have proposed a number of amendments in a bid to harmonise and tighten up supervisory arrangements and sanctions. However, crime is always moving into new areas, such as the trafficking in immigrants, trafficking in human organs etc., and is always finding new ways of laundering the proceeds. A great deal of work needs to be done. We feel that the revised directive does not go far enough, although we do, of course, support it.</p>
<p class="contents">Unbridled globalisation calls for ever-increasing political regulation, coordination, harmonisation and supranational bodies, on a scale and to a standard which is commensurate with organised crime. Take the example, the extremely important example, of offshore activities; the OECD recently published lists of the countries and methods used to launder money and the frightening amounts involved. We think the Union should help countries, whatever the country and whatever its political regime, which are used to hide illegal activities behind offshore legislation. It should help them to harmonise and comply with common rules, even the hopelessly inadequate rules which prevail in the Member States of the Union. We can do this perfectly well, without any particularly illegal infringements, by including clauses and arrangements to foster harmonisation in trade and other cooperation agreements with these countries. Otherwise, I think we are wasting our time.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The suggested extension of the directive to a new swathe of businesses and professions looks on the face of it to be both dangerous and burdensome: dangerous in that there might be a threat to the privileged lawyer/client relationship which is the linchpin of access to justice in a civil society, and burdensome because in theory this directive would now extend to your local high street jeweller.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is one thing to require a multinational firm of accountants to comply with this sort of regulation, quite another to require a small firm or one-person business to do so. I was attracted at first by the outrage of colleagues who said that this proposal represented the state turning lawyers and others into policemen on their behalf – but as I read and researched, my views changed. We must bear in mind, as has already been said by the rapporteur, that the proposal we are considering is before us at our request, at the request of Parliament, because we wanted to get to grips with money-laundering, with this international crime which represents a substantial threat to the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been impressed by the results obtained in England by the Criminal Investigation Unit, working with lawyers under what are already very extensive rules and regulations, but respecting professional privilege. They have been particularly successful. We should learn from that experience. In Scotland, lawyers are encouraged to see tough rules as self-defence for lawyers, protecting them against the claim of involvement in crime. We should as a Parliament stick to our original desire to tackle money-laundering strongly as a manifestation of organized crime and it seems to me that perhaps this problem will come back to haunt us.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a shame that we have not been able to deal with this problem as what it is, a matter of criminal law, but have had instead to deal with it within the strait-jacket of the internal market context.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This money is laundered and put into circulation in the legal economy. This poses serious dangers: a danger to the economy because of distortions of competition; a danger to the company of being undermined, and a danger to the state whose stability is threatened.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is so important that we take up the battle here against money laundering and prevent it from happening. Because if we succeed in stamping out money laundering then we will also stamp out organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I welcome the fact that a new proposal has now been tabled which extends the first directive. The situation has changed. Organised crime is using new kinds of businesses. Money is being laundered through different channels from the ones which were used in the past. That is why it is absolutely essential for the European Parliament, for the institutions, the Commission and the Council, to make decisions here so that we have a new effective instrument with which to combat money laundering. That is why we in the European People's Party support the fact that this directive extends the list of predicate offences to all areas of organised crime from which these proceeds are derived, and extends the scope to cover the professions and businesses which are abused or which may specifically be involved.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much welcome the rapporteur's efforts to propose an approach which actually makes the directive enforceable and practicable and thus into an effective instrument in the fight against organised crime. We will be firmly supporting these proposals from the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But in truth it means something different. Organised crime is the repeated, systematic committing of crimes by exploiting professional structures; for example, the systematic theft of cars, the systematic theft of credit cards and the like. This kind of crime has two consequences: firstly, the damage is considerable because it does not correspond to a single act, but to an accumulation of acts. Secondly, the money gained from the criminal acts is so great that it cannot be used up unobtrusively by private individuals. At conferences I always explain it as follows: organised criminals simply cannot eat, drink and be merry to a sufficient degree to get rid of the money inconspicuously. That is why they try to disguise the money acquired by criminal means and to pass it off as money which has ostensibly been acquired legally. This is called money laundering. Dirty money is turned into respectable money. Anyone who prevents this from happening, or at least makes it considerably more difficult, cuts organised crime to the quick, stunts its growth and damages its ability to propagate itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lehne referred to the fact that we already had a directive on this very early on which harmonised standards in the European Union. Nevertheless, this new directive is necessary to allow more recent developments to be taken into account. We think it is good that the directive is not just being extended to banks but also to other businesses or professions which might be abused for money laundering purposes, and here the problems associated with the liberal professions have been satisfactorily resolved in our view. We also think it is good that all forms of organised crime, and not only drug trafficking, are to be regarded as predicate offences.</p>
<p class="contents">We have attached particular importance to the inclusion of dealers in precious stones, dealers in luxury goods with a value in excess of EUR 50 000 and auctioneers. What surprised us rather was the fact that the Commission did not – although the problem is obvious – integrate electronic money into the directive from the word go. It would seem that the aggressive civil service intelligentsia within the Commission, who put a positive spin on anything to do with the Internet, drown out any critical murmurings about it also being possible to abuse this technology for other purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has disappointed us: so far it has not decided anything at all; it is behaving like a broody ox. I therefore say to the Council: make your decision quickly now! Money laundering is far too serious a matter to entrust to the cowboys and Indians games of small-time Councils of national ministers! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The amounts which change hands in the process run into billions. The fight against money laundering is also in Europe's interests. The excellent report by my colleague, Mr Lehne, seeks to improve the existing directive on preventing money laundering. Institutions, such as banks, and also individuals with similar responsibilities, such as notaries and lawyers, are to be involved in resolving crimes of money laundering.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, however, prevent possible new loopholes from opening up. Our aim will be to develop a pan-European information system to counter money laundering as quickly as possible. If we do not establish a collaborative network to monitor and combat money laundering then one day we will no longer have an overall picture of money-laundering activities. It must not come to that! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it would seem that the new directive is limited almost exclusively to the tasks, roles and responsibilities of the self-employed and does not evaluate sufficiently the growth in illegal trafficking which is, sadly, linked to uncontrolled and uncontrollable mass migration, particularly in the Balkans, which has consequences not only in purely financial terms but also in the wider social context in the countries which are already part of the European Union. It is therefore necessary and appropriate for us to avail ourselves of the results of the work of the money-laundering task force without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposes in the directive to lay down an obligation to provide information, but we are worried about the handling of the information. It might be appropriate to set up an authority or permanent monitoring centre, considering the considerable diversity of types of money laundering. The reference to banks or art dealers or auctioneers is too narrow in its scope, for not only tax havens but also Albanian pyramid companies and small commercial activities could be included which are a cover for illegal trafficking. Clearly, prevention has not been sufficient to date, so the alternative is now to resort to the budget to establish penalties. Finally, it should be noted that money-laundering operations should also be included in evaluations of respect for human rights because illegal activities are often linked to the arms and drugs trades and the trafficking of women for prostitution and children for paedophilia. Therefore, an evaluation of whether to accept a candidate State for enlargement should include careful investigation of its illegal money-laundering activities!</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The fight against money laundering is a top political priority. The fact that efforts have been stepped up to tackle the problem of proceeds from criminal activity is mentioned on a regular basis in the closing statements of summit meetings. Both at the Tampere Summit and the Feira Summit, the European Council asked the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers to approve this proposal, which provides for the scope of application of the 1991 money laundering directive to be updated and extended, as soon as they possibly could. </p>
<p class="contents">Parliament and the rapporteur have shown themselves willing to do their best to see that the proposal is adopted at first reading. With this aim in mind, a number of meetings have been held between the rapporteur, the president of the working group of the Council and the offices of the Commission. It pains me to have to tell you that the work has not come on as quickly in the Council as it has in Parliament and the discussions within the Council have as yet been unable to shed enough light on certain aspects of this proposal. That is why the dossier is now being submitted to this plenary sitting for an opinion at first reading as per the normal procedure.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Almost everyone agrees that the directive of 10 June 1991 on prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering has worked well. Although it is not easy to calculate a preventive effect, it has undeniably become rather more difficult for ill-gotten gains to find their way into the financial system in general and the banking system in particular in the Member States of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, it was clear from the very outset that the 1991 directive would have to be updated at some point. After all, the money laundering ban in the directive only applies to the proceeds of drugs dealing, which is now out of step with common practice at international level. In addition, Article 12 of the text of 1991 foresaw the difficulty of extending the obligations laid down in the directive to vulnerable professions and activities outside the financial sector. That is what we are discussing this evening.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, experience had taught us that a number of technical aspects also needed to be dealt with or clarified. The pressure on the European Union to step up its fight against money laundering culminated in the Action Plan to Combat Organised Crime, which was endorsed at the Amsterdam Summit in 1997, and the report and resolution approved by Parliament in March 1999.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The most difficult and sensitive aspect of the proposal is without doubt the extension of the obligations laid down by the directive, one being the obligation to report suspicions of money laundering and the extension thereof to non-financial professions and, above all, legal professions. As sensitive as this may be, the Commission firmly believes that when these occupational groups act as intermediaries in the provision of financial or business services, they should be subject to the same obligations as other financial intermediaries.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is grateful to the rapporteur and to the four committees involved in the compilation of this report for helping to have the professions included in the scope of application of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">With your permission, I would now like to move on to a discussion of the individual amendments. The Commission will adopt Amendments Nos 1, 5, 25, 30, 33 and 37 in their unamended form. The Commission is largely well-disposed towards the underlying idea or the intention behind the lion’s share of the proposed amendments, but would prefer at this stage not to go for a technical solution. It would much rather work towards a compromise that accommodates both the demands of Parliament and the wishes expressed by the Member States in the Council. This applies to Amendments Nos 4 and 12. The Commission would concur that there is a need for an adequate definition of the term ‘organised crime’. But given the choice, it would use the definition of organised crime arrived at through concerted efforts on 21 December 1998 as a point of departure.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Amendments Nos 6, 15 and 26, the Commission appreciates being able to rely on Parliament’s support for including a wide range of professions in the directive’s scope of application. As far as tax consultants and accountants are concerned, at this stage the Commission has not yet taken a definitive stance on whether the same conditions should be applied to these professions as are applied to lawyers, and hence whether a limited number of their transactions should fall within the scope of the directive, or whether the directive should apply more widely to these professions.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to Amendments Nos 17, 18 and 19, the Commission proposal sparked an interesting discussion on whether it would be appropriate to involve certain types of dealers in high-value goods, such as jewellers, art dealers etc., in the fight against money laundering. But the problem there is that more often than not, this type of dealer is not regulated at all and that it can therefore seem difficult, not to say impossible, to establish whether they have fulfilled their obligations.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue its search for a suitable way of bringing these dealers within the directive’s scope of application. But it would not wish this aspect of the discussion to lead to the adoption of the proposal being unduly delayed.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 21 and 22. The Commission recognises that differentiated identification requirements may be justified in specific cases. It will continue to work on this aspect of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 9, 10, 13 and 14. These four amendments concern definitions, and the Commission agrees with the reference to electronic money. In fact someone made a comment about this just before. I refer to Amendment No 9. The Commission is prepared to look into the extent to which UCITS (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) and collecting societies should fall within the scope of the directive. Amendment No 10 makes reference to this. The Commission views favourably the amendments concerning fraud in the Community, Amendment No 13, and the concept of ‘competent authorities’, as referred to in Amendment No 14.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 11. The Commission is prepared to work with the Member States to establish what the role of the market supervisory authorities should be.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 23. As far as the identification of customers is concerned, the Commission would point out that it thinks it is right to drop the Annex. However, it is still debating what would be the most suitable text to include in the main text of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 24. The Commission is prepared to consult with the Member States on any adjustments that need to be made to the amounts relating to insurance policies.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 31, 32, 41 en 43. The Commission welcomes the fact that there is support for the role of OLAF within the context of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 34. The Commission would agree that the concept of ‘independent practitioners’ of legal professions must be defined by each Member State. There is nothing in the proposal to stop the Member States from going further than the requirements laid down in the directive.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 38. The Commission is open to the idea of covering the gambling sector more broadly if it is practicable to apply the same supervisory requirements.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I now come to the amendments that the Commission is unable to accept, starting with Amendments Nos 2 and 3. These amendments seem to deny OLAF any authority whatsoever within the scope of this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 7, 8, 16 and 45. The Commission takes the view that these amendments could place too many restrictions on the application of this directive to the legal professions.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 20. The proposal cannot treat customs and tax officials in the same way as it does financial institutions or professions falling within the scope of the directive. This aspect must be left to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 27, 28 and 29. These amendments raise aspects of the 1991 directive that need no alteration as far as the Commission is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 35. One of the options available to the Member States is an appeal to the bar or an equivalent self-regulating body, and the relationship between the Member States and the bar or another similar body is an internal affair.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 36. The Commission feels that each Member State must decide for itself as to whether there is a role for registers of mortgages in the fight against money laundering.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 39. The obligations contained in the directive cannot be extended to beyond the territory of the European Union. The Financial Action Task Force is currently looking at the issue of off shore centres.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 40. The Commission cannot agree to this item being dropped because it would mean a cooperation obligation being imposed on the bar when this obligation can only properly be fulfilled by the normal anti-money laundering authorities.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Amendment No 42. The Commission does not think it appropriate to place a restriction on the use of cash in this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">There you have my response to the House, Mr President. I am sorry to have spoken for longer than originally intended but I wanted to comment on all the amendments since it is such an important subject and since all amendments deserve to be gone into briefly from time to time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
