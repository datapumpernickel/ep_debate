<p>I would point out that the laws promulgated in the Member States to comply with the annulled Framework Decision to which the honourable Member refers, are not automatically rendered invalid by the annulment. The decision as to the consequences of a declaration of non-validity of a Community act for the national acts transposing it is an issue of national law (see Judgment of the Court of Justice of 20 October 1975, Case 23/75). That said, the Commission must now decide whether to submit a proposal to the Council in order to include in the Directive in force an obligation for Member States to provide for penal sanctions to ensure that Community standards are respected as regards ship-source pollution.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0874"></a>

<p>As far as the European Qualifications Framework is concerned, the Portuguese Presidency has collaborated closely with the EP’s rapporteur to draft a text that is acceptable to all parties and which, notwithstanding certain procedural formalities, should receive official approval at the beginning of next year. It is hoped that this ambitious new instrument will prove useful as a link between different countries’ qualifications systems, acting as a translation tool making qualifications more comprehensible for Member States, employers and individuals, and thus enabling each citizen to move more easily from one country to another to work or study.</p>
<p>The second area concerns talks between Parliament and the Council with a view to reaching a consensus on the proposal for setting up the EIT (European Institute of Technology). If everything continues to run as smoothly and constructively as it has to date, it is likely that an agreement can be reached quickly at second reading at the beginning of 2008. Although they are not directly linked to the creation of the European Higher Education Area, higher education establishments will undoubtedly play a key role in the EIT, and it is therefore hoped that they will make a significant contribution to creating that Area.</p>
<p>In addition to these two dossiers, the Portuguese Presidency’s work in the area of higher education has focused on three issues. Firstly, on the conference held in Lisbon on 4 and 5 October 2007 to mark the 20<span class="sup">th</span> anniversary of the Erasmus Programme. One question arising from that conference – how to widen the Programme’s social dimension – was discussed by Ministers at the Council meeting on 15 and 16 November 2007. Secondly, the proposal to extend its ‘sister’ programme, the Erasmus Mundus Programme (and the Council is looking forward to hearing Parliament’s opinion on that subject), was also discussed by the Ministers at the 15 November meeting. Lastly, the third issue is that of finding the best way to respond to the modernisation agenda for European universities, on which the Council approved a Resolution at the same November meeting. All these issues can be regarded as making a contribution towards creating the European Higher Education Area.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0877"></a>

<p>Asthma is the major chronic childhood illness in Europe, costing the European Community more than three billion euros each year.

<p>The EU is currently funding a major research project (Gabriel) involving over 150 scientists from 14 European countries in order to identify key factors in the development of asthma.

<p>This answer was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States as such.</p>
<p>The Council has already examined several of the fundamental factors in the development of asthma. In terms of public health measures, in its Recommendation of 2 December 2002 on the prevention of smoking and on initiatives to improve tobacco control (OJ L 22 25.01.2003, p. 31.), the Council points out that given the health risks (e.g. asthma) linked to passive smoking, Member States should try to protect smokers and non-smokers from exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.</p>
<p>The Council recommends that Member States should implement legislation and/or other effective measures that provide protection from exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in enclosed public places and public transport. Several Member States have already effectively banned smoking in public places chiefly to protect children and pregnant women from exposure to tobacco smoke.</p>
<p>As for air quality, on 25 June 2007 the Council approved its Common Position on the proposal for a directive on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe. One of the proposal’s objectives for ambient air quality is the protection of human health, which includes targeting emissions of pollutants that aggravate asthma attacks. As well as covering the main air pollutants; special attention is given in this proposal to fine dust (also referred to as particulates) and to tropospheric ozone, as they pose a major risk to human health. This proposal will set rules for fine particulates present in the air, known as PM 2.5, which penetrate deep into human lungs.</p>
<p>As regards ensuring that asthma sufferers have access to health services and medical care, it should be borne in mind that organising the provision of health services and medical care, and in particular ensuring that consultation, diagnostic and treatment services are available for patients, is the sole responsibility of the Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0882"></a>

<p>Misuse of the drug khat is an increasingly common occurrence in Europe. Some 60 tonnes of khat are smuggled into my home town of Malmö each year across the Öresund bridge alone. The people affected often belong to traditionally vulnerable groups, such as refugees and those living in socially deprived areas. Young people and children are affected most. The efforts of the customs service to stop imports of khat, therefore, not only form part of the fight against drug abuse but also perform an important function in combating exclusion and social stigmatisation in society.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the EU does not speak with one voice on the subject of khat. In the UK and the Netherlands, the drug has yet to be classified as such. The outcome of this situation is that those countries currently operate as transit destinations from which khat - which is perishable and not storage tolerant - can be forwarded and smuggled into countries where it is illegal.</p>

<p>The Council is not aware of the projects mentioned by the honourable Member and has no information on whether the Bulgarian Government has applied – or what amount might be involved – for financing to build the nuclear power station in question.</p>
<p>If such an application were to be made, it should be borne in mind that pursuant to Decision 77/270/Euratom of the Council empowering the Commission to issue Euratom loans for the purpose of contributing to the financing of nuclear power stations, applications for Euratom loans are addressed to the Commission, which has power of decision on that matter.</p>
<p>It is also worth remembering that, notwithstanding the general loans policy outlined in Article 267 of the EC Treaty, the EIB is an independent institution and is headed by its Board of Governors and its Board of Directors.</p>
<p>It therefore falls to the Commission and to the European Investment Bank to provide information on the questions raised by the honourable Member.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0890"></a>

<p>(PT) This answer was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States as such.</p>
<p>In December last year, the Council noted that Turkey had not fulfilled its obligation of full non-discriminatory implementation of the Additional Protocol to the Association Agreement. The Member States, therefore, meeting at the Intergovernmental Conference, decided not to start negotiations on the chapters covering areas of action related to Turkey’s restrictions on the Republic of Cyprus until the Commission had confirmed that Turkey had fulfilled the commitments which it entered into under the Additional Protocol. The chapters are as follows: Chapter 1: Free Movement of Goods; Chapter 3: Right of Establishment and Freedom to Provide Services; Chapter 9: Financial Services; Chapter 11: Agriculture and Rural Development; Chapter 13: Fisheries; Chapter 14: Transport Policy; Chapter 29: Customs Union; Chapter 30: External Relations. Moreover, the Council agreed that Member States meeting at the Intergovernmental Conference would not provisionally close any chapter until the Commission had confirmed that Turkey had fully implemented the commitments which it assumed under the Additional Protocol.</p>
<p>The Council also agreed it would monitor and analyse the progress made on questions covered by the declaration of 21 September 2005 and invited the Commission to include information on this matter in its next annual reports, namely in 2007, 2008 and 2009, if relevant. In its 2007 report on Turkey the Commission noted that, since the Council Decision of December of the previous year, Turkey had made no progress whatsoever towards full non-discriminatory implementation of the Additional Protocol. The Council made a detailed analysis and assessment of the report at its meeting on Monday 10 December. In its conclusions, the Council noted with regret that Turkey had not fulfilled its obligation of full non-discriminatory implementation of the Additional Protocol to the Association Agreement and added that it would continue to follow up and review progress on those issues. However, I can reiterate how important it is for Turkey to deal with this issue as quickly as possible, as it is clearly affecting the progress of accession negotiations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0891"></a>

<p>This answer was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States as such.</p>
<p>The Council has been following the situation in Angola closely. The general framework governing relations between the EU and Angola is still the Cotonou Agreement and entails the political dialogue established pursuant to Article 8 of that Agreement and development cooperation under the European Development Fund. The dialogue provided for under Article 8 was launched in December 2003 marking the commitment, although it did lose some steam in subsequent years; the EU is now making endeavours to revitalise and consolidate this important instrument (for the record, the last talks were held in October 2007).</p>
<p>Relations between the EU and Angola have generally developed slowly in key cooperation areas established under the aegis of the Cotonou Agreement as regards, specifically, democratisation, development of civil society, respect for human rights, good governance and combating corruption. Hence there has been only a slight improvement in overall relations since 13 October 2003, when the issue was last dealt with in the Council.</p>
<p>While Angola has specific interests in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it continues to be an important partner as regards stabilisation of the Great Lakes region and has contributed to the EU’s Police Mission in the DRC (‘EUPOL Kinshasa’). Angola seconded 13 Angolan police officers over the electoral period (July 2006 to March 2007) to help the Congolese police guarantee safe elections. That was the first time the Angolan police force had assumed an international commitment of that kind. Moreover, the EUSR for the Great Lakes is in regular contact with the Angolan authorities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0893"></a>

<p>This answer was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States as such.</p>
<p>Preparations continue for the ESDP mission to Eastern Chad and the northeast of the Central African Republic, and this includes planning for the composition of the force. Thus far Belgium, Greece, Spain, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Romania, Finland and Sweden have pledged contributions to the force. The force will receive the appropriate equipment and support. EUFOR/CHAD/CAR will operate within the scope of Chapter VII, following unanimous approval of UN Security Council Resolution 1778, with a suitable mandate to match the situation on the ground.</p>
<p>The Council has been concerned about the peace negotiations in Darfur in recent months. In this regard, the June, July and October 2007 conclusions from the (External Relations) Council meetings clearly set out the policy line followed in many bilateral and multilateral contacts, including those by SG/HR Javier Solana and the EU Special Representative (EUSR) in Sudan. That line includes strongly urging all parties to play a constructive part in the negotiations and to reach an agreement to put an immediate end to the violence. Moreover, the Council has highlighted the need for an independent investigation into the Haskanita attack as well as cooperation with the International Criminal Court. The Council also stressed that it was willing to consider new measures, namely within the framework of the United Nations, against any party obstructing implementation of the UN aid package and the deployment of UNAMID as well as measures guaranteeing humanitarian supplies and the protection of civilians.</p>
<p>With regard to the peace negotiations in Darfur, the Council firmly supports joint AU/UN mediation headed by the AU and UN special envoys. The difficult start to the negotiations in Sirte last October posed a special challenge. At present, it is still not clear whether, when, in what form and under what body the talks can resume. Despite the difficulties, we are aiming for an ongoing process and in this respect much is being done to make the peace negotiations genuinely comprehensive with wide-ranging participation. We are clearly involved in a difficult and complex process, namely with regard to consolidating the position of different rebel groups and ensuring they participate in future talks. With this objective in mind, the EUSR in Sudan, Ambassador Brylle, remains in close contact with the main stakeholders in this process.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0898"></a>

<p>Israel and the Palestinians have been engaged in a political dialogue since last summer, starting with several meetings between Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas. The Council praised the efforts both parties made leading up to the Annapolis Conference on 26 and 27 November. The EU welcomes the holding of the Annapolis Conference and the joint statement by Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas on the immediate relaunching of bilateral negotiations in a spirit of good faith with a view to signing a peace treaty by the end of 2008. Such negotiations should lead to the setting up of an independent, democratic and viable Palestinian State in the West Bank and Gaza, uniting all Palestinians, coexisting side-by-side and in peace and security with Israel and its neighbours. It is also vital that both parties implement the obligations within the framework of the Road Map for Peace, in parallel with the negotiations. The EU welcomes the broad participation of the Arab partners at the Conference and urges them to continue to play a constructive role.</p>
<p>As for the EU’s role in this context – which the honourable Member refers to in his question – the High Representative, in full association with the Commission, has drawn up an ‘EU Action Strategy’, which analyses all the EU’s activities with a view to continuing support for the parties in their current negotiations and during the subsequent implementation period. This document will act as the basis for the EU’s future work, taking on board the results of the international Annapolis meeting, as well as the next Paris Donors’ Conference to be held on 17 December. The EU will step up its programmes promoting the creation of institutions, good governance, contributions from civil society and support to assist Palestinian economic growth, working in close cooperation with the Quartet representative. The Council welcomes Tony Blair’s work, especially the recent announcement he made regarding a series of quick impact projects.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0900"></a>

<p>This answer was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States as such.</p>
<p>The Council acted quickly and visibly to the recent events in Pakistan. Before the state of emergency was declared, the High Representative Javier Solana had spoken on the telephone with General Pervez Musharraf and had tried to dissuade him from taking that course of action. After the state of emergency had officially entered into force, the EU immediately decided to postpone a meeting of the Political Directors’ Troika with their counterparts in Islamabad, thus sending a very clear signal that under the present circumstances relations between the EU and Pakistan could not remain unaffected.</p>
<p>The Heads of Mission in Islamabad met soon after the state of emergency was declared and issued a statement that was widely published in the Pakistani press. High Representative Solana also made a statement in which he voiced his concern and called for a speedy return to the Rule of Law. In a third statement, the Presidency clearly formulated the EU’s demands to the Pakistani Government for it to: (i) restore the Constitution, (ii) create the necessary conditions to guarantee free and fair elections scheduled for January; (iii) release all political prisoners, including members of the judiciary, as well as Ms Asma Jahangir, UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief; (iv) honour the President’s commitment to step down as Army Chief of Staff by 15 November; (v) energetically pursue reconciliation with the political opposition; and(vi) relax the restrictions imposed on the media.</p>
<p>The Council also agrees with the honourable Member that, as a member of the Human Rights Council, Pakistan is especially bound to uphold respect for human rights and the UN mechanisms regarding human rights. [In that context, detention of or issuing arrest warrants against UN special rapporteurs is unacceptable.]</p>
<p>The Council is continuing to monitor the situation in Pakistan closely and is examining what new measures could be taken. Very recently, at the (General Affairs and External Relations) Council meeting held on 19 November 2007, Ministers exchanged views over lunch on the recent events in Pakistan and voiced their concern regarding this situation, calling for the state of emergency to be lifted.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0907"></a>

<p>This answer was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States as such.</p>
<p>Unprecedented cultivation levels and high production led to a 34% rise in opium production in Afghanistan in 2007. According to figures from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, opium production in Afghanistan reached 8 200 metric tonnes in 2007. Afghanistan’s share of global opium production increased from 92% to 93% in 2007.</p>
<p>If all the opium were processed into heroin, the yield would be 1 170 metric tonnes. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime also reports that most of the opium produced in Afghanistan is processed into heroin inside the country. In 2007, the number of heroin laboratories in the country increased. However, the precursor chemicals required for processing are not available in Afghanistan, which means they are imported through neighbouring countries. Afghanistan exports part of its opiates and imports precursor chemicals from neighbouring countries.</p>
<p>To halt heroin imports to the European Union, in May 2006 the Council approved a document setting out measures to increase EU support for combating drug production and trafficking in Afghanistan and reducing trafficking from that country, including the transit routes. The document dealt in particular with helping Afghanistan in the efforts it has made to combat drug production and trafficking and to cut trafficking from the country. The Commission and the Member States are the major international contributors to Afghanistan (EUR 452 million). Efforts are centred on alternative crops and eradication.</p>
<p>As regards transit routes, the Paris Pact Mechanism is used. Iran and Pakistan are also involved. A meeting was held recently in Kabul, which those countries attended. At a high-level meeting, which was held in The Hague under the consultation mechanism, the European Union suggested that round table talks should be held on the Black Sea/Eastern Europe and East Africa.</p>
<p>In its work in Afghanistan, the European Union is trying to give assistance an Afghan face, namely through the Afghan Trust Fund. Stemming the flow of heroin from Afghanistan has acted as the incentive for drafting action plans for Central Asia and the Western Balkans. Troika meetings are held regularly in Iran and the first high-level Troika involving Pakistan will take place on 12 December 2007.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0921"></a>

<p>With regard to the planning process, the Council approved the Concept of Operatons (CONOPS) on 12 November 2007 and work has already begun on the process of putting the force together.</p>
<p>Three force generation meetings have been held in Brussels, on 9, 14 and 21 November 2007. The process is proving difficult, as is the case with all operations, due to a lack of essential capabilities. We shall move on to the next stage – operational planning – when the difficulties of putting these scant resources together have been surmounted. The next step is approval of the Operational Plan (OPLAN) and launching of the operation.</p>
<p>The following third countries have been formally invited to make up the force: non-EU NATO allies and candidate countries (Turkey, Norway, Iceland, Croatia, FYROM, the United States and Canada), together with Switzerland, Ukraine and Albania. None of these countries has made any material contribution so far.</p>
<p>In the meantime, negotiations on the agreement on the status of forces have progressed satisfactorily with the governments concerned (Chad and the Central African Republic (CAR)) and should be concluded soon.</p>
<p>The UN and EU secretariats have worked in close conjunction since the outset. NATO’s non-EU European members and our African partners (the governments of Chad, CAR, Cameroon and Sudan) and the African Union (AU) and African sub-regional organisations (SRO) have been kept regularly informed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0923"></a>

<p>This answer was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States as such.</p>
<p>Broadband has been mentioned in several policies: e-inclusion, accessible digital content, the radio frequency spectrum policy, research and development and the regulatory framework for networks and electronic communication services are all connected with broadband, as are the cohesion policy and rural and regional development strategies.</p>
<p>In the Ministerial Declaration approved unanimously on 11 June 2006 in Riga at the Ministerial Conference on ICT for an inclusive society, ministers agreed to give priority to reducing the disparities in internet access between all regions and increasing the availability of broadband in under-served locations. The goal is to reach at least 90% broadband coverage of the EU’s population by 2010, in particular by using the Structural Funds and the Rural Development Fund and by supporting, where appropriate, the creation of broadband Public Internet Access Points. They also decided that national i2010 broadband strategies needed to be updated to provide additional guidelines and targets regarding coverage and connectivity in public administrations, schools, health centres and other key locations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission’s Communication ‘European i2010 initiative on e-Inclusion – to be part of the information society’, which was unveiled at the Council meeting on 29 November 2007, reports that the objective set by the Riga Declaration of achieving 90% coverage of the population by 2010 had already been met at the end of 2006, when 89% of the EU’s population had coverage and 70% of the rural population had coverage in 2007.</p>
<p>The same Commission Communication sets out a European Initiative on e-Inclusion which includes a strategic action framework to implement the Riga Ministerial Declaration by enabling the conditions for everyone to take part in the information society, by bridging the existing broadband, accessibility and tackling competences gaps, namely:</p>
<p>The Commission will stimulate regional initiatives on an inclusive information society through thematic networks in the framework of the European Commission initiative on ‘Regions for Economic Change’. The Cohesion Policy Fund will continue targeting investment in knowledge in areas where commercial deployment of ICT infrastructure and services is inadequate.</p>
<p>Regional and local authorities in the EU must drive the effort to bridge the broadband gap, including by using EU Structural and Rural Development funds, to promote an inclusive information society, especially in remote and rural areas. They must support infrastructure as well as e-services and applications for citizens (e-health, e-government, e-learning and e-inclusion).</p>
<p>The Commission will support in the framework of the ICT-Policy Support Programme (ICT-PSP) a web platform on regional initiatives for the information society, and will conduct a survey on EU funding for regional information society projects.</p>
<p>The Council is currently analysing two Commission proposals (one on repealing the GSM Directive and the other on mobile satellite services), the goal being to study the possibility of freeing up frequencies for wireless communication applications by allocating them to mobile services which might benefit rural and remote areas.</p>
<p>Regarding the repealing of the GSM Directive and consequently the possibility of frequencies being used by 3G services, it is hoped that the measure will benefit European citizens by significantly reducing the obstacles to the development of advanced mobile communication services and by helping to surmount the geographic digital divide.</p>
<p>As far as the decision on mobile satellite services is concerned, it is worth pointing out that the coverage which these pan-European systems offer will make it possible to improve broadband coverage in rural and remote areas, thus reducing the geographical digital divide.</p>
<p>In addition, the Member States are also planning their broadband strategies by means of National Reform Plans as part of the Lisbon Strategy, and some new Member States are drawing up specific national broadband strategies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0925"></a>

<p>Although the ICC has issued an international arrest warrant against rebel leader Kony and four of his commanders, Kony and his Lord's Resistance Army are still in the Garamba national park in the Democratic Republic of Congo, from where he is destabilising and terrorising northern Uganda.</p>
<p>The peace process between the LRA and the Ugandan Government, which has the explicit support of the Council, is making little progress. According to the latest reports, moreover, Kony has sidelined his right-hand man and important negotiator Vincent Otti. Cooperation was no longer possible because Kony suspects Otti of spying for the Ugandan Government. The departure of Otti, who was seen as a key figure and advocate of the negotiations, is a serious blow to the peace talks. It also seems that Kony is already regrouping and arming in preparation for the failure of the peace talks. According to the ICC Prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, food aid for the LRA is systematically being sold for arms.</p>
<p>In the light of these recent developments, will the Council exert greater pressure on the Governments of the DRC and Sudan to surrender Kony to the International Criminal Court, or is its preference rather for reviving the peace talks?

<p>The Council is fully aware of the significance of the execution of the four warrants (for the arrest of Joseph Kony, Vincent Otti, Okot Odhiambo and Dominic Ongwen) issued by the ICC.</p>
<p>The Council approved conclusions on Uganda on 18 June 2007. On that occasion, the Council reiterated its support for the peace talks under way in Juba and welcomed the appointment of His Excellency Joaquim Chissano as the UN Secretary General’s Special Envoy for LRA affected areas. The Council underlined the continued importance of reaching a peace deal that provides both peace and justice to local communities, and is compatible with the wishes of the local communities, national laws and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p>As regards the problem raised about the diversion of food aid and possibly other types of international aid, the Council will continue to raise these questions with the relevant international partners. As for food aid, the Council would like to reiterate that, in accordance with the Treaties establishing the European Union, that question does not fall within the Council’s competence. The EU, namely the EC, finances the food aid distributed by the WFP and, to a lesser degree, by NGOs.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0937"></a>

<p>The IAEA Director-General’s latest report, which was analysed by the Agency’s Board of Governors at the 22-23 November meeting, contains positive and negative aspects.</p>
<p>In the statement sent to the Board of Governors, the EU voiced its concern vis-à-vis issues that still need to be resolved regarding the Iranian nuclear programme and regrets that, just as the report states, Iran’s cooperation has been more reactive than proactive. It also stated that it was concerned about the fact that, as the IAEA’s Director-General reported, the Agency is receiving less information about Iran’s current nuclear programme and that, unless the Additional Protocol is fully implemented, the Agency will not be in a position to give credible guarantees that there is no undeclared nuclear material or activity.</p>
<p>In the statement sent to the IAEA Board of Governors, the EU also noted with mounting concern that Iran was continuing to flout the UNSC’s mandatory demands, stressing that, as the IAEA reported, Iran was still carrying out enrichment activities and constructing the heavy-water reactor at Arak. The EU urged Iran to heed the appeal made by the Director-General by applying the measures decided by the UNSC.</p>
<p>At its meeting on 15 October, the Council of Ministers of the EU reiterated its support for Security Council Resolutions 1696, 1737 and 1747 and pointed out that, in Resolutions 1737 and 1747, the Security Council had shown its intention to adopt appropriate new measures under Article 41, Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter if Iran refused to suspend its uranium enrichment activities. It further agreed on the need for the EU to consider what other measures could be taken to support the UN process and to achieve the international community’s common objectives.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0941"></a>

<p>The Council takes note that the ACP–EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, which met in Kigali in Rwanda on 19 to 22 November 2007, approved the Kigali Declaration on Economic Partnership Agreements. The declaration concerns relations between the EU and all ACP countries, including the African countries.</p>
<p>The Council views it as a proactive measure in the scope of the consultation and dialogue process on Economic Partnership Agreements. The Council welcomes and encourages this process.</p>
<p>The Council attaches great importance to wide-ranging consultation on Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs). In the May 2007 Conclusions on EPAs, the Council specifically underlined the importance of the ACP-EU dialogue on EPAs, in addition to the important role of dialogue with parliamentarians, civil society and the business community from both ACP States and the EU. That idea was reiterated, within the context of EPA monitoring, in the Council Conclusions of November 2007.</p>
<p>The Council recognises and welcomes the important role of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly in the Cotonou system. In compliance with Article 17(2) of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement, its role as a consultative body is namely to promote democratic processes through dialogue and consultation and to discuss issues pertaining to developing the ACP-EC Partnership.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0944"></a>

<p>This answer was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States as such.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member points out, due to the obstacles encountered by the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) whilst preparing to send observers to the Russian parliamentary elections on 2 December, it has not been possible to send an observation mission. The Presidency regrets that the ODIHR has been forced to take that decision, given that it has sent observers every year to a vast array of OSCE States without any difficulty. However, the constraints on the ODIHR’s activities, namely the invitation arriving too late, the limit imposed on the number of observers and the difficulties election observers encountered in obtaining visas left the ODIHR little choice.</p>
<p>Given that in previous Russian elections, most of the principal shortcomings recorded by international observers were related to pre-election matters, it is regrettable that the restrictions imposed by the Russian authorities have affected in particular the long-term aspect of an observation mission. To carry out an independent assessment of elections, it is crucial for the ODIHR to observe not only how the elections are conducted on voting day, but also during the election campaign.</p>
<p>With regard to the measures taken by the Council, the honourable Member is no doubt aware that it is ODIHR’s exclusive responsibility to decide whether to send an election observation mission. The Presidency has voiced its concern to Russia and will continue to do so over the coming days.</p>
<p>The Council will continue to voice its concerns to our Russian partners at the regular meetings and will urge Russia to respect its international commitments.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0956"></a>

<p>A large number of health programmes are being broadcast on television in EU Member States. The real aim of these programmes is overt or covert advertising of medicinal products, and in particular food supplements. People are not encouraged to eat healthily and to take exercise. They are encouraged to consume more and more vitamins and medicinal products. The consequences of doing so without medical supervision may give rise to health problems. In addition, the advertising often does not reflect the medicinal products’ real effects.</p>

<p>The EU legislation on medicinal products for human use sets out very clear and restrictive rules on the advertising of these products.</p>
<p>They were introduced in the beginning of the 90s in the so-called "rational use" package. This reflects the underlying objective, namely that consumption should be moderate and that advertising, where allowed at all, shall not promote to an excessive use of medicinal products.</p>
<p>These rules are now contained in Directive 2001/83. It forbids direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines and allows for advertising of non-prescription medicines under the conditions laid down in the Directive.</p>
<p>The advertising of non-prescription medicines must comply with the summary of product characteristics granted in the marketing authorisation procedure. It shall encourage the rational use of the medicinal product, by presenting it objectively and without exaggerating its properties, and shall not be misleading. Therefore, the advertising should not encourage the consumption of more medicinal products.</p>
<p>Concerning food supplements marketed as foodstuffs and presented as such these are regulated under Directive 2002/46/EC which foresees that advertising must not attribute to food supplements the property of preventing, treating or curing a human disease, nor refer to such properties. In addition the advertising of food supplements must not include any mention stating or implying that a balanced and varied diet cannot provide appropriate quantities of nutrients in general.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Regulation 1924/2006 on nutrition and health claims also applies to food supplements, notably to the advertising of these products. This Regulation ensures that any nutrition or health claim made is clear, accurate and substantiated. The Regulation on claims has been applied by Member States since 1<span class="sup">st</span> of July 2007, but the list of permitted health claims still needs to be adopted. Adoption is foreseen for beginning of 2010, after the evaluation of their scientific merit by the European Food Safety Authority.</p>
<p>It is important to stress that the implementation and the application of current EU legislation on advertising of medicinal products and food supplements is the responsibility of Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0901"></a>

<p>The historically high prices of oil (almost USD 100 per barrel) are due to a confluence of several factors, amongst which the following appear most important:</p>
<p>worldwide oil demand (mainly by non-OECD<a href="#defann_35_1" name="refann_35_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> countries, in particular China and India) increases faster than new discoveries and investments in production capacities;</p>
<p>OPEC's commitment to increasing production has been lower than demanded by consumer countries and expected by market operators;</p>
<p>unusually low stockpiles of oil and petroleum products in several large oil consuming economies (especially the United States), creating uncertainty in the market about the capacity to withstand even relatively minor supply disruptions;</p>
<p>regional conflicts in major exporting countries (e.g. Iraq, Nigeria) keep large parts of their production capacities out of function or under constraints;</p>
<p>persisting uncertainties regarding supply from Iran;</p>
<p>a weak dollar causing the suppliers of oil to demand higher nominal prices (as oil contracts are predominantly dollar-denominated).</p>
<p>Consumers are most visibly touched by this price rise through the prices they have to pay for petrol and diesel. However, it should also be noted that EU customers are relatively shielded from the implications of rising oil prices, due to the structure of taxes and excise duties in place which reduce the transmission of the shock. The strengthening of the euro relative to the dollar has also cushioned the price increase. A positive side effect of the current market conditions is that it can be expected to increase the public interest in energy saving and efficiency as well as in alternative fuels.</p>
<p>As alternative transport fuels are currently more expensive than diesel and petrol, the recent increase in the cost of oil (assuming it will be long lasting) significantly reduces the price difference. This renders investments into research, demonstration and commercialisation of technologies related to alternative fuels increasingly attractive. Such economic trends notwithstanding, the Commission is committed to devote a significant share of the energy research budget of the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme for Research into biofuels and end-user energy efficiency.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

We will need to reflect further on this important subject and on how to ensure most effectively that the EU is speaking with one voice. The Commission will make its own position on the wider aspects of the external energy policy known at later stage.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that a clear and coherent common position and similarly clear and coherent actions by the Member States and the Community in support of this policy will give the EU strength and credibility, as well as leverage in international negotiations.</p>
<p>The Commission shares the view that the Member States should keep each other and the Commission informed of, and consult each other and the Commission on strategic decisions which could affect the interests of other Member States and the EU as a whole. This would concern major bilateral agreements with third countries on energy projects. Solidarity and transparency between the Member States and the Commission would help immensely in ensuring that the EU actions are consistent with the interests of the EU as a whole. This is particularly true regarding regions such as the Black Sea and Caspian Region and Central Asia.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Eco-design<a href="#defann_38_4" name="refann_38_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> implementing measures for product groups, including standby consumption of all electrical appliances.</p>
<p>A working plan setting out for the following 3 years the list of product groups which will be considered as priorities for Eco-design implementing measures</p>
<p>To improve energy efficiency in transport:</p>
<p>A proposal for a Regulation on advanced safety features (tyre pressure monitoring) and low rolling resistance tyres</p>
<p>A proposal for a Directive on the promotion of clean and energy efficient road transport vehicles</p>
<p>In order to support the placing on the market of fuel-efficient vehicles, the Commission is preparing a revision of the Directive on car labelling<a href="#defann_38_5" name="refann_38_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Commission has proposed to bring aviation within the Emission Trading Scheme<a href="#defann_38_6" name="refann_38_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a>. This will provide an additional financial incentive to improve efficiency in the design and operation of aircraft.</p>
<p>The Commission has proposed<a href="#defann_38_7" name="refann_38_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a> to introduce a mandatory target for the reduction of lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from transport fuels. This will provide a stronger incentive for further improving energy efficiency in transport fuel production processes.</p>
<p>Moreover the following horizontal measures are foreseen:</p>
<p>A review of the Energy Taxation Directive to facilitate a more targeted and coherent use of energy taxation by integrating notably energy efficiency considerations and environmental aspects.</p>
<p>An examination, in the framework of the debate launched on VAT reduced rates, of the efficiency of VAT reduced rates in some circumstances.</p>
<p>A Reference document on Best Available Techniques as regards Energy Efficiency as a result of the information exchange under the IPPC Directive<a href="#defann_38_8" name="refann_38_8"><sup>(8)</sup></a></p>
<p>A proposal for a revised Regulation allowing voluntary participation by organisations in a Community eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS). This regulation obliges participating organisations to report on the basis of core indicators, including energy efficiency, and to continuously improve their environmental performance. These reports are verified and validated by independent environmental verifiers and are made public.</p>
<p>The Commission also foresees the adoption of a Communication on green public procurement setting targets for green public procurement and installing a process for identifying environmental specifications to be used in tender documents, including energy efficiency related criteria.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>For a whole variety of reasons (increasing scarcity of food crops, rising food prices, financial speculation, etc.) it appears to be the case that a rush to produce agrofuels might rapidly worsen the problem of hunger in the South, more especially in Africa. On 25 October 2007 the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food issued a report calling for a five-year moratorium on the production of crops intended for conversion into fuel: the idea being, once that time lag has passed, to move on directly to second-generation biofuels made from crop waste. Another possible solution would be to produce agrofuels from inedible crops grown on arid or semi-arid land. Will the Commission back adoption of the moratorium and/or encourage generous support for research into second-generation agrofuels so as to ensure that the globalisation of ‘green petrol’ is not brought about at the expense of the least developed countries and their small-scale producers, bearing in mind, moreover, that large agricultural producers and transnational companies are already in the best position to profit from the new situation on the energy market?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission does not share the view of the United Nations' special rapporteur. The recent increases in agricultural raw product prices result from a combination of low harvest, due to bad weather conditions, and an increase in the demand from large emerging countries. The Commission is of the opinion that a moratorium would ignore the potential of biofuels to improve livelihoods in rural areas, in particular in developing countries. However, the Commission will closely follow the possible impacts that "first generation" biofuels might have on food security.</p>
<p>The Commission agrees that every effort should be made to develop second-generation biofuel technologies and bring these fuels into the market. They will improve security of supply by diversifying the range of feedstocks that can be used. But the progress of "second generation" biofuels largely depends on the development of the "first generation" biofuels. The Commission is supporting the development of these technologies through its programmes for research and technological development.

<p>The Commission does not plan to propose renewable energy consumption targets at regional and local level in addition to the binding national targets.</p>
<p>However, the Commission encourages regions to set themselves targets as part of ongoing negotiations on Cohesion Policy and rural development programmes. Many regions have set local renewable energy targets. In fact, one of the agreed common indicators in the regional rural development programmes relates to the increased production of renewable energy.</p>
<p>So far, Member States have already allocated around € 8 billion to promoting renewables and energy efficiency at local level under Cohesion Policy funding for the period 2007-2013. It is however difficult to quantify the total amount of aid to regions, because additional contributions from other sources, such as the "Intelligent Energy – Europe" initiative within the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (2007-2013) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development will also play an important role in encouraging the uptake of renewables at local level.</p>
<p>The Commission is about to make a proposal for a framework Directive for renewables which would require Member States to submit national action plans outlining how they aim to reach the national renewable targets. For some Member States, considering the regional aspects, such as availability of resources in different regions, should be a key element to consider.

<p>For the preparation of the SET-Plan, the Commission has undertaken a detailed analysis of the strengths and weakness of the European energy technology research and innovation system, as well as of the different technology avenues currently pursued. These can be found in the Capacities Map and Technology Map, which are presented together with the Communication on the SET-Plan. The outcome of the evaluation is that innovation in energy faces many difficulties, but working closer together at EU level we can tackle those more effectively. We need to: acknowledge the vital and strategic role of energy technology to tackle energy and climate change; jointly plan our research and innovation activities; effectively pursue our objectives through more targeted and powerful instruments; increase financial and human resources; and, reinforce international cooperation.</p>
<p>Concerning the question of financing, the Commission would like to stress that it should be a collective endeavour, therefore we would need to mobilise public funds, but also the private sector, and certainly both at EU and national level.

<p>A recent study conducted by the US Blacksmith Institute (September 2007) found that the developing economies of China, India, Russia and Argentina pollute the environment not only of the millions of people who live near the industrial plants which cause the pollution, but also - unfortunately - of the entire planet, since most pollutants end up in the seas and the atmosphere, which of course do not respect borders. The polluted environment is also responsible for a number of diseases, as evidenced by the increased incidence of various types of cancer.</p>
<p>Fortunately the European Union has been quick to grasp the importance of environmental protection for human health, and all its policies have a very important environmental protection dimension. But what is happening to the world's environment? Findings are presented at international fora which reach official conclusions, but no substantive political initiatives are being taken on matters of substance.</p>
<p>Does the Commission intend to put pressure on the international community to take effective measures to protect the environment which ultimately affects both polluters and non-polluters, so that we can ensure a healthy environment for our children before it is too late?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The impact large emerging economies in particular China, India and Russia are having on the environment, is taken seriously by the Commission and bilateral co-operation has been stepped-up with these countries. Today every opportunity is taken to raise environmental concerns in bilateral and multilateral fora in an attempt to bring these countries on board.</p>
<p>Environment has become a cornerstone of the EU’s bilateral strategic partnerships with China, India and Russia and high-level Environment Dialogues have been established with these countries. These dialogues have resulted in concrete activities in the fields of air and water pollution, climate change, cleaner production and waste management.</p>
<p>The EU Summits with India and China in 2005 agreed to enhance co-operation on climate change by establishing Climate Change Partnerships. Under the EU-China Partnership co-operation is underway to build in China a near-Zero Emissions Coal Demonstration Plant with carbon capture and storage to address China's rapidly increasing greenhouse gas emissions from coal use.</p>
<p>Through our Regional Strategy Programmes for Asia and Latin America the Commission also supports the protection of the environment strengthening environmental governance and enhancing expertise.</p>
<p>The Environment and Forests thematic budget line (2000-2006) provided more than 300 million EUR to ensure that environment became an integral part of the region's development. The sustainable management of natural resources was among the key priority areas addressed.</p>
<p>Environment is also one of the key policy sectors to be funded under the Regional Strategy for Asia (2007-2013). Over 30 million €/year will be allocated to activities under the Environment, Energy and Climate Change heading. These initiatives will help to build the regulatory, administrative and scientific capacity needed in Asia to face today's environmental challenges.</p>
<p>The Commission also works in multilateral fora through various United Nations (UN) bodies, notably the UN Commission on Sustainable Development and United Nations Environment Programme, urging for greater international action to deal with global environmental concerns.</p>
<p>The Commission (representing the Community) takes an active part in the elaboration, ratification and implementation of Multilateral Environmental Agreements (Conventions /Protocols) and today is a party to over 50 environmental agreements covering issues such as climate change, protection of the ozone layer, desertification, nature protection, management of chemicals and waste, and transboundary air and water pollution.</p>
<p>In the field of air pollution, the Commission has played a key role in reaching agreement with partners (including Russia) to reduce pollution from heavy metals and sulphur emissions under the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP).</p>
<p>Globally the Commission has pushed for strong and effective implementation and further development of the Stockholm Convention – the key international treaty to protect the environment from toxic chemicals known as POPs (Persistent Organic Pollutants). The elimination of POPs requires important financial and technical resources. The Commission works closely with developing countries to help with the elimination of POPs.</p>
<p>This is just a snapshot of the many initiatives underway or in the pipeline and shows the Commission's true commitment to working in all fora to advance the protection of the global environment for all mankind.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0883"></a>

<p>First, the Commission is checking the technical and legal compliance of the measures transposing the Directive into national legislation in the Member States. These measures should place a responsibility on producers for the organisation and financing of the collection, treatment, recovery and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic equipment and in particular of lighting equipment. National legislation should also ensure that producers inform consumers about this separate collection, the return and collection systems available to them, their role in contributing to reuse, recycling and recovery, and about the meaning of the symbol – a crossed-out wheeled bin - marking electronic equipment. Compliance checks have already lead to infringement procedures against two Member States (October 2007). Infringement cases against other Member States are likely to follow.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Commission is assessing obligatory reports of Member States on the implementation of this Directive. A first reporting round was due for September of 2007. The Commission is currently assessing the reports. It will publish its findings in 2008.</p>
<p>Thirdly, Member States have to report on the quantities and categories of waste electrical and electronic equipment collected, reused, recycled and recovered within the Member States or exported. The first reporting is due for mid 2008.</p>

<p>The Commission promotes the protection of children’s rights both within the Union and in its external action. Initiatives taken are consistent with the "rights of the child" as enshrined in Article 24 of the European Union Charter for fundamental rights. Moreover, they are in line with what is foreseen in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
<p>It is also important to remark that Article 5 of the Draft Lisbon Treaty provides that “in its relations with the wider world, the Union shall […] contribute to […] the protection of human rights, in particular the rights of the child”..</p>
<p>The Commission is aware that environmental changes and specific hazards have a significant impact on the health and well-being of children.</p>
<p>Thus, as vulnerable part of the population, children are covered by the "European Environment and Health Strategy" launched by the Commission in June 2003 as the SCALE<a href="#defann_46_1" name="refann_46_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> initiative, where the C indicates the special focus on children.</p>
<p>The concerns of children are also integrated throughout the Environment and Health Action Plan adopted in June 2004.</p>
<p>In this framework, the Commission is addressing the effects of environmental pressures on children's health in a range of research projects. For example, research projects on "susceptibility" have been funded in order to adjust policy responses to the needs of children in those cases where they are specifically vulnerable.</p>
<p>A particular concern relates to air pollution, which poses significant risks to human health. Sensitive groups including children are those suffering the most adverse health impacts.</p>
<p>Therefore, in addition to Community measures that are in place with the objective of improving ambient air quality and that are aimed at the public at large, there are further provisions for the sensitive groups. The ozone information threshold to prevent even brief excessive exposure of specific parts of the population is one example.</p>
<p>In addition, the new Air Quality Directive - currently in 2<span class="sup">nd</span> reading<a href="#defann_46_2" name="refann_46_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> -, includes objectives set specifically to push for reduction of urban background concentrations of fine particles PM2.5. This is expected to bring the largest health benefits in particular within the sensitive groups - including children.</p>
<p>Children's exposure to indoor environments is also of particular concern. The Commission has set up an expert working group on indoor air quality to give advice on possible policy initiatives in this area and has funded several research programmes related to this.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Under the Water Framework Directive (WFD)<a href="#defann_47_2" name="refann_47_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> Member States are required to set up, by 2010, water pricing policies that serve the dual purpose of recovering the costs of water services and giving users of services an incentive to use water in a sustainable way.</p>
<p>The mechanisms for estimating these costs (financial costs as well as environmental and resource costs), enforcing such cost recovery and estimating the adequate contribution of different water users must be part of the River Basin Management Plans (cf. Article 13 WFD) to be established by end 2009. They must be then reported to the Commission by the Member States by 22 March 2010.</p>
<p>Whilst the WFD sets out the principal obligations, it is for the Member States to develop the details of their water pricing policy in line with subsidiarity.</p>
<p>To support this work, the Commission initiated and organized the preparation of an informal guidance document and other supporting tools to implement the economic instruments of the WFD. This has been carried out in close cooperation with the Member States<a href="#defann_47_3" name="refann_47_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>When developing the River Basin Management Plans, Member States are required to consult the public. Draft River Basin Management Plans shall be made available for consultation in December 2008. At that moment, interested parties can express their views on the planned measures including those selected for the recovery of costs.</p>
<p>The WFD states that Member States may take into account social and economic considerations when establishing the level of cost recovery for different users (cf Article 9.1). Moreover, Member States can exempt specific water use activities from the provisions of Article 9(1) where this does not compromise the achievements of the objectives of the Directive (cf Article 9.4).</p>
<p>Furthermore, transparency of water pricing structures is crucial for such economic instruments to be effective. The WFD does not itself prescribe provisions as regards consumer protection, as this would be outside the scope of its legal basis. In line with subsidiarity, it is for the Member States to set up appropriate mechanisms. Physical persons can however seek redress via Directive 93/13/EEC on unfair terms in consumer contracts<a href="#defann_47_4" name="refann_47_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Some 60 plants are involved, requiring development costing at least 1 billion SEK. Most are located in Norrland and south-central Sweden. The organisation representing the waste water treatment plants, the Swedish Water &amp; Wastewater Association, has accused the Commission of having insufficient knowledge about the matter. The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency has established that a conversion would not have any positive impact. Researchers and public authorities in Sweden are agreed that nitrogen is not the primary cause of eutrophication of the Baltic but phosphorus, which the Swedish treatment plants eliminate almost entirely.</p>
<p>On what grounds has the Commission decided that the conversion of Swedish waste water treatment plants would actually improve nitrogen treatment? To what extent does the Commission consider that the present treatment plants are the cause of cross-border environmental problems?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Baltic Sea is one of the most eutrophied water areas in Europe because of the high concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen.</p>
<p>Agriculture and insufficiently treated waste water are the main sources of these nutrient inputs.</p>
<p>This conclusion is notably included in the Baltic Sea Action Plan adopted on 15 November 2007 by HELCOM, the Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea, to which Sweden is a party.</p>
<p>HELCOM has estimated that annual reductions of some 15,000 tonnes of phosphorus and 135,000 tonnes of nitrogen would be required to achieve a good ecological status in the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>In order to protect the environment from the adverse effects of waste water discharges, the European Union adopted in 1991 a Directive on the treatment of urban waste water, which lays down relevant deadlines and conditions<a href="#defann_48_1" name="refann_48_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> in this area. A key feature of this Directive is the identification of sensitive areas where more stringent treatment for waste water is required.</p>
<p>The fact that eight Member States around the Baltic Sea have designated their coastal waters as sensitive under the Urban Waste Water Directive is a confirmation of the fact that the eutrophication of the Baltic Sea is a cross-border environmental problem.</p>
<p>The treatment plants referred to in the question are discharging water which ends up in areas that Sweden has defined as sensitive. The deadline for introducing stringent water treatment in such plants was 31 December 1998.</p>
<p>As Sweden had not complied with this obligation, the Commission started an infringement procedure against Sweden in 2002. In fact, the Commission considered that Sweden, taking into account both its obligations under the Urban Waste Water Directive and the high degree of eutrophication of the Baltic Sea as a whole, needs to remove nitrogen from the waste water.</p>
<p>A reduction of nitrogen discharges from Swedish waste water will benefit the Baltic Sea as a whole.</p>
<p>It is however positive to see that Sweden is taking other steps in this area. It is for example worth mentioning that, in April 2007, Sweden agreed, in the framework of the Council of Baltic Sea States, to increase waste water treatment in order to further remove nitrogen.</p>
<p>Reducing the eutrophication of the Baltic Sea is one of our responsibilities in ensuring the best possible environmental conditions in Europe.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>'Mind Compass Parks A.E.' intend to build a desalination plant at Koilada in the municipality of Kranidi on the basis of a study which has been assessed as riddled with faults by the Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable Development of the Hellenic Technical Chamber. The purpose of the plant is to supply water to tourist facilities, such as those under construction at Delpriza - Killada Hills and Seascape Hills - and to make commercial use of the water produced. The construction of this plant will have a particularly negative impact on fishing, agricultural production and public health, as well as disastrous consequences for the environment in the Gulf of Koilada, site of the ancient city of Massitos.

<p>The Commissioner in charge of Environment is currently in Bali at the United Nations climate change conference, where the EU hopes, as do many of our partners, that the international community will agree to launch negotiations on a new global and comprehensive climate change agreement for the period after 2012. The Commissioner spoke about this at length during the November plenary debate on Bali<a href="#defann_50_1" name="refann_50_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>As he explained, the EU's climate and energy strategy and the work we have done with key global partners over the course of this year, including at the recent EU-China and EU-India Summits, has been instrumental in setting the level of ambition for Bali as well as the architecture of any post-2012 climate agreement.</p>
<p>Our projections show that, in order to achieve our objective of limiting global climate change to 2ºC, global emissions reductions of at least 50% compared to 1990 levels are needed by 2050. The targets which the EU has set itself are in line with achieving this level of ambition, but only if others also act.</p>
<p>To show true leadership, the EU must deliver at home. The Commission will adopt the climate and energy implementing proposals early next year that will provide the necessary tools to reach our targets for at least 20% unilateral emission reductions and 30% in case of an international agreement whereby other developed countries commit to comparable efforts.</p>
<p>The pressure is now on our developed country partners to follow suit in taking the lead and making ambitious commitments to absolute emissions reductions. We cannot expect others to take action on the scale needed if we are not.</p>
<p>Projections for emissions growth worldwide however leave no doubt - developing countries must also contribute – not necessarily through absolute emissions reductions at this stage, but they should slow the rate of emission growth, and we stand ready to help. We must get global emissions of greenhouse gases to peak in the next 10 to 15 years. Only this brings us on a path of keeping global average temperature rise within the 2 degree limit.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

These are the Baltic Sea and the North Sea and English Channel respectively. As a result, ships passing through these areas are only allowed to use fuel with a maximum sulphur content of 1.5% by weight (or 15.000 mg/kg or ppm). This is around 40% less than the average fuel used by international shipping (2.7%). This requirement also applies to passenger ships operating on regular services to or from any Community port.

<p>It is evident, however, that more has to be done to reduce air pollution from ships. Even with the measures mentioned, total sulphur oxide (and nitrogen oxide) emissions from ships in European waters will be as high as all land-based sources combined by 2020.

These provisions include incentives about sustainable water use as well as efficiency and reuse measures.</p>
<p>The Commission has addressed water scarcity and droughts in its Communication to the Parliament and to the Council of 18 July 2007 "Addressing the challenge of water scarcity and droughts in the European Union"<a href="#defann_53_5" name="refann_53_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>. It fosters, among others, 'water-efficient technologies and practice'.</p>
<p>Agricultural and Cohesion policy and the use of their Funds support the implementation of the Acquis Communautaire; therefore they can contribute for the above-mentioned purpose.</p>
<p>In practice the reuse of treated waste water is nowadays practised in the EU and Mediterranean countries and beyond.</p>
<p>In addition, a comprehensive document "Mediterranean Wastewater Reuse Report" has been elaborated by experts from participating countries, stakeholders and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) during 2007 under the joint chairmanship of the Commission and Malta. It assesses current knowledge and experience (including detailed case studies), provides an overview of related benefits and risks, outlines applicable European Union environmental legislation as well as legislative frameworks in several countries, and provides a set of recommendations.</p>

<p>Under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) commercial international trade in tigers and tiger products has been prohibited since 1975.</p>
<p>The Commission is nevertheless very concerned by the continuing poaching and illegal trade that are threatening the remaining tiger populations in the wild.</p>
<p>The Community is fully committed to CITES and plays a key role within the Convention, in particular in order to ensure that its provisions are effectively implemented and enforced. The Community fully supported the decisions aimed at strengthening enforcement and conservation efforts for tigers, which were adopted at the 14<span class="sup">th</span> Conference of the Parties to CITES (CITES CoP14) in June 2007.</p>
<p>The Commission is of the view that CITES Parties must give greater priority to combating illegal trade in wildlife. In this vein, the Commission adopted an EU Action Plan on CITES Enforcement in June 2007. The Community also put forward a proposal, which was adopted at CITES CoP14, aimed at strengthening law enforcement and improving regional cooperation.</p>
<p>The Commission has on numerous occasions expressed its willingness to provide funding and technical assistance to India in order to support conservation programmes for the species and address poaching. Whilst such funding and assistance has not yet been requested by India, the Commission has provided funding through its multilateral programme for an Asian CITES implementation and enforcement workshop in China in 2005. This workshop addressed enforcement issues and regional cooperation in combating illegal trade in tiger products. The Commission also intends to provide funding for a CITES tiger trade enforcement meeting due to take place in 2008.</p>
<p>The Commission has urged China to step up its efforts to tackle illegal wildlife trade. Whilst the Commission understands that China has made progress in improving enforcement of CITES, the Commission intends to raise the matter with them again at relevant opportunities in order to ensure that CITES is effectively being enforced.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0960"></a>

<p>The quantity of CO2 emissions allocated to Bulgaria by EC decision of 26 October 2007 for the period 2007-2012 amounts to 42.27 m t CO2 eqv. This is a reduction of 37. 4% compared to the requested quota and drastically decreases the opportunities for development and growth of the poorest country among the EU Member States and its main industrial sectors. Why is there such a large difference?</p>
<p>The Commission has wrongfully accepted data presented by Bulgaria in its year 2005 plan as a starting point for analysis and calculations, without taking into account the basic circumstances in the country as required by Directive 2003/87/CE<a href="#defann_55_1" name="refann_55_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The Commission has ignored the closing of reactors 3 and 4 of the Kozlouduy nuclear power plant, which eliminates about 17 m t CO2 eqv a year. The Commission is evaluating the carbon intensity of the Bulgarian economy by using the nominal GDP instead of GDP per PPP. Furthermore, basic documents (PRIMES model update) needed for preparations were not available, not coordinated and delayed.

<p>In evaluating National Allocation Plans (NAPs) submitted by Member States, the Commission followed a transparent and consistent methodology. The methodology used 2005 emissions as a basis for projecting future emissions in the 2008-2012 period, and took account of future Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth and expected improvements in carbon intensity. The methodology was applied in an equal manner to all Member States. Given that no verified 2005 emissions data were available in the case of Bulgaria, the Commission used 2005 emissions data provided in the Bulgarian NAP.</p>
<p>When using 2005 as a basis for its calculations, the Commission took account of the closure of two reactors at the Kozloduy nuclear power plant. Bulgaria receives funding from the EU to improve the capacity utilisation of the remaining Kozloduy reactors and to invest in renewables and energy efficiency. In addition, Bulgaria exported a significant share of electricity generated in Kozloduy.</p>
<p>The Commission used the PRIMES model as a basis for its own assessment because it was the best available tool at its disposal. It is a robust economic model developed by independent experts and based on up-to-date economic theory. Its input data are provided on a regular basis by Member States. The model has already been used for policy decisions by the Commission and other public institutions. Moreover, it covers all of the 27 Member States of the European Union.</p>

<p>Agricultural commodities have shown very significant price increases over the last few months, in particular for wheat, maize, poultry and many dairy products. There are several reasons for these developments. Some are of a structural nature: they had already caused prices over the last 18 months to reach firmer levels than those observed for more than a decade and were largely anticipated in the medium-term prospects for agricultural markets that the Commission published in July 2007.</p>
<p>Besides these structural factors the agricultural sector has been hit over the most recent months by a series of adverse climatic conditions in many producing and exporting regions. The combination of these structural and short-term factors has generated very tight market conditions generating a sharp rise in the market prices of many agricultural commodities.</p>
<p>The management and monitoring of agricultural markets by the Commission are based on regular and in-depth market analysis for both the short and medium term, and although the Commission does note elaborate short-term price forecasts as such, it is increasingly clear that the impact of these short-term factors on prices should slowly decline over the next few months.</p>
<p>Under a medium-term perspective and with all the caution necessary when analysing these market developments, the Commission is of the opinion that structural factors, such as the growth in global food demand and the development of new market outlets, can be reasonably expected to maintain prices at sustained levels, though at lower levels than those recently observed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0876"></a>

<p>One of the major objectives of the policy of the European Union in the rail sector is to create a regulatory framework which supports the competitiveness of this mode of transport, which knew a period of steady decline in its transport share until recently. The recipe chosen was to progressively open the rail markets so that internal gains in terms of efficiency, reliability and accessibility could also be translated into external advantages as compared to other modes of transport, such as air transport.</p>
<p>The opening of high speed lines enabled rail to obtain significant market shares on routes where transport by air was previously dominant. The effort spent by the European Community to support the development of a European high speed rail network has been remarkable as far as the financial assistance and technical harmonisation are concerned.</p>
<p>The recent adoption of the legislative proposal to open the market for international rail passenger services by January 2010 will support this move.

<p>The obligation to stamp out scrapie positive animals and the problems with the supply of feed was already a heavy burden on sheep and goat borders in Cyprus. The outbreak of Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) is adding a further blow to Cypriot farmers.</p>
<p>Although exports of the famous cheese halloumi will not be affected by sanitary restrictions it is clear that its production is undermined by the fact that the particular sheep breed, Chios is necessary for the traditional production of halloumi. The replacement of animals culled for health reasons will only take place whenever suitable animals will become available.</p>
<p>Community expenditure for FMD is managed under the so called "veterinary fund". Council Decision 90/424/EEC allows the Commission to reimburse the expenses incurred by a Member State to control FMD. For FMD the rate of co-financing is set at 60% for compensations made to owners for the slaughter and destruction of animals, the destruction of milk, the cleaning and disinfection of holdings, the destruction of contaminated feeding stuffs and, where it cannot be disinfected, contaminated equipment. It may also compensate for transport of carcases to processing plants. Commission Regulation (EC) No 349/2005 sets out implementing rules for these measures.</p>

<p>The Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs is the correct basis for the European response to globalisation. Europe falls far short in achieving success in shaping globalisation, under the broad approach agreed at the Hampton Court summit in October 2005 and centred on the Lisbon Growth and Jobs Strategy, renewed in the spring of 2005 after its original launch in 2000. Furthermore, globalisation is constantly evolving and progress towards the achievement of the Lisbon goals has been rather disappointing. R&amp;D must be increased, but targets must be realistic and be clearly justified. The current Lisbon target of 3 per cent of EU GDP for R&amp;D spending is neither and should be recast.</p>
<p>What measures has the Commission already taken to ensure that Europe will jointly reinforce its external and internal policies in order to be ready to adjust them in the light of events, such as changes in energy markets or the recent financial instability, and in order to achieve the Lisbon targets?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The European Union's response to globalisation has moved to the heart of the EU policy agenda. The relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy in Spring 2005 put Europe back on track to face up to competition as the touchstone for creating growth and jobs in the modern global economy. As part of the response to the informal meeting at Hampton Court in October 2005, the Spring European Council in 2006, Heads of State and Government stressed the need to move up a gear in the work of the renewed Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs in order to spearhead the response of the European economy.</p>
<p>The EU is working on many of the policy elements needed to equip it to take on the challenge of globalisation. The good results of the renewed Lisbon Strategy are clearly visible as we approach the end of the first three-year cycle of reforms. Budget deficits have been reduced from 2.5% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2005 to a forecasted 1.1% in 2007, whilst public debt has declined from 62.7% in 2005 to just below 60% in 2007. Productivity growth reached 1.5% in 2006, compared to an annual growth rate of 1.2% between 2000 and 2005. The EU-United States (US) productivity gap has started to diminish with some indications that factors other than the favourable cycle are also at work. Economic growth was 3.0% in EU-27 in 2006 (compared to 1.8% in 2005) and is expected to remain at 2.9% and 2.4% in 2007 and 2008. Almost 6.5 million new jobs have been created in the last two years. Another 5 million jobs are expected to be created up to 2009. Unemployment is expected to fall to under 7%, the lowest level since the mid-80's. The employment rate, currently at 66%, has moved much closer to the overall Lisbon target of 70%.</p>
<p>As the pace of change accelerates, the areas of work need to be stepped up to boost the capacity of the EU to shape the globalisation agenda. The Commission is putting new ideas on the table to address these key challenges:</p>
<p>- Getting the most from the Internal Market: The EU single market gives Europeans a solid foundation on which to adapt to globalisation and structural change. In its Single Market Review of 20 November 2007, the Commission has set out a package of initiatives to modernise the European single market and to bring more benefits to Europeans, building on past successes. The single market has already helped create competitive companies, reduced prices, more choice for consumers and a Europe attractive for investors. The Commission's measures are based on extensive consultation. They will ensure that the single market does even more to take advantage of globalisation, empower consumers, open up for small businesses, stimulate innovation and help maintain high social and environmental standards. Among the most important policy actions set out in the single market package are initiatives to: help consumers to exercise their contractual rights and get redress across borders; provide better information for consumers and small businesses; respond to weaknesses in sectors where the single market should deliver more; propose a Small Business Act; and introduce a "researcher passport"; clarify how EU rules apply to services and social services of general interest; and promote the quality of social services across the EU. Due to globalization, regulatory dialogues with our key partners have also become a priority. Their aim is, notably, to foster greater economic integration. It is also to develop convergence towards high quality standards (for instance in the case of accounting) and to develop multilateral responses to global challenges, such as in the case of the current financial turmoil. The EU has developed such dialogues with US, China, Japan, Russia and India.</p>
<p>- Responding to Europe's new social realities: The ongoing stocktaking of Europe's social realities is looking at the big changes under way in our societies. This will require a new approach to the social agenda. The EU will need more effective means of ensuring citizens' existing rights of access to employment, education, social services, health care and other forms of social protection across Europe. In areas where the EU has a direct role, it must better adapt its existing instruments and policies, but also build on new policy responses such as the Globalisation Adjustment Fund.</p>
<p>- Sustainable energy policies for a low carbon future: The Commission's initiatives on energy policy clearly demonstrate its determination to reinforce EU policies to adapt to the changing world context. The conclusions of the 2007 Spring European Council, which largely endorsed the Commission's proposals set out in "An Energy Policy for Europe"<a href="#defann_60_1" name="refann_60_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, set out an ambitious EU approach to energy and climate change. This approach is based on binding targets – to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020, rising to 30% when an international agreement is forthcoming, and to increase the share of renewable energy in the EU's energy mix from less than 7% today to 20% by 2020. It also includes a commitment to reduce energy demand in 2020 by 20% and to deliver a fully functioning internal energy market. The Commission is now implementing the Action Plan agreed by the European Council. An internal energy market package was tabled by the Commission on 19 September 2007. A Strategic Energy Technology Plan has been presented on 21 November 2007. Early in 2008, the Commission will put forward the main legislative proposals to deliver on the climate change and energy objectives, including renewable energy and carbon capture and storage. In the international context, it is vital that, at the Bali Conference on climate change in December 2007, the EU works effectively to ensure the launch of official negotiations on a comprehensive international agreement to fight climate change for the period after 2012 when our current Kyoto commitments come to an end.</p>
<p>– More research and development (R&amp;D) and innovation: Progress as concerns EU R&amp;D intensity has so far been modest, standing at 1.84% of GDP in 2006, a considerable way off the 3% R&amp;D target for 2010. However, Member States have set national targets and have increased government budgets for R&amp;D in nominal terms. Should all Member States achieve their national targets, the EU R&amp;D expenditure is now forecast to reach 2.5% of GDP by 2010.</p>
<p>Substantially greater amounts of EU funding have been made available for growth and jobs. The new regulatory framework for the Cohesion policy programmes will make some € 210 billion available for investment in growth and jobs over 2007-13, an increase of over 25% compared to 2000-06. Measures have been taken to improve the framework conditions for R&amp;D and innovation through the adoption of a new R&amp;D and innovation state aid framework and through guidance on tax incentives and knowledge transfer. On the expenditure side, the 7th Framework Programme was adopted which will raise R&amp;D spending at the EU level by 75% between 2007 and 2013 and support for major public-private partnership.</p>
<p>– A more dynamic business environment: small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and entrepreneurship has been put high on the reform agenda. The European Council has invited Member States to set their own national administrative burden reduction targets by 2008 of comparable ambition to the target set by the Commission (i.e. a 25% reduction). To this date, nine Member States (AT, DE, DK, ES, IT, NL, SE, SK, UK) have set a 25% national reduction target, while another two Member States (CZ, FR) set a target of 20%. The average time and cost to start up a private limited company is roughly half of that needed in 2002: it is now estimated at 12 days and cost € 485.</p>
<p>The Commission will seek the views of SMEs and their representatives to help design a "Small Business Act" for Europe with a view to making a wide range of proposals to support SMEs by the end of 2008. The better regulation "culture" has begun to take root across the EU: the institutions need to lead the way. The Commission has made major changes in the way it develops new proposals and monitors implementation of the existing acquis. As well as cutting existing burdens, special consideration should be given to whether all the administrative requirements of EU legislation need to be applied in full to SMEs.</p>
<p>– Greater employability and investment in people: Globalisation and technological change risk increased inequality, opening up the gap between the skilled and the unskilled. The key to increased performance lies in modernising education and training policies. There is a growing interest in "flexicurity." This can help people to manage employment transitions more successfully in times of accelerating economic change. The Commission has proposed common principles for consideration at the December 2007 European Council. These would offer Member States a basis to draw on as they work with the national social partners to adapt flexicurity to national circumstances and mainstream this approach into their National Reform Programmes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Worldwide, according to the World Health Organization's estimates, tobacco is the second major cause of death, causing an estimated 4.9 million deaths per year.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization predicts that without further action in 2020 the mortalities attributable to tobacco world wide will increase two-fold, and approximately 70% of these deaths will occur in developing countries.</p>

<p>The EU has provided leadership for and supported the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, the FCTC, as the main international tool for this purpose.</p>
<p>The European Community and 25 Member States are now Parties to the Convention and key players in the process. The rest of the world often turns to the EU, drawing from its experience in areas such as banning advertising or fighting illicit trade.</p>
<p>The EC is committed to cooperate and is prepared to assist other Parties in implementing the FCTC through the existing mechanisms in place.</p>
<p>The Commission is advocating tobacco control at a global level. In developing countries, the EC promotes a thorough analysis of priority health problems and supports countries in planning and financing national health strategies. In this context, where partner countries identify tobacco and actions related to the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control as priority, the EC will support these countries' strategies for tobacco control.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0909"></a>

The coincidence of the price crises that hit Europe's countryside with saturation of the internal market by the influx of Moroccan tomatoes in both November 2006 and in April this year, which is when the bulk of the quota-excess entered the EU, demonstrates the direct relationship between these illegal imports and the disruption of the European market.</p>
<p>Does the Commission intend to take effective measures to put an end to this blatantly illegal situation, apart from merely reducing the quota for the following year, under the provisions of Article 25 of the Association Agreement between the EU and Morocco?

<p>According to the figures recorded by the Commission from Member States' monitoring data, total EU imports of tomatoes originating in Morocco reached 251,589 tonnes, i.e. 16,259 tonnes beyond the quantities fixed in Protocol 1 of the Association agreement.

<p>Under the terms of the rules of the World Trade Organisation, no voluntary restraint can be imposed between the partners (Article XI of GATT). Consequently, Morocco is free to export any quantity of tomatoes apart from the preferential tariff quotas, these exports being subjected to the corresponding customs tariff. The Commission cannot therefore subscribe to the interpretation of "illegal character" of Moroccan tomato exports taking place outside the preferential quota which is made by the Honourable Member.</p>
<p>The application of Article 25 of the Association agreement stipulates provisions in the event of serious injury for national producers of similar or directly competitive products on the territory of one of the parts or of serious disturbances in a sector of the economy or difficulty which can result in serious deterioration of a regional economic situation.

<p>The Commission follows very closely the recent developments concerning nuclear power in the EU’s neighbourhood, including in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>Even though it is not the European Union's role, or indeed the role of the Commission, to decide for any of the third countries whether they use nuclear energy or not, these developments can not be ignored.</p>
<p>It is useful to state that all countries of the Mediterranean region, with the exclusion of the state of Israel, have signed the Non Proliferation Treaty.</p>
<p>The Commission has recently addressed this issue in bilateral contact with some of the countries concerned while stressing the following pre-requisites:</p>
<p>The Commission recommends that the first point of contact for any of the countries with ambitions for developing a civil nuclear programme be the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna. The countries concerned should sign the necessary agreements to ensure the respect of nuclear safeguards, and adhere to the relevant international conventions on nuclear safety, physical protection and nuclear waste management.</p>
<p>It is essential that in each of the countries committed to developing of civil nuclear programme, the most advanced framework for nuclear safety is put in place. This should include the establishment of an independent regulatory authority which must ensure that the measures necessary to guarantee high standards of safety, security and non proliferation are adopted and respected. However, the safety of nuclear installations remains the sole responsibility of the State that operates them.</p>
<p>The Commission could have a significant role in the area of nuclear safety by supporting the development of the legislative and regulatory frameworks; it could also contribute significantly to the development of nuclear safety culture in the EU’s neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The European Court of Justice has several times expressed its opinion on the relation between the Community law and sport<a href="#defann_64_1" name="refann_64_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The Court held that sport was subject to Community law only when it constitutes an economic activity whether performed by professional or amateur athletes. In case sport involves gainful employment, it is covered by Article 39 of the EC Treaty and the prohibition of discrimination against EU nationals on grounds of nationality under Articles 12 and 39 of the EC Treaty applies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to article 7(4) of Regulation 1612/68<a href="#defann_64_2" name="refann_64_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>on freedom of movement which will also apply, collective agreements and regulations governing employment must be non-discriminatory. This applies to agreements concluded by both public authorities and private bodies, including sport organisations such the UEFA<a href="#defann_64_3" name="refann_64_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. However, the Court did make an exception to the general non-discrimination rule for matches which are purely of sportive, rather than economic, nature (e.g. games between national teams). At the same time, it has to be recalled that the Court made it clear that each time when the purely sporting character of regulations is invoked, careful and strict analysis of the grounds for excluding a specific rule from the application of the Treaty must be undertaken.</p>
<p>In this context, any rule implying the establishment of quotas on the basis of nationality for the composition of professional teams other that national teams seems to be contrary to Community law on free movement of workers. Given that Article 39 of the EC Treaty has a direct effect, individuals, who consider that they have been discriminated against, have the possibility of taking legal action according to national law and practices.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission has refused to end the excessive deficit procedure against Poland, despite the fact that, according to the Commission’s own forecasts, Poland’s budget deficit in 2007 will be 2.7% of GDP, and forecasts for economic growth and inflation in 2008 suggest that the budget deficit will be lower than 3% of GDP in 2008. Poland is one of the few EU Member States to introduce pension reforms, which places a burden of several billion złoty on its budget each year. By contrast, the two largest Member States in the euro zone, Germany and France, clearly exceeded the deficit ceiling from 2002 to 2005, i.e. four years running, but to avoid imposing a fine of billions of euro on these countries, in line with the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), the Pact’s rules were changed. Both countries have yet to complete reforms to their respective pension systems. This situation creates the undeniable impression that the Commission does not measure the EU Member States against the same yardstick. The larger Member States, already part of the euro zone, are able not to adhere to SGP rules, while other countries, merely applicants to join the zone, are, in spite of the serious reforms to their public finances, continually called upon to carry out further reforms. When will there be an end to the unequal treatment of Member States as regards adherence to the SGP?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission issued on 20 November 2007 a communication to the Council on the "Assessment of the action taken by Poland in response to the Council recommendation of 27 February 2007 according to Article 104(7) under the excessive deficit procedure". In this Council recommendation Poland was recommended to correct its excessive deficit by the year 2007 and to this end to take effective action by the deadline of 27 August 2007. The Polish government notified the Commission on the actions taken and the Commission made an assessment of these actions based on its Autumn 2007 forecast concluding that no further steps under the excessive deficit procedure (EDP) of Poland are needed at this stage.</p>
<p>The communication from the Commission to the Council represents an intermediate assessment following the expiry of the deadline for taking action. For other countries under the EDP, the Commission has also adopted communciations to the Council following the expiry of the deadline for taking action, provided of course that the assessment of action taken was not negative, in which case a recommendation for a Council decision establishing that action taken is inadequate was adopted by the Commission.</p>
<p>The decision on abrogating or not abrogating is the next step in the excessive deficit procedure in Poland. The abrogation of the excessive deficit procedure can only be based on actual data. 2007 actual budgetary data will be validated by Eurostat in April 2008, thus abrogation cannot take place before. Moreover for abrogating the excessive deficit procedure it is essential that the durability of the deficit correction is ensured. This will be assessed against the Commission services' spring 2008 forecast for the period to 2009 to be published by the end of April 2008.</p>
<p>The reformed Stability and Growth Pact allows to take into consideration the costs related to the introduction of a pension reform establishing a fully funded pension pillar. When it comes to the decision on abrogating or not the excessive deficit procedure in Poland, these costs will be considered subject to the conditions of the Stability and Growth Pact, i.e. provided that the deficit has declined substantially and continuously and has reached a level that comes close to the reference value.</p>
<p>The Commission treats all countries equally. The reform of the Stability and Growth Pact was undertaken in order to introduce more economic rationale, to better reflect the increased economic heterogenity of the enlarged EU, and to enhance national ownership. The rules of the reformed Stability and Growth Pact were negotiated and approved by the governments of all Member States, including Poland. The Commission closely monitors the budgetary developments in all member states reacting appropriately when it is necessary.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0931"></a>

<p>The Commission is fully aware of the environmental problem associated with the discharge of pollutants into the river Vardar/Axios. As pointed out in the Commission's replies to questions <a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2006-0637_EN.html">E-0637/06</a> and <a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2000-0442_EN.html">H-442/00</a>, financial assistance has been provided to address this problem since 1997. There is currently a network of monitoring points and stations for continuous monitoring of the hydrological and environmental status of the Vardar/Axios watershed area, which has enabled an extensive analysis of the water quality. The authorities of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia have announced that they will publish a report with all relevant hydrological, morphological, chemical and biological data on the water quality of the river during 2007.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the national authorities to take measures against the pollutants. As underlined in this year's progress report, there has only been limited progress in the area of water quality. However, the adoption by the government of a new law on waters which allocates clear responsibilities for water management to the Ministry for the Environment and Physical Planning is a step forward. The Commission encourages the authorities to transpose and implement the Directive on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control as soon as possible. While legislative transposition is at an advanced stage, the authorities have stated that they will not be able to fully implement the rules of the directive in this field before the end of 2009. The Commission will continue to monitor the issue and raise it again in its bilateral meetings.</p>

Approval of any proposed purchaser will depend on respect of these criteria. The Commission has not yet received any proposal regarding a purchaser for Distrigas.

<p>According to aid organisations, such diseases as leprosy and tuberculosis are still prevalent in China and measures to control and treat them are entirely dependent on foreign aid. In the past five years, more than 700 new cases of leprosy have come to light in China - a worryingly large figure. In Guangxi, for example, which is one of the poorest regions of the country with a GDP comparable to that of Lesotho in Africa, sick people are banished to isolated villages with derelict houses, far from modern China. The State pays them a monthly allowance of 150 yuan – equivalent to EUR 15 – which leaves them far below the extreme poverty line as calculated by the UN.</p>
<p>Is the Commission aware of the situation with regard to such diseases as leprosy and TB in China and their very inadequate treatment? Will the Chinese authorities be called upon to make additional efforts themselves to prevent them from spreading, so that such measures are not reliant solely on foreign aid?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission shares the Honourable Members' concerns regarding leprosy and tuberculosis in China.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis remains the number one cause of death from infectious disease in adults in China. According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, China has the world's second largest tuberculosis epidemic, second only to India, with more than 1.3 million new cases of tuberculosis every year.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, following the oubreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), China has demonstrated a strong commitment to confront tuberculosis and other communicable diseases, including by a large increase in domestic funding.</p>
<p>As a result, China now ranks second on the list of countries which have scaled up directy observed therapy short course (DOTS) coverage and has reached the global tuberculosis targets of 70% case detection and 85% treatment success by the end of 2005. It should however be noted that, treatment for drug- and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is not yet widely available and China must also confront the challenge of tuberculosis among internal migrants, ensuring that all patients are diagnosed, treated and reported.</p>
<p>The EC currently funds the EU-China Social Security Project with an EC contribution of € 20 million. This major project, which has been implemented since 2006, is supporting the modernisation and cost efficiency of the social sectors, including medical insurance systems at the central government level and in six pilot provinces. The project is, through improved models for medical insurance schemes, expected to have a considerable impact on the social protection of the poorest populations of China.</p>
<p>China has not yet been able to achieve the important public health goal of eliminating leprosy. According to the WHO, new cases of leprosy in China ranged between 1400-1660 annually from 2002-2005. However, by 2005 case detection rates have improved and first level sub-national elimination has been achieved in China.</p>
<p>The EC has funded a specific project (with EC funding of € 0.5million) on leprosy in Guanxi province completed a few years ago, implemented by Handicap International.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission is funding a research project entitled "Tuberculosis China" which organizes the analysis of a large collection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains from the 31 provinces of China. This will produce knowledge of the diversity of Chinese TB strains. The project aims to increase collaboration with Chinese scientists and transfer of technical knowledge, and collect the data in a shared-database and produce population analyses. Technical knowledge will be transmitted to Chinese laboratories.</p>
<p>The Commission is well aware of the challenges remaining in China as regards diseases such as tuberculosis and leprosy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0943"></a>

<p>The European Union agencies currently employ several hundred contract agents, who are entitled to pensions funded from the EU budget.</p>
<p>Has the Commission had any thoughts, and/or made any calculations, concerning future expenditure from the EU budget on pensions for contract agents in the Community Agencies?</p>
<p>If so, what form have these thoughts and/or calculations taken? Does the Commission foresee any problem with the cost of contract agents' pensions?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Contract agents taken on by executive agencies and regulatory agencies pay the same contribution to the pension scheme as officials and temporary staff (1/3 of the amount necessary for actuarial balance, which is currently 10.25% of basic salary) and they acquire the same pension rights (1.9% of their final basic salary per year up to a maximum of 70%).</p>
<p>The situation of contract agents is therefore no different from that of officials and temporary staff, and falls into two categories:</p>
<p>like officials and temporary staff, contract agents leaving service without having acquired the right to a retirement pension in the European institutions scheme (less than ten years’ service and under 63 years of age) are obliged to transfer the actuarial equivalent of their retirement pension rights, updated to the actual date of transfer, to another pension scheme (Article 109(1) of the CEOS and Annex VIII, Article 11(1) of the Staff Regulations);</p>
<p>contract agents leaving service with at least ten years’ service or after the age of 63 have the right to a pension under the same conditions as officials (Article 109(1) of the CEOS and Article 77 of the Staff Regulations).</p>
<p>The funds necessary for the payment of pensions are provided for in the budget (Title 30, Chapter 1, Article 13). The 2008 preliminary draft budget provides a breakdown of the calculations, including the estimated number of pensioners of the agencies<a href="#defann_76_1" name="refann_76_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
