The directive before us is the second offshoot of the Directive on ambient air quality assessment and management, and the proposal is part of an integrated package of measures designed to combat atmospheric pollution. The essential feature of this second offshoot of the air-quality Directive is that it establishes benzene and carbon monoxide limit values for the first time in the European Union. This is a very important step; I would even call it a milestone in the history of air-quality legislation, because it is the first limit value to be imposed for a carcinogenic substance, namely benzene, which can, of course, cause leukaemia. We know that petrol and oil are sources of benzene, and in the European Union 80 to 85% of benzene emissions result from petrol combustion in road vehicles. There has never been a safety threshold, and so benzene emissions have always posed a health risk. The precautionary principle that is enshrined in the EU Treaty, however, makes it imperative to establish a limit value at which the health risk is extremely low. It therefore stands to reason that we are particularly supportive of the proposal for a limit value of five micrograms per cubic metre of air.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position is a definite improvement on the Commission's proposal. I also very much welcome the fact that it incorporates many of the amendments adopted by this House. One amendment in particular was absolutely essential and central in our view, for the Commission had proposed that Member States could be granted derogations almost at will. It was effectively a blank cheque that could have been renewed over and over again, and by dropping this provision we have managed to achieve a compromise to which we too can subscribe. In the implementation of the directive it will also be important, of course, to respond to the problems faced by the countries of the South and to arrive at an appropriate compromise. The proposal also corresponds to the suggestion made by Mrs Schleicher at the first reading in the Environment Committee, namely that a single exception may be made, that it must be duly substantiated, that it need not be restricted to countries but can also apply to particular regions or geographical areas and that a concentration in excess of ten micrograms may not be authorised under any circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also very important in the light of our forthcoming enlargement to the East that we should emphasise that the European Union does not operate a two-speed environmental policy and that those Member States to which exceptions apply must make every effort to move towards compliance with EU requirements and must furnish proof of progress in this direction. The Environment Committee has also tabled a number of other amendments, but these should not be contentious either, because they relate primarily to the obligation to provide information. In these we have clearly emphasised that the new instrument of the Internet must be used as a means of improving the flow of information. I have no doubt that these amendments will also have answered the question as to how information is to be communicated. Moreover, we have also drawn attention to the fact that indoor pollution is also a major problem which should be addressed by EU research programmes. We cannot present a credible case for the improvement of outside air quality unless we demonstrate a clear commitment to improving the quality of indoor air. In addition, we have underlined very clearly that the Member States will also have to compile better documentation. Another very important point is that the governments of those Member States to which derogations apply should also inform the public of this special dispensation and of the efforts that are being made to achieve our goal of five micrograms by the year 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall close there – my time is up in any case. What is important is that this directive should be swiftly implemented, and I believe we have worked hard towards that aim and that we are unlikely to encounter any problems in achieving it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schleicher (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mrs Breyer has just indicated, we are dealing today with the second individual directive deriving from the framework Directive of 1996 on the assessment and management of ambient air quality. The main aim of the proposed legislation is to establish limit values for atmospheric concentrations of benzene and carbon monoxide in order to improve the quality of our air and to avoid, prevent and reduce the adverse effects of these substances on human health and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the main source of emissions of both pollutants is road traffic. Other major sources of benzene emissions are fuel distribution, oil refineries and the chemical industry, while all combustion processes emit carbon monoxide. This directive is a very important contribution to the maintenance of clean air and to the global climate strategy. The proposal was presented by the European Commission in December 1998. The Finnish presidency made a determined effort to use the new legal scope offered by the Treaty of Amsterdam in order to have this proposed directive enter into force back in December 1999 after the first reading, with the amendments adopted by the European Parliament. Our Group would have warmly welcomed that.</p>
<p class="contents">I need hardly say that our Group supported the amendments which emphasise the danger to certain sections of the population and which regard the proposed environmental measures as surpassable minimum standards. The provisions on a single extension of the deadline and on compliance with the limit values that are required for climatic reasons in our southern Member States, provisions which are now contained in the common position, were introduced by ourselves at the time of the first reading, as was the maximum benzene concentration of 10 micrograms per cubic metre.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Breyer, of course, has already given some indication of the subsequent harmonious development of the common position. This now contains the very wording that we wanted on this point, and its other provisions are consistent and provide for practicable measures to improve air quality in Europe. Our Group accepts this common position and can support it as it stands. This new regime guarantees that public health will be afforded a high level of protection, and it is flexible enough to be adapted at any time in response to technological progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Breyer has taken a great deal of trouble and has achieved much of what Parliament wanted at the negotiating table. I must say, however, that in our view the amendments which have been reintroduced are superfluous; while they are justifiable, it is not worth putting the directive on ice again for the sake of these amendments, which would only delay the adoption process. We consider it far more important – as you yourself said, Mrs Breyer – that, after a delay of half a year, this instrument should now enter into force as quickly as possible, so that it can play its part in improving the quality of the air we breathe in Europe. For that reason, our Group does not support the amendments, because we hope that, by withholding our support, we can expedite the process of adopting this directive.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am aware of the significance of this directive in terms of the development and enhancement of European environment policy. It will be the first legal instrument to set a limit on concentrations of a carcinogenic substance. Its significance lies not only in the fact that it is important to have a limit value for this particular carcinogenic substance but also in the fact that it sets a precedent for the future regulation of other carcinogens.</p>
<p class="contents">The main political aim at the first reading was to limit the scope for derogations from the prescribed limit values as far as possible, to make the rules as restrictive as possible, and I believe that we can be more than pleased with this solution, which was the fruit of our joint efforts. My Group is also interested, of course, in the rapid implementation of this directive, and we wish to avoid a conciliation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also aware that the debate on this directive is not the right place to discuss indoor pollution. Nevertheless, I do believe that it is appropriate to highlight the dangers of indoor pollution and to call for initiatives in that domain, such as additional research. After all, there is evidence that people are exposed to hazardous substances, especially the carcinogen benzene, as a result of indoor pollution too. This is why we support the amendments that have been tabled, and we trust that we shall nevertheless be able to avoid a conciliation procedure.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should also like to congratulate the rapporteur. She has done extremely well with the lion’s share of her amendments and the amendments which have been adopted by the Commission and Parliament at first reading. The question which remains is whether or not we want to go further than what has been accepted in the common position. In our opinion, the rapporteur’s arguments are convincing and we will give them our seal of approval. </p>
<p class="contents">In the discussions we have had on this directive, a subject came up which could in fact have come up in other environmental issues as well, but it is important in my view to bring it to the fore in this context. The question we always need to ask ourselves as European institutions is: why is this one of our concerns? Why is it the case that a problem which can be very localised – this is, in fact, one of the very problems we are discussing at the moment – why is this something which we need to decide on in Brussels or Strasbourg and cannot delegate to national level? I am not talking about the legal dimension, because, legally, we are bound to deal with this.</p>
<p class="contents">Eventually, it became clear to us that in this case, it would be useful if we, as European citizens, were to deal with this on the basis of a kind of equality before the law, offering the same level of protection to the same citizens. But I can imagine that other people would argue against this, saying: no, it is important to be involved in this as a Union. I would find it useful if the Commissioner, time-permitting, could comment on this briefly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Breyer’s report went a long way towards further improving the Commission’s proposal at first reading, which took place in December of last year. </p>
<p class="contents">The limit values which have been set for benzene and carbon monoxide in ambient air are based upon the World Health Organisation’s latest recommendations and are aimed at achieving a high level of protection of people’s health throughout the Union. Adoption of this directive would mean that the Union would take the lead internationally where limit values for benzene and carbon monoxide are concerned. </p>
<p class="contents">I want to begin by explaining the Commission’s views on Amendments 2 and 3. These concern the issue of providing information to the public, something which is of the greatest importance. As you perhaps know, the Commission has now, in the course of the week, adopted a new directive which will further improve access to environmental information. The Commission approves Amendment 2, which expressly mentions the Internet. Amendment 3 (1) refers to the fact that the Member States should make a special effort to inform those who are affected by the extensions to the time limits within which the limit values for benzene are to be complied with. The Commission agrees in principle with this requirement, but the common position expressed in Article 8.3 of Directive 96/62/EC, that is to say the framework directive on air quality, already obliges the Member States to compile this information and make it available to the public. In order for the Commission to be able to approve Amendment 3 (1), the latter must therefore be substantially reworded. Amendment 3 (2) contains a demand for free public access to the Member States’ documentation concerning the selection of places from which to take samples. In spite of the fact that the Member States already have this obligation under the Århus Convention, the Commission approves the Amendment. </p>
<p class="contents">I turn now to Amendments 1 and 4 which both concern the Commission’s review of the Directive in 2004. The review will form part of the first report on the new integrated programme for clean air, which the Commission is in the process of drawing up. The common position already states that the purpose of the review is to study the latest results and, if need be, further improve protection. Because indoor air pollution can cause significant health problems, the Commission will take account of this issue in the review. Amendment 1 may therefore be approved in principle, but must be reworded. </p>
<p class="contents">I turn finally to Amendment 4, which concerns an important issue. The most difficult point in the negotiations in the Council was the limit value for benzene and the time limit for achieving this. Against the background of the results of a current investigation into benzene, mainly the southern Member States considered that they were uncertain of being able to achieve the limit value of 5 g/m3 by 2010. Despite this, Article 3.2 of the common position offers only <span class="italic">one</span> possibility for extending the time limit by five years under certain conditions. Moreover, a concentration of 10 g/m3 must not be exceeded during that period. I would emphasise that this is in line with Amendment 22, tabled at Parliament’s first reading. Only through an addendum to Article 7.3, in which it is expressly stated that the Commission can propose further extensions in the light of the results of the 2004 review, was it possible for this agreement to come about. From a purely legal point of view, this clause does not lead to the Commission’s right of initiative being limited or otherwise affected, but may be seen as an important part of the final compromise in the Council. According to Amendment 4, the clause ought not to be there, something which could jeopardise the agreement with the Council. The Commission considers that the compromise to which this could lead would involve unnecessary delay in adopting this important directive in which, for the first time ever, limit values are established for benzene and carbon monoxide in ambient air. The Commission is therefore unable to approve Amendment 4.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to say that I believe the common position constitutes a valuable compromise to which I hope that the whole Parliament will agree, without the need for major changes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
