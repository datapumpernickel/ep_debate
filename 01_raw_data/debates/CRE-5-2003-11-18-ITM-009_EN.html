<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, network and information security has become increasingly important, with growing use of the Internet and other information and communication technologies. In today’s society, much depends on networks and information systems. Yet, in order to fully realise the advantages of the information society, people need to be able to trust the system. It has become clear that we have to make a common effort to strengthen network and information security in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2001 the Commission presented a communication on a policy framework and in February 2003 a proposal to establish a European Network and Information Security Agency. Now, nine months later, we are about to witness a first reading agreement on ENISA.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur, Mr Paasilinna, for his thorough work, as well as the political groups which have helped to reach a satisfactory compromise with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very positive that there has been such a strong will to negotiate and to reach an agreement. The European Parliament has contributed a lot to this process, as it has to the important telecom-related legislation over the past three years.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy that Parliament has been able to overcome a number of difficult issues and to reach this compromise. The compromise has to be confirmed today and tomorrow by this House, in order for the Telecom Council on 20 November 2003 to adopt a political agreement which would allow the Agency to start at the beginning of 2004. That is what the European Council called for last spring.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank Parliament for the support it has given the Commission. This support has enabled the Council to make concessions on the involvement of industry by introducing a permanent stakeholders' group. Although not fully in line with what the Commission wanted in terms of composition and voting rules for the Management Board, the compromise proposal has made the management of the Agency considerably lighter and given the Executive Director the main management tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has looked carefully at Parliament's compromise amendments and can accept them. The present text from Parliament has clarified the objectives and tasks of the Agency. It will be a learning process to transpose the tasks into a more operational set of actions, but I am happy to see that there is wide agreement on the general lines of what the Agency should do.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the composition of the Management Board and its voting rules, the Commission would have preferred a reduced composition, together with an extension of the simple majority voting rules. We consider that the extended management board with two-thirds majority voting rules is a potential obstacle to the smooth functioning of agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">In this specific case the Commission has, however, decided to accept a deviation from the proposed framework for regulatory agencies of December 2002, although that should not be considered as a precedent for future agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">This Agency will operate in the sensitive field of security and it urgently needs to be put in place now. I hope Member States will do their best to participate in the Management Board in order to make the Agency work successfully.</p>
<p class="contents">This Agency is a major step forward for Europe or at least for eEurope. Member States have shown a willingness to cooperate actively on this issue in order to strengthen the internal market and to help the European citizens, businesses and administrations make full use of the networks and information systems. This will be a signal both to stakeholders in Europe and to countries outside the Union that we take the issues of network and information security seriously and that Member States and the Commission, with the support of this House, are ready to act. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Baldini,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, the Presidency is aware that communications networks should be seen as key, vital infrastructure in modern economies and, as such, should be protected: their protection and their security is a matter of public interest. Personally, as Mr Gasparri’s representative – who has, I am sorry to say, been detained in Italy today due to the grave tragedy that has struck our country, and is involved in paying our last respects to the soldiers killed in Iraq – I would like to confirm the Presidency’s past and ongoing commitment to the issue of security of networks and information. The European institutions have, moreover, shown that they are aware of the urgent need for joint action that will enable the Agency to actually be operational from the beginning of 2004, as the Heads of State or Government recommended to the Spring 2003 European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The Internet and communications technologies are certainly the innovations that have most characterised our society in recent years and that have influenced how the overwhelming majority of human activities are carried out. However, over and above the obvious advantages, these technologies have introduced a series of problems into our society that are linked to the poor reliability of the instruments used. Security requirements have changed rapidly over the past 20 years, in line with the development of networks and computers, which are ever more omnipresent in public and private life. Broadband connections give the user the possibility of having a permanent connection to the Internet; new wireless applications allow access in practically any place and the possibility of connecting almost anything to the network – from personal computers to household appliances – continues and will continue to develop people’s use of the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">Controlling security has become a difficult and complex task and the user is faced with problems of the availability, integrity, authenticity and the confidentiality of data and services on a daily basis. The complexity of technology means that several components and elements have to interact and makes human behaviour a crucial factor.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from being a source of malfunctions, computers and networks can, however, also be subjected to attacks on information systems. Today, an attack on an information system can put entire nations in serious difficulty. To reduce the likelihood of such an event, every country needs to take effective action to improve the security of its ICT infrastructure; given the cross-border dimension of the problem, however, structures need to be defined in which national experiences can be gathered together and become common heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">The experience of recent years has taught us that sharing experiences and information, and, more generally, international cooperation, are the most efficient weapons for creating a mentality of security in the information society. During its term in office, the Presidency has, therefore, made every effort to try to address this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a regulation that Parliament is looking at today is the result of greater agreement, by the institutions, on the need for a joint approach at European level regarding security of information. A convergence of positions was arrived at following an increase in concern from both the public and the private sectors regarding crime and even phenomena that are only potentially dangerous linked to the new technologies. The more communications networks become features that are essential and central to the functioning of our modern markets, the greater the endeavours we will have to make to ensure and create a secure, protected environment for those operating at the different levels.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the Agency’s objectives is to create a joint committee in Europe for issues relating to information security, which is necessary to guarantee the availability and security of networks and information systems in the Union. From this point of view, the Presidency upholds the importance of creating a new culture of security, in which such a concept is not just taken to mean a cost for operators to bear, but as a real and genuine opportunity for market development, also to be achieved by boosting consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">The Agency should be able to facilitate the enforcement of Community measures on security of networks and information. The assistance provided by the Agency will help to implement Community legislation in this area, thus contributing to the smooth functioning of the internal market. This will strengthen the ability of the Community and of the Member States to react to problems of security of networks and of information systems, as well as to the development of the information society in general.</p>
<p class="contents">The actual model proposed by the Agency is innovative. In fact, it is based on the knowledge that measures in the area of security of networks can only be tackled in close cooperation with all actors in the world of communications: with market operators and with users of communications services.</p>
<p class="contents">Our institutions have the opportunity to render an essential service to the public and to the European agencies by creating this Agency, for the consensus we hope for at first reading is possible, which is an indication of a great sense of responsibility and of deep understanding of the sensitive nature of this matter. The negotiations were laborious and complex, but the positions of the Council and Parliament were gradually reconciled, evidence – and I repeat – of a great sense of responsibility. I hope, therefore, that, in a few days, we will be able to celebrate the adoption of this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I want to thank Commissioner Liikanen, the rapporteur, Mr Paasilinna, and Mr van Velzen, Mrs Mann and Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, as well as, of course, all the other members of the committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Paasilinna (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FI) </span>Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the security of information systems is a major concern of today and a subject of discussion in modern and vulnerable societies. Power supply networks, water supply and sewage, traffic control, hospitals – everything can be thrown into chaos any time, any place. The Bastel virus this autumn was perhaps the first where business lay behind the destruction it caused. The hackers or crackers used it to aid a shady business, chiefly pornography, one presumes. Stealing sensitive information on ordinary people is also obviously a crime, when you think about it. Various sorts of violation of people’s privacy can happen on an absolutely massive scale. This sort of thing has to be tackled.</p>
<p class="contents">Its lack of security is becoming more and more a barrier to the development of the networked society. Last year 75% of European companies had no information security strategy. Less than 2% of investment in information technology is put into information security. In two companies out of every three information security is as yet not considered a strategic issue. The Data Protection Act should have entered into force in the Member States in October. Under this law unsolicited email cannot be sent without the specific consent of the receiver. Spam accounts for more than half of all email, and, for many, more than 90%, as is the case too with many of us in this House. The credibility and reliability of email are now being wrecked. We voted on this subject in this House last year. At the time almost half did not regard spam as a problem. They opposed this idea of getting someone’s permission first. Now that will not be enough either. Now the operators will also have to clean up content. That will result in problems for the freedom of personal communication. Security clearance is very much on the increase as our lives become more and more involved in networks and communications. With broadband we are on line the whole time. The wireless Internet will be the obvious hunting ground of the troublemaker. It will be a nuisance for all: private individuals, companies and society. The problem over security is made worse by the fact that in a complex environment many components and partial systems have to function together. The human factor is also a risk. Information security thus affects everyone everywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Information security is a political question, and that is why we have to resolve it. That is why, moreover, we are in an exceptional hurry here to create this agency for Europe, the European Network and Information Security Agency. Without security the Lisbon objectives will not be implemented. Information insecurity would lead us into an age of piracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Three types of measure are in progress. We have enacted laws relating to electronic communications and data protection. The Commission is drafting principles for judging and sentencing cybercrime and looking at ways of improving information security, and one of these ways is ENISA. I want to thank my colleagues, the Council and the Commission for their excellent levels of cooperation. It shows how we have now understood what this situation means. ENISA will be a centre of excellence that coordinates, analyses and gives advice. It will work very closely with the public and private sector. The Agency will promote the development of risk assessment and risk management methods. International cooperation will be indispensable. The Agency must be located somewhere where there are already viable top information technology communications systems, including wireless. The world’s top operations centres must be located there and we must be able to find Europe’s most highly skilled people there easily.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur I have worked in favour of a compromise, which is that the Management Board should have representation from all Member States. At the same time it will not get involved in day-to-day work, which will be the domain of the Executive Director, the staff, the Advisory Board and the working groups. There is no doubt that a large Management Board will be a necessary forum of cooperation and a factor in creating direction. Voting rules are slightly problematic. We can return to them in a few years’ time. The Agency will work for the benefit of the Member States, where levels of information security vary considerably. The role of companies in our compromise is a strong one, thanks to Mr van Velzen, because they of course possess most of the networks and expertise. I also wish to thank Mrs Mann, who has also keenly promoted this move.</p>

I welcome that. The agency is an important factor in securing the networks and the information society. We must hope that, on this occasion, the ends justify the means because there are, unfortunately, a number of things to complain about in the outcome. The fact that Parliament and the Council have reached an agreement in the course of the first reading entails, in this case, losses for both Parliament and the industry. The agency’s management board has become too large, with a representative for each Member State, and the industry has had to give way, together with other areas of civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">My amendment, which was aimed at bringing about transparency in the application and appointment procedure, will no doubt acquire significance in the longer term. The Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs was united in supporting it, but it disappeared in the course of discussion through an administrative mistake by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. In other words, the Council’s wheeling and dealing<span class="italic"> </span>with authorities that infringe legislation, and vice versa, continues without any democratic scrutiny.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a couple of messages for the Commission and the Council prior to the joint<span class="italic"> </span>declaration<span class="italic"> </span>that is now to be drawn up. Guarantee long-term transparency in the application procedure. Exploit and develop the EU’s cooperation with the United States and other third countries. Ensure that network security is achieved in accordance with the common guidelines that have already been approved in a Council resolution and that have been signed by ten of the Member States, together with six other countries. Develop the EU guidelines around what individual Member States are already applying.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, a delegation from Parliament visited Washington and experienced on the spot what should become our future style. An EU singing from the same hymn sheet should facilitate our foreign relations, especially with the United States. Through this agency, we can now jointly develop data protection in all its different dimensions, and that is good. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, we have not seen otherwise, as this has already occurred with a great many dossiers. I should also like to say to the Italian Presidency that a very peculiar procedure has taken place. I have never before seen the Council ready when Parliament has yet to make a start. We have had to do an enormous amount of work together in order to succeed, and, thanks to the tremendous efforts of the Italian Presidency, we have indeed achieved that compromise. This situation must not be repeated on any account, but we must all learn from it.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of the Agency is clear. The Commissioner has just pointed it out. Mr Paasilinna cited some data, and I shall not reiterate it. I should, however, like to draw attention to the article in last week’s <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> with the headline: ‘Blackmail by internet as gangs target sites’. What was it about? Ordinary extortion demands are made, then you have to pay a certain amount and you will be left alone. So this is where we have got to. We are talking about damage to industry running into millions.</p>
<p class="contents">Very often, physical infrastructure, too, is targeted. We always think that it is financial institutions that are involved, but top of the attacks list are the electricity networks. As an Italian, you know what it means when a light goes out. A huge number of attacks have been committed on the physical infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased, therefore, that there is now clarity as regards the location of the Agency. It is now ultimately a case of helping the Commission and the Member States with a colossal mobilisation of industry. Fortunately, the Agency has also been given an executive role. It is obvious that industry, too, must play a part as far as possible. When all is said and done, Member States do not have ownership of security. Much has already been said about the Management Board, and also about the voting rights. Privately, I still cannot explain why two-thirds of votes should be needed. We still have not solved this mystery surrounding the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I am extremely pleased that prevention has become one of the tasks. After all, how can you talk about security without mentioning prevention? On the subject of transparency, I should like to ask the Italian Presidency – and I do expect an answer to this – whether you are now prepared to let the Member States that put themselves forward for the Agency do that out in the open, so that everyone knows which country the Agency wants. Will you not let that take place behind closed doors in the Council? I challenge you to provide that transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">My conclusion is that this is a first step: no more and no less. In practice, it will turn out to be inadequate and badly in need of revision. It is very important, however, that the Agency is put in place, and therefore my group gives its unqualified support to this Agency and to the amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe we have achieved a good compromise. In the many speeches that we have already heard, it has been described as a compromise, but as one that will indeed bring us, in the coming year, a European agency to deal with security issues throughout the Internet and its infrastructure. I believe that it was on this basis that we then all decided to simply try and reach a compromise that would take us through the first five years, although we were always aware that, after those five years, we would make a real attempt at creating genuine European structures and doing away with the problems that will now be inherent in the Agency. These have to do with voting rights, but also with the issue raised by the Member States, which will now, in fact, be represented by one person each.</p>
<p class="contents">I nonetheless believe that, faced with the challenges in this area, each and every one of us will really try to determine what this agency’s tasks are. I have confidence in the promises made by the Italian presidency of the Council, and I think it will remember them even after five years. I hope that we will then all work towards making an early start on the audit that we have planned for – as early as after three years, if my memory serves me correctly – so that we can then make a start on rethinking the structures and defining the tasks more precisely.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with reference to that, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that I would like to put a question to you. Will you actually be coming back to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy to discuss these tasks with its members as soon as you know how they are to be catalogued in collaboration with the Member States? The fact is that I suspect that this is not just about issues of security in the infrastructures – Members have already mentioned data security – but also about many other aspects that are equally affected, and initiating another wide-ranging discussion of these issues could be very interesting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council cut the Commission proposal down to the bone and initially tried everything possible to prevent the efficient functioning of this Agency. A start has been made, however. Nothing now stands in the way of the creation of a European agency, and I hope that the Council does not impose another blockade on the issue of finding the right seat for the Agency. It is important that initiatives developed by Member States and businesses with regard to network security are well coordinated at European level. After all, it is cross-border problems that are at issue here, and the jurisdiction of the Member States stops at the border.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I am pleased that a role, if only an advisory role, is being reserved for industry in the composition and functioning of the Agency. After all, industry is the most important player regarding ownership and operation of networks, and we lay down the rules that determine that industry has to guarantee the functioning of the network. We must then also fill in the specific details.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that, with this Agency, a body is established that can negotiate with other international players. In that way, the Agency can contribute to maintaining a healthy transatlantic relationship, which is essential in the sphere of security in general and network security in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">It is incomprehensible to the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party why the Council remains committed to a two-thirds majority of votes as the basis for decisions by the Management Board on, among other things, the work programme and the appointment of the Director. This does make it very difficult to take proper decisions efficiently. Efficiency – what efficiency? In any case, it is good that a compromise has finally been reached, and so the ELDR Group will support the report by Mr Paasilinna. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am here on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which strongly supported Mr Paasilinna in its opinion, and I would like to thank him as rapporteur and my colleague Mrs McCarthy, who was the draftsman for the opinion that I also worked on.</p>
<p class="contents">From the perspective of those of us who work in the field of the internal market, it is important to emphasise that this is one of the reasons cited in particular for setting up the Information Security Agency. It is becoming increasingly apparent that questions about the security of computer networks and confidence in them are very much in the minds of the people we want to encourage to take up electronic commerce and enjoy all the benefits of the broadband infrastructure, whether accessing commercial or public services. Therefore this new centre of excellence to significantly step up cooperation between Member States in this area is of vital importance. It is essential for the competitiveness of the European economy and for the development of the information society – something that I know you, Commissioner, are very keen on – that we should start to pool our resources and address these crucial issues.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a tribute to my colleagues who have worked with the Italian presidency and with the Commission that we have managed to get an agreement. Speed is of the essence. However, we must not allow speed to compromise the search for excellence. I know you, Commissioner, will be looking for the best possible people and the best possible operating structures to put in place so that this agency really can contribute its expertise as soon as possible. Because it is a best-practice agency – and this is something we particularly emphasised in our report – it has to adopt the best possible practice in its own security and the way it operates its own systems, to set an example to everybody else.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that all of us look forward very much to working with the new agency and seeing it contribute to the undoubted success of information society measures that we have supported so consistently in this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Internet, as we have heard, is no longer a new phenomenon. Today, more than 90% of companies and 44% of households in the EU have an Internet connection and more than two-thirds of Europeans use a mobile phone. Our everyday systems are controlled by computers and communication networks, from public transport systems to the water that comes out of our taps at home. It is no surprise, then, that security in this area is a huge concern for our citizens and businesses. I must admit that I have reservations about creating new agencies willy-nilly. However, I have to say that I totally support the establishment of this one.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I wish to make three points, which are also questions to the Commission. Firstly, the issue of differing security standards. Given that at present the 15 Member States are all at different stages of combating cybercrime, how does the Commission plan to tackle this obstacle and ensure effective implementation, especially once we become a Union of 25, when the real challenge will be to harmonise security standards across Europe? Will the Agency have sufficient clout to ensure that Member States take the recommendations and advice of this Agency seriously?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on the issue of cross-border cooperation, it is a fact that there is no systematic cross-border cooperation between the current Member States. We know that security is a difficult and complex task, encompassing all sorts of issues like availability, integrity, authenticity and confidentiality of data and services. How does the Commission intend to get public and private sectors and businesses and consumers to work together? How does it intend to promote security in these areas?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, security requirements are constantly evolving as networking in the community and computing develop further, electronic communications become more widespread and hackers become more adept at foiling security systems. We need to ensure that we in Europe have the highest possible level of security. How will the Commission ensure that this Agency does not fall behind new technologies and that it leaves no stone unturned in the fight against cybercrime?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I hope the setting up of this Agency will lead to some rationalisation within the Commission, because often when we set up agencies it also means some sort of streamlining within the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Second, the participation of private sector businesses and others will be taken into account. This is something that Parliament has long been pushing for. Mr Paasilinna, Mr van Velzen, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel and Mrs Mann all spoke very convincingly on that issue tonight in the presence of the Italian presidency, and we are very proud of that. There seems to be a strong body of opinion in favour of what the Commission proposed earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">Keeping up with changing technology will always be a challenge for us. The information society technologies programme, however, is one area where we can help: research programmes are ongoing in that field, and there is also the stakeholders' group. I hope that the European Network and Information Security Agency will be a kind of 'hub of hubs' in this area, where the best knowledge can be exchanged.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again I should like to thank Mr Paasilinna, Mrs Cederschiöld, Mr van Velzen, Mrs Mann, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, Mr Harbour and Mrs Gill. I should like you, Mr President, to pass on a message to the Bureau that these people deserve a chance to have a debate on the information society during the daytime. Since I have been in this House this has never happened before 9.30 p.m. at the earliest. This gives the impression that 'future' issues are discussed in the evening and 'past' issues during the day. Could this change, even just once, before the European elections? I trust that you will pass on this modest wish. With this team you could run any file in Europe, and they deserve to do this during the day from time to time.</p>
<p class="contents">I got a little emotional there but I should now comment on the amendments! The Commission can accept all the compromise amendments as voted on 17 November 2003 in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. None of the other amendments can be accepted.</p>
