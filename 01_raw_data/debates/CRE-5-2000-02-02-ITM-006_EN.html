<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dimitrakopoulos (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Mr President, I will begin by thanking the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission for all our recent very useful contacts. Let me also once more thank my co-rapporteur Mr Leinen for our excellent collaboration.</p>
<p class="contents">The Intergovernmental Conference that is about to begin is important, both in a general sense and more particularly in view of the imminent enlargement. The work of the Conference will determine the structure and method based on which Europe will be functioning in the twentieth century. For the European Union of the future to be able to function more effectively, more democratically and with complete transparency, clearly what we need is an extensive and in-depth reform of the institutions and the way they work.</p>
<p class="contents">The first and substantive prerequisite for achieving that reform is the agenda based on which the Intergovernmental Conference is to begin its work. From the decisions made at the Helsinki Summit, it emerges that the agenda agreed there is unsatisfactory and does not guarantee the essential and substantive changes required for creating a more functional Europe, one that is more effective, more democratic and more transparent. This is because the Helsinki agenda is limited to consideration only of the three issues that relate in a fragmentary way to the structure and operation of just two of the European Union’s institutional bodies. I will not repeat which ones, because everyone knows.</p>
<p class="contents">My conclusion is justified on the one hand by the constant and sometimes very insistent demands of the peoples of Europe and on the other hand by the huge scale of the great enterprise in which the European Union is already involved, namely enlargement. Granted this, the new Intergovernmental Conference must not fail to include in its agenda issues which, properly addressed, would ensure the correct operation of all and not just some of the European Union’s institutions. Just as it also must not fail to include everyday issues which, for that very reason, are highly visible to the European public.</p>
<p class="contents">In its numerous debates and its reports so far the European Parliament has openly supported the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference. At the same time, however, I am asking for it to include issues that improve and complement the reform, I repeat, of all the institutional bodies as well as issues that are of direct concern and interest to the European public such as health, energy, culture, transport and even tourism. Whether or not the agenda will ultimately be widened is still the subject of debate and on this point I would like to extol the political conduct of the Portuguese Presidency, which has repeatedly made a commitment to the European Parliament to make the necessary efforts towards that end. All the same, whether or not more issues will be considered must in no way diminish the importance attributed by every Member State to the Intergovernmental Conference. This is because the institutional framework within which Europe will operate in the future is a foundation of European integration and is therefore a matter of the greatest national importance for every one of the Union’s Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In light of what I have said, I ask Parliament to approve the opinion which Mr Leinen and I have put before you, so that on 14 February, the work of the Intergovernmental Conference can begin and our two representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, can proceed with the difficult task that awaits them with the European Parliament’s backing. The same applies to the Commission and I would again like to thank Commissioner Barnier for his collaboration with the European Parliament and for the very constructive proposals he put before us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as we are concerned, mini reform would represent a lost opportunity. Mini reform would also jeopardise the stability of the European Union. The European Parliament could not, indeed must not, allow the European Union to be jeopardised in this way, that is by overstretching it and falling short when it comes to deepening. We would like to take this opportunity to remind the governments once again that Parliament must give its consent before a new Member can accede to the Union. Parliament is also sure to form the decision it has to make on enlargement in the light of the outcome of this Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">On 18 November 1999, we named the key points on our agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference 2000. I would just like to reiterate a few points: provisions for reinforced cooperation with these 20 and 25 Member States, integrating security and defence policy into the Community framework, incorporating the Charter of Citizens’ rights into the new Treaty, constitutionalising the Union by dividing it into a main part and a subsidiary part, reforming Article 48 so that when it comes to future treaty amendments, Parliament will play a real part in the negotiations on an equal footing, and – another thing worthy of mention – a statute for European parties so that the next European elections are actually fought on the basis of European issues rather than taking the form of national debates on domestic policy. Last but not least, there is the strengthening of institutions and instruments for the common economic, social and employment policy, as a counterbalance to European monetary union and the single currency, which we have, of course, already adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to a wider agenda we also want an improved method for the elaboration of this new European treaty. In the interests of the citizens, we must provide for greater transparency in the political process during the Intergovernmental Conference. That is why we demand Parliament’s extensive involvement at all levels.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union has a two-fold basis of legitimacy; it is a Union of States but it is also a Union of peoples. It is high time that this found expression in the method for elaborating a new treaty. All the more reason for the representatives of the European Parliament to participate fully in the preparation group, at ministerial level as well as at the meetings of the European Council, insofar as this Council concerns itself with matters pertaining to the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The national governments decided to open this Intergovernmental Conference on 14 February. Parliament will deliver its opinion in tomorrow’s mini-sitting, thereby creating the pre-conditions for the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference. I cannot deny that many of my fellow MEPs would have preferred to have waited until we had a report from the Portuguese Presidency to hand following its tour of the capital cities, so as to be able to discover if there is any progress towards or impetus for a wider agenda. However, we have faith in the Portuguese Presidency and we have faith in the commitment it has testified to here to proposing additional points for the agenda at the Lisbon Summit in March. We urge the governments to support the Portuguese Presidency in its proposal. As such, this represents a vote of confidence and we very much hope that we will not be disappointed if we deliver our opinion at this early stage, without knowing exactly what there is in the way of fresh impetus and what the additional points on the agenda will be.</p>
<p class="contents">The opinion we are placing before you is a clear signal to the governments not to miss the last opportunity we will have before enlargement to implement ambitious reforms within the EU and to raise the level of acceptance of this next European treaty, which is more transparent and provides for the full participation of Parliament. I too would like to thank the Portuguese Presidency and Commissioner Barnier for their cooperation. I would urge this Parliament to produce a consensus of opinion in favour of adopting our opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that Portugal’s commitment to driving forward the launching of this Intergovernmental Conference was made very clear at the meeting of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and subsequently confirmed by the Portuguese Foreign Minister’s statements in this Chamber. </p>
<p class="contents">In fact, we regard this as a unique opportunity to adapt the Union to enlargement, and we must do so in a way that combines a certain degree of ambition with the need to achieve results by the end of this year. This is the obstacle we all face, which will certainly be heightened by the difficulties certain governments will have in getting measures through their parliaments or, in some cases, approved in national referendums. We must be aware that we face a ratification process which will take around two years and that it is crucial that we guarantee its success. Any failure would be a failure for the whole Union. We must therefore guarantee that the final outcome of the conference’s work is sufficiently acceptable to all shades of public opinion and to all political hues in the various Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the mechanism we have proposed for this conference has been very well received by the various governments. The establishment of a preparatory group which I chair was also a response to the concerns expressed by the European Parliament about the scope for its representatives to intervene at this stage in the negotiations. I am therefore counting on the work of our friends Mr Broke and Mr Tsatsos, who will doubtless prove extremely valuable participants in the discussions within that group. I would like to add that our understanding is that they will be able to participate fully, just like any other group member appointed by a Member State or representing the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I also consider that in choosing its Foreign Minister to chair the ministerial group, the Portuguese Presidency is also trying to give a signal that it wishes to ensure that the President of the European Parliament has a sufficiently high-level representative and not one at a level which could conceivably be interpreted as being less worthy of the role of the president of an institution such as this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is difficult to summarise the contacts – and the significance of the contacts – that I have had with the various Member States, particularly because I have not yet finished this tour of the capitals, in the course of which I have tried to find out how the different countries see the conference and what their expectations for it are.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I think that I can safely say that the various Member States are willing to open the debate, but not necessarily to conclude it – and this should be made clear from the outset – in line with this Parliament’s interpretation of certain reforms that are necessary. In any event, many governments feel that they will be able to accept various topics that I have suggested.</p>
<p class="contents">These topics are obviously related to those institutional issues that the Portuguese Presidency regards as coming within its mandate. I would like to make this quite clear: our mandate, which was given to us in Helsinki, does not, as Portugal sees it, cover just the three Amsterdam leftovers. The mandate that we brought back from Helsinki does indeed the three Amsterdam leftovers, but it also covers associated institutional issues. In this context, there is obviously the work relating to the European Union’s institutions, and the issue of closer cooperation, which is an issue quite closely linked to the leftovers themselves. It also covers issues such as the Union’s legal personality and the simplification of the Treaties, as well as other issues fundamentally related to a revision of the Treaty on European Union. These strike us as being very important, particularly those dealing with the structure of this Parliament itself in a post-enlargement context. There are also issues such as the provisional measures that will have to be implemented if enlargement takes place before the end of this parliamentary term, as well as the individual responsibility of the Commissioners. Finally, there is a whole raft of issues that we feel can and must be included in the agenda of this conference.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The Member States are apparently open to this possibility. I would like to say that it is my intention that initiatives taken during the Portuguese Presidency should start and move ahead quickly and with a substantial input of work. I do not intend to start the work of the preparatory group merely as a kind of superficial revision of certain issues, acting – as Mr Napolitano claimed – as a kind of scribe for the positions adopted by the various Member States. I am not seeking to be a scribe. What I am trying to do is to put forward concrete proposals for specific issues, with the obvious risk that these proposals may not be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">We intend to divide the work of the preparatory group into two stages, in the course of which all of the issues will be studied. The first stage would begin with qualified majority voting, and the members would then try to identify institutional issues relating to the leftovers, and only at that point would we address the issue of the Commission and the weighting of votes. The issue of closer cooperation would be included with institutional issues.</p>
<p class="contents">In the final part, that is the second stage, we would revisit the set of issues that had already been addressed, which had been discussed at ministerial meetings, and we would also try to identify the range of new issues that might be added to the agenda. Knowing whether security and defence issues had already had been fully discussed in the meetings reserved for them would play a crucial role in deciding whether we could integrate them into the final stage of the Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">The same thing could be said about the Charter of Fundamental Rights. We will see, when the time comes, whether the discussions being held specifically on this issue will lead to conclusions enabling us to include this issue in the Intergovernmental Conference, particularly in the second half of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">These, in principle, are the presidency’s intentions on this matter. We will be presenting a report to the Lisbon European Council, which will, of course, have to be of a factual nature, given that we will be making the report in March, only having convened the conference in February. We hope that the second report, which the presidency will present on its own behalf at the second European Council, will, if possible, be more substantial and contain more specific points concerning the treaty texts. We have taken note of the proposals put forward by the Commission. In our presidency capacity, we welcome these proposals and they will be properly addressed in the discussions at this conference, whatever each Member State may think about the solutions the Commission itself is putting forward in its proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that we will be able to include all the suggestions and documents that Member States may send us on this matter. In fact, we shall be requesting the Member States to provide us as quickly as possible with their contributions to this conference rather than have them arrive at the last moment. Of course the conference will always be open to suggestions from the Member States, but we would like them to state their positions as promptly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is what we think the real work of this conference will be. We are genuinely determined that, where the Intergovernmental Conference is concerned, the Portuguese Presidency should be exercised effectively and seriously. We also hope to be able to hand over to the French Presidency something tangible and as representative as possible of the links that may be established between the Member States in the course of our work.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It seemed to us that the agenda lacked content, because our group was thinking in terms of the Treaty and, specifically, the protocol on the Union’s institutions. In Helsinki, the governments approved the idea that, as long as the European Union consists of fewer than 21 States, a minimal reform would be sufficient. With more than 21, a deeper reform would become necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council in Helsinki itself approved enlargement involving 13 new Member States. It is therefore inconsistent to open accession negotiations with 13 countries while contemplating a minimal reform. We are therefore thinking in terms of the Treaty and we want the agenda of the next Intergovernmental Conference to allow for a deeper reform of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, Mr President, this Parliament is holding this debate today because we did not want to delay the start of the Conference. In theory, we could have done so. We could have voted on the 17th of this month and the Conference would not have been able to start on the 14th. However, we did not want to do this because we wish to send a clear political signal to the governments and the candidate countries that we want this reform to take place, precisely in order to facilitate enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I am very happy to be able to say this to the Portuguese Presidency because it has earned great respect in this Assembly. The Portuguese Presidency shares many of this Parliament’s aspirations and has committed itself to doing everything it can to ensure that the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference is widened to include other essential issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to point out that this aspiration on the part of the European Parliament is not an aspiration to gain benefits for the European Parliament itself. However, the European Parliament will be reinforced politically by the Treaty resulting from this Intergovernmental Conference. This is for one very simple reason: according to the agreements made in Helsinki, this Intergovernmental Conference will lead to issues, which are currently decided unanimously, being decided by a qualified majority. Therefore, the number of issues decided by a qualified majority will increase. It is already established within the Community acquis that those legislative issues which are decided by a qualified majority are also subject to codecision with Parliament. Therefore, since the qualified majority will be extended, there will also be more codecision with Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this Parliament would not be fulfilling its role as a supranational European institution if it did not consider the political design of the Union. That it is what we are doing. We believe that, in the political design of the Union, other issues need to be dealt with. These include, amongst others, the incorporation into the Treaty of security and defence issues, which have made much progress recently, but which must be incorporated into the Treaty. Of course there is also the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and work began on its wording yesterday, which I believe has started very positively. We are going to work seriously to ensure that the Europeans come to see being European as an advantage and that European citizens have certain fundamental rights which are connected to the Union’s institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President, our proposals, which we will specify in another report, together with the proposals of the Commission, which has produced an excellent document – and I am happy to be able to say this here to Mr Barnier – are going to be used as conference documents. We will talk about this on another day. Today we must give the green light to this conference, and, for its part, the Group of the European People’s Party, Mr President, is ready to give that green light. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are giving a positive opinion on the convening of the IGC precisely because we have been impressed by the attitude of the Portuguese Presidency which has taken on board our request that the agenda of the IGC be widened. The Amsterdam leftovers is not a very good term, because they are very important subjects in themselves. Let us call them the first three subjects of the IGC.</p>
<p class="contents">These first three subjects are very important but they are subjects which were explored in detail by our Member States during the last IGC. They did not quite reach a conclusion on them but they certainly do not need nine months of further study. They need a political deal. It is more a question of nine minutes, perhaps nine hours if it is difficult, locked away together in a room to reach a solution on these subjects, not nine months. In those circumstances it would be silly not to widen the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other issues that should fruitfully be looked at, especially before such a large widening of the Union to so many new countries. Nobody is asking for a Christmas tree. Nobody is asking for an IGC of the Maastricht style with a hundred or more subjects being debated. However, there are six, seven, eight, nine perhaps, subjects which it would be very appropriate and useful to address. There is time. Remember the IGC that led to the Single European Act. It lasted only five months. The IGC that led to the enormous Maastricht Treaty lasted a year. Only the Amsterdam Treaty lasted a year and a half and that was because everyone knew you had to wait for the results of the British election if you were going to have any outcome from that IGC so that was a different reason. A year is ample time to address a large number of issues and it should certainly be enough to address the few crucial points that we wish to be added to the agenda. I am pleased to see that the Commission shares our view.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has just published its opinion and it has done exactly what Parliament asked of it – to bring forward a comprehensive proposal complete with actual draft treaty articles. I thank the Commission for doing that even if, of course, I do not agree with everything the Commission said. I think there are some gaps in what they have put forward. Nonetheless the Commission has provided a service and I pay tribute to Commissioner Barnier who is here with us today for doing that. They have laid out for the public to see some of the crucial issues that we are going to have to address in this IGC. That is all to the good. The Parliament, the Council presidency and the Commission are pulling in the same direction for a wider agenda. I wish you every success, President of the Council, in making sure that the European Council agrees to this agenda and that on Valentine’s Day when you start off the IGC it will be under good auspices and you will bring it to a good conclusion, also when the French Presidency takes over, by the end of this year.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is one of the political conclusions that we must draw from the grave decision of 14 Member States yesterday virtually to freeze relations with a partner. It makes it impossible for those same Member States, at the IGC, to fail to give operational meaning to the protection and advancement of fundamental rights. It is already strange within the convention that is drafting the charter to see representatives of some Member States, especially Britain and France, seeking to argue that a mandatory charter would somehow be an infringement of national sovereignty.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital that the IGC prepares the way to accept the installation of a fundamental rights regime within the Treaty. One part of this is to improve the access of the citizen to the Court. Another is for the Union itself to sign up to the European Convention. Another is clearly for national parliaments and national political parties to find a reinforced role that they can play inside European Union affairs and to share the shouldering of responsibility to build European parliamentary democracy.</p>

<p class="contents">We would have preferred to have had greater clarification of the agenda and more guarantees on the method before giving our opinion, and frankly, we did not appreciate the discourtesy the Portuguese Presidency showed towards the European Parliament by scheduling the start of the Intergovernmental Conference for Saint Valentine’s day, the first day of the Strasbourg part-session. </p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, given that this opinion is quite important, we can still vote for it, and indeed, the majority of our group will be voting for it. I nevertheless wish to stress the fact that it is quite distressing to see the lack of real interest in this reform. </p>
<p class="contents">The events in Austria make it crystal clear that we need a body or structure for democracy in Europe and we need to establish principles which provide bases all the Member States. It is also distressing to think that the initiative taken against Austria is actually the result of an agreement between governments and that, in any case, the European Union and its institutions would not have had the means or the consensus to allow them to act, and to prevent and rectify the course of events. </p>
<p class="contents">We must take action on this at the Intergovernmental Conference, and I firmly hope that this opinion, that was given reluctantly, will not mean that the European Parliament ceases to exert pressure on the Council and the Member States to make sure that this Intergovernmental Conference is not merely a technical exercise, but rouses the passions that we saw a few hours ago in Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, we find ourselves in a situation of historic importance, that is to say, we are negotiating or are on the point of taking up negotiations with 12 States, and together we have reached a stage at which closer European integration may be a reality in the not too distant future. How, though, is the Union to be enlarged if we do not do the job properly now, i.e. before enlargement takes place? That is why we as a group are in favour of the Intergovernmental Conference. We consider it to be indispensable and urgently needed and hope that it actually comes up with the goods that will enable us to carry out enlargement of the European Union in the not too distant future.</p>
<p class="contents">My group, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, noted with satisfaction that the Council Presidency is far from happy with the current state of affairs. You can therefore rest assured that the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is committed to seeing that the Union gets on with the tasks in hand.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are talking about is nothing more and nothing less than the future of Europe, and, in particular, a Europe that the citizens truly regard as being theirs, because they are instrumental in shaping it and because the cares and concerns, the problems and issues they face on a daily basis are also taken seriously by politicians. The politics of closed doors and private discussions; all that must be consigned to the past once and for all. That is why we need transparency. I believe it falls to you, as President-in-Office of the Council, to see to it that the train does not keep rolling on as before, leaving the people behind on the platforms as if they were ignorant as to the content of the treaties. We believe it is imperative not just to make every available effort to provide the citizens with comprehensive information on how the Intergovernmental Conference is going, and its outcome, rather they must be directly involved in the overall reform process to a far greater extent.</p>
<p class="contents">We also take the view that the political decision-makers must at long last change the habit of a life-time and ask the citizens in referenda, once the Intergovernmental Conference is over, whether or not they go along with the way in which Europe is to continue to develop in the future. In this way, Europe would truly belong to the citizens and the Union would acquire an entirely new quality of democratic legitimacy. </p>
<p class="contents">There is another central issue relating to democracy that I would like to make clear reference to. As a member of the convention that has now taken up its work on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, I wish to make the following point clear: neither my group nor I are content with making a solemn announcement about the Charter. After all, what will the citizens say if we make a solemn announcement about rights to them but they are unable to take legal action in respect of these rights as individuals? No, to my mind this would only serve to deepen the credibility crisis facing the Union. The poor turnout at the European elections really should have been warning enough for everyone. What we need are visible rights for each and every citizen; the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding for all the citizens of the Union. Together we should work towards this goal in the interests of the citizens, and what I expect to come out of the Intergovernmental Conference is that the relevant Cologne decision will be revised here at the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we are also talking about effectiveness of decisions and functioning institutions in a Union of 27 plus Member States. We will not achieve this just by undertaking a mini reform, as the Council has resolved to do, and that is why all institutions must come under scrutiny. We need bold change and, at the same time, we must take care to give the greatest possible attention to equal rights for the major and small States. This is something I would stress, particularly with my being an MEP for one of the major Member States. I would like to thank the Commission for the proposals they have put forward and I am certain that comprehensive discussions with the citizens will ensue here in the European Parliament, on all the issues you have raised.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one final issue I would like to raise. Parliament’s opinion expressly demands amendments to the Treaty in the area of economic policy. It is indeed the case that globalisation of national economies, but above all the introduction of the euro and the associated stability pact have led to a situation where we need to do more than analyse decision-making processes. What we need most of all is to have the courage to undertake a critical examination of the Union’s policies to date. It is all about creating a socially just Europe. A socially just Europe is still highly topical, for what we need to do as a matter of priority is place the fight against mass unemployment and poverty firmly at the centre of the Union’s policies. Hence, to my mind, that includes having the courage to amend Article 4 of the EC Treaty, which defines the Union in traditional neoliberal style as an open market economy with free competition. The same applies to Article 105, in my view, for the European Central Bank must at last be given the political task as enshrined in the Treaty, of using its monetary policy to promote sustained growth and employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berthu (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group considers that the agenda for the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, as set by the Helsinki Council, i.e. focussing strictly on the issue of decision making in an enlarged Europe, must be adhered to. It must be adhered to in the interests of the fast, effective work of the conference, prior to enlargement. This is why we cannot subscribe to either the opinion of the European Parliament or indeed to that of the Commission, which both wish to widen this agenda far too much and, what is more, widen it in the wrong direction, i.e. moving towards centralisation and an ever tighter European system.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group has therefore tabled a raft of amendments which, when taken together, form a real alternative resolution. In them we say that the forthcoming IGC must look into a decision-making system that pays greater attention to national sovereignty. We deplore the fact that the Commission, in its opinion of 26 January, limits itself to following the routine path of a standardised Europe enlarging towards the East, a centralised superstate operating on the basis of majority decisions. The federalists imagine that they are thereby going to create unity through constraint, but this is a totally superficial concept.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite the opposite, in an enlarged Europe, Mr President, the standardisation imposed by the improper use of majority decisions can lead only to the whole thing exploding. Furthermore, the centralised European system, as we can see it developing today and as we can foresee it by extrapolation, erodes nations and, in eroding nations, erodes the national patriotism which forms the basis of our will to defend ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The Europe which results from this is not stronger but weaker, as it no longer knows what it is or what it is defending. This is why we have always said that enlargement was possible only if the diversity and freedom of the peoples of Europe was clearly recognised, i.e. by adopting flexibility founded upon the respect of national sovereignty. We are delighted today to see the progress this idea has enjoyed in certain circles, one which are still, unfortunately, outside the European Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">A flexible Europe, is a Europe which respects its national democracies, which relies on the support of its nations, its national patriotisms, instead of continually persecuting them. It is this that gives us the determination to defend ourselves against external threats, not the constraining, convoluted decision making procedures which the Commission thought it could propose at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is no coincidence that the last intervention is the only one that<span class="bold"> </span>was<span class="bold"> </span>completely opposed to further European integration. I say this without being the slightest bit ironical about the highly respectable position of Mr Berthu and his group, but it is no coincidence that the European Council’s decision is supported by those who are, after all, in Parliament because – and this is a highly respectable position – they are fighting against further integration.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the message that Parliament is sending to the Council. I hope that the Portuguese Presidency – and I add my compliments to those already offered – can convey Parliament’s message and convey the result of our mediation work on Saint Valentine’s day. In any case, tomorrow we shall vote against the IGC agenda. This message must be very clear; this is how we explain the way we shall vote tomorrow. We shall give an opinion – which is technically and legally necessary – on convening the IGC on 14 February, but we shall give an unfavourable opinion of its content. Just consider the facts: we looked at Austria a while ago, but we can also look at the stock markets, Mr President: given that the euro, that great undertaking, has fallen 16% against the dollar in a year, then perhaps, I will not say a government, but a good head of a family should ask himself whether one can conceivably tell the citizens that the only subjects open to negotiation are the number of Commissioners or similar issues. </p>
<p class="contents">There is clearly a more ambitious goal. We Radicals have tabled amendments which we are submitting to the House in order to consolidate this text, and for example, to request – just for the sake of mentioning Articles 6 and 7 – that the very minimum be done, i.e., that the European Parliament should also be involved in drawing up the European Constitution and that a proposal be made for the European Parliament to adopt the amendments to the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that there are other topics: for example, many Members have subscribed, along with us, to the issue of the seat of the institutions, an issue that we believe should be considered at least at IGC level. </p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I hope that the message that we give tomorrow will be strong and wide-ranging for once, so that thanks also to the efforts of the Portuguese Presidency, this agenda will be revised. Otherwise, the challenge really would be lost, not just for the present but also for many years to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He said that there would always be unanimity on social questions but, in the Commission’s draft, plans are quite explicitly being made for majority decision-making on issues relating to social security and on taxes connected with the internal market. This means that it will be possible for major parts of the social systems in the Member States to be changed by a majority in Brussels, even if a unanimous French National Assembly, a British House of Commons and a Dutch Lower House should be against this. And, in this regard, you are going to the heart of democracy as it relates to distribution policy and people’s social conditions, which are what voters wish to influence when they go to the polls. These are matters which we ourselves shall no longer be able to decide upon as voters and no longer be able to change on election day. Brussels knows best. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi also announced greater transparency, but his draft regulation signals a clear backward step, and that is not only my assessment, but also that of the European Ombudsman. Today, the Commission is obliged, on a case-by-case basis, to weigh considerations of confidentiality against people’s demands for, and expectation of, transparency and, if the Commission’s regulation is adopted, the Commission will be entitled to lock away whole categories of documents without having to give them specific consideration. There is also the desire to create a legal entitlement to confidentiality and to lock away documents of a kind which are at present publicly available in a range of Member States. Under the banner of “progress towards transparency”, a range of documents is being locked away from the general public. It is, of course, thoroughly Orwellian. I want to ask Mr Prodi never more to comment on a proposal here in the House which is not, at the same time, available for critical scrutiny by the public. Mr Prodi secured positive comments for a proposal which would otherwise have been met with criticism, for the new draft regulation presents as progress the fact that it will now be possible to grant right of access to documents in the Commission’s possession. There follows, however, a long, long list of exceptions, and there is legal entitlement to confidentiality in regard to those exceptions. The French text contains the word “refuse” and the English text the word “shall”, which means that the Commission is to keep secret such information as is today available to the public, for example in my own country. In addition, we have a flexible clause concerning the efficiency of the negotiations and of the institutions, which may be used for any purposes whatsoever. It is therefore …</p>

We as a European Parliament will use these opportunities to see that our issues are given the attention they deserve. The preparations the Commission has made so far are on the right track, although they do not go far enough if the European Parliament’s motions are anything to go by. There is more to be said on that score.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucially important for this Intergovernmental Conference to score a hat trick; that of the power to act, democratic legitimacy and transparency. In the end, it is only by having these three things in place that we will be able to achieve acceptance amongst the citizens. At the same time of course, we need to create the power to act in order to facilitate the enlargement of the European Union. If we have been having a different debate here in this Chamber today then that only goes to show how important this is. The European Union must also have the power to act in the event of a government electing to impose a total blockade. This is an important sign that majority voting is a crucial pre-requisite to the European Union’s being able to function come what may. This is particularly important where enlargement is concerned, and legislation and in relation to treaties, which entail changes being made to legislation. Of course we also want to extend the European Parliament’s corresponding powers in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we as a European Parliament are going to have to take action in relation to Economic and Monetary Union, for there is a lack of supervision in this area. The Finance Ministers behave as if they were in an intergovernmental meeting, when in the Ecofin Council and in the Euro 11 Council, which is an unacceptable way to go on. Unlike Mrs Kaufmann, I am not in favour of extending supervision over the European Central Bank as I am an advocate of independence for the European Central Bank. However, there must be an appropriate level of supervision on the political side. Furthermore, the tripartite relationship of Commission, Council and Parliament must be restored to the sphere of foreign and security policy, where hitherto the Council was in sole charge far more than should have been the case, especially in relation to the crudely fashioned crisis management measures, for which the Commission alone has responsibility. The overall plan failed to do justice to any of this. We must examine whether any changes are needed to this end which would fall within the scope of the Intergovernmental Conference. The Portuguese Presidency has agreed to initiate deliberations on this matter, perhaps to extend the mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another point I would just like to draw your attention to. The debates we are having these days, on a certain European country’s government, for example, show, do they not, that we must place the spiritual, moral, constitutional, community and common welfare-orientated leanings of the European Union on a firm footing, and that legally binding fundamental rights must also be incorporated into the Treaty for the same reason, as this will be a crucial stabilising factor. I would urge those who are still very hesitant in this respect to consider whether now is not the time to make this connection and perhaps pluck up the courage we need to make suitable progress in matters of fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union needs few, if any, new instruments, and it does not need any new competences. What it does need are instruments that will enable it to put its competences into practice. For this reason, we must ensure that the instruments have the effect of enabling us to carry out, on behalf of the citizens, the tasks we have already formally been set in the Treaty. In my view, that is the most important issue this Intergovernmental Conference has to concentrate its energies on. If we succeed in making progress here, then we will also be ready for the historic task of enlarging the European Union. This is the crux of the matter. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am confident that this will be tackled in a suitably positive manner under your tutelage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can assure you that it was not easy to achieve this, last week in the Committee I chair, but we eventually decided to back the Portuguese Presidency and we would like to win this wager.</p>
<p class="contents">You spoke to us about the start of your tour around the various capital cities and told us about the difficulties that some governments have in reaching a consensus in their own countries, and therefore in their parliaments. I would like you to bear in mind that yesterday we had a very worthwhile day of discussions and dialogue with the representatives of the 15 national parliaments, which were represented by competent and exacting delegations. The aim was not to draw conclusions – it was impossible to draw any – but the debate was certainly very encouraging. We need to be careful and be sure that national governments try to convince their respective parliaments to ratify solutions that correspond to the Union’s requirements for growth and that they do not hide behind supposed resistance put up by the parliaments to avoid signing appropriate conclusions at the Intergovernmental Conference table. However, we shall intensify our collaboration and our dialogue with the national parliaments for the entire duration of the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, we also discussed the Commission, represented by Commissioner Barnier, who gave its opinion. This effort was appreciated, even if different views were later expressed as regards the proposals, and moreover, Mr President-in-Office, you also expressed different views. Nevertheless, we must stress that many people are aware, as they were yesterday too, of the risk that enlargement could compromise the original plan for the construction of a political Europe, a risk that was, moreover, indicated in an interview that surely escaped no one’s attention, owing to the authority of the person being interviewed – Jacques Delors.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, therefore, ensure that at the Intergovernmental Conference we discuss how to consolidate the democratic bases of the Union and how to strengthen – and this has been discussed in the House even today, with regard to the situation in Austria – the system of principles, values and rights underpinning the Union and the role of the political institutions of the Union, with regard, among other things, to running the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">We are counting on the Portuguese Presidency, we are counting on ourselves and we are counting on the Commission so that we can hold constructive and decisive debates on all of this at the Intergovernmental Conference.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Finnish Presidency only listened to minimalist governments and, unfortunately, turned a deaf ear to this Parliament. Portugal should not take a leaf out its predecessor’s book. </p>
<p class="contents">It is of the utmost importance that the European Parliament and the Commission join forces for this IGC. In many ways, they share the same interests and the same insights. An essential component of this joint effort should, in any case, be this Parliament’s right of assent to the forthcoming changes to the Treaty. Of all priorities, this one is the most pressing. What is the Commission’s verdict on this? </p>
<p class="contents">It also means that our Parliament President and the two representatives should be able to take part on an equal political footing and, therefore, not only within the working party, but also at the same political level as the Commission. There is no reason whatsoever why representatives directly elected by citizens should be involved in talks at a lower level than the Commission. </p>
<p class="contents">Not only do we owe the sweeping reforms to the new Member States, but we owe them to ourselves. If we allow Europe to be watered down as a result of enlargement, we will drown in our own political quagmire. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It seems to take a masochistic pleasure in self-mutilation. After having restricted, on its own initiative, its participation in the IGC to two minor seats, Parliament is now giving up the right to add to the agenda for this IGC. The fact is, whether through weakness or foolishness – nothing to be proud of either way, you will admit – in rushing to give its opinion, Parliament is giving up the only lever which the Treaty accords it, i.e. demanding a complete IGC agenda as a prerequisite before declaring its opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Why do we have to vote on this opinion tomorrow, 3 February, as a matter of urgency, when we could wait, in a position of strength, until the opening of the Strasbourg part-session on 14 February, and thus force an agenda that is complete, and therefore consistent, on the Council. A good dose of hypocrisy is needed to overlook our weakness today. Hypocrisy to be regretted bitterly, in our resolution, that the agenda for the IGC is not equal to the issues, since in our haste, with blameworthy naivety, we are stopping ourselves forcing through this more ambitious agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">If there is a democratic deficit at the end of this IGC, then I say that the political groups which so wanted this haste will be accountable for this. Whether we want it or not, since Parliament itself is going to extinguish the only spotlight capable of shedding a little light on the debates, the venue for decisions is now going to move to the 15 Member States of the Union. I therefore invite the Members of Parliament who form the great majority, those who last November ruled that the future of Europe was deserving of debates that went far wider than the Amsterdam leftovers, to take up their pilgrims’ staffs and go and convince their own governments that this IGC must be extended, since this is permitted according to the resolution of the Helsinki Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of the situation in Austria, this is a dark day for Europe. It makes us realise that the victory of democracy is never definitive, and that we have to work to convince and keep on convincing. In order to assert our fundamental values, they need to be laid down in writing, as a matter of urgency, and, beyond this IGC, I believe we owe Europe a constitution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The forthcoming enlargement of the Union is used as an argument for this. I am convinced that this is an error of judgement. A federal and centralist EU which intervenes more and more in the government of the Member States is in actual fact less well placed for enlargement. A flexible EU which concentrates on fewer but important areas and which respects national differences and national democracy has a better chance of embracing a significantly greater number of countries. </p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph D of the draft resolution requires a more coordinated and more open economic policy at EU level. It is not, however, possible to talk about this without at the same time talking about monetary union. This text says nothing about the major democratic and political problems involving monetary union and the European Central Bank. This is untenable. If there is a desire to make the EU more democratic, the whole construction of EMU must be reconsidered. The Central Bank must be placed under political control so that the direction to be taken by monetary policy may be governed by political objectives such as high employment and prosperity. Public control of the Central Bank must be improved if this is to become possible. The rigid and unsuccessful monetarism of the Stability Pact must be re-examined and discarded so that we might have a uniform policy which has prosperity as its primary objective. Article 56 of the Treaty, prohibiting currency speculation or any interference in the free movement of capital, must be removed so that damaging currency speculation may be checked by means of political control. </p>
<p class="contents">In the majority of EU countries, there are now governments dominated by social democrats. It is remarkable that, now they have the opportunity to do so, none of them is demanding any change in the direction taken by monetary union. It also, of course, damages credibility when it is stated that monetary union could constitute a counterbalance to globalised capital. </p>
<p class="contents">The resolution requires the European Parliament to have increased influence over the Intergovernmental Conference. It is, however, important to emphasise that the Intergovernmental Conference is and will remain a conference of the Member States. It is the Member States’ parliaments, or people voting in referenda, who are to direct the development of the Treaty. It is therefore out of the question that the European Parliament should be given any formal influence over the negotiation process or over ratification. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the events of the last few days show that all those who had made basic criticisms of the way enlargement and the revision of the Treaties have been planned were right. The Union cannot be enlarged to 28 without addressing the matter of whether Europe has certain joint principles and values, whether it comes down to an economic free trade area, or whether, on the other hand, it has a greater ambition: the desire to be a supranational union, in ways that have yet to be defined, that wants to blaze a trail for civilisation and democracy in the world. </p>
<p class="contents">This is what is and was meant by the call for a European Constitution. The amendment of the Treaties was, however, limited to a review of some internal rules, which was necessary and important, but did not answer the fundamental question: what is Europe, what are its common principles and therefore, its objectives and limitations? </p>
<p class="contents">However, politics exacts its revenge, and having been thrown out of the window by a debate on a limited agenda, it comes back in, as a matter of fact, through a door, and through the front door in the case of Austria, since a party is entering the Austrian Government which seems to represent a return to intolerance, xenophobia and forms of racism. And it is not a question of links with the past; it is a question of prospects for the future, and nothing could be more wrong than the right and left taking a divided stand on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I belong to a world, the world of Liberal Catholics, which is not left-wing but which holds as dear as anyone else the values of tolerance and common European values, and will have nothing to do with policies that reject these values. </p>
<p class="contents">The Council has done well to lay open this subject to Europe and to the world and if we do not set down these values in a Charter of Fundamental Rights, in a European Constitution, then we shall construct a Europe without a solid, lasting base. </p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Barnier, I know – at least I think I know – that you and the representatives of the Portuguese Presidency share these values: make the most of the chances you were given by the December Conference to include these subjects and principles, because this is the only way we will build a lasting Europe.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am thinking of the contributions from Mr Bonde and Mr Sjöstedt who point out that the present contribution contains a string of relatively unconscious but undoubtedly rational initiatives dictated by the desire for power and pointing in the direction of a centralist and federalist EU. They rightly included the problem with monetary union and centralist government and presented a number of alternative democratic principles. I might add that all rational political campaigning in my own country, Denmark, takes it for granted that, when we enlarge the circle of EU countries to include the envisaged huge number of new Member States and when we in that way extend the breadth of the Union, we cannot at the same time pursue further integration in depth, that is to say engage in a more intensive qualitative integration towards a United States of Europe. However, that is precisely what is happening. With every single geographical extension to the area covered by the EU, we have seen how extensions in breadth have been followed by intensive extensions in depth, and that is precisely what the draft resolution from the Committee is contemplating, especially in paragraph 7 which says that there should be more thorough integration in depth. In the light of developments in recent days, it might well be asked what we really are to do about these intergovernmental conferences and treaty amendments when government leaders – in reality the European Council of Ministers – make decisions in relation to an independent Member State entailing intervention in that Member State’s democratic process. You can think what you like about Mr Haider, and I personally consider him to be a very dangerous politician, but you cannot just intervene in an independent and friendly country’s democratic process. When we hold intergovernmental conferences and consider changes to the Treaty, we must take into account the fact that the EU is developing all the time, sometimes in contravention of the Treaty, as we have just seen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On 14 February, we will see the launch of the IGC which is to be completed by the end of 2000. This is a big task but it can be done. I think it is generally agreed here this afternoon across all groups that the Helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to cover the necessary reform to prepare Europe for enlargement. In other words we need to go further than what has been referred to as the important “Amsterdam leftovers”. These include the extension of qualified voting – in my country we accept that but not to areas of taxation – the re-weighting of voting in Council to favour larger states and the number of Commissioners in an enlarged Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the latter point, Ireland wants to maintain the right to nominate a full and equal Member of the Commission irrespective of the number of Member States joining. We are prepared to consider re-weighting the votes in the Council of Ministers, provided that the larger Member States are willing to agree to every Member State having a full and equal Member of the Commission. I feel I speak for many smaller countries when I make that particular point.</p>
<p class="contents">At the IGC, we would also need a debate on the possible divisions of the Treaties into two – into a policy area and an area on the Constitution. We would accept the division of the Treaties providing it would not limit the control the smaller Member States had in the re-negotiation of the whole policy area of the Treaty. In other words, if we are not represented fully in the Commission we will not have an input into policy discussions. So we are watching that entire point extremely carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">We look forward to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to seeing its contents. The Treaty of Amsterdam, Mr President, has set the number of European Parliament Members at 700 and a debate is needed in this Parliament on how that number will be distributed among the enlarged Europe.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In any case, this emerges from the favourable schedule we decided upon.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, under the present rules of the Treaties, the European Parliament would have little to gain from a policy of confrontation. On the contrary, we should concentrate on working out persuasive proposals on the necessary reforms, in collaboration with the Commission whose own proposals are worthy of note. We must use dialogue at every political level, including of course dialogue with the national parliaments. That way, we will create a climate of cooperation which will be positive for the quality of the reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference must make it clear to those with whom they will be negotiating that, with the Union’s institutional changes, we are faced with responsibility for the constitutional development of the Union. They must therefore realise that such issues cannot be decided on the rationale of bargaining alone. The issues to be dealt with at this Intergovernmental Conference are exceptionally sensitive. It may be easy to come up with solutions, but what matters is how well those solutions will stand up in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">I will mention two point that may create tension. One is the balance which has so far been maintained between large and small countries. Europe is not, nor can it become a classic federal state. The solutions we opt for must be consistent with the fundamental rationale of the European Union, which is a union of states and peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">The other area of conflict is more difficult. Owing to the imminent increase in membership, the bodies of the future European Union must become more effective. This means that they must function more simply and more rapidly. By its very nature, however, the European Union is, and will remain, a complex and convoluted multi-governmental institution. Possibilities for faster and more simple operation do exist. Of course they do, but they are not unlimited. If the limits are exceeded because of a one-sided quest for effectiveness, then the legitimising basis of the European Union will suffer. I am, however, optimistic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The most important issue with regard to this is internal differentiation within the Union. It is unfortunate that there has been no serious consideration thus far here in Parliament of the issue of internal differentiation within the Union, which will, however, be necessary if the Union is to enlarge as planned. The Commission’s former president, Jacques Delors, has once again publicly raised the issue of a European Confederation. He has also said that the countries in the vanguard of integration should be able to proceed faster and that they should have their own institutions, for the sake of clarity. The Commission’s current President, Mr Prodi, and the High Representative, Mr Solana, have put forward ideas along the same lines.</p>
<p class="contents">Last November, the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party adopted a position on internal differentiation within the Union when it proposed a system of concentric rings for Europe: the onion skin model. In the next resolution on the IGC, Parliament must take a long and hard look at the questions of differentiation and flexibility. Both enlargement and the achievements of integration will come under threat unless we can create a system of concentric rings, as proposed by the Group of the European Liberal Democrats and Reform Party. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity, not just between Union and Member States but between Member States and their own internally self-governing regions. This has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about.</p>
<p class="contents">May I particularly draw attention to one of the implications of enlargement in respect of this Parliament. A ceiling of 700 has been prescribed as the maximum that Parliament can safely become and remain a deliberative assembly. If you apply the existing principle of digressive proportionality, six seats for every state and then one more seat for every half a million inhabitants, you already have the situation where Luxembourg with 367,000 people has more Members in this Chamber than Wales, which is a partly self-governing region of the United Kingdom. Scotland, with a population of 5 million, has eight seats in this House at the moment; Denmark and Finland, with the same population, have sixteen.</p>
<p class="contents">Now what is going to happen if we retain a ceiling of 700, bring in 26% more population over time, and then adopt the Commission’s, I think ill-considered, proposition, that there should be a European list of candidates. What will happen to a place like Scotland, which I represent here? It will become totally invisible!</p>
<p class="contents">Members of this House should not in these circumstances be in the least surprised that in these discussions, people in Scotland and other such countries are asking whether enlargement should not also take the form of admitting new Member States from within existing ones. A growing body of opinion in Scotland holds that view.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are not discussing the substance of the agenda, that is the items already included or those that we all wish to see included. We are stating the political position of the European Parliament on convening the Intergovernmental Conference. There is nothing new here, apart from one aspect: the fact that with this opinion – assuming it is approved tomorrow – the European Parliament is adopting a positive strategy to assist in widening the IGC agenda. This also demonstrates its willingness to contribute, by means of its two representatives and its President, to reaching a more satisfactory final solution to this revision of the Treaty. This opinion is positive about the convening of the IGC and yet critical, as it would inevitably have to be, about the substance of this agenda. </p>
<p class="contents">The constitutional framework has now been clarified. Everybody is aware of the Portuguese Presidency’s positive and ambitious approach, and they are also aware of the European Parliament’s position. The Commission has just drawn up a document in which it also explains some of its views, some of which are presented as options, which means that the ball, to use a sporting expression, is now in the European Council’s court.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President, and my dear friend Dr Seixas da Costa, my question is this: without wishing to know more than we need to at the moment – in order not to compromise our common goal – I would like to know, from the contacts you have made during your tour of the capitals and from your own point of view, if there is any useful information you could give us. I ask this because at the moment our lobbying work is more important than our work within the European Parliament. This involves raising the awareness of the governments that are most reluctant to include further items on this IGC agenda, and persuading them to do so.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">My second question is for Commissioner Barnier. It relates to the Commission’s initiative. I was one of its critics, as I felt that the Commission should have gone further at the Helsinki European Council. I also feel, however, that the Commission did an excellent job, whether or not you agree with the solutions put forward in the document adopted on 26 January. However, why is the Commission concentrating only on the Amsterdam leftovers or perhaps on some other point? Why is it confining itself to stating that other issues could be included, specifically the Charter of Fundamental Rights or common foreign and security policy issues? I would therefore challenge the Commission to move forward and to begin, at least by providing alternatives, to work on these other points, which will perhaps later on form part of the agenda and contribute to its success. It could do this in the same thorough way in which it has worked on the proposals we are already familiar with.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall finish by offering my warmest congratulations to the Portuguese Presidency. They do not have an easy task, but I know that it is in safe hands.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been said many times. This time, however, it is true. We have established the single currency – which is extremely positive – and we are facing enlargement. The question is if we will undertake enlargement whether we are prepared or not. Will we enlarge with or without deep reform? That is the debate, and this question must be addressed in any discussion of the Intergovernmental Conference, its agenda or its method.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the Council, for the moment, has not opted for enlarging with deep reforms in place. That puts enlargement in danger. It jeopardises any prospect of political union and, of course, it is difficult for the public to understand. The Council must realise that, if we want the future of the European Union to involve a form of enlargement built on firm foundations, the next Intergovernmental Conference must go much further.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is consulting us and Parliament is giving its opinion. We want an Intergovernmental Conference, but not this one. Must there be an IGC? Of course there must, but not this type of Intergovernmental Conference. The agenda must go much further. We must be much more daring with regard to the issues dealt with in the IGC and we must be much more transparent and much more democratic. Being much more democratic means greater participation by the European Parliament and allowing the Commission to exercise even more – yes, more – its ability to take the initiative. We must clearly set firm objectives. The functionalist approach is over, for better or for worse. The functionalist approach has brought us to this point. Have we achieved results? Yes, but the point is to make a qualitative leap and, speaking in political terms, this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, means convincing the other Community partners that to fall short would be the worst thing we could do at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barnier,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the House, at this stage, following this debate which I have listened to most attentively and with great interest, I should like to make a few comments in addition to the guidelines and the statements which it has been my honour to present to you in the course of recent weeks in the company of President Prodi.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the report which they produced after extremely thorough and meticulous work, your two rapporteurs, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, proposed that Parliament should adopt a formal opinion pursuant to Article 48 of the Treaty and thus, if this opinion were adopted, the Intergovernmental Conference could effectively start on 14 February, as suggested by the Portuguese Presidency. As far as we are concerned, after producing the opinion expected from the Commission, according to this same Article 48 of the Treaty, we are pleased that the conference can thus begin earlier than anticipated. We know, I know myself, that the weeks we have before us will be useful to us. I would just like to make a few comments, after reading the draft opinion and after listening to the speakers on behalf of the various groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission understands the anxiety expressed by a number of you with regard to the scope of the conference agenda. I understand this anxiety, this fear that the agenda may be too limited, and yet I feel, as I said to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on returning from Helsinki, that we can work on the basis of this Helsinki mandate. Indeed, it is in this spirit and in the framework of this mandate, which the Commission framed for its own opinion, but using all the terms thereof, plus everything between the lines.</p>
<p class="contents">We have not restricted ourselves to the three so-called leftovers, which is, in any case, an incorrect label. I do not like the term ‘leftovers’ any more than Richard Corbett does. It gives the impression that they are three minor or insignificant subjects whereas in fact they are three extremely serious and important subjects, and difficult, so difficult that we did not have sufficient political courage collectively at Amsterdam to deal with them in depth.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as we are concerned – I am responding to Mr Seguro who expressed concerns about this just now – we have not restricted ourselves to these three subjects, even though I do consider them as priorities, and consider that they must be dealt with now. They are the first but they are not the only subjects, Mr Seguro, that the conference must deal with. We have dealt with other subjects and we have mentioned our idea that other subjects may be dealt with in this conference, if the Portuguese Presidency firstly, and then the French Presidency, so wish, in view of the serious nature of the present juncture prior to enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">We are ready for it, whether it is a matter of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, on which work has started, the CFSP and the consequences for the institutions of the current defence policy negotiations, or an extremely difficult subject on which we are continuing to work: reorganisation of the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">I have heard many comments on the Commission’s opinion, which mentioned all these subjects and dealt with many of them in depth, with specific indications of new draft articles, but no one has said that we were going beyond the Helsinki mandate. This proves that it is possible to go into issues in depth while respecting this mandate, by using the terms laid down in the mandate and all the openings which it offers.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the participation of the European Parliament in the conference proceedings, I think that Mr Seixas da Costa will agree with me, on the basis of our shared experience, in saying that you would be wrong to disregard the level of the reflection and negotiating group in which your two representatives, Professor Tsatsos and Mr Brok, are going to be working. Of course, the final trade-offs will be made, as in any institutional negotiations, and I think this is no bad thing, at Council level, especially at the level of the Council of Heads of State and Government, who hold the key to the success of this conference in their hands.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me point out, in passing, that the Commission President, Mr Prodi, is also a Council member, and he has every intention of making use of this position and this role, alongside the Heads of State and Government, particularly during the final period. However, these Council proceedings must be carefully prepared. This preparatory work, this fine-tuning, must not be omitted, ladies and gentlemen of the House. I know from my own experience in Amsterdam that it is extremely important and useful, and that it will not just be limited to technical details. I think that all of us, the personal representatives of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, your two representatives, and myself, as a representative of the Commission, will be going into matters in detail, but it will be afterwards, at a different level, one in which we will also be participating, that the last trade-offs must be made.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout this conference, ladies and gentlemen, it is not only the status of the negotiators which is important, but the quality of what they will be saying. And once again I should like to point out in this House, in view of my own experience prior to Amsterdam, that whatever the ambiguity or weakness of the status acknowledged to the two representatives of the European Parliament, prior to Amsterdam, the quality of what Mrs Guigou and Mr Brok said counted for a lot in these negotiations. I am sure that the situation will be just the same and, as far as I am concerned, in my current position, I shall ensure that the contributions of your two representatives are listened to and respected throughout these negotiations. I am sure that in this way the European Parliament will not be just an observer at these negotiations any more than the Commission will be.</p>
<p class="contents">We now await, therefore, with great interest, ladies and gentlemen of the House, your next opinion, in which you will specify Parliament’s priorities and practical proposals for these negotiations. It is extremely important that the two European institutions involved in these negotiations, the Commission on the one hand and Parliament on the other, alongside the Council members, explain clearly to the citizens of the Union continually, every day, what the issues of this conference are and what responses we advocate in our capacity as European institutions responsible for ensuring both the proper operation of this enlarged Union and the common interest.</p>
<p class="contents">In the coming months, ladies and gentlemen of the House, the Commission will therefore be working in close cooperation, on good terms, with your two representatives, Professor Tsatsos and Mr Elmar Brok, in order to reconcile our points of view, if need be. Quite probably, our points of view and our positions will not always be the same. There will probably be differences of opinion, that would be only normal. The important thing is that we are consistent, and I have been committed to working towards this consistency ever since I accepted the position of Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">Our concern and our ambition, therefore, on a large number of subjects, is to be on the same wavelength and to carry these negotiations forward successfully. This will not be a matter of chance, since, let me repeat, I feel we have the same ambitions for these negotiations and that together we see it as a moment of truth for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to make three additional comments, quite briefly, Mr President. Firstly, to congratulate and thank Mr Napolitano, the chairman, and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the extremely original major initiative which it took yesterday in bringing together the competent representatives of national parliaments, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Commission for an initial joint debate. Such dialogue between the national parliaments, the European Parliament and ourselves is extremely important. I have said, furthermore, that I would play my part by visiting each of the national parliaments. Tomorrow, I shall be in London. In a fortnight’s time, I shall be in Berlin. In three weeks’ time, I shall be in Paris, and I shall continue this dialogue in one capital after another. I feel this initiative you have taken is extremely positive, and I should like to thank you for taking it.</p>
<p class="contents">My second brief comment is to thank the Portuguese Presidency, particularly Mr Seixas da Costa, for his proactive approach. Indeed, the comments which have just been made express a proactive attitude and a concern which match his own: the Portuguese Presidency cannot be just an interim presidency. It will have to initiate these negotiations. We are well aware that they cannot be completed within these six months and that it will have to hand over to the French Presidency, in the hope that a conclusion can be reached before the end of the year 2000. Not only that a conclusion can be reached, but that a successful conclusion can be reached, which is not necessarily the same thing.</p>
<p class="contents">Concluding negotiations is not the same as concluding them successfully. The handover will have been made, but the conditions in which the handover is going to be made, by yourself, Mr President, and by the Portuguese Presidency, are going to be extremely important, as is the nature of this handover. It is all the work which is going to be carried out together, under your guidance particularly, in the course of these few months, which is extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">We have great confidence in the Portuguese Presidency’s ability to bring this task to a successful conclusion, and indeed great expectations thereof. Portugal is a small country, but being a small country is no reason why one may not have great ambitions. After having heard Prime Minister Guterres, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and yourself, I have confidence in the ambition of the Portuguese Presidency and the extremely proactive way in which it will conduct these negotiations. It can count on the partnership of the Commission over the next few months.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me repeat, we shall have a very great effort to make in order to popularise the topics of these negotiations. These are difficult subjects, subjects relating to institutional policy and mechanisms which are not always easy to explain. All the more reason for Members of the European Parliament, Ministers, Commissioners to devote a little time to explaining matters to the citizens, to public debate. As far as the Commission is concerned, it will, ladies and gentlemen, be taking initiatives to inaugurate and orchestrate this public debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
