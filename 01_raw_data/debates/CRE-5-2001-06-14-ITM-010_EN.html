The war has been going on for twenty-five years; and again we are about to vote on a resolution. Surely we must ask ourselves the question whether sufficient efforts are being made for peace.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that the Swedish Presidency has applied itself to this question and provided a declaration. I wonder, however, whether the two sides – and I mean both the government of Mr dos Santos and UNITA – are not actually doing their level best to prolong the war.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a war that is fed by a stream of smuggled diamonds and oil: sufficient to buy vast quantities of arms and hold the civilian population hostage. I consider this war to be making a mockery of our civilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore also like to ask that the recommendations again recorded in this resolution, be followed up both by the Commission and by the Council, so that it can be monitored whether the will for peace is really increasing. Of course we welcome the fact that statements have recently been made both by President dos Santos and by the leadership of UNITA expressing the intention to start a dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we see that the civilian population is being harassed time and time again. There are the kidnappings by a new movement, again calling itself a rebel movement. There are the new minefields. There are the attacks on towns and the constant attacks on the civilian population; and those who live in those parts know that meanwhile in the bars on the borders the soldiers are trading with each other. What cynicism! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Because of the consistency required of it, however, this House cannot wipe out its earlier resolutions or the more or less recent positions of the other Community institutions and international bodies, especially the Council, which has particular competences in this matter. Just as it cannot or must not ignore or paper over important events that have happened recently which mark the way the situation in the country is evolving and clarify, if that were necessary, the real intentions of certain forces acting in the territory, especially UNITA under Jonas Savimbi. Having said that, I must also emphasise right now that I regard it as positive that the proposed resolution on a compromise, as it has been presented to us, has essentially put an end to the attempts to cloud the real situation in Angola and whitewash UNITA that underlay the initial proposal by the UEN…</p>
<p class="contents">It is, however, equally true that even after the positive changes that have been added to this compromise at our suggestion, particularly the statement of agreement with the position adopted by the Swedish Presidency on behalf of the Union, it still suffers from unacceptable positionings and serious gaps. This is the case with the obvious attempt to place the responsibilities of the legitimate government of Angola and those of UNITA on the same level, in clear contradiction to successive United Nations resolutions, which are symptomatically and for this very reason forgotten. The same happens with the unacceptable omission of the recent condemnable attack by UNITA in Cachito, which resulted in the death of a great many defenceless, innocent people and the dreadful kidnapping of dozens of children and young people. For that very reason I believe it to be very important and timely for the Commission to reaffirm the positions that it and the Council have adopted on behalf of the European Union. Indeed, as I understand it, nothing can justify the fact that the above-mentioned positions and omissions can remain in a resolution by this Parliament, and they are in fact the essential reason why we have not subscribed to the compromise. Furthermore, we are amazed at the blatant gulf between what was approved and reiterated recently by the Council and what is now proposed, even more so when some of the principal supporters of the current compromise originate from the same political force that shapes a government which so recently defined and adopted the position taken up by the Council. That is also why we tabled some draft amendments with the aim of enabling this Parliament to realign itself with the positions of the Council and the international community and to ensure a line of continuity and consistency with what we have always approved here. Our final vote will of course depend on the direction this vote takes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That was not our intention. Our intention is to contribute to peace, because at last consistent signs are coming from Angola that some lasting change may happen in that country. That is the major piece of news of the last few months. Amid the news of the terrible ongoing war, it is these signs of peace that are strongly emerging from the civil society of Angola and which make our vote today so urgent. It is these signs that we are turning to, to point them out, embrace them and encourage them. We do not want just to cry over more deaths or lament further destruction. We want to welcome those people who, with courage, generosity and independence, coming from the churches and the many sections of Angolan society, are carving out a new path that can lead to national reconciliation and lasting peace. Let us listen to the Angolans. They know more and better than we do. The AMC, the broad movement of citizens, a civic platform recently launched in Luanda, speaks to us of inclusive national reconciliation. Inclusive in the sense of not excluding anyone, because it is the poisonous spirit of exclusion that spreads war, misery and ruin throughout Angola. Inclusive because the spirit of including everybody is a precondition for reconciliation, and because without true reconciliation to restore confidence there will be no peace.</p>
<p class="contents">The Angolans want peace. Let us listen to the Angolans, let us trust that internal mediation and the energy of the civil movements can succeed where international mediation has failed. Let us follow the voice of the Angolans, good people, not just those of the AMC but those of so many movements that fervently hope for peace: the Inter-Church Committee for Peace in Angola, the Angolan Reflection for Peace Group, the ‘Peace and Development’ Women, who today are holding an international conference in Luanda, the Martin Luther King Association, the Justice, Peace and Democracy movements, the Village of Peace, the Messengers of Peace, the Mosaic, and still more, like the Forum on the multiple consequences of war a few months ago, from which there sprang an appeal for an immediate cease-fire. These are the voices we must listen to. We must recognise their features, learn their names, publicise their faces, shake their hands. Because the tragic recent history of Angola teaches us one thing: we must only trust those who talk of peace without arms in their hands, with gestures and instruments of peace. We have to stop this monopoly of the bipolarisation of war.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore ask you to join in an invitation that I have already asked the President to make so that we here can listen to the vision of Angola and the future of peace that people aspire to, people like Dom Zacarias Kamuenho, Vieira Lopes, Rafael Marques, Justino Pinto de Andrade, William Tonnet, Chivukuvuku, Marcolino Moco, Cesinanda Xavier, and others, who have joined this civil movement for peace. These are the ones who can teach us a lot. Angola is still suffering, but it does not have to be like that. This Angola of peace hopes that we will be able to send out new, different signs to the new signs with which it is challenging us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Each time we discuss Sierra Leone or Angola, I think with dismay of this game that was, indeed, regarded as just a game but which, at the same time, showed in a bloody way – one moment in Angola, the next in Sierra Leone – that what could actually be a country’s blessing can also be a curse upon it.</p>
<p class="contents">My friends, I truly believe that we are beginning to see signs of a more intelligent policy in respect of the monitoring of resources. We have seen many proposals for peace – the Lusaka Protocol, peace proposals in Sierra Leone and such like – but so long as war pays better than peace we will not get especially far. I therefore strongly support what Mrs Maes has stated, namely that it is this way we must choose in order to move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that Canada, which has started work on sanctions, deserves our support and forms a reference point for our activities in respect of sanctions and our work in opposition to landmines and child soldiers. We need to introduce similar work that is just as ambitious.</p>
<p class="contents">It is interesting to note that many who speak Angola’s language are speaking today. I also believe that there are many amongst us who have a bad conscience concerning what we said about Angola in the past. We have all in our own way contributed to the tragedy. Now it is a matter of putting a stop to this, of looking at what is singled out in the UN’s reports – including the reports requested by the parliaments of the Member States – and also of pointing the finger at the presidents: those holding power in Togo or Burkina Faso who have, in their own way, contributed to the buying of diamonds or oil.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the World Bank, which was mentioned in the debate, I actually believe it can be a very positive player in Africa, for example by monitoring, as it does at present, the income that the Angolan government acquires through the oil trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Angola has everything it takes to be a great, rich, developed country and a factor for stability and progress in south-western Africa, but it has been squandering its resources and energies in a conflict which seems to go on forever. We condemn the use of war, and we condemn most especially inhuman attacks on defenceless civilians, women and children, attacks that nothing can justify. Several times over the years this Parliament has pronounced on Angola and has criticised attitudes and behaviour. We recall these deliberations, which we uphold and support and which the compromise resolution upholds, recalls and supports. Just as we remember the United Nations deliberations on the conflict and we do not deny that the various sides have different responsibilities. In our view, however, at this precise moment when a little window of hope is opened with declarations from the main players responsible and initiatives in civil society for peace, our role is to encourage this movement.</p>
<p class="contents">We must tell the people of Angola and the political leaders that the international community is willing to collaborate in the search for peace. There is no military solution to this conflict. The General Affairs Council said so at its meeting on 11 June in Luxembourg. Today it is the European Parliament’s turn to affirm it on behalf of the peoples of Europe. We are pleased with the compromise text that it has been possible to draw up and we shall vote against the proposals that may disfigure it, not because we disagree with the content of several of them, but because what is expected of us today are words of encouragement and not of recrimination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Soares (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, my fellow Members of Parliament, representatives of the Commission, I too approve of the draft resolution on Angola, which has resulted from a compromise and in my view is a moderate and well balanced draft. Basically it is an appeal for peace, which at this time, as has been stressed by José Ribeiro e Castro and just now by Carlos Coelho, needs to be supported by the international community and especially our Parliament. The situation of Angola is a tragic situation. Angola is a devastated country, which has experienced twenty-six long years of civil war without a break. That is, since independence on 11 November 1975 there has been a civil war in Angola, and it is still going on. As has just been pointed out, this civil war does not have a military solution; and the theory that it is possible to reach a solution by crushing the enemy, even if the assassination or death of Savimbi were to occur, would not be a solution because the war would carry on. The war can only end through negotiation among those that wage it and through pressure from Angolan civil society, which is at last emerging. There are independent voices of civil society that are appealing for peace, especially those supported by the Angolan Catholic Church, which has played an extremely important role in this, and by all the other churches, which are exerting great pressure for peace, that is, for negotiations for peace. This is the pressure that we must support, both the European Union as a whole and this part of it which is the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Mention has been made of a proposal by some of our left-wing friends – the Greens and the Communist Party – who would like us to make a special condemnation of the Cachito massacre. We do not agree and we have proposed an oral amendment which might be a compromise. This oral amendment would condemn all massacres from whatever source, because there is not just the Cachito massacre but also the massacres that have happened recently, for example, in Cabinda. Therefore if we only mention one kind of massacre we shall be turning a blind eye to a reality which, as has been said, is a complex reality, and therefore what is an apparently humanitarian act is essentially a political act with which we cannot agree. For that reason we are going to vote on this proposal for a resolution as it has been drawn up and not with the amendments that have been suggested. By doing this we think we can contribute to peace in Angola, and I should like to second José Ribeiro e Castro’s proposal for Parliament to listen to independent voices from Angola who are today courageously fighting for peace, such as the journalist Rafael Marques, such as Archbishop Zacarias Kamuenho, such as the former Prime Minister of Angola Marcolino Moco, and many other Angolans who are able and have the courage to come to this Parliament and say truthfully that it is necessary to get rid of the warlords. Because while it is true that there are warlords on both sides and that both should be condemned, whether on the side of the MPLA or on the side of UNITA (and we must condemn them both), the truth is that there are interested parties that gain with the war, and those that gain with the war are the oil and diamond interests. What we need to do is help civil society and the churches to emerge so that this ravaged people may finally achieve peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As established in the common position adopted on 11-12 June 2001 by the European Union, the Commission remains committed to supporting initiatives contributing to a political solution to the Angolan conflict. It seeks to promote the strengthening of democratic institutions and the improvement of human rights, the rule of law and justice, and a more transparent management of public finances. The Commission encourages political dialogue within the terms of the Lusaka accords to overcome the conflict and expresses the hope that the recent declarations by President Dos Santos, inviting Mr Savimbi to set a date for his movement to end the war, will result in a dialogue for peace and national reconciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission expresses its grave concern at the lack of safe access for relief agencies to people in need. The Commission's strategy of assistance is delivery of a flexible package of emergency and rehabilitation assistance according to the changing requirements, as well as the creation of conditions which enable structural development actions to be undertaken. I should inform Parliament that the level of eco-interventions in 2001 is expected to rise to a similar level as in the year 2000, which is in fact EUR 52 million. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
