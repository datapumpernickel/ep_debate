<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bowis (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, today the world's gaze is very much on world trade. However, for millions that is a million miles from their broken, infected and disabled lives, because you can only trade if you can make, grow, sell and distribute. Those tasks are essential to your economic wellbeing and to your country's economic growth. They are tasks which are way beyond you if you are physically or mentally ill or disabled. If they are beyond you, you are in a downward spiral to poverty and, more often than not, to death. Health and wealth, ill-health and poverty are inextricably entwined. Poverty leads to ill-health and ill-health means poverty for nations, families and individuals. Without health you cannot create wealth and without wealth you cannot prevent and cure disease.</p>
<p class="contents">We, the countries of the European Union, have accepted the challenge to help the least- and the less-developed countries to overcome poverty and to become partners with us in world trade and development. We have acknowledged the fundamental link between good health and the reduction in poverty and we now need to enhance this priority in our development policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has sent us a good communication, which I welcome. It focuses on the three massive challenges of TB, AIDS and malaria and nothing in my report contradicts that focus. Indeed, I call for more and better investment in these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are other enormous health challenges we must also address. Let me start with the final point in our report. We, the developed world, are short of doctors. Each and every year we make up our domestic failure by recruiting 63 000 doctors from the developing countries. In return, we send them just 1 300. This is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Then let me re-emphasise the need for a shift in resources to basic health, if our rhetoric is to be translated into effective action. Just 3.4% of our current development budgets go to health. That is simply inadequate. Only 9 of the first 61 country strategy papers had health as a focal area for cooperation. That will not achieve results.</p>
<p class="contents">We need resources, but they must be efficiently targeted. Drugs, for example, are wasted if not accompanied by adequate storage, distribution, monitoring and patient education. Nigeria is an example where dramatic improvement was possible in fatal childhood diseases once the programme developed a home-to-home strategy and changed the public perception about immunisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are the diseases and disorders beyond the three priorities of TB, AIDS and malaria. By 2020, 80% of the global burden of disease will be non-communicable diseases: cardiovascular, cancer, respiratory, diabetes, depression, epilepsy, etc. Diarrhoea diseases kill 1.5 million children a year.</p>
<p class="contents">We heard in the last debate about water. Apart from malaria, water-borne diseases that debilitate and destroy include typhoid, dysentery, cholera, hepatitis, trachoma, fluorosis and Japanese encephalitis. Yet 1.1 billion people have no access to clean water and 2.4 billion are without hygienic sanitation. Yet the cost need not be prohibitive, and our report points to examples of inexpensive interventions and changes of local practice which can make a significant difference.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to colleagues from all parts of the House who suggested additions or amendments – most of which we were able to incorporate in committee – and a few which I have accepted and put my name on at this plenary stage. I would also like to thank the governments, academics, practitioners and NGOs – not least from the developing countries themselves – for their contributions. They confirmed many of the proposals I had drafted and suggested new areas for me to explore, such as vaccines, maternal health, biomass fuels and palliative care. I hope Parliament will endorse our report and that the Council and the Commission will see it as supportive as well as exhortative. None of us can be satisfied with our efforts to date to defeat poverty by promoting good health. We are all in development mode and our commitment must be to drive our policy forward and faster. It is in all our interests to make real and lasting progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While we give support to health directly in many countries, the Commission is increasingly investing in budget support strategies where the linkages to improved health outcomes are ensured.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context the follow-up through key input and outcome indicators is crucial and this is a high-priority area of work. This relates to a long discussion with Parliament and the Committee on Development and Cooperation about the percentages allocated to different sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is prioritising support for improved health and education outcomes. To reflect this, it is not enough simply to calculate funds for health and education where they appear as focal sectors. All support to related social sectors, such as investment in water and sanitation, and budget support linked to improved health and education outcomes, has to be taken into account. Doing this brings us to something that adds up to more than 40% of the programming for the 9th EDF.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a matter of the credibility of the link between budget support and outcomes in these sectors, but this is the best way we can do this. We are relying on other donors or partner governments to do more of the substantial work. We are providing a lot of money, but this is also what complementarity is about, what donor coordination is about and what ownership is about.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in no way apologetic about these percentages and I will never get tired of arguing like I do here whenever, like tonight, I hear figures – which I feel are wrong – regarding how much we do in these sectors. The Interreg contribution through budget support is real and it has the advantage that it also makes it possible for us to fund, and for support to be received for, the ongoing recurring costs.</p>
<p class="contents">It does not do much to help to build a nurses' training centre if the teaching there cannot be sustained. That is one of the advantages of budget support. This is in no way an excuse, but it is a real, hard-core explanation.</p>
<p class="contents">The specific challenges as regards HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis have been meaningful, leading to our contribution to the global fund. Our engagements at country level mean that we now know better what to do than we did some years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Attempts at solving the HIV/AIDS problem are made more difficult as it involves having to cope with the ideological battle of reproductive health and sexual rights. I do not want to start a discussion tonight on these issues, but it is an added problem on top of all the other existing problems.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards financing I am pleased that it was possible to get the United States to accept what everyone else agreed to in December last year in the WTO on TRIPs and the use of generic medicines. The point I want to make here is that it is very nice to see that our decision last year to untangle the procurement of medicine for these diseases adds to the reality and impact of what was agreed in the WTO last weekend. If we still tied procurement to European producers, the WTO agreement that Third World countries should be able to buy generic medicine would not have carried much real importance. So it is the combination of this deal in the WTO and our untying of procurement there that really is dynamic.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to prolong the discussion ahead. I will end by repeating my appreciation of the input provided by Mr Bowis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Illness and poverty are two sides of the same coin and therefore any strategy for combating poverty must take account of this interrelationship. Lack of health drastically reduces the opportunities for the peoples and groups suffering from it to develop. In developing countries, 28 000 children under five years old die every day as a result of illnesses which can be prevented with existing medicines. Diarrhoeal diseases alone kill more than a million and a half children per year and one in every 13 African women may die during pregnancy or childbirth, which also means that they can no longer care for the rest of their families, immediately increasing their risk of death.</p>
<p class="contents">AIDS, as well as killing more than 2 million people in Africa, is hindering the possibilities for development in a society by removing thousands of active young people and mothers who, in turn, leave behind orphans.</p>
<p class="contents">Women are the poorest and suffer most from illness in the developing countries. Furthermore, they are much more vulnerable to risks of illness, which is always linked to poverty, precisely as a result of their reproductive role. That is why we have wished to highlight the importance of information, but also of access to reproductive health services, which would help to prevent the spread of AIDS, illnesses caused by continual pregnancies, births and clandestine abortions.</p>
<p class="contents">Incorporating the views of women into the fight against poverty and illness is essential to the least-favoured societies since they are responsible for the care of children and because they are an indispensable factor in the well-being of individuals, families, local collectives and nations.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that, thanks to this report, whose rapporteur, Mr Bowis, has been so much in favour of incorporating the gender perspective into it, the Commission’s Communication has been improved. Perhaps the same can be said for the still weak position occupied by women in the development policy of the European Union, which I believe must continue to strive to fulfil its commitments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This House welcomes the Commission communication and urges the Commission and the Member States to make their contributions to achieving the Millennium Development Goal of halving by 2015 the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water, especially given that around three million people die every year from water-borne diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at the Commission’s ambitious goals, they deserve Parliament’s full and unequivocal support. The EU has undertaken to reach the development aid target of 0.39% of GDP on average for all EU Member States by 2006. At the International Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey in March 2002, it was agreed that each of the current EU Member States would by 2006 increase the proportion of GDP spent on development to at least 0.33%. Yet taking the Federal Republic of Germany as an example, we can see that unfortunately, this is likely to remain a utopian ideal. Germany vigorously rejected, to the very last, any increase in spending, claiming that this was incompatible with budget discipline. This shows that ultimately, the Federal Government’s economic policy failures are the cause of inadequate development assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Only yesterday, I saw that the German Minister of Development states on her website that 0.27% of GDP is currently allocated to development assistance. This must seem like pure mockery to the people affected, who followed what happened at the World Summit on Social Development in Copenhagen as long ago as 1995 and trusted the pledge that 0.7% of GDP would be spent on official development assistance. The only conclusion we can draw is that it is hard luck for anyone who relies on development pledges! It is a sign of political bankruptcy – indeed, it is a political debtor’s oath – that at the same time, real expenditure has decreased by more than 500 million euros from 1990 to 2001. Yet we live in an era when Volkswagen, for example, has to appoint three apprentices to every training place in the developing countries because two out of three die during training, either from Aids or from other – water-borne – diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in Monterrey, and I quote with your permission, Mr President, ‘If the industrialized countries do not double development assistance, the forces of envy, despair and terror will continue to grow’. Let me add to this: these forces will impact on Europe too. That, not least, must be avoided! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Poverty reduction must therefore be linked as a matter of urgency with measures to combat diseases, and great efforts are needed to build an effective healthcare system in the developing countries. In this context, we must focus first and foremost on the most vulnerable population groups, such as children, who die, as previous speakers have said, in their hundreds of thousands every year from diarrhoeal diseases. They die of infectious diseases because they are denied the vaccinations which could save them, and they fall victim to malaria – hundreds of thousands of children every year – because their immune systems are not robust enough to survive this disease.</p>
<p class="contents">These examples show that health problems in the developing countries, especially among children, certainly do not always result from life-threatening diseases. Often, they fall victim to illnesses capable of being cured or prevented if the necessary drugs or vaccinations are available. Women, too, are especially at risk. Giving birth to many children at short intervals destroys women’s reproductive health, causing severe anaemia and increasing their susceptibility to infectious diseases. Poor food or malnutrition also undermines the health of large sections of the population – for hunger is not just hunger, it also saps the strength necessary to build a good life.</p>
<p class="contents">It has quite rightly been pointed out, and I say this again, that sustainable development is under threat. It is true that a holistic strategy is required. It is not just primarily a matter of medical care. The scenario we are dealing with today – and this is where the campaign against tuberculosis, malaria, and AIDS comes into play – is that we are dealing with diseases – AIDS in particular – which are not curable but which can be treated, thus giving people the opportunity to live for longer. Nonetheless, the fact that there is no cure for it means that we must also address the issue of prevention. This is an extremely important area, and must also be included in a holistic healthcare system.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that we can generate more support for these campaigns in many ways if we highlight the severe economic impacts sustained by countries where a large number of people are affected by these diseases. According to the statistics which I have available, in Burkina Faso, agricultural production has decreased by 16% because people are sick or have already died of AIDS and therefore can no longer work in agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">In Swaziland, school attendance among girls has decreased by 36% because they have to care for their parents who are sick with AIDS. Ultimately, only the grandparents will be left. This means that massive economic damage will result in these countries unless there is an effective healthcare system to help restore public health to the necessary level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The same applied, incidentally, to my own report on the financing of clinical interventions to combat AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, which was adopted several months ago.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore give my unreserved support to the rapporteur and to the proposals he and the Committee on Development and Cooperation have put forward. We need to increase the level of financial contributions, particularly those earmarked for water. As several other Members have said, three million people die in the world every year for lack of drinking water. Major vaccination campaigns are needed. Preventive health measures need to be built up. Medicines need to be made accessible and methods of treatment need to be adapted for developing countries, not to mention palliative care, the provision of analgesics and the fight against trafficking in counterfeit medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">In March 2003, in the wake of the Sixth Framework Programme on Research and Technological Development, I persuaded the European Parliament to adopt a EUR 600 million research programme to combat AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis under Article 169, which also made a concrete contribution towards achieving the same objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">I am seizing the opportunity I have been given this evening to inform fellow Members about the implementation of this programme since its final adoption on 16 June. Commissioner Busquin has returned from Africa, where he was able to confirm interest on the part of researchers in the countries concerned following the establishment of appropriate management structures. Measurable progress has already been accomplished over several years, very often with the encouragement of this House, acting in close partnership with the European Commission. We also, and above all, need to be aware of the dramatic situation in the developing countries, which is an indication of everything that remains to be done and of the enormous effort that is required in terms of imagination, partnership and budget resources.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I would like to reiterate my support for the committee’s proposals, my total support for our rapporteur, my personal commitment in these areas, not to mention the commitment of my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, and I invite the Commission, and above all the Council, to step up Europe's commitment if we are to avoid a situation in which far from improving, the developing countries' position deteriorates in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have repeatedly asked for the scope of this action to be extended to other diseases particularly associated with poverty and with poor hygiene and environmental conditions. I therefore very warmly welcome John Bowis's report, which approaches health in the broadest possible way and takes account of the impact on health of food, environmental and educational policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Preventing diseases involves improving the living conditions of people in the South, by means of a coherent and integrated development strategy. In the long term a preventive strategy is essential. In the shorter term, we need to ensure that the sick have access to treatment and medicines, which also have to be made available in the first place. It is true that in the majority of countries in the South health systems are poor, but privatising the sector will not solve the problem. Only the public sector can provide free and universal health care. For that reason, health should continue to be excluded from GATS, and I am delighted that this report reiterates that fundamental principle.</p>
<p class="contents">I of course support the amendment calling for the provisions of the Doha Declaration on medicines to be implemented, especially as the agreement that the TRIPS Council has just reached is supposed to allow it to come into force. Although we welcome this entry into force, it also has to be recognised that the complexity of this agreement means that we have some doubts about its effectiveness. For example, countries without any production capacity will be subject to a double system of mandatory licences and restrictions that they could often find costly. If health really is one of the priorities of the European Union's development policy, then the Member States should make a firm commitment to grant the mandatory licences developing countries need if they are to protect their public health.</p>
<p class="contents">We Members of the European Parliament need to join together to exert continuing pressure if this communication is not to be just a dead letter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has taken all aspects of human health into consideration impartially.</p>
<p class="contents">It is opportune that we should be speaking about the health situation in the developing countries and access to clean water in the same sitting. You cannot just daydream about good health if people are denied their basic right to clean water. Clean water, functional sanitation and good hygiene are the foundations on which healthcare is built. Every year three million people die of infectious diseases transmitted through polluted water.</p>
<p class="contents">Health and poverty reduction is a subject where almost everything has already been said. There is no lack of information from us. I do not intend now, therefore, to churn out more tragic figures and statistics before Parliament. I would prefer to tell you briefly why I decided some time ago to stand for the European Parliament. When I was asked to stand I had serious doubts about the reasons, which I shall not go into here. However, while I was thinking over what my decision should be I was on a working trip to El Salvador and Mexico. I was working for a development cooperation organisation examining the tracks of the hurricane that had raged in the autumn of 1998 and familiarising myself with the situation regarding AIDS patients and conditions in the slums. I met a mother of small children who had been infected with HIV by her partner and now it had been detected in her newborn child too. I encountered a lot more examples of wretched human destiny: small people crushed by enormous problems. Then I began to think: what if the politicians who decide these people’s affairs and fate for them have never met them in the flesh? What, furthermore, if they do not understand the issues they are taking decisions about? Supposing they do not even see the people through the statistics? They are, after all, real people, not zombies. They have a pain threshold.</p>
<p class="contents">I made the decision to go into politics for these people’s sakes. Many a time I ask myself if my efforts are visible anywhere or sufficiently visible, and I cannot bring myself to answer the question. I think that if it does not result in any practical decision being made, or a gesture made for better things to come, or a hunger for justice, which has concrete results, I do not have the right to call myself a politician. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now 35% of the development budget goes on social expenditure, including education and health care.</p>
<p class="contents">For Africa one of the biggest threats is the AIDS epidemic. Along with tuberculosis and malaria this is a disease requiring extra attention in the Commission’s policy. In the present announcements this attention is very clearly in evidence in the action programme. Attention is focused on these three diseases. The arguments for the approach to these three diseases remain valid and have even become clearer still than previously where AIDS is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Public opinion however is not yet fully mobilised around a clear realisation of the worldwide crisis that these three diseases represent. There is still an urgent need for large-scale collective action.</p>
<p class="contents">In his report Mr Bowis rightly says that, in addition to these three diseases, the approach to other poverty-related diseases also warrants attention. African trypanosomiasis, better known by the name sleeping sickness, is a good example of this. There are two stages to this infectious disease. In the first stage the victim suffers fever and debilitation. The disease is difficult to recognise at this point, but relatively easy to treat. If the disease is not treated, then the parasite moves from the blood to the brain. It can take anything from a few weeks to years before the disease progresses from phase 1 to phase 2. In stage 2 the victim suffers fits and convulsions. Sleeping sickness is easy to recognise in the second phase, but treatment then is far more difficult. If the disease is not treated, the patient goes into a coma and inevitably dies. There is a general lack of such treatment in the developing countries. An unnecessarily large number of people die because the diagnosis cannot be made in time and medicines are not available or are far too expensive. The agreement on the cheap AIDS medicines that was concluded last Saturday as part of the WTO negotiations is a big step forward in combating this poverty-related disease.</p>
<p class="contents">To give priority to basic health care ahead of regulations in the field of intellectual property was a crucial decision. Failure would have destroyed confidence in the ability of the WTO to have a development round to tackle the injustices in the world trade system. All the WTO members now have an obligation to ensure that the agreements work in practice. European countries must promise, just as Canada has already done, that producers of generic medicines obtain licences from the country in question for export to developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important in the WTO negotiations that, where the trade in services or GATTS is concerned, the right of every WTO member to regulate public services should be guaranteed and that developing countries must not be compelled to hand government control of basic services such as health care over to the market. I would like to say expressly that, in this, I feel supported by the attitude of the Commission and Commissioner Lamy. In this our positions do not differ.</p>
<p class="contents">If you were to ask a random passer-by in Strasbourg how his health was, then that will always count as number one. If we later go to South Africa, I should like to see a similar random passer-by whom we meet there able to say the same, and for us to be able to live safely in the same world village, on the same street. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
