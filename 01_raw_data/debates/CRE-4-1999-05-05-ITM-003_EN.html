<p class="contents">‐ the oral questions to the Council (B4‐0334/99) and the Commission (B4‐0335/99) by Mr De Giovanni, on behalf of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, on the forthcoming institutional reform.</p><p class="contents"><a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Verheugen, </span>  <span class="italic">Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too want to begin by thanking you, Mr President, on behalf of the Council. It is, of course, a little difficult for the Council to thank the President of Parliament; for if it praises him too much, that is supposed to mean it has done something wrong, which is why I would like to say that you are the Council"s partner, an uncomfortable partner, conciliating on real issues but quite unyielding when it comes to representing Parliament"s rights. But we have cooperated well and successfully, for which I give you very warm thanks. Let me also say quite specifically on behalf of the Council that this Parliament took a qualitative leap forward during this term of office. That is thanks to you, Mr President, and to your predecessor, my friend and political companion Klaus Hänsch.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, it is not just that Parliament has acquired more rights and is asserting them. More importantly, it has become much more firmly anchored in European public opinion than any previous European Parliament, and that is the crucial difference. This Parliament is seen as a genuine parliament, and from the Council"s point of view I can only say that it is taken seriously as such, indeed more and more so. Mr President, I wish you all the best, both personally and politically.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to the matter in hand. The phase of European development ahead of us is determined by the fact that once again we have to set a number of important signals. In Berlin we wanted to secure the financial bases of the Union up to the year 2006 with Agenda 2000, with particular reference to the tasks relating to enlargement. Here I want to give particular thanks to Parliament for its constructive approach to this question over the past weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">After Berlin sought to protect the Union"s financial ability to act, the Cologne summit will now endeavour also to protect and strengthen its political ability to act in the long term. The Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force a few days ago, a historic breakthrough. The Treaty provides the European Union with a wider range of instruments but at the same time raises new questions to which we shall have to find answers in Cologne. However, our activities are overshadowed by an issue that dominates all others, the conflict in Kosovo and the accompanying human tragedies. That was debated here in depth yesterday afternoon, so I need not go into it again in detail. I just want to establish again that against the background of developments in the Balkans, over the past weeks the European Union has demonstrated its unity and resolve, from the joint declaration by the Heads of State and Government of 24 March to the General Affairs Council"s decision last week to toughen the sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council continues to maintain that on the threshold of the 21st century Europe cannot allow the numerically largest ethnic group in Kosovo to be collectively deprived of its rights and subjected to severe, systematic human rights violations. We must ensure that hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced persons can return to their homes. No ruler should be able to claim that persecution and murder are a matter of internal policy. That is the lesson of the 20th century. We must also repeat that for us this Kosovo conflict is not just a matter of humanitarian objectives and humanitarian questions. It is also a matter of the general European perspective of our policy of integration and of the long‐term security and stability of Europe as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">If Milosevic achieves his aim of a Kosovo no longer inhabited by Albanians, that will create a source of crisis in a region that is in any case not very stable and could lead to numerous new conflicts. The aim of stabilising south‐eastern Europe will become remote and there will be no prospect at all of integrating that part of Europe. Europe would remain incomplete. That is why it was so important to look beyond the military objective and set out a political plan for pacifying the entire region.</p>
<p class="contents">The German Presidency of the Council took the initiative and made the necessary proposals. The Heads of State and Government supported the German proposals at their meeting on 14 April in Brussels. Last week the Council decided to begin preparing a stability pact for south‐eastern Europe, an initiative that the entire international community now firmly welcomes. Together with the international organisations and the neighbouring states concerned, we will hold the first working meeting on 27 May and will hold the first conference of foreign ministers on 11 June.</p>
<p class="contents">It is against this backdrop that the European Council will be meeting in Cologne on 3 and 4 June. While the Council will have to take a serious look at current developments in Kosovo, it must not ignore the other central issues relating to its political ability to act.</p>
<p class="contents">Cologne will look at the following major issues: firstly, the European Employment Pact; secondly, the timetable for the forthcoming institutional reform; thirdly, the European charter of basic rights; fourthly, the common strategy towards Russia; and fifthly, the further development of the European security and defence policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say a few words on these points. Unemployment is the most urgent social problem of the present time. Thanks to the Employment Pact, which we hope to adopt in Cologne, we want to give the people of Europe a sign that the European Union is looking at their concerns. The pact is to become the expression of an active labour market policy that seeks more than before to avoid unemployment, in other words that looks above all at reducing youth and long‐term unemployment and at ending the discrimination against women on the labour market. We want to interlink the national and European level measures to promote employment more closely and link them to a coordinated monetary, financial and wages policy as also to economic structural changes.</p>
<p class="contents">A working paper submitted by the German Presidency was discussed for the first time and positively received at the informal ECOFIN Council in Dresden in mid‐April. The idea of also involving the social partners and the European Central Bank in the future dialogue on fiscal, wages and monetary policy found strong support.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important item on the Cologne agenda will be institutional reforms. In accordance with the request of the Vienna European Council, it will have to be decided in Cologne how and when to tackle the institutional questions not resolved by the Amsterdam Treaty and that have to be resolved prior to enlargement. The Presidency of the Council will shortly be submitting concrete proposals on the subject with a view to Cologne. At present we are still at the stage of intensive consultations with the Member States. Insofar as Treaty changes are required to resolve these questions, they will have to be agreed in the framework of a conference of Member State government representatives. Pursuant to the provisions of the Treaty, a formal hearing of the European Parliament will also be necessary before such a conference is convened.</p>
<p class="contents">But initially Cologne will be concerned only with the further procedural steps, with laying down the procedures, the timetable and the agenda for the intergovernmental conference. The Amsterdam protocol on the institutions with a view to enlargement of the European Union, together with the declarations on the subject, provide the framework for the intergovernmental conference, but we might indeed have to go further. The developments early this year that led to the resignation of the Commission and to a discussion about reforms certainly give reason to examine the relations between the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission in this regard. I think it is most important to build on the democratic control that the House has exercised so effectively here. We must fully restore confidence in the institutions; we must not have a repeat of the institutional crisis we have just gone through.</p>
<p class="contents">In the view of the presidency, it is essential to further strengthen the European Parliament. The more able the European Union becomes to act, the more its actions and decisions must have democratic legitimacy. That also means, for instance, that in all cases where the Council adopts legislative acts by majority vote – and we want to make majority decisions the rule – the European Parliament must have equal codecision powers on an equal footing.</p>
<p class="contents">The careful preparation of the intergovernmental conference will be vital to its successful conclusion. Here we will be able to draw on the comprehensive preliminary work that was carried out during the intergovernmental conference on the Amsterdam Treaty. Given this time‐frame, the intergovernmental conference could be convened as early as the beginning of next year and brought to a conclusion in the course of the year 2000. That is an ambitious aim, but I believe that a short and clearly circumscribed intergovernmental conference could send out an important signal about the European Union"s ability to enlarge and about the effectiveness of its institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Irrespective of whether the institutional questions left over from Amsterdam are resolved, we will have to look in the medium or long term at the question of the constitution of Europe. The German Foreign Minister, Mr Fischler, pointed out here in Parliament that following Maastricht and Amsterdam the question of a European constitution is now more serious than it once was. We know that the Amsterdam Treaty only entered into force a few days ago and we must begin by gathering experience from it, because even now the comprehensive debate on the future development and form of the European Union is showing more and more clearly that in addition to the European Parliament the national parliaments and the broadest possible spectrum of social groups must also be involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The German proposal to draw up a European charter of basic rights also belongs in this context. Our initial aim for Cologne is to be asked to draw up a charter of this kind. At the given moment we will have to consider whether and how this kind of European charter of basic rights can take precedence over the European treaties. We need to tell the people of Europe that their basic rights apply in the same way at European level as at national level. The first talks on this charter of basic rights have now begun and I am sure that we will manage to agree on the further procedure in Cologne.</p>
<p class="contents">Formulating this kind of charter of basic rights would be a typical task for Members of Parliament – they are best able to do so and it is what they must do – and we will certainly take account of that aspect in our proposal concerning the practical form that charter of basic rights should assume.</p>
<p class="contents">The Amsterdam Treaty has markedly enhanced the Union"s ability to act in foreign policy. Even if the Union is already demonstrating great solidarity now – as in the Kosovo crisis ‐we still need to develop the common foreign and security policy further. If ever there was a need for a common European foreign and security policy, then it must be now, and it is time for all doubting Thomases to hold their tongue. We need it; Europe can no longer accept the fact that it has become an economic world power and yet does not even have the political power to resolve its regional problems.</p>
<p class="contents">One way of achieving this is through the CFSP High Representative to be appointed in Cologne, as provided by the Amsterdam Treaty. Another is the common strategy towards Russia that we want to adopt for the first time in Cologne and which we will be able to implement on the basis of majority decisions. This common strategy towards Russia is a pilot project; it will very much determine the face of future common strategies. Work has already begun on further common strategies, but they will not yet be ready for decision‐taking by the time of Cologne.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need a European security and defence policy if we are to implement a common foreign and security policy. Here it is clear that collective defence in Europe will remain the task of NATO; but the European Union must also develop its own military crisis‐management capability for cases where the European Union or WEU believes there is a need for action but in which our North American partners do not wish to or cannot be involved. Tony Blair"s initiative in Pörtschach and the Franco‐British meeting in St Malo gave fresh impetus to this question.</p>
<p class="contents">After the creation of the single market and economic and monetary union, the formulation of a European security and defence identity has now become central to the European integration process. Without it that process would remain incomplete. During our dual presidency of the EU and WEU, we are resolutely endeavouring to make use of this new dynamic. We intend to draw up a report on means of further developing the European security and defence identity by the time of the Cologne European Council. That report will form the basis of a new European Council decision in Cologne that concretely defines the further procedure in this important policy area. Among others it will cover the question of possibly integrating the WEU in the EU, pursuant to Article 17 of the Amsterdam Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, even without the additional challenges facing the Union as a result of the crisis in Kosovo and the resignation of the Commission, there is a wide range of tasks to be dealt with in Cologne. As you know, however, situations of crisis can also release forces and produce their own dynamism; the German Presidency remains confident that it can match up to its responsibility to develop the European Union into a pan‐European and at the same time global community that has the ability to act. It hopes that here it can continue to count on the support of the European Parliament. Thank you for your attention.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Santer, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. – (FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Cologne European Council comes at a decisive moment for the European Union. The entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty on 1 May marks a further step forward. A newly elected Parliament will take up office in a few weeks" time. There is also to be a new Commission. Later this morning you will be voting on the appointment of the future President, Romano Prodi. The new President will need the support of the European Parliament to make a success of his term of office. All these factors need to be capitalised on to give European integration a fresh boost. Lessons need to be drawn from the past with a view to preparing for the future. Now is the time to prepare the ground for the institutional changes ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">Before discussing this and replying to Mr De Giovanni, I would first like to briefly run through the other issues due to come up for discussion at the Cologne European Council in a month's time.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Kosovo will of course be discussed. The European Union will obviously be called upon to play a major role here. First, there will be the reconstruction phase where the Commission will have a coordinating role alongside the World Bank, for which it will need adequate support and resources. The Union will then have to devote itself to defining a genuine strategy for stability in the Balkans, and Cologne will be an important step along the way.</p>
<p class="contents">Cologne is also where the first common strategy under the Amsterdam Treaty is due to be adopted. As you are aware, this common strategy concerns Russia. This is no easy task, if only because the Council and the Commission do not, in the end, have all that much time available, but we are making good progress. This is all the more significant in the context of the Kosovo crisis. It is more important than ever to maintain and develop constructive and close political, economic and commercial dialogue with Russia. The Kosovo crisis is also a stark reminder of the need for a proper European defence identity. Following the progress made at the Atlantic Alliance summit in Washington, the European Union will need to adopt a solid stance.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the economy, the prospects for growth in 1999 are not looking quite so good. But there are some positive signs. Consumer confidence, which has remained high, is gradually taking a hold on businesses, whilst the drop in the European Central Bank's key interest rates is also grounds for optimism. It is nonetheless clear that alongside the requisite budget consolidation, Europe will also need to speed up the structural reforms of the employment, goods, services and capital markets. It was with this in mind that the Commission recently adopted its recommendation on the broad economic policy guidelines. This comprises specific country‐by‐country recommendations, including economic reform issues. I hope these recommendations will be discussed openly and thoroughly this year. The coordination of economic policies should not just be left on the drawing board.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will also be reporting on the development of the trans‐European networks and hopes that the European Investment Bank will make its contribution, as it did at the Amsterdam European Council in 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the European Council will discuss a report by the Ministers of Finance on the structure of international finance. The crises in Asia and Russia highlighted the need for reforms in this area. Progress was made during the discussions at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Washington just over a week ago. However, I would have liked to have seen Europe genuinely speaking with a single voice.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us consider, for example, debt relief for the poorest nations: why should each of the European G7 countries have to come up with its own relief plan? Why should we leave it to our partners, in particular the Americans, to organise the Community"s external representation for the euro, rather than acting on the decision taken at the Vienna European Council?</p>
<p class="contents">Cologne is set to be interesting from the employment point of view. The Luxembourg process has taken root and is starting to produce results in terms of national employment policies that are more systematic, integrated and far‐reaching. At the instigation of the German Presidency, we will be taking a further step towards the European Employment Pact which I called for back in January 1996. To help the discussions, the Commission will be sending the European Council a communication on the best way of integrating the objective of higher employment into the formulation and implementation of Community policies and measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Cologne will also see the forthcoming institutional reform begin to take shape. It is not, of course, for me to speculate what submissions Romano Prodi and the new Commission will want to make to prepare the ground for institutional reform, or what they will wish the reform to involve. I would, however, remind you that even when it was putting Agenda 2000 together, the Commission called for the questions first raised at Amsterdam to be settled and said that a more far‐reaching reform should follow.</p>
<p class="contents">Any delay in strengthening the institutions and the way they operate can only jeopardise the actual enlargement of the Union. The new reform must prepare the institutions for enlargement. But it must also supply solutions to certain problems in the working of the institutions which have come to light in the last few months. So the institutions need overhauling, that much is certain. But the overhaul must focus on the priorities, rather than just drawing up shopping lists, knowing, as we do, that we must not project the alarming image of Europe as a building site which is never completed. There is no doubt that the job needs to be done in stages; but we certainly cannot have a state of never‐ending construction work.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that there is no point in dreaming up new reforms if the political will to implement what already exists is lacking. We must build on what we have already achieved. I am thinking, for instance, of the justice and home affairs section of the Treaty of Amsterdam. And I would call on the public and the institutions to take a close look at how intentions are converted into procedures and working methods.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking beyond the institutional reforms which must be put in place, I would like to plead for a consistent approach. We cannot call for new European programmes, condemn the use of technical assistance offices and refuse to provide more human resources all at the same time. We cannot make high‐sounding declarations about the principle of subsidiarity on the one hand, and constantly demand fresh initiatives from the Commission on the other. We cannot expect the Commission to act as a strong political driving force and at the same time give the impression of wanting to turn it into a mere secretariat for the Council or the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from certain quarters) </span></p>
<p class="contents">Some issues have already been identified: weighting the votes in the Council and reducing the number of Members of the Commission. But we will have to go further than that if we are to carry out a thorough reform of the Treaty provisions that govern the composition of the institutions and the way they work. Whatever happens, such a reform must include bringing in qualified majority voting as standard practice, as the President‐in‐Office just mentioned. Thought also needs to be given to extending the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Should we go further? Certainly. For example, the thorny matter of collective responsibility and the individual accountability of Commissioners needs to be addressed. The principle that policy decisions are taken collectively is, it seems to me, as vital now as it ever was, for the very legitimacy of the Commission and the European institutional system. But that should not lead to a failure of individual accountability in certain situations where decisions are not and cannot be taken collectively. This contradiction – which is only apparent – will be resolved by the judicious exercise of the new powers enjoyed by the President of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cologne European Council will therefore have to take stands on some major issues. Be it employment, Kosovo, enlargement or the working of the institutions, the European Union must learn to speak with one voice: one voice for the 15 Member States and one voice for the institutions, too. This does not mean that they must always follow the same line. It means that they must work together, that a constructive approach must be taken to enhancing and strengthening the Europe of the future in the eyes of our fellow citizens and to giving it the place it deserves in the international arena.</p>

I sincerely want to pay tribute to him for that, and now I will go straight on to the issue of institutional reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Institutional reform is on the table again and that is greatly to the credit of the German Presidency, I have to say, right from the President‐in‐Office"s speech to Parliament in January.</p>
<p class="contents">Two fundamental issues have been raised: the need to hold an intergovernmental conference very early in the year 2000, with a method and timetable to be discussed, and the issue of the constitution, which Mr Verheugen has taken up, as I was delighted to discover this morning. Why do I consider it important, indeed essential, for institutional negotiations to reopen? Because there is a need for more Europe, there is a need for Europe to have a role in the world. The historical and political context demonstrates that, and without reformed institutions and a strong political will the need for Europe cannot actually be met. And then, as the President‐in‐Office said this morning, the institutional balances are out of kilter and need to be redefined. The Council did well to appoint Romano Prodi as President so quickly, but we all know – and now President Santer has said so – there is still the problem of defining a stronger political role for the Commission. In short, there are institutional balances to be restored.</p>
<p class="contents">The agenda for the intergovernmental conference must certainly cover ‘the Amsterdam triangle" as it is called in Community jargon. It must certainly include qualified majority voting, which is not in fact a technical issue, as we all know, but a highly political issue calling into question the sovereignty of the nation states. And the agenda must certainly touch on the composition of the Commission and the way the votes are weighted. We know all that. But we need something else as well, because, as people have highlighted, the background to the intergovernmental conference in 2000 will be complex and difficult, so foreign policy and, above all, the area of freedom, security and justice are issues which must be raised again.</p>
<p class="contents">In our resolution we raise the problem of the method. We do not introduce fundamental points like Article N, naturally, but we say that changes need to be made at the preparatory stage, because the intergovernmental method has proved inadequate, which is why we need to prepare differently if the intergovernmental conference is to be a success. We are pressing, as we did before in the November 1997 Méndez de Vigo and Tsatsos resolution, for a Commission document to underpin interinstitutional coordination involving civil society and national and regional parliaments. To put it as briefly as I can, what we need is a highly authoritative document on the intergovernmental conference table, because preparing for the intergovernmental conference in a different way may guarantee safer results in terms of reform. That is the point! We do not include Article N in the discussion, we do not discuss the need for final unanimity, but we do say we must prepare for this conference in a different way. Why? Because Europe demands it, because Europe needs strong institutions!</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make one final reference to the issue of the constitution. I am, I repeat, delighted that the President‐in‐Office returned to this subject this morning. We know the problem today is not to write a constitution, as we have done in the past and as we have demonstrated that we are capable of doing. We know there are two problems today. First, there is the need to simplify the principles in the Treaty to present clear rules, principles and values to the public, so that they know what we mean when we talk about Europe and Europe"s constitution. Secondly, there is the area of freedom, security and justice, where flesh and blood people live and move. Those people need legal and jurisdictional guarantees. That is why we talk about including fundamental rights in the Treaty – Mr Verheugen reminded us of that again this morning – and I believe we can build a political Europe and a people"s Europe at the same time on that basis because the two either move forward together or do not move forward at all.</p>

In this case, because of the personal relationship I have had with the President for a long time, I would also like to congratulate him on having carried out his work so successfully.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wanted to take this opportunity to say goodbye to Mr Santer as President of the Commission, as I believe that this is the last debate he is going to attend. I would congratulate him, too, on his work while in office.</p>
<p class="contents">The German Presidency has done a great deal of work since it took over. Contrary to expectations it managed to conclude the Agenda 2000 package, which seemed extremely difficult, and now it has just informed us about the fairly ambitious programme for the Cologne European Council, on which I must congratulate it. In his speech, the President of the Commission set out five very clear points that represent genuine requirements of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The first requirement is the European Employment Pact. The German Presidency is right to give priority to this proposal as, in spite of other issues, there is no doubt that the main everyday problem for Europeans is employment. The only question mark is whether or not the European Union will have sufficient resources in the years ahead to implement an employment policy of its own given that the financial perspective for the 2000‐2006 period has been reduced and practically all Community policies have had to face cutbacks.</p>
<p class="contents">We are naturally very pleased with the specific reference to an intergovernmental conference in the year 2000, which my colleague Mr De Giovanni has already mentioned. The question of institutional reform was clearly left unresolved at Amsterdam. If it is not resolved, enlargement will be impossible. Allowing all the countries applying for membership of the Union to join under the present conditions would require significant changes to the structure of the EU. This intergovernmental conference will face a difficult task, but I would still like to thank the German Presidency for having addressed the issue so clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the European Union"s Achilles" heel is still the common foreign and security policy, and the German Presidency has stressed the need to develop Article 17 of the Treaty of Amsterdam. The first step towards creating a European defence identity – which is proving essential – is to incorporate the Western European Union into the EU system. Another important element is the appointment of a prominent figure to be responsible for implementing this policy, in other words the CFSP High Representative. We must point out that, from Parliament"s point of view, it would have been better to leave this in the hands of the Commission, rather than trying to turn the Commission into a form of secretariat for the Council, as President Santer mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to end by congratulating the German Presidency – and Mr Verheugen in particular – on the excellent work that has been done since the beginning of the year.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Brok </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, we have been given an introduction here to the difficult questions facing the Cologne summit, which have to be resolved in our common interest. I am particularly grateful for the fact that so much emphasis has been put on the concept of the common foreign, security and defence policy, for Kosovo shows us how necessary it is that we achieve results in terms both of prevention and of the EU"s ability to act. If the German Presidency intends to make appropriate use of its dual presidency of the European Union and of the WEU, that is to be welcomed. But it is also important to use the potential offered by the Treaty of Amsterdam in regard to implementing the common foreign and security policy for the genuine good of the Community and not to continue following the old methods.</p>
<p class="contents">Belatedly, although not too late, Russia is also being brought into the process again. A common Russia strategy, which would establish a balance on this continent and help bring about solutions, is welcome. But here we must not forget that in view of the many disputes we are currently facing in, for example, the field of trade, we should also improve relations with the United States. Mr Verheugen, I would therefore cordially request you to ensure that the US‐EU summit in Bonn on 19 June is also used to strengthen the partnership and cooperation between the USA and Europe, to improve its shape and also to involve the parliaments in the appropriate way.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the problems of unemployment, the Employment Pact is a most important subject. However, we will be looking very carefully at the outcome of the summit and examine the distribution of tasks in terms of the role of the national states in employment policy and the European role, so as to avoid giving the mistaken impression that Europe is responsible in the wrong area. We will also make sure we do not have a repeat at European level of the Lafontaine policy mix between monetary, financial and wage policy. I do not know what you meant by saying the European Central Bank should be involved here like the social partners and I hope I misunderstood you. The European Central Bank must play an entirely independent role and cannot be a component of a strategy put together by the governments.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make a final remark. Mr Méndez de Vigo will have more to say about this. The institutional reform must be achieved in cooperation with the European Parliament, which must certainly have a better role to play at the intergovernmental conference than it did in Amsterdam, where it remained rather on the sidelines. I hope the German Presidency of the Council will manage to ensure that. We must make the European Union capable of enlargement by extending majority decision‐making. If in a second stage constitutional and other such questions are discussed, then it must be made clear that this will not delay the enlargement timetable. But we should keep these questions on the agenda and I can only congratulate you on the idea that we should formulate a strategy for drawing up a charter of basic rights. If that could be achieved in cooperation with the European Parliament and the national parliaments, it would do a great deal for the people and for the identity of the European Union.</p>

<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Spaak </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span><span class="italic"> – (FR)</span> Madam President, Mr President‐in‐Office, Mr President of the Commission, during the 1998 congress in The Hague, the European Movement expressed its regret that the Union now seems condemned to progress in a vast conceptual vacuum and appears to lack any political perspective at a time when it is setting off on the two greatest adventures of its history: the launch of the single currency and enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1998, another major challenge has appeared: the war in Kosovo. We must oppose all attacks on people"s rights at the borders of Europe. But I must remind you that it is not the European idea that is at issue here. In his speech yesterday morning, Mr Prodi explained to us the fundamental values on which that is based. What is at issue, and what should be looked at seriously by the Cologne Council, is the fact that the political leaders of certain Member States have, for far too long now, tended to hang on to the outdated remains of their national sovereignty, particularly in terms of foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The tragedy in Kosovo, which has been on the cards for almost ten years, is a terrible illustration of this. As a result, the European Parliament"s compromise text stresses the importance of appointing the High Representative for the CFSP in Cologne. It also stresses that this High Representative must be supported by the policy planning and early warning unit and must also have the ability, through his or her personality, to play an important role.</p>
<p class="contents">The Liberal Group is particularly pleased that emphasis has been placed on the urgent need to strengthen institutional relations with the Western European Union, which should eventually have its own defence and prevention force.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to congratulate the chairman, Mr De Giovanni, on the text of his resolution, which, I am convinced, will serve as a reference point for the next Parliament. I must say that it was a great privilege to work with him.</p>
<p class="contents">To my mind, there are two key issues that should be considered in Cologne. The first of these is the timetable. The timetable approved by the Committee on Institutional Affairs puts emphasis on the conclusion of the work of the next IGC before the first enlargement. Only a requirement such as this will allow the applicant countries to embark on a political project, in full knowledge of the facts, where the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> cannot be called into question.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is the method. The method used to prepare the ground for the Treaty of Amsterdam proved to have various weaknesses. We will therefore have to change our method. In other words, we will have to give the Commission the role it deserves, that of the driving force behind the next reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi"s ambition in relation to the political authority he plans to exercise, along with his colleagues and the European Parliament, augurs well for the future; he is a committed European and we wish him every success. We would also like to thank Mr Santer for the work he has done during his time in office.</p>

I must take this opportunity to congratulate and thank him for his impartiality, conscientiousness and fairmindedness both in general and also as chairman of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, in which I have participated in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to highlight a few of the most important aspects of this motion and the corresponding discussions. These relate to the idea which has prevailed and which still prevails of a European constitution, the establishment of or the desire to establish a specific constituent authority at Community level and a certain and perhaps corrective interpretation of the former Article N of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I have read, listened and reflected. I always taught my pupils that the law and politics must respond to the concerns of the people. At this point in time, it is apparent to me that the people of the European Union are concerned about war, misery, social exclusion, unemployment, drug trafficking and crime in general. As far as I have heard, they are not calling for a European constitution, unless they believe that a European constitution will solve everyone"s problems. However, I do not share this belief. For me, a European constitution enshrining rights and duties which are not in themselves feasible and cannot be complied with is of little help with the problems currently on the minds of the people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have my doubts about the European specific constituent authority. I too believe that the constituent authority comes from the people but I also believe and would argue at the moment that we do not have a European people. This does not mean, however, that this will not develop in the future and perhaps this should develop. Our borders are therefore not currently defined. So I consider, or I at least share the belief, that institutional reforms must be implemented. However, these must not assume the form of a constant building site. In particular, they must take account of the people, respond to their concerns and always include them. To conclude, if the people are not included, the building may collapse at any moment. And what I do not want to see, because I am a firm believer in Europe, is Europe collapsing due to any of these pitfalls.</p>

To govern is to make choices, and there are various choices available. My group feels that, given the choices set out in, for instance, the manifesto of the British and Spanish Prime Ministers, Tony Blair and José María Aznar, advocating further deregulation and greater flexibility, we would opt instead for a Franco‐Italian proposal, based on relaunching active employment policies and public investment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cologne European Council must be more than just a combination of good intentions, a catalogue of unconnected actions or the sum of the national employment policies. The public would not accept this, nor would it be credible.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the institutional timetable is concerned, we fully agree that institutional reform is now vital and that we must define the stages leading up to an intergovernmental conference. We can also tell the Council that Parliament has worked for many years to establish a genuine inventory of fundamental rights. We are in the best position to help.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the war in Yugoslavia, in the Balkans, and particularly in Kosovo, we must state loudly and clearly that we totally condemn the activities of the Milosevic regime in Kosovo and that it is time to consider a political solution. In Yugoslavia or in Serbia, there are a million innocent people, a million good people who can help us stop the bombing, the widespread destruction of infrastructure and the collateral damage, and help us find a political solution in the wake of the punishment meted out not only to the Milosevic regime, but also to the population in general. The German Presidency should be particularly sensitive to this. I would never blame the German people for the sins of the regime it had to suffer under Hitler"s dictatorship, and I feel that the same should apply in Yugoslavia. In this way, I hope that we can overcome the problems we face and come to an agreement on achieving peace for Europe.</p>

And I really must say at this solemn moment that there is great cause for concern here. Every person of sense now knows that the neo‐liberal counter‐reform has failed. And yet we go on here as though nothing had happened and at best we keep setting up new corporative consultation mechanisms. That is a good thing, but it is not the change of course that we need and without that change of course we will not satisfy the expectations of the peoples of Europe, who after all have been voting out the representatives of the neo‐liberal counter‐reform since 1995/96. Why do we not have the courage, the strength and the imagination to bring about this change of course? In this context, as a member of the Greens I particularly regret the resignation of my old friend Oskar Lafontaine.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of seeing a clear change of course in European policy in year one of the euro and a move towards a new type of economic development that can also resolve the problem of mass unemployment, we are given a European employment pact that falls far short of what the Santer initiative once contained, that falls far short of what the original proposals that came from the presidency"s German Ministry of Finance contained. It is not a question of whether the bottle is half full or half empty; it is a question of whether there will be a bottle at all or whether all that is fashioned in Cologne is a paper bottle that cannot be filled with anything. This is a fight we will now have to engage in, to ensure that we have a bottle that we can then fill. So I ask colleagues for their solidarity and openly welcome the European marches against mass unemployment which will bring these demands into the open again in Cologne; I hope that will help jolt the summit into action.</p>

<p class="contents">From that perspective, it is unfortunate – and I am continuing to stress this point – that it is still being held on the dates it was originally planned for. If we had not had the crisis that shook the Commission, we would have found ourselves in a situation where, in spite of Parliament"s requests, the European Council would have taken all the decisions without giving any consideration to the views of the voters who will be going to the polls between 10 and 13 June.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two requests to put to the Council. In relation to our foreign policy and our policy towards the United Nations, the European Union must make progress and speak out on two key issues: the ratification of the Statute of the permanent Criminal Court and the moratorium on capital executions, which was requested through a vote by the United Nations Commission in Geneva.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Union and the presidency were to highlight these two issues in the European Council to indicate the path to be followed and the choice to be made by the Union in the months ahead, we would be making a firm commitment in two areas which, in my view, will be critical as the third millennium approaches.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as institutional reform is concerned, I must thank Biagio De Giovanni, the chairman of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, for his proposals. These are to be taken into account during the next parliamentary term and by the current and future presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European Radical Alliance added an amendment which I hope will be voted through so as to add an official and formal note to the European Parliament"s right to ratify any proposal for reform. I hope that this amendment will be accepted during the vote, which is to be held shortly.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Berthu </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span><span class="italic"> – (FR)</span> Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President‐in‐Office, the European Union is currently facing an institutional crisis following the collective resignation of the Commission. Yet the lesson the Council seems to want to draw from all this is that we should actually move towards more federalism, more of a superstate and more power for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Heads of State and Government have already sought to appoint a more political President of the Commission, who will be responsible for exploiting all the federalist opportunities provided by the Treaty of Amsterdam. The President‐designate, Mr Romano Prodi, seems to have decided, in fact, to make this a very political role. In his speech yesterday, he spoke of his political responsibility, of the Commissioners" ability to provide political direction, of his role of political guidance and of the need for him to take an important political initiative. In short, the nominated President of the Commission is already tending to take the position of a head of state, with an extra dose of ultra‐liberal and free trade attitudes that should worry even the traditional Liberals.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament will naturally encourage this development of government, initially through the resolution it is undoubtedly about to adopt, which hopes to make the Commission the driving force behind institutional reforms. However, before taking any decisions, it would be wiser to wait for the second report by the Committee of Experts, which will no doubt give us an interesting insight into the workings of the institutions. The European Parliament has cautiously postponed the publication of this report until after the European elections.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations feels that the real lesson to be learned from all this is that we should restore the primacy of national democracies with a view to bringing Europe closer to the people. In this respect, the draft Statute for Members of the European Parliament – which the Council has just approved – sends out a signal in the wrong direction. In our view, it is totally unacceptable for the Members of this House to be paid out of the Community budget rather than by their own countries. An elected representative must be paid by those he represents and no one else. Otherwise, we would be institutionalising a dangerous mechanism against the people; it would represent – if I may say so, Madam President – an insidious <span class="italic">coup d"état</span> .</p>

<p class="contents">The European Council in Cologne must remedy these omissions and do the groundwork for the reform of the Commission, the extension of qualified majority voting and the reweighting of the votes within the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We are against any solution which reduces the powers of the Commission. It must retain its independence and its power to make proposals. These are both indispensable conditions for the fulfilment of its autonomous functions, in the general interest of the European Union. The exercise of these prerogatives prevents the Commission from becoming a sort of Council secretariat and hence dwindling to a level inappropriate to the political role it ought to play. It would also be improper and inappropriate for that role to dwindle into a bureaucratic one, without taking account of the need to extend the principle of subsidiarity whenever the opportunity arises. But even if all these concerns were addressed in preparation for the summit of Heads of State and Government, that would not represent an adequate response to the gravity of the Kosovo crisis and would not make up for the notable absence of Europe from that particular trouble spot in the current affairs of the continent.</p>
<p class="contents">If it wants to be equal to the role it ought to be playing, Europe has got to make up its mind finally to endow itself with a means of determining its own common foreign and security policy. A signal along those lines must go out from Cologne. A decision must be taken to make a start on political union. Our determination to take that route must be made clear, and it must be made clear that the European Union is going to be an active player in international relations and in dealing with crises, because it intends to equip itself with all the instruments it needs to guarantee its sovereignty and autonomy.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a new Treaty now and, more importantly, we need to give the starting signal and define the exact ground to be covered, and these signals must come from Cologne, especially as, with the unfortunate experience of Kosovo, public opinion is proving more sensitive than before to the role Europe can play.</p>
<p class="contents">Another unresolved issue, which affects the Union"s ability to take action, is the lack of a common economic policy. The single market is prey to tensions and repercussions. A strong employment policy linked to development requires a coherent economic policy. There must be a definite signal marking the start of an irreversible stage which will lead to the solution the Union needs to operate effectively. The real economy of our countries needs new impetus to expand. That impetus will not come from stock exchange indicators. At worst, they disproportionately swell the financial bubble which dominates real economies like an incubus. Here too Cologne must give the signal in order to define an economic policy which finally sets out the objectives to be achieved, such as a different relationship with the global market organisation, the relaunch of quality as the hallmark of the European product, and lower taxes on businesses. We must ensure that Amsterdam is remembered as an opportunity regained rather than lost.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Görlach </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the statement by the President‐in‐Office of the Council about Cologne is, as always with presidencies of the Council – and especially the German Presidency – very ambitious. But it is not enough just to wish the presidency of the Council and the Council as a whole good luck in achieving the objectives of the Cologne summit. Parliament should also make it clear that we have our own ideas on the central subjects of that summit and that we want the intended measures to produce a successful outcome. So I want to concentrate on two points.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the institutional reforms and the preparations for the intergovernmental conference. It will not surprise you, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, if I do not take the same line as my colleague Mr Elmar Brok. If the institutions are to cooperate successfully but also if we are to secure what is eventually achieved in the intergovernmental conference for the long term and implement it successfully, then the European Parliament must be involved more closely in this conference than it was in past conferences – and I am deliberately not using the term intergovernmental conference, however much that has become common parlance – in this conference of the Member States. I know the will is there. And it is not just a matter of form either, nor of our wish for recognition. It is simply a question of normal procedures among democratic institutions of which more account should be taken in future.</p>
<p class="contents">When you discuss the institutional reforms do remember that it is not just a question of figures but also of ensuring that the matter of Parliament"s lack of power in relation to cooperation with the Council and the Commission – here I am addressing the inadequate codecision procedures – really is included in the agenda of this conference. In addressing this, I am also addressing in very concrete terms an area which greatly concerns this Parliament, the Council and the Commission and which continues to account for nearly half the entire EU budget. I am referring specifically to the common agricultural policy. We cannot accept that Parliament has no codecision right in this sector that accounts for half the budget. We really must fill this democratic gap. That is a most important point!</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the common foreign and security policy. We urgently need it. It is clear to see and everybody will understand that Parliament is not very happy with the creation of a Mr or Mrs CFSP because this does not really fit into the kind of structures we have all built up in our Member States. But I do not want to quarrel about that now. I would like to see progress made in the common foreign and security policy. And that is also the view of my group. So we say: ‘OK, do it, and do it quickly!" For sadly there is a bitter lesson we have had to learn: one cause of all that has already happened in the Balkans and that is also happening now lies in the absence of a really effective EU common foreign and security policy.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Méndez de Vigo </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span><span class="italic"> – (ES)</span> Mr President‐in‐Office, in the speech by President Santer – which was an excellent speech and I would like to congratulate him on it – and the speeches by my other colleagues in the House, you will find a rare unanimity. Parliament is in favour of institutional reform and supports the presidency in its efforts to that end. We need it for the simple reason that it was not tackled in Amsterdam. We also need it because Parliament is in favour of enlargement and we do not want enlargement to be delayed any further because the institutions have not been reformed. We are therefore going to support all the initiatives the German Presidency takes to implement this reform as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague Mr Brok has already spoken about the content and I would like to speak about the method. I believe that, through the resolution last November which Mr De Giovanni mentioned, Parliament proposed something that is as original as it is simple: the idea of using the Community method, the method we are accustomed to, in order to prepare the reform of the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We certainly do not wish to take the place of the governments, who will have to take the decisions. What we want to do is to help make things easier for them. So, with the approval in due course of President Santer – for which I would like to pay tribute to him – we believe that one good possibility would be for the European Commission to prepare a draft, to discuss it with Parliament and to also include the national parliaments in the discussion – for a discussion is all it would be. Eventually, we would be able to present the governments with a proposal, which we hope would receive as much support as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, if the Commission is in agreement, if the European Parliament is in agreement and if the national parliaments have been involved, this document would have tremendous legitimacy, and the governments and any President‐in‐Office would be able to accept a discussion paper. I would point out once again that you would have the last word.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this is a good possibility, Mr President‐in‐Office, and I would ask you to give it your consideration in Cologne.</p>

This is what we hope to see. When it was announced, our group welcomed the new approach set out in Luxembourg and in Pörtschach. These summits were actually marked by a change of tone and confirmed that our priority was the fight against unemployment. However, our hopes were not to be fulfilled with the subsequent Vienna summit. We had to content ourselves with statements; no specific measures were adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that the Cologne summit will come up to the expectations of the people of Europe and will result in specific actions. In light of the preparatory work, we are hopeful, since certain governments are proposing active employment policies and measures to relaunch investment. However, the statements by Mr Prodi and other governments, which advocate competition, liberalisation, and the flexibility of work, are also casting a shadow over this hope.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Secretary‐General of the ESC recently pointed out, we must do away with a certain dogmatism and use stability to foster growth and employment. Our group is putting forward innovative proposals to support this growth and generate employment. We propose to replace the stability pact with a genuine growth pact. Its main priorities would be to relaunch profitable investment, to continue lowering interest rates selectively to promote employment, to work to reduce working hours without cutting wages, to put a stop to the process of liberalisation and deregulation, and to establish a minimum wage in every Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">The German Presidency has rightly emphasised fiscal policy and its interaction with our economic and budget policies. In this area too, we must be innovative by combating fiscal dumping and taxing financial transactions. The social movement is becoming increasingly important at European level, and together with this movement we will work to ensure that these proposals contribute to a social and democratic Europe.</p>

It has not managed to put an end to the crimes against the people of Kosovo but instead has dramatically worsened their plight. But this failed NATO objective, the humanitarian crisis, was the only justification for violating international law and conducting this war of aggression. No end justifies the means. That realisation is one of the foundations of our civilisation. The <span class="italic">ultima ratio</span> has proved irrational.

<p class="contents">Let me first take this opportunity to thank both the President‐in‐Office of the Council and the President of the Commission for constantly bringing up and resolutely following up the question of employment policy, even though the Santer plan was not followed up to the same extent and came to nought in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">So I welcome the proposal once again to conclude a European employment pact in Cologne, especially after the preliminary discussions during the Austrian Presidency. For I think it would be very dangerous if the grave crises of today – such as Kosovo – led us to forget that we have a social crisis within the European Union. The President‐in‐Office of the Council rightly said that unemployment is the most urgent social problem of our time. I was painfully aware that the candidate for the presidency of the EU Commission failed to address this problem in equally clear and unambiguous terms yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also emphasise strongly that we need closer cooperation between the European countries and between monetary, financial and wage policy. It is an illusion to think – and I do not think anyone would pretend it was possible – that national or regional employment policy could be replaced by an EU‐wide policy. What approach the European Central Bank takes, what kind of interest‐rate and monetary policy it formulates, what kind of infrastructure is built up, whether it would not finally be possible to strengthen the European infrastructure in particular, all these things have a major impact on competitiveness, on unemployment and on the employment situation in Europe. In my view we must not desist here but must make greater efforts to coordinate these policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make a brief comment on the second point, the intergovernmental conference. I want to say quite openly and plainly that I am sceptical about the notion that the European Union can be reformed simply by holding a kind of intergovernmental conference. What the President‐in‐Office of the Council said here today in fact backs up this scepticism, for he said that far more comprehensive reforms will have to be undertaken. But can the representatives of governments whose powers, means of action and influence are being taken away and transferred to the European level put together a genuine reform package by themselves? After all Amsterdam did not just fail because of the ill will of individuals, it also failed for structural reasons, because of the way these matters are approached. I believe we need a parliamentary constituent assembly in which this Parliament and the national parliaments cooperate at least as equal partners, as a complement to the intergovernmental conference, otherwise we will end up with another failed intergovernmental conference. I think it is essential also to involve this Parliament more closely in this process.</p>

The biggest danger is that once again not one important decision will be taken and the people of Europe will turn away in despair from the spectacle of European cooperation within Europe, which is all too frequently hesitant and deficient. The biggest opportunity is that a number of issues will be resolved and confidence in European cooperation restored and strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">A breakthrough would be both useful and necessary on three points. The common defence and foreign policy has always been a non‐starter, partly because a number of Member States have sought to retain primacy. The drama in Kosovo and the moral and military response to it have brought the Union together for the first time in this field. It would bring us nothing but credit if we could sustain this unity and defend this European cooperation on the basis of values such as democracy and human and minority rights. I would strongly urge the Council to do this. It is also just as urgent to get rid of the destructive unanimity requirement in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">A second step forward should be to establish better standards and values for a social Europe. We want a Europe which not only embraces economic and monetary cooperation but which is also concerned about unemployment, combating poverty and caring for the disabled and the elderly. In short, a Europe that seeks not only to earn money but also to be of service to a society in which humane standards carry weight.</p>
<p class="contents">A third breakthrough is necessary in the field of the internal democracy and transparency of the European institutions. After the European summit in Cologne we must choose once and for all to have a Europe in which the European Parliament exercises control over all legislation and the entire budget and in which the European Commission is required to guarantee maximum transparency and management which is free from fraud. The loopholes in the Treaty of Amsterdam in this field must be closed as soon as possible. That is the kind of Europe we want, Mr President, a safe, social and democratic Europe which is free from fraud. If the Cologne summit can provide an impetus for this then as far as I am concerned it will have been a success.</p>

In this regard the Amsterdam Treaty articles concerning employment can be said to be gaining substance. In pushing through the European strategy on employment it is vital to get to grips with measures that can provide added value for national efforts. It is especially important to ensure that Europe is competitive while still complying with agreements that have been made. The superiority of European labour market practice must be made plainly visible through our ability to maintain growth and levels of employment by means of a system of open dialogue among the labour market organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of Europe have been concerned, alarmed and puzzled that another war seems to be developing in the Balkans, where small children and the elderly are the ones who are suffering. The Cologne summit must succeed in creating a credible single foreign and security policy. High level representation alone is not enough; adequate tools for action are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must take more overall responsibility in order to ensure that the situation in the Balkans grows more stable and allows different groups to coexist. We must also immediately embark on an active programme of cooperation with Russia, just as Germany, as holder of the presidency, has done to its credit. The present and future holders of the presidency must create an agenda for advancing the strategy on Russia. One important ingredient in this programme is the approval and practical application of the recommended measures to be taken within the context of the northern dimension.</p>

EU enlargement and the events in central Europe oblige us to make a realistic assessment of the possibilities that such a policy offers. There is clearly movement within the European Union: Pörtschach, Saint Malo, Bremen, Berlin. Cologne could be a historic summit. Both Chancellor Schröder and Minister Verheugen have made optimistic statements.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a new awareness of the principles which must form the basis of global policy. Europe must now determine its future responsibilities. The principle of equal partnership with the United States must be better defined. Strategies must be agreed. There is a lot that can be decided now, without having to amend the Treaties. A different timetable must be adopted than the one proposed by the Committee on Institutional Affairs. The Western European Union should be fully integrated into the European Union in 2002, for example. In the meantime, someone can already be appointed to be responsible for the common foreign and security policy, together with his or her deputy. The Defence Ministers must be granted a responsible role, and we must determine the proper role for the Political Committee. We must make it easier to increase cooperation in the field of foreign policy and security. Self‐planning and analysis can start immediately. In the light of Pörtschach it is very important to determine exactly what the ‘European pillar" involves.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now time to give real substance to the European defence identity. My hope is that the European Council will understand what is now at stake and make Cologne a success.</p>

We must make progress with the democratisation of the EU. The core elements of this are as follows: majority voting as the rule, a new weighting of votes in the Council, structural changes in the Commission and the European Parliament"s right of assent on all treaty changes. The distinction between compulsory and non‐compulsory expenditure could also be done away with. But if our end is to be democratisation, it must also be the means. That is why we have to apply the Community method to future reforms, which means that the Commission must make the first proposals; it is essential, I repeat essential, for the European Parliament to be distinctly more involved!</p>
<p class="contents">With the Amsterdam Treaty, Agenda 2000 and the euro, the EU has acquired a new quality; with the military operations in Kosovo its face has changed. All this also brings us up against the question of the constitution we now have and the constitution that we need. It is clear that however much we appreciate the presidents and grandees who presided over the beginning of European integration and the Community treaties, today we must give priority to basic rights and declare confidently that we, the citizens of Europe, are building a Europe of freedom, peace and solidarity. Human dignity, justice and the social welfare state are both the means and the end. The Biagio De Giovanni resolution sets out a guideline for the years to come. The German Government deserves our support for its commitment.</p>

<p class="contents">The question is whether we succeed in having a policy which includes the whole continent or whether, through possibly unenlightened choices, we stir up old divisions, create new clashes and open up a kind of trench across the heart of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the Balkan question must be dealt with, that is certain. But to do that it is vital to get Russia firmly involved in the right way. Finally that has been understood. We ourselves cannot settle these sorts of separation issues. The response must be loud and clear. I support the programme you have presented: the European constitution and the new Charter that it must include. The problems of unemployment must be confronted with renewed vigour.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is very important that we have spoken with one voice. It is vital for European policy that we speak with one voice. But we also need to speak with the right voice. And the right voice cannot be just the voice of war, it must be a diplomatic voice and a political voice too, capable of finding the space to resolve the problems.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not at war with Serbia, but we are trying to make Serbia respect fundamental human rights, and we need to be able to take advantage of every means available to us. There is an opening at the moment. The European Union must keep talking and move things even further forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I support the proposal for peace and stability. Its aims coincide with our established position. I want to thank President Santer because, if Parliament is to grow strong, it must also be responsible. Too much presumption can sometimes lead to conflicts which cause imbalances. That is why we need a European constitution and that is why we need a high level response, which should come from the Cologne summit.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Barros Moura </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my feeling is that, in addition to enlargement, the European Union is now needs to give specific political responses to a series of problems on which our future really depends. These responses must be understood by the people or, to put it another way, they must be ‘user‐friendly" for the men and women of Europe. At the top of the list is the need for effective coordination of economic policies and for an employment pact. This requires the political will to use the opportunities created by the euro for this purpose. We need a security and justice policy which meets the expectations and requirements to defend the freedoms of the people. In particular, in view of the Balkan issue, we clearly need, but are genuinely lacking, a common foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with those who have said that if the political will existed, the current Treaties could allow us to achieve a great deal. The political will to use the current Treaties in this way has been lacking and I fear that when the ‘cold war" ends, there are some who may lose the desire for political integration which is at the root of our achievements and of peace in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the German Presidency of the Council for its decision to hold the Intergovernmental Conference although it may find that this should take place using a Community procedure. The institutional reforms or the desire to limit the IGC to the three reforms from Amsterdam, including the weighting of votes and the number of Commissioners, are restrictive. I fear that this is hiding the idea of a return to an intergovernmental Europe with a ‘governing body" consisting of the large Member States. I am saying this straight out as I feel that this is the essence of many speeches. I believe that if we can bring to the fore the idea of a constitutional and citizenship pact, this must primarily imply a reinforced political will for political integration to overcome nationalism. Note that I am saying this at a time when war has reignited in the Balkans. Our way forward must be through integration because, as Mitterrand said here in this House, ‘nationalism is war".</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Verheugen, </span>  <span class="italic">Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your contributions to this debate, which I regard as on the whole giving strong encouragement to the German Presidency"s programme for the Cologne summit which I have presented. Let me very briefly give my position on four questions that many Members have raised here.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the question of the basic perspective, the basic strategy. Quite contrary to some fears expressed here, it would seem that Europe is coming closer together in face of the crisis and that the processes of integration are acquiring a new dynamic, both internally and in terms of the area covered, quite simply because, as I have said once before in this Parliament, the European alternatives are becoming clearer than ever before in this time of crisis, namely the alternative represented by this Parliament, which is an integrated Europe, a Europe based on peace, stability and prosperity, and on the other side the old picture of Europe that we see in the Balkan wars: nationalism resulting in war, expulsion and misery. When we look at these alternatives we see that there is a very distinct trend throughout Europe towards European integration. We must exploit and strengthen that trend. Let me give a small example. The fact that last week the Council called on the Commission urgently to submit a proposal to conclude association negotiations with Albania and Macedonia means that we are actually 10 to 20 years ahead of time, for under normal circumstances this could not have been envisaged until at least ten years" hence. It is the political circumstances that are forcing us to rethink our strategy and really make use of the dynamic that has now been created.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question concerns the Employment Pact. Let me say that in terms of substance it is not an employment policy action plan. That remains within the remit of the responsible national leaders. The Federal Republic of Germany, for instance, has already submitted its national plan and is trying to implement it; it has earmarked DM 2 billion for a special plan to create 100 000 training places and jobs for unemployed young people. That is what we expect of the Member States. What the European Employment Pact can achieve is a commitment to ends and also to means, and above all macro‐economic coordination. We should not underestimate the importance of that coordination, for it did not work adequately in the past. In this context, the macro‐economic dialogue between the institutions on the one hand and with the social partners and the European Central Bank on the other represents a new and important element. It is not a question of in any way diminishing the Central Bank"s independence, but it obviously must be included in any dialogue on macro‐economic coordination. After all, it has very crucial instruments available to it and surely it is better for people to sit down together and talk to each other – and the European Central Bank can evaluate the real expectations in Europe – than to engage in public quarrels and battles that cannot produce any practical results.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point in this connection is that of course we must optimise the financial resources and instruments available to the European Union and in particular to the Commission with a view to creating employment. As I understood President Santer, the report he intends to submit is aimed at achieving precisely that objective.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point concerns the institutional reforms. I would not like to see any misunderstanding arise here. What the German Presidency is envisaging is the beginning of a medium and long‐term process whose end we cannot even foresee, just as we cannot even foresee its scale. Embedded within this process are concrete steps that we can see clearly and that we should take as soon as possible, rather than embarking on some huge reform project that encompasses everything, an intergovernmental conference on a scale never seen before; that would lead to the kind of failure never seen before either. The rational course is to decide step by step what can be decided, while always remembering that we are engaged in a more broadly‐based process that will basically be a process of social discussion, a process of parliamentary discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">The first two steps are, therefore, as I have said: firstly, to tackle the famous leftovers of Amsterdam and examine the question whether our present situation as regards relations between the institutions will force us to make further changes to the Treaty, and secondly, the charter of basic rights, which, as I said, will have to be formulated by the parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point goes back to what Mr Tindemans and others have said. I am extremely grateful to Mr Tindemans for speaking so plainly, for his urgent appeal that we finally do what we should have done long ago. The German Presidency has undertaken to do a great deal here. It wants Europe to do more than just speak, but to act, to take a real leap forward now, to actually use the instruments at our disposal, for in the end they are all there. They are all there in the Amsterdam Treaty. They are all there in the various institutions concerned with security in Europe. We just have to put it all together and fashion it into a meaningful whole. It is a question of political will and nothing else. It is not a question of not having the necessary means or legal bases. It is simply a question of political will. I cannot foresee today whether the Heads of State and Government will muster this strong political will to take the necessary step and open up the new dimension of integration that we urgently need. But I promise you that we will make every effort to achieve this. And all in all I am optimistic, because the situation we now find ourselves in truly does force us to draw the conclusions that should have been drawn a long time ago.</p>
