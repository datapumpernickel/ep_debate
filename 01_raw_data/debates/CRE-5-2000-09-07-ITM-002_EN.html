<p class="contents">I would like to commend this result of the conciliation to the House. It was probably the most difficult conciliation and overall framework directive that this House has had to handle. The way in which Mrs Lienemann conducted the whole matter of taking all the political groups the whole way through was really something to be admired. I congratulate her most comprehensively for the way she did it.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We now have before us a legally binding directive which Parliament can be fully proud of. That was not the position with the original directive. We now have a legally enforceable directive which means that the environment of the Community over the next twenty years really has the opportunity of improving.</p>
<p class="contents">My only complaint, and this is why I took the floor, was that during the conciliation process non-governmental organisations were trying to influence Parliament beyond the stage that Parliament had agreed in its second reading. Documents were very often available to those organisations before they were available to members of the Conciliation Committee. This is not tolerable. In conciliation, where we need to build trust between the Council of Ministers and Parliament, we need confidentiality. This is something that we have to address seriously in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the Portuguese Presidency for the way they conducted the conciliation, but I hope that Parliament will be able to improve this situation internally for the future.</p>

This Directive provides a framework for consolidating legislation which has been in existence at national and European level concerning the whole area of the safety of surface water and ground water. The core elements of this Directive ensure the protection of surface water, coastal water, internal waste and ground water now and into the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council, which represents the fifteen Governments of the EU, originally did not include any provisions relating to the elimination of hazardous substances in this new Water Directive. I am supporting this Conciliation Agreement, which guarantees that the elimination of hazardous substances will now feature in this Directive and addresses this imbalance.</p>
<p class="contents">From an Irish perspective, we make the working assumption that the elimination of hazardous substances includes the prohibition on discharging radioactive substances as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Water pricing was always going to be a sensitive aspect to this Directive. This Directive now calls on Member States to take account of the principle of the recovery of the cost of water services, including environmental and resource costs, in accordance with the polluter-pays principle. Member States must ensure by 2010 that water pricing policies will provide an adequate incentive for users to use water resources efficiently. Member States will be allowed on an exceptional basis to opt out of the obligation of cost recovery if this is based on established national practices.</p>
<p class="contents">Water pricing policy is also a taxation issue. Under existing EU Treaties such tax changes require the unanimous support of all EU Governments. It is only right and proper that this matter of taxation is left in the domain of Member States, which must have the final say as to what taxation policies, at local or national level, it wishes to pursue.</p>

The Commission's proposal to monitor observance of the break-even principle by means of price surveillance is aimed at those EU Member States that still heavily subsidise their water industries. In contrast, in Germany the break-even principle is already being implemented, as is monitoring of unfair practices by the cartel office and by local authorities. Against this background, the framework directive on water resources and the Commission proposal on water pricing should not be used to create further layers of bureaucratic supervision in Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the provisions on the charging of environmental and resource costs associated with water use are aimed at those Member States that still make excessive use of and pollute their water resources, and therefore not at Germany, where exceptional efforts are already being made in this respect. The provisions of the framework directive on this point do not, therefore, provide any grounds for introducing a universal water or sewage tax in Germany, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the non-binding nature of the economic provisions of the framework directive on water resources and the Commission communication, there is a danger that there will be a considerable delay in implementing these provisions in the countries actually being targeted, if they are, in fact, implemented there at all. If, as has already been the case with the transposition of other directives, Germany, the ‘model pupil’, goes its own way, this would heighten the distortions in competition between the national water industries in the EU still further, thus running counter to the aim of the directive, which is to create a uniform framework for Europe's water industry. Germany has to learn to implement EU provisions in accordance with the objectives of the directive, not as individual <span class="italic">Länder</span> would like. With the EU framework directive on water resources we will once again see individual countries going their own way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ever since 1997 the European Parliament has been calling for the piecemeal nature of water legislation in Europe to be brought to an end. After nearly four years, these rationalisation attempts have finally borne fruit.</p>
<p class="contents">The conciliation between Parliament and the Council of Ministers, the final stage in the legislative procedure, has enabled what I consider a balanced and satisfactory compromise to be reached. The discussions were difficult, but I am happy that the Council finally agreed to make the main objectives of these new rules binding. Our Parliament could not have endorsed a text which was nothing more than a statement of intent.</p>
<p class="contents">The PPE/DE Group has always taken an ambitious and realistic stance. In my view, it was essential for this new framework directive to guarantee, in the future and for the sake of future generations, improvements in European water quality.</p>
<p class="contents">Henceforth, water management in Europe will be based on the principle of a hydrographical district, a body that goes beyond the administrative boundaries of Member States and takes account of the real water situation in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective is gradually to eliminate discharges of hazardous substances, within 20 years of their identification. That is a realistic compromise between, on the one hand, Mrs Lienemann’s initial position in favour of a zero level of discharges into water and, on the other, the position of the Council, which was opposed to any binding objective. A list of what are called ‘priority’ substances will be submitted to the European Parliament in the near future. That will be a vital step and I hope our Parliament will be able to follow the same line as today.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the polluter-pays principle, the Member States will have to incorporate environmental costs in water pricing. That is real progress. Water is a vulnerable and invaluable natural resource. Public health and long-term supplies are at stake just as much as biological diversity and landscape conservation.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, I voted for this text.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I am sorry that we could not keep the article allowing Member States to transfer water in the form in which we had adopted it at second reading. That kind of project complies with the principle of regional cohesion and solidarity that we have always upheld. In that sense, it deserves strong EU support, in the context of promoting trans-European networks and regional policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Trying to incorporate piecemeal water policies in one framework directive represents a considerable challenge. The binding commitment the European Union has made to its Member States to eliminate discharges of hazardous substances into water within 20 years is certainly a step forward, even if 3 years are enough for certain chemical products.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we welcome the introduction of water management plans based on hydrographic basins, we must remain vigilant when applying these policies; here I am thinking particularly of the project to divert water from the Rhone basin towards Spain. In that specific case, priority should be given to water management and the water savings that can be made, before massive projects to transfer water from one hydrographic basin to another are proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union now also needs to consider water pricing. It is unacceptable for multinationals alone to fix water prices, on the pretext that they are providing a technical water management service.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive represents a step in the right direction, but there will have to be more precise rules to reduce water pollution upstream. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know that each year within the EU there are up to nine million vehicles that are scrapped on an annual basis. This directive, which will now be enacted uniformly across the European Union, will ensure that cars will be disposed of in the future in a more environmentally friendly manner.</p>
<p class="contents">All vehicles within the European Union must now be fully recyclable by the year 2015. This is only right and proper because the European Union has both national and international obligations to implement more environmentally friendly legislation. Up to 75% of all metallic components in new vehicles can be recycled as metal scrap. This process should and must continue in an effort to promote higher environmental standards.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive aims to increase the scope for vehicle recycling and to encourage the re-use of car components. This can be achieved by improving the construction of various commercial motor vehicles and by setting up dismantling facilities throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position established the right for the last owner to return a vehicle to a treatment facility free of charge. There is an obligation on manufacturers to bear the whole or a large part of the cost of implementing these measures and for them to take back end-of-life vehicles at no charge to the last owner. It was agreed at conciliation between the European Parliament and the fifteen Governments of the EU that this provision should now apply from 1 January 2007. However, any Member State within the EU is free to implement this specific provision of this directive earlier than this date.</p>
<p class="contents">Car manufacturers, the suppliers of materials and equipment manufacturers must make an effort to limit the use of hazardous substances. We must all ensure that recycled materials can be used in the manufacture of cars at the design stage. The European Parliament and the European Council at conciliation have also agreed that all vehicles placed on the market after 1 July 2003 should not contain any heavy metals such as cadmium or lead.</p>
<p class="contents">Car manufacturers must also provide information on the rate of re-use, recycling and recovery of used cars which will be achieved within the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I have had much representation in Ireland on the need to take cognisance of the special vintage car industry in Europe. At the request of the European Parliament, collector's vehicles will now be expressly excluded from the scope of this directive. This is very important in light of the key social and economic role the vintage car sector plays in promoting tourism across the length and breadth of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proposal for a directive on end-of-life vehicles, submitted in 1997, is aimed at preventing the creation of scrap from vehicles and promoting the re-use, recycling and recovery of vehicles and their components, so as to reduce the amount of scrap produced by end-of-life vehicles that are dumped or incinerated without any energy recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission’s strategy is based on measures such as increasing the percentage of re-usable components, ensuring an adequate number of collection points for end-of-life vehicles, achieving a number of objectives regarding the re-use and recovery of end-of-life vehicles, checks on the use of certain heavy metals in vehicle manufacture and ensuring that the cost of disposing of end-of-life vehicles is not borne by the last owner.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations came up against stumbling blocks on several points. The difficulties focused on producer liability and the treatment of heavy metals. After several hours of conciliation, the negotiators managed to reach agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of producer liability, the directive stipulated that the last owner would be able to return an end-of-life vehicle free of charge and required producers to bear a substantial part of the cost of treating end-of-life vehicles. The compromise provides that for new vehicles, i.e. for those put on the market after 1 July 2002, producers should be liable from that date. For existing vehicles, i.e. vehicles put on the market before 1 July 2002, producer liability would begin in 2007 rather than 2006. The directive would also allow Member States to introduce these provisions before the dates specified.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of heavy metals, the Council and Parliament have agreed that vehicles put on the market after 1 July 2003 should no longer contain heavy metals such as cadmium, lead or hexavalent chromium. The two delegations reached agreement on the exceptions set out in Annex 2 of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, I am glad that Parliament’s call for vintage cars to be excluded from the scope of the directive was favourably received. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Far from being satisfactory, I see it merely as a first step, although it does, in some respects, go in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">While I welcome the figured objectives that have been set (by 2006, 85% of the weight of vehicles produced after 1980 is to be recycled, re-used or recovered, and 95% by 2015) I regret the hypocrisy of some of the provisions advocated by the PSE and supported by the Socialist and Social-democratic Governments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council of Ministers has, in fact, remained inflexible about allowing the owner to return his end-of-life vehicle free of charge. That is a demagogic provision. It may well be based on goodwill towards the consumer, but it is totally unrealistic. In fact, the directive stipulates that the cost of treatment will be borne entirely by the producers. The latter are bound to pass on at least part of these costs to the purchase price of new vehicles. So, far from encouraging the purchase of a new generation of less polluting vehicles, this measure is a hidden bonus for those who own the most polluting old vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council of Ministers finally responded to the wishes of the MEPs, who had been calling since the first reading, for vintage vehicles to be expressly excluded from the scope of this directive. The amendment I tabled and supported has, in fact, been fully incorporated into the final text.</p>
<p class="contents">In wider terms, this directive is not ambitious enough. For example, it says nothing at all about the problem of the dumped cars that disfigure the landscape. Despite the polluter-pays principle, it is the taxpayers who bear the cost of removing them. It is a pity that neither this directive nor the directive on the disposal of waste has concerned itself with this problem, which, after all, has disastrous environmental effects in much of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the impact of the increase in road traffic density is not limited to pollution from end-of-life vehicles and their recycling, something that has not yet been resolved in spite of its worldwide nature, or to the damage and harm this does to the air we breathe, or even to the serious resultant global warming. Road traffic also produces considerable, incessant noise pollution, which millions of people living beside roads and motorways as well as the humble pedestrian have to suffer on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="contents">So, the purpose of Mr de Roo’s proposals is to highlight a form of pollution that is generally overshadowed by others, and here we support him fully. But let us not forget that we must also set out more general requirements in relation to pollution from cars, which are becoming increasingly prevalent in developed societies and in our towns, and let us put pressure on the Commission to introduce policies to shift traffic off the roads and onto the railways and public transport. The Strasbourg tram is a clear illustration of this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We only saw the economic gain and how convenient it was for the car driver, not the drawbacks. Exhaust fumes and the lack of traffic safety were accepted as part of the deal, as well as the noise cars generate.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, over the past few years, this attitude has started to change. Many cities give bicycles and trains more space and restrict the freedom of cars. This does not end the problems caused by cars and lorries. The number of cars is still on the increase, as is the proportion of freight transport by road, and with it, noise pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at it through the eyes of the car industry, it is evident that manufacturers will pass the buck. They will look to the road owner – in general the Government – to increase safety and to reduce environmental pollution. As long as the car industry succeeds in doing this, they, themselves, do not have to look into reducing pollution caused by cars, or incur any additional costs as a result. In their opinion, noise pollution should be countered by using ‘very open asphalt concrete’, a road surface which, however, can turn unexpectedly slippery overnight when frosty.</p>
<p class="contents">What matters now is that a choice should be made between the interests of the car and the car-tyre industries on the one hand, and the interests of the public and the environment on the other. Far too often, we see that the short-term interests of powerful industrial groups are given priority, whilst the majority of our electorate increasingly sets different requirements for political decision-making. Protecting the quality of our life, rather than making a fast buck, is gaining in importance all the time.</p>
<p class="contents">This contrast was highlighted once again during the debate on car tyres. Mr De Roo was right in demonstrating that the regulation proposed by the Commission will not sufficiently improve matters, and that it is technically possible to reduce pollution by a few decibels. This simply requires the political will to put sufficient regulations in place, to monitor compliance with the regulations and not to allow too much leeway. The Group of the European United Left has constantly backed Mr De Roo in this. We regret that his reasonable and self-evident proposals cannot count on the general approval they deserve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the debate in the Chamber yesterday on cloning, I heard a number of people more or less clearly defending cloning for the purposes of medical treatment, on the grounds that this would be quite different from cloning for reproductive purposes. Unfortunately, there is a tendency now to engage in a new semantic debate or strategy of this kind which would lead to a watering down of the moral implications of cloning human beings. Those who do not wish to permit any form of cloning would be viewed as immoral in the sense that we would be allowing people to suffer from diseases such as Parkinson’s which would be curable if only the ban on gene technology were lifted.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a completely absurd assertion which I think ought to be withdrawn. Researchers throughout the world have said that Parkinson’s disease and other serious illnesses can perfectly well be cured by other methods. We also heard Emma Bonino say that politicians must take risks, but we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance believe that it is our absolute duty as elected representatives to identify the risks and to be careful.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I should also like to ask the Group of the Party of European Socialists why they have not called on Tony Blair to withdraw the whole proposal, but are content to request that a committee on biotechnology be set up. We must observe the precautionary principle, in this case more so than ever.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ask ourselves the most important question of all. For what purpose should we clone human beings? I believe we must realise that there is a race going on in the field of genetic technology, which means that there is a great risk of overstepping the limits in a quite horrifying way. The technology is developing incredibly fast now. We cannot just content ourselves with this debate. Rather, we must push the debate further and speed it up, whilst also observing the precautionary principle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commercial and industrial cloning, or cloning in order to create people with certain characteristics is unacceptable in everyone’s book, and rightly so. Nevertheless, we are today dealing with two conflicting points of view. Within the GUE/NGL Group, it has been left up to the conscience of the individual members as to how they wish to vote. In my opinion, the difference between the views of the Christian Democrats and the Greens on the one hand and the Social Democrats and Liberals on the other hand is that the former emphasise the penal implications for the medical profession, whilst the latter focus on the need for further research into the effects. I myself endorse the latter.</p>
<p class="contents">A solution needs to be found for people who need a new heart, a new kidney or liver, as well as for people suffering from Parkinson’s disease. This too is a question of ethics. My party, the Socialist Party in the Netherlands, exercises utmost reserve with regard to cloning and genetic manipulation. From this perspective, I have been able to support the alternative put forward by the Social Democrats and Liberals rather than that put forward by the Christian Democrats and Greens which goes for all-out rejection. Moreover, it appears as though it will be possible, within the next couple of years, to use the recipients own brain stem cells to grow organs which are not rejected by their bodies. I very much prefer this technique over and above the circuitous route developed in Great Britain, which is based on the reproductive technique. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The matter is a controversial one and depends very much on one’s chosen perspective. There are two points of view, with no real great difference between them. In the first place, technically speaking it is a question of the same sort of procedure. Secondly, philosophically speaking, if the action is examined from the point of view of the foetus, there is no difference at all. In either case it is being used as a tool, as something to use, and not as a living being with intrinsic value.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone is touchingly unanimous in their opinion that cloning for purposes of reproduction is unethical. My own profound concern relates to what grounds we have for preventing it, and I am someone who has studied philosophy. Are our arguments later to be abandoned on the basis of the fact that we actually already clone anyway, technically speaking? Does our purpose matter in the end, if the deed is the same? I voted against Amendment No 5 today only because, in my opinion, it would have required justification. However, I do not think that there are any grounds for making a distinction from the point of view of technical methods or the foetus. For that reason, discrimination such as this cannot be approved without the proper kind of thorough discussion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So the intention cannot be said to be a bad one. The method, however, is highly questionable, for at least two reasons. First, a life is created (either by using a surplus embryo originally destined to create a new human being, or by using a cloned embryo), and then it is destroyed to save another one. Do we have the right to create in this way categories of sub-humans that can be manipulated at will? Quite obviously, I think not.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, although everyone agrees that human cloning must be condemned in general, some people are trying to draw a distinction between ‘reproductive cloning’ (aimed at reproducing a complete human being), which would be banned, and ‘therapeutic cloning’, which could be authorised under supervision, subject to certain limits, and provided it is not carried out for commercial purposes. But that is an artificial distinction, since it is based on the intention behind the cloning, whereas the act itself is identical in both cases: therapeutic cloning also essentially involves the reproduction of embryos by cloning. All cloning is by definition reproductive.</p>
<p class="contents">The cloning of embryos for research purposes, or even the mere use of surplus embryos for these purposes, would amount to crossing an invisible boundary beyond which the exploitation of human life would become acceptable. We would be entering a different society, one contrary to our values.</p>
<p class="contents">One solution to this dilemma would be to speed up research into the possibility of obtaining stem cells from adult organs, which could be clearly earmarked for therapeutic purposes, as called for in the resolution tabled by our fellow Members, Elisabeth Montfort and Nicole Thomas-Mauro. That kind of procedure would be acceptable, since it is comparable to organ donation. Looking ahead, that suggests that perhaps our current questions concern only a transitional stage in the research. At any rate, we hope so.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the working party, which has dubbed itself a ‘Convention’, responsible for preparing the first draft of a Charter of Fundamental Human Rights is about to take a wrong turning here. Article 3 of the draft, as it stands, confines itself to prohibiting ‘the reproductive cloning of human beings’, i.e. it perpetuates the false distinction that we reject. I tabled an amendment on this point, together with a few other Members, but although it was worded in very moderate terms, it has not, to date, been accepted. Really, from whatever angle we look at this Charter, it is impossible to find any virtue in it whatsoever. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And if there were to be only one such issue, without doubt it would be the defence and promotion of human life and dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past few decades, scientific research has made enormous strides and given hope to those suffering from illness or disabilities and to their families. Yet at the same time, some of this research and some of the scientists involved in it seem to have lost sight of what I would call a just and sound scale of values. It is therefore up to those responsible for the common good, especially in the moral and political field, to put right certain abuses. This applies to the British and American decisions to permit, respectively, cloning and the use of what are called unplanned ‘supernumerary’ embryos, in both cases for therapeutic purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">This raises a great many, closely related, problems. There are not two kinds of cloning, reproductive and therapeutic. We must continue to prohibit the creation of human embryos endowed with the same genetic make-up as another human being, for whatever purpose. Indeed, no human law that is not criminal can ever deny the fact that the embryo represents the beginning of life. So it is unjustifiable to destroy an embryo under any circumstances, even to cure someone who is ill, for how could anyone decently justify destroying one human being in order to cure another? Similarly, and more generally, life is an indivisible whole, it is present from the moment of conception and as such, is no longer subject to any human wishes. Does the recognition of life depend on whether it is planned?</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, as responsible individuals, the potential parents have to give some thought, before conception, to having a child; but once conceived, that child exists and any manipulation of it, let alone planning its destruction for whatever reason, is an infringement of its fundamental rights and, in the worst case, a crime. It was a good thing that our Parliament took a clear stance on these abuses and thus, even if against the wishes of some of its Members, opted for life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it is right to take a stand against the decision taken by the British Parliament. It has been stressed that the European Parliament is standing by its decision to ban cloning, and consequently also to withhold all funding for clone research.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I regard paragraphs 6 and 8 in particular as very dangerous, because the medical claims being made for biotechnology are taken at face value here, although the results so far have at best been contradictory. By calling for further research into gene therapy and other forms of genetic engineering, the European Parliament is treading on very thin ice, particularly as there is not a word about the risks or about unsuccessful experiments, nor are they subjected to any kind of political assessment, all of which would cast some doubt on the unreservedly positive claims being made.</p>
<p class="contents">This expression of the European Parliament’s views on the cloning of embryos may represent a success in the short term. However, I fear that totally uncritical calls for more medical genetic engineering could in the long term completely undermine this success and even reverse the situation completely. They could open the door wider for technology whose implications are completely unknown. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This decision was taken before giving due consideration to numerous crucial medical, moral and social issues. No one disputes the fact that rapid developments in genetic and molecular biology have opened up new paths for science, reduced the gulf between the impossible and the feasible and given us hope that we can combat the diseases and illnesses which are the scourge of mankind.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, and precisely because biomedical science has incalculable potential and a tremendous ability to penetrate every aspect of human life and development, turning dreams to nightmares, both the scientific community and society as a whole at all levels need to address the urgent and vital question of who should have control of this new, highly powerful scientific ‘weapon’ and why?</p>
<p class="contents">Where capitalism in its most unadulterated and depressing form and the unbridled market economy rule, there is a fine, indiscernible line between the scientific motives and speculative madness of the multinational pharmaceutical monopolies. It is criminal for issues which impinge on human existence itself, on life and death, to be commercialised beyond the bounds of any social or political control. The rapid rate of advance in this area, with crucial questions unanswered and matters of capital importance pending, is fraught with danger, given the huge economic interests hiding behind this endeavour.</p>
<p class="contents">The ‘therapeutic cloning’ plan will be the spark that kindles the fire since no one can guarantee that limited and specific use will be made of cloning. The cloning of embryos could become the ‘Trojan horse’ which rekindles attempts to clone or ‘counterfeit’ human beings, with unpredictable and possibly dramatic consequences for the human race, and it must be averted.</p>
<p class="contents">The biggest risk is not inherent in the power of science but in the erroneous and uncontrolled exploitation and application of science. And when these activities are conducted in the context of the profit motive and its obscure interests, then we must be especially attentive and constantly vigilant. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clearly we cannot allow this trend to continue and must rapidly adopt measures to reverse it. What is at stake, indeed, is the protection of the environment, the quality of life and the health of Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">We could make serious progress if we implemented the Commission’s proposal to apply the principle of ‘reward the best and punish the worst’ to air transport in Europe, drawing a clearer line of demarcation between the various activities on the basis of their quality in environmental terms. Although the Commission’s communication describes a number of possible instruments, such as economic incentives and more stringent standards, it does not set out any measurable objectives or timetables. Nor are there enough practical measures to encourage aviation to pay more respect to the environment. So it is essential to set objectives and to respect timetables, so that the aviation industry, the airlines and the users can adapt to the legislative measures in good time.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the exercise on which the European Parliament has embarked. Its report tackles several of the problems caused by air transport. In particular, it looks at the problem of noise, which is an increasing source of concern to the people of Europe. According to a study conducted under the EU’s fifth environmental action programme, 80 million people in Europe are exposed to noise levels that scientists regard as intolerable, while another 170 million are exposed to disturbing noise levels. Recent studies also show that there is a link between aircraft noise and sleep disturbance, health and learning ability.</p>
<p class="contents">People who live close to airports are particularly affected by the noise of night flights. The ICAO has initiated a process of revising noise levels. The European Union must support that process and, if necessary, the Commission will have to take additional measures if the ICAO does not reach a satisfactory agreement. There are two ways to reduce aircraft noise: at source, thanks to more stringent certification standards and plans for phasing out aircraft that do not comply with them, and by land-use planning measures near airports.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the problem of gas emissions. It has been admitted that emissions from aviation account for about 3.5% of the global warming produced by human activity. According to forecasts, these emissions will rise by 3% a year over the period 1992 to 2015. So it is both urgent and vital to take measures to reduce aircraft emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">The list of pollutants from air transport is a long one. This alarming fact should encourage us to take measures very quickly. That means the Member States must give the Commission a clear negotiating mandate so that at the time of the 33rd session of the ICAO Assembly in 2001, it can vigorously pursue the environmental and transport policy objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In that sense, Mrs Lucas’ report sets out the positive measures that will help reduce pollution in air transport including, in particular, the phasing out of the loudest aircraft.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it raises practical and political problems, namely the obstacles of air transport policies and their adverse environmental impact. Europe’s measures to reduce greenhouse gases are being blocked by the fact that it has excluded air transport, a major CO2 producer, from the Kyoto Protocol and the plans to reduce pollutants. A tax on kerosene, environmental charges, zero VAT rating of air tickets: these are all points that need to be considered in order to establish fair competition between the different modes of transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A massive warming of the earth's atmosphere in coming years because of emissions of carbon dioxide and other harmful gases was recently forecast, once again by the World Wide Fund For Nature. This calls for an immediate response in the form of a rational policy and an economic system that is not solely geared towards short-term profit. With an estimated share of 15%, air transport is, of course, not the only cause of air pollution and by no means the most important. However, bearing in mind the forecast doubling of air traffic by 2015 within the EU alone, it is positively essential for the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament to take joint measures to limit the environmentally harmful impact of air traffic. These measures need to cover the whole range of harmful impacts, including emissions, noise, and poor air traffic management and town and country planning, and to take account of the economic interests of airlines in a balanced way.</p>
<p class="contents">We support setting rigid limit values for emissions and noise pollution and the EU initiative being called for at the forthcoming 33rd ICAO Assembly. And should the outcome of the ICAO Assembly be unsatisfactory, we are therefore also calling for the EU to set its own limits. Measures of this kind can and must encourage the air transport industry to develop new technological solutions, and more efficient, cleaner and quieter jet turbines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has created two holy cows: the car and the aircraft. Those who seek material gain from cars or aircraft are prepared to subordinate everything to their freedom to use these modes of transport, and overlook the adverse effects on their fellow human beings and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Aviation and airports have now become a privileged sector. They are largely exempt from taxes and environmental rules. This is why they can offer their services comparatively cheaply, even if the airfares are high on journeys governed by a near-monopoly. For this reason alone, aviation can win the unfair competitive battle against the railways, which have lost a large part of their share of international passenger transport to other modes of long-distance travel, especially aviation. As a result, cross-border railways are having to rely increasingly on privatisation plans and major investments in the high-speed network. These measures, however, have a number of detrimental effects on the public and the environment, effects which would not have emerged without the competition from aviation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is high time that aviation met normal environmental requirements of the kind that are in place for all other sectors, in order to protect the public and the environment against noise, emission of harmful substances and risks of accidents. Should this render aviation companies less profitable or hinder the enormous growth in air transport, this would not be a disaster, but rather a necessity. Mrs Lucas has made a few modest steps in the right direction and these are largely in line with what my party, the Socialist Party in the Netherlands, endorses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have tried, drawing on my wealth of experience, to make the Members of the European Parliament understand this. I am sorry that many of them have not fully grasped what I have been trying to make them understand throughout this part-session. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, playing is in our make-up and benefits our health and sense of well-being. But unfortunately, the enjoyment we derive from sport has come under pressure over the past decades and has been marred by a persistent and one-sided focus on performance and ever greater commercial interests. The use of doping in sport must be seen against this background. In my opinion, the phenomenon of doping cannot be considered in isolation but forms part of the commercialisation of a leisure activity. As a result, the discrepancy between amateur and professional sport has become far too pronounced.</p>
<p class="contents">Sport is high on the agenda in the Commission’s Helsinki report. In the resolution too, sport is commended as fulfilling a social and integrating role which brings people closer together. It is regrettable that many major sports events show signs of the opposite. Not for nothing did the Dutch <span class="italic">chef de mission, </span>Andre Bolhuis,<span class="italic"> </span>nickname the Olympic Games in Atlanta the Olympic War, probably because these games involved thousands of police and because of the hostile atmosphere which the American public and their media created with regard to overseas sportspeople. If we are to counter these expressions of hostility, which we also encounter during international sports events in our countries, sportsmanship needs to be placed at the top of the bill once again. The focus on performance and commercial interests should disappear very much into the background. This would at the same time create a much better climate for fighting the use of doping in the most effective way possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of sport, the Treaty does not accord any direct powers to EU institutions. Accordingly, the involvement of the Community in fighting the use of doping should be low-key. The sports sector is organised in its own unique way and national federations and unions still play a key role in this. Consequently, I do not agree with the request to include a reference to sport in Article 151 of the EU Treaty. After all, pressing for a Community-wide sports policy runs counter to the subsidiarity principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the resolution we voted on a moment ago does contain positive elements, I cannot support it mainly for the aforementioned institutional reason. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must congratulate the European Commission on the action plan it has proposed, together with the rapporteur and Mrs Buffet, President-in-Office of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the terms of the Olympic Charter, sport must embody “a spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play”. Doping in sport runs totally counter to that ideal. Yet doping products are widely used by professional sportsmen and women, but also by amateurs.</p>
<p class="contents">This scourge, whose true scale is difficult to measure, is a complex phenomenon that poses a serious risk to the physical and psychological health of the sportsmen and women. It is also a form of cheating that is contrary to the sporting ethic.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of that, we must take stronger European Union action to combat this phenomenon. I therefore support the inclusion of a legal basis in the Treaty that would allow for Community action in the field of sport. I know that this issue is giving rise to much discussion, which will in fact help fuel the debate to be held in the European Sports Forum in Lille on 26 and 27 October. I will, of course, take part in it and give my views.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, I endorse the call for the Commission to step up research into the causes of doping in the various sports disciplines, even though we know that one of the main reasons for the spread of doping lies in the commercial profits that are now linked to sport.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the Fifth Framework Research Programme, the European Union will have to conduct more research on doping substances, on methods of detection and on the health impact of using doping products.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is also vital to launch information campaigns on the risks associated with doping products. These campaigns should be aimed primarily at young people and be conducted with the help of athletes with an established reputation.</p>
<p class="contents">Since doping must be combated at international level, the creation of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is without doubt a vital step forward. This agency, set up in 1999, is currently operating under transitional procedures that leave something to be desired in terms of transparency and independence. I am glad to say that the French Presidency has undertaken to improve the way it operates.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us restore the true value of sport. Above all, sport must be regarded as an educational and social activity that encourages team spirit, solidarity and loyalty and helps combat racism and xenophobia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A word was even coined for this new version of ‘bread and circus’. It is ‘tittytainment’, formed from the American slang for breasts and the word entertainment.</p>
<p class="contents">The lesson was learned and the idea of sport as an entertainment, as an industry and as the opium of the impoverished masses of the world, took off. There is an endless succession of world cups, European cup finals, Grand Prix competitions, the Olympics of Helsinki and Sydney, football, tennis, races, car rallies and horse races.</p>
<p class="contents">All this is done in the name of the social function of sport, which produces healthy minds in healthy bodies, to the point that the Treaty of Amsterdam now includes a declaration on sport emphasising “its role in forging identity and bringing people together”.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, we all know that, thanks to sport and to the Olympic Games, the Peloponnesian War never happened, that Athens and Sparta truly loved one another and that the circus brought the gladiators together. From the evidence of the Heysel stadium, with its death toll, to the British hooligans at the UEFA Cup in Copenhagen and elsewhere, not forgetting the case of Nivel, the French policeman murdered by German supporters, let alone the Turkish ‘tourists’, the French PSG and others, it is quite obvious that sport makes people more sociable, tolerant and cooperative and fosters all those other qualities which have been promoted so well by the French suburbs and inner cities, since the World Cup, through the festive bonfires created by setting fire to cars.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor did high-level sport produce dozens of cases of rape and sexual attacks in the Olympic village in Atlanta; and French tennis champion, Nathalie Tauziat, who wrote a book criticising the very emotionally charged atmosphere behind the scenes of the tennis courts, was obviously eliminated from the French team selection in Sydney in the name of the team spirit and significant social values fostered by sport, according to Mr Mennea, the rapporteur for the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport.</p>
<p class="contents">Once this balm and these nice sentiments have been applied to the galling wounds of real life, our rapporteur becomes well aware that sport is not a cultural phenomenon but a political and strategic instrument used to enslave the citizen, who is made to forget the loss of his civic powers through a form of televisual training developing age-old instincts.</p>
<p class="contents">Share-capital companies, sports-club factories, from Manchester United to AC Milan, not to mention the US basketball and golf circuits, doping, the industry of anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs, which have left Pankov’s Germany and the Soviet Union to spread throughout the world, Adidas, Nike and other sponsors who want to see results, transfers to the tune of dollars beyond our wildest dreams, the EU Court of Justice’s judgments, including the famous 1995 Bosman judgment that everyone criticised but that ensures the free movement of young sportsmen and women and sports merchandise, the huge commercialisation, the alleged re-broadcasting rights and the collusion between sport and business – that is the real face of the industrialised world of sport that comes under our Community legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is from that manipulated world that we must protect real sport, the amateur sport practised in thousands of clubs, which have limited resources and survive thanks only to the devotion, ability and generosity of a huge number of voluntary workers.</p>
