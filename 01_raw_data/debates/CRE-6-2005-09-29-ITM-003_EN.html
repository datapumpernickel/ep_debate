<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">László Kovács, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, the European textile and clothing industry is, and will remain, an essential part of the EU's industrial and social fabric. The figures speak for themselves: around 2.5 million employees, about 4% of EU GNP. There has been a significant reduction in employment in the sector over the past years. That is unavoidable in an increasingly open world economy, but this fact is of no consolation to the worker who loses his or her job.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of the Commission and the European Union as such is to provide a predictable framework for the European producers and importers in the context of an open economy. However, this framework must be a compromise between widely differing objectives. On the one hand, we must and will ensure continued protection of our industry against unfair trade practices. Also, if there are genuinely unforeseeable and major surges in imports, the European Commission should be ready to provide temporary relief to the European textile and clothing industry without neglecting other interests at stake, such as those of importers, traders and distribution or of industry that is sourcing abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we must respect our commitments to China and help it to become a responsible WTO member. China, provided it avoids unfair trade practices, is entitled to enjoy the benefits of its comparative advantages and its WTO accession, while managing its integration into the global economy in a way that avoids trade disruption. This is what we have called the 'smooth transition'.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the textile and clothing sector is concerned, the scene for what is happening today was set a decade ago. It was agreed during the Uruguay Round that we would gradually abolish the remaining quantitative restrictions on imports in the textile and clothing sector by 1 January 2005, after a decade of transition. However, few anticipated the scale and speed of China's rise in this sector. There is a need to create a positive environment in international trade for textiles and clothing after the end of the textile and clothing agreement. The European textile and clothing sector has already proved that it can adjust to difficult situations and that it has the capacity to compete. One fact is often ignored: the EU remains the world's second largest exporter of textiles and clothing. This fact contradicts the view of those who see globalisation and the rise of China, and India in particular, as a swamping of European markets by low-cost producers.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that the EU can compete globally but it involves a process of restructuring and adjustment playing to our strengths, not to the strengths of other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We should focus on innovative, high-tech, valued-added textiles in which we are strong. It also requires that other countries, not least the most competitive textiles and clothing exporting countries, should open their markets to competition too.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the current negotiations in the Doha development round are so important and China has to fulfil the commitments it made when it joined the WTO. When China joined the World Trade Organization it accepted a formal commitment that allowed the importing countries to apply special textile-specific safeguard measures if imports from China were to increase very rapidly and cause prejudice to the industry of importing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It did not apply unilateral measures. The EU and China reached a reasonable and balanced memorandum of understanding on 11 June 2005. This agreement was the result of months of patient and difficult negotiations aimed at dealing with this problem in a negotiated way with China, rather than through unilateral safeguard action which would inevitably have had unwelcome repercussions. Above all it enables the European Union and China to focus on a more positive overall trade agenda and to continue building a solid trade and economic partnership in the textile and clothing sector as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me recall that this memorandum of understanding gives a breathing space to the European industry, giving it extra time to adjust. It also provides a predictable and sure trading environment between the EU and China for the textile and clothing sector enabling businesses, including both the manufacturing industry and importers, to plan their investments with more time and to adjust. It affords temporary protection to the current position of many vulnerable and poorer countries in the EU market and avoids a wide-ranging trade dispute with the EU's second largest trading partner.</p>
<p class="contents">What has been agreed is the maximum we could have extracted from China in terms of an agreed limitation of their exports, against the background of their and our WTO obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">On 5 September the EU and China decided through agreed minutes to fine-tune the implementation of the memorandum of understanding. These agreed minutes aim to unblock as a matter of urgency goods shipped after 13 July, the day following the entry into force of the regulation implementing the 11 June memorandum of understanding, in excess of the agreed levels set out in the memorandum of understanding. These agreed minutes entered into force on 13 September enabling from that moment the issuance of the necessary import licences and the release into free circulation of the merchandise which had been blocked on entry to the EU because of the exhaustion of the quantitative limits.</p>
<p class="contents">Through the agreed minutes, and in the spirit of close cooperation set up with the Chinese since the June memorandum of understanding, both parties decided to share the burden of the agreed solution. Half of the blocked amounts were unblocked by advance transfers from the 2006 agreed limits, plus transfers between different categories for 2005. The other half was unblocked through a unilateral increase by the EU of the import for 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lucas report, which we will be discussing later, expresses concerns about the way the memorandum of understanding has been implemented, causing disruption to retailers and importers. In the implementation of the memorandum of understanding, the Commission has acted diligently and transparently. We have to remember that, in this case, we are dealing with unprecedented volumes of trade in clothes, which are creating unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">The difficulties arising from the transitional phase of the implementation of the memorandum of understanding should not recur due to an improved monitoring and control system applicable from now on. Should implementation problems arise in the future, the Commission will take expeditiously the necessary measures to ensure full respect of the memorandum of understanding as complemented by the agreed minutes of 5 September. But we insist that from now on, importers need to make sure that they conduct their operations in compliance with current EU regulations and that they verify that the quantities are available from the agreed limits.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking to the future, European industry now has an additional two-and-a-half years of predictability ahead, at least with respect to the product categories covered by the memorandum of understanding. The challenge for European industry now is to use this time to the maximum extent possible, in order to adjust to the new competitive situation that began to emerge regularly ten years ago. The difficulty of the challenge that faces the industry should not be underestimated, especially in those sectors where China's advantages, arising out of cheap labour, make it exceedingly difficult to compete.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, aware of the difficulties that the sector is experiencing, will continue its work in several other trade policy areas to provide the best possible environment for the industry to thrive in the current competitive environment. Among our priorities will be: securing better and effective market access in third countries, notably through the Doha development agenda negotiations, but also through bilateral contacts; fighting fraud, counterfeiting and piracy; and acting on allegations on unfair trading practices where justified. These and other measures are being examined in the context of the high-level group on textiles and clothing. The Commission is determined to take the necessary steps to give new momentum to those measures, which are destined to help the industry overcome successfully this transitional period. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, the implementation of this agreement has run into some difficulties, such as the piling up of many goods in European ports, on which subject you have already spoken to us. Today, following the agreement of 5 September, we hope, Commissioner, that we can avoid new supply blockages, and avoid the entry onto European markets of additional quantities outside the Shanghai Agreement. Similarly, we would hope that the revised agreement could take appropriate account of the interests not only of the European textile industry, which has put a great deal of effort into adjusting, but also of textile producers in developing countries who have suffered the consequences of the liberalisation of this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner, how can we envisage building a sustainable future for the European textile industry beyond 2008? In the light of the recommendations of the Textiles High Level Group and of the European Parliament’s own-initiative report, what are the foundations for this future? In addition, the crisis linked to Chinese textiles has taken on, in addition to social and industrial aspects, a geopolitical dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that we must now ask ourselves how, in the long term, the European Union views its commercial relations with its major partners, particularly with China. We will also have the opportunity to debate this point when we discuss Mrs Lucas’s report. In the meantime, we must identify new avenues of development for the European Union’s industrial sectors, which will, in future, enable us to anticipate imbalances and to provide a competitive response to all global challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must, at the next WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong, support its partners’ efforts to combat the counterfeiting and piracy of textiles and clothing by effectively implementing the agreement on intellectual property rights, negotiate reciprocal access to the market by insisting on the removal of technical barriers to trade, and see to it that the social and environmental standards are applied by all. Would that not, Commissioner, be the best way of ensuring that, ultimately, we could all trade on an equal footing? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know how complicated and how difficult that was and our Group would like to congratulate you warmly on that.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much regret that the Council is not present for this debate. We have just seen how necessary it is for the Member States to act coherently, and I find the Council’s absence from this debate most unfortunate; I would like it to be informed that we are not happy about it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to return to a few points that Mrs Saïfi has already raised. The safeguard measures were introduced in the context of the WTO negotiations; that also shows how skilfully the Commission, the Member States and the relevant parliamentary committee negotiated at the time. We in Parliament have always said that this is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the first crisis we have just seen with safeguard measures, Commissioner, I would like to ask you something on behalf of my Group. Do you believe that the safeguard measures proposed during the WTO talks and agreed to by China are adequate in the light of the crisis? Do you think that the safeguard measures perhaps need to be reviewed again and possibly amended?</p>
<p class="contents">When you reply, which you are welcome to do in writing, I should be grateful if you would again make an assessment of the Member States’ role in this crisis and suggest what must be changed in future.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one point you raised, Commissioner, with which I wholeheartedly agree. You said that China has already become a political and economic world power. That clearly shows, of course, that many of the talks we have held in the past, in the WTO or in connection with other international agreements, are now presenting us with a new challenge. We are now dealing with major world powers: China, India, too, in other areas with its software industry, Brazil when it comes to sugar. What challenges do you believe the European Union will have to face in the future in the light of this situation? You said that business is capable of taking on the competition and pointed out that we are the second largest exporter. My question, on behalf of my Group, is this: do you believe that is enough? Do we need to do more, especially for small and medium-sized businesses? Do you think the aid we sometimes give to firms, many of which even then are guilty of outsourcing, is sufficient? Or would you as the Commission suggest that we need more controls to keep a proper check on it?</p>

<p class="contents">I hope you will not mind me saying this, but the measures that were taken on 5 September to eliminate the quotas, particularly those on the textile products that were blocked in European ports, are reminiscent of a game of panic football.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that the memorandum of understanding, which Commissioner Mandelson brokered with China in June, and which entailed the imposition of quantitative import restrictions on ten product categories, was very badly prepared. How else can we explain why less than two months later, the quota for 2005 has already been used up? The blocked goods were hurriedly cleared, and the June agreement ignored, with all the confusion that this entailed for producers, traders, buyers and consumers in the textile industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a few very concrete questions, Commissioner. Where do we go from here? How can the existing uncertainty and confusion be dispelled in an industry that is struggling as it is? How do people envisage the further implementation of June’s memorandum of understanding? How will imports from China be monitored in the coming months? And what if, within a few weeks’ time, another load of clothing is stuck in European ports? And what about the quotas laid down for subsequent years?</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, the latest agreement with China clearly produces far more questions than it answers, and I fear, Commissioner, that the Commission does not have those answers either. I hope you can convince me otherwise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are faced with the fact that world trade is no longer what we used to imagine it would be in the future. We always assumed that we here in Europe would do high-tech, while everyone else would supply us with cheap raw materials and cover our basic needs, as it were. That strategy is not working because development has proceeded much quicker, as with textiles in China, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are now saying that the agreement, the memorandum of understanding, has given us a breathing space, then it really is nothing more than that and will at best only slow the trend down somewhat, but it will not solve the underlying problems. Europe is not adapting quickly enough.</p>
<p class="contents">I also note that European interests are divided in this matter, between consumers, traders and politicians. Consumers want cheap T-shirts. At the same time, a growing number of people in Europe are supporting campaigns like the Clean Clothes Campaign, promoting products that have been made under fairer conditions. People want ethical standards in production; they also want ecological standards in production. At the same time, however, everyone wants to have these low-cost products. The traders are the same.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask you a question, Commissioner. If you say you believe the Commission acted diligently, how could the fact that any amount of Chinese-made products have piled up in the ports within a very short space of time be overlooked? I fail to understand how European Heads of Government can attend the opening of firms that have relocated to China and then come home and complain about competition from China. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a proverb that applies very well to the Commission and to Commissioner Mandelson.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when the textile sector is experiencing a true industrial and social disaster, they were listening, but they were not hearing. In the matter that put us in opposition to China, the European Union threw in the towel by agreeing to reassess the import quotas. The proposals and calls for help from employees’ unions and professional associations in the sector went unheeded. The only winners in this affair are the dealers that fear neither God nor man, the saboteurs of European industry, masters of delocalisation at all costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Demonstrating quite extraordinary courage, the Commission and the Commissioner jointly decided that, faced with hundreds of thousands of job losses, faced with the closure of thousands of businesses, they urgently needed to do nothing. They therefore hid behind this schoolyard phrase ‘20 million Chinese or Indian shirts equals one Airbus’. This equation is particularly stupid, because even an absolute imbecile knows that it is not the textile producers who buy Airbuses but the airlines. I can even tell you a secret: when these companies buy aeroplanes, it is because they need them, and they expect to fund these purchases from their activities, not by selling shirts. Moreover, the United States was able to sell its Boeings at the same time as taking the necessary measures to protect its textile industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with these pressures, with the anger of European workers and, above all, with the approach of the French referendum on the Constitution, you very strategically pulled out some tempting proposals, which were immediately received enthusiastically by all your friends in the club of two-faced hypocrites but which very quickly turned out to be nothing but smoke and mirrors. As you declared so cynically, globalisation is a game in which there are winners and losers, but we cannot say that to the people, so we are sometimes required to take tactical measures.</p>

Today, even the high-tech industries are leaving the continent. We must fight against this deindustrialisation of Europe and not surrender to this mirage of the tertiary sector above all. The other idea is that of the ideology of the EU which consists, in your view, Commissioner, in seeing this industry as a relict and China being forced to look outwards as a smooth transition.</p>
<p class="contents">We must open our eyes if we are to save this industry. We must re-establish the principle of Community preference as provided for in the Treaty of Rome so that competition is not competition between social systems. We must re-establish a competitive monetary policy so that we can fight on an equal footing against the monetary dumping of the dollar and of the yuan. In the immediate future, let us encourage China to concentrate on supplying its internal market, let us re-establish the quotas according to the 2004 standards and let us not forget the poor textile-exporting countries that are the main victims of this irresponsible policy.

<p class="contents">Well, it is the same for textiles and delocalisation. Watching jobs dying, watching businesses dying by the thousand, seeing all of these diseases of globalisation, when there is the possibility of developing new customs technology, is an incredible piece of obscurantism. I have explained this to Mr Mandelson. Today, the old generation of customs duties is highly complex, with quotas, tariff peaks and non-tariff barriers. It is all technically complex and inefficient.</p>
<p class="contents">We could, however, make it much simpler. We simply need to invent, as we in France did for VAT in 1954, a customs duty deduction. Under this principle, the customs duty payable on the textiles would provide the Chinese exporter with a customs credit that would be deductible on his purchases in Europe. The Chinese exporter could use this customs credit, either on the stock market or by rediscounting it to the banks, and, very simply, we would have invented customs VAT, which has taken 50 years to spread.</p>
<p class="contents">I have explained this to Mr Danet, Secretary-General of the World Customs Organisation. I have sent a note to Mr Mandelson. Seeing where we have ended up because of technological obscurantism, though, being unable to invent a new generation of customs duties, is heartbreaking, Mr President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is contrary to the Shanghai philosophy of a controlled increase in imports in order to give the European industry time to adapt. The bureaucracy of the Commission bears a great deal of responsibility here. The Commission has given preference to the interests of importers. The crisis in a traditional industry, the European textile industry, comes before them. Factories are closing one after the other. Workers' jobs come before the interests of importers. That is the European interest and the European Commission, the guardian of European interest, is being called on to protect it.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally am not in favour of neo-protectionist trends in international trade. Nonetheless, aggressive Chinese imports demonstrate that the balance of the world trade system depends on converging systems, institutional transparency and converging social and environmental protection standards. It also depends on effective protection for intellectual and industrial property and avoiding economic, social and ecological dumping practices. In addition, I believe that effective measures for the gradual adaptation of the European textile industry are needed, as are the necessary balancing measures in keeping with WTO law. The Commission needs to leave all the bombast behind. We, Parliament, have Mrs Saïfi's report and the relevant motion which accompanies it; we are pointing out the way forward for the European Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This review stems from the Commission’s apparent inability to guarantee compliance with the international agreements to which it is signatory. The flood of textiles since January 2005 had been on the cards and it is appalling that the Commission was neither ready for it, nor sufficiently flexible to react to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the practice of reviewing in September an agreement to which it had signed up under oath three months earlier does the Commission no credit on the international stage and severely weakens it in future negotiations. The Commission’s fragility is alarming and has, worse, instilled among European businesses, producers and importers alike, an atmosphere of uncertainty in terms of marking out strategies, which we must act quickly to dispel. I should therefore be grateful, Commissioner, for direct answers to the following four questions:</p>
<p class="contents">One: the Commission continues to regulate production in the EU, for example with the Reach Directive. What specific plan does the Commission have in order to ensure that the opening up of Europe’s markets will actually be accompanied by international compliance with minimum rules on human rights, the environment and workers’ rights?</p>
<p class="contents">Two: the high-level textiles group has recommended a range of political measures aimed at speeding up the process of revitalising the competitiveness of European textile regions, a recommendation accepted by the Commission. You referred to these initiatives, albeit very briefly. What exactly is the state of play with regard to these measures and to what extent does their implementation depend on the financial perspective?</p>
<p class="contents">Question three: what guarantees can the Commission give us that the September agreement will not suffer the same fate as the June agreement? What capacity and/or desire has the Commission acquired since that time to monitor the agreement and ensure that it is honoured?</p>
<p class="contents">Question four: given that the problems facing the footwear industry are similar to those of the textiles sector, can the Commission confirm the rumours that anti-dumping measures are in the pipeline for implementation in 2006?

The cotton mills of Lancashire helped form the backbone of the industrial revolution in the United Kingdom. Much of that has changed over the years. Mills that once employed thousands now employ in the very low hundreds.</p>
<p class="contents">It was unfortunate in Lancashire that the management of the process was not provided at a governmental level and many valued people found themselves with redundant skills overnight.

If EU industry is to have a chance in the future, it will not be heavy industry that holds its own but industry that is leanest, most environmentally sound and most knowledge-intensive and that also goes easy on resources. What we have witnessed in this case has, in fact, been quite shocking. It is specifically the old-fashioned heavy industries that have tried to do others serious damage by invoking state protection in accordance with the most repellent traditions of the rich OECD countries whose desire has been to protect their own markets but force poor countries to open up theirs. As a rule, the result has been twice as much harm caused to the poor.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is, the rich countries must open themselves up and also pin their hopes on renewal. It was of course in order to guarantee this whole process that ten years were spent on developing the Multifibre Agreement. There are, in actual fact, countries that have taken these matters seriously and that have managed to adapt, and without job losses. Going back on the agreements would penalise those countries, for they cannot possibly compete successfully with government-protected sunset industries. This is of course exactly the same as what is happening within the chemical industry, where another ‘Chemical Ali’, backed by governments, is coming along and trying to destroy modern industries. We must hope that the industry we obtain is one that can hold its own, even if the poor countries get their act together, and we must do everything we can to help the poor countries thrive. That is not something I can go into here – there is not time to do so – but that is what the aim must be, rather than that of isolating ourselves again to the detriment of everyone concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We had hoped for practical measures backed by appropriate, urgently-needed resources to implement important proposals laid down in Parliament’s resolution of 6 September. What we heard, however, was more of the same, and attempts at defending the indefensible. Let us cast our minds back:</p>
<p class="contents">On 1 January, the liberalisation of the textiles and clothing sector was accompanied by an exponential increase in imports to the EU. The Barroso Commission had been warned of the grave social and economic consequences for countries such as Portugal, and of the pressing need to activate the safeguard clauses provided for in the trade agreements. Yet it was not until 6 April that it implemented these clauses, albeit watering down the impact of their implementation. It then took until 17 May for it to open talks on just two categories of textile products, leading to the presentation on 10 June of an agreement, which quite apart from turning its back on the use of the safeguarded clauses, was laden with booby-traps. Once again, because of the absence of regulation on implementation, it did not enter into force until 20 July, which gave the large European multinational importers and distributors time to undermine the import limits agreed in June.</p>
<p class="contents">In September, the Commission, pandering to the wishes of the large multinationals, this time acted quickly, and forced the admission of millions of textile and clothing items, going back on what it had itself agreed. The moral of the story is that those who have gained from the liberalisation of the textiles and clothing trade are the large importers and distributors; it is they who have raised their profit margins to ever more outlandish levels. The losers are the European textiles industry, the workers and the thousands of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Last year, when the Commission was informed of the forecast, and a few politicians, myself included, were sounding the alarm, Europe failed to say anything and sent no warning signals, either to China or to the retail chains, and failed to prepare in time for rapid monitoring. It was a mistake not to make it clear to retailers before they signed contracts that the EU would take protective measures and limit the growth in imports to acceptable levels, and that we would not foolishly sit back and watch an industry that provides work for millions of women in southern and central Europe die out. </p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately limits were imposed only after six months had passed, after massive import contracts had been signed, and after the goods had clogged up European ports. It was clear that the Chinese expected vast quantities of goods to be allowed into Europe. This agreement turned out to be a mere scrap of paper. This begs the question of whether it was meant in earnest. Critics say that it was just a matter of reassuring the European Parliament. I do not share this view, which is why, on behalf of Czech textile workers and others, I demand that the quotas be enforced for one further year, until the end of 2008. This would balance out the agreed limits that were exceeded after June. </p>
<p class="contents">Above all, however, I would call for this respite to be used to change the EU’s trading strategy. All economic and political levers should be used to force communist China to open its own markets on a reciprocal basis, to accept the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and thus to comply with minimum standards in the near future. It should also be forced to stop circumventing the ban on state subsidies to exporting companies, to limit trade piracy and to assume partial responsibility for industrial waste and for repairing environmental damage. </p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the EU will ultimately become a strong player on the world stage, and that the Commissioner will become a strategic decision maker, rather than simply an arbitrator of the occasional dispute. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission proposed restricting these imports and, as a result, reached the agreement in June. Taking advantage of the time period necessary to establish this agreement, however, certain European importers accumulated a large quantity of goods.</p>
<p class="contents">The new agreement of 5 September 2005 contributes to resolving this problem, which had reached a point at which it was not benefiting anybody. But that agreement cannot be described as satisfactory, because it has given the impression that there has been a lack of rigour.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people have said, right here today, that the textile industry should have adapted more quickly because it had known what was going to happen for the last 10 years. But I would predict that, if we do not deal with these challenges in an ordered manner, though we are talking about textiles today, tomorrow we may be talking about cars or communications and information technology products.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not an argument between free trade and protectionism, but rather what we want is increasing, but fair and transparent, trade, which respects minimum social and environmental standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to draw your attention to a situation that is causing alarm in the sector. In addition to the well-known distribution chains that produce goods in China at stable prices, unfamiliar makes have appeared that declare unusually low prices, which do not even cover the cost of the raw materials for the product.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, prices of trousers entering the Union can oscillate between EUR 6 and EUR 0.43; in both cases we are talking about trousers produced in China. In my country, these practices represent around 40% of imports originating from China.</p>
<p class="contents">I suspect, Commissioner, that we are dealing with a case of fraud, in which the value declared in customs is being used to reduce the importer’s tax bill, both in terms of the Community tariff and in terms of VAT. I would therefore like to know what decisions the Commission is going to take in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we must act fast, and I would suggest a number of paths worth considering: authorise the Member States to use the Structural Funds reserve to assist businesses suffering cash-flow problems, and to help them to innovate and restructure; assist businesses in creating consortiums so that they can form a true commercial force able to conquer the Chinese market; impose social and environmental criteria; require product labelling that indicates the country of origin; and, finally, as the speakers before me have already said, create true European labels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Capitalist restructurings in world trade, especially in the textile industry, result in huge profits for large textile export and distribution groups and big business in general. At the same time, thousands of workers are being thrown out into the street of unemployment. According to the official statistics of the European Textile Organisation, 1 million jobs will be lost in the Member States by the end of 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">What is all this talk of the invasion of Chinese products into the Member States trying to hide? Obviously it is trying to hide the responsibilities of the European Union and the governments of the Member States, the anti-grass roots policy whose criteria are competitiveness and the profit of big companies, of big business.</p>
<p class="contents">The workers need to draw the necessary political conclusions, given that the statistic quoted in the relevant reports is this: that 60% of Chinese exports to the rest of the world come from foreign investments in China.

It consists mainly of small and medium-sized firms and has successfully gone through a great deal of structural change in Europe in the last 30 years. We are not at the beginning. The crisis that has now been triggered by the dramatic rise in imports from China is not, however, affecting companies in the European Union alone; it is those in some of the world’s poorest countries, Bangladesh for example, that are primarily affected. They are the ones that are suffering the most. So is our customs union partner Turkey. It would be completely wrong for the European Union now to insist unilaterally on new subsidies. As the Commissioner rightly said, we need to concentrate on innovation, on efficient methods of production.</p>
<p class="contents">On the international stage, of course, the Commission must enforce standards and try to ensure that fair conditions for competition prevail. Unfortunately, I am unable to join in the eulogies that say the Commission got everything right in 2005. It waited too long. The high-level group constantly put us off. Then it gave only half a response, did not know that imports were piling up in the ports. The praise for the Commission is therefore very muted.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to make clear, however, that there are two sides to the question we are debating today. Consumer prices are also involved. We cannot ignore the fact that our consumers in the European Union like being able to buy low-price textiles. Europe’s two largest groups, H&amp;M and Zara, are proving tremendously popular with consumers. This, too, is connected with the fact that the international division of labour cannot be stopped in such a labour-intensive sector. The Commission can however, especially this year, provide a better and more sensible environment for it than in the past. I call on the Commissioner to act sooner and more decisively, not to devise new programmes of subsidies but to ensure that conditions are fair. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that, above and beyond all the polemic, this is due to Parliament’s grave concern regarding the future of the textile industry and above all, which is the striking aspect of this matter, due to the perceived lack of foresight on the part of the Commission and of the Member States. True, you have mentioned an unprecedented increase in volume, but this increase in import volumes was anything but unpredictable. Everyone knew what we were dealing with regarding the end of the multi-fibre agreement and the lifting of quotas on 1 January this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, I cannot understand why we had to wait for so long for the Commission to react. We had the option of bringing safeguard clauses into play, which is permitted under the WTO’s rules. It was not at all necessary to wait for agreement from the Chinese, nor to wait until June.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we also question the conditions under which the protocol signed on 10 June has been implemented and the way in which we ended up in this imbroglio of 85 million products piled up in Customs and breaches of the quotas agreed for 2005. How is it that appropriate measures were not provided for when the agreement was signed and what guarantee do we have that the conditions of this agreement can be kept for the two and a half years to which you referred and which are supposed to give the sector time to organise its restructuring.</p>
<p class="contents">The professional textile and clothing association has signalled the loss of 165 000 jobs since the beginning of the year and projects that one million jobs will be put at risk by the end of the year. Can you confirm these figures? What measures does the European Commission intend to take? Can the restructuring fund, which was defended by Mr Špidla and the previous Commission, be used to help the employment areas and businesses worst affected?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, several speakers have referred to the structural problems now posed by competition with China, which distorts competition in reality, according to the WTO’s rules: export subsidies and hidden aid, such as the provision of electricity or interest-free loans given to state-owned businesses by state-owned banks. We could also ask ourselves whether it is time to raise the question, along with the other partners of the European Union within the WTO that are targeted by this increase in Chinese imports – Bangladesh, Turkey, Tunisia and Morocco – of fundamental social standards. Does the Commission intend to talk to these partners and to put these subjects on the negotiating table, particularly at the Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This House’s left-wing Members in particular are calling for the market to be sealed off again. The Committee on Regional Development is calling for new programmes to support the European textile industry. Sealing off and subsidies – if that is all we can think of in this age of globalisation, then this sector must be in a really bad way in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, the European textile and clothing industry is a lot further ahead than the politicians, because the companies in question have been facing up to global competition for decades. For a long time now, they have been strengthening their competitive core areas in the European Union: research, marketing and finishing, and developing supplier structures in the Far East, especially in China. The European textile industry did not receive any subsidies for this structural change. That is why more than 100 000 jobs were lost in the Dutch-German border region, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Unemployment is nevertheless now far below average in the regions concerned. That is precisely because there were no subsidies to preserve the existing structure. It is because the European Union supported structural change outside the textile industry, in technology centres and redevelopment, for example; you remember the RETEX programme from the past.</p>
<p class="contents">New programmes specifically to support the textile industry are not the way. Firms in Europe that have regained their health by slimming down would not understand if their ‘reward’ was now to have to compete with neighbours that were suddenly subsidised. Instead of distorting competition with subsidies, we must shape the regulatory environment. This includes, for example, making patent protection easier, prosecuting product and trademark pirates consistently and expanding research capacities, particularly in nanotechnology, new materials and production processes. We must help the affected regions, not by using operating subsidies to delay structural change but by pursuing an active structural policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to quote the Commission certain statistics: in 2004 alone, redundancies exceeded 15 000. Recently, new textile factories have closed in areas of Greece such as Corinth, Thessaloniki and Thrace. It is a crucial problem and the traditional productive fabric of the country is being damaged and unemployment is increasing.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this is a wider problem; it is a European, not a national problem. That is why active rather than passive intervention is needed. The question is how is the European Union reacting and how is it making use of the mechanisms of the World Trade Organisation. The question is what integrated European policy does Europe have at its disposal to modernise and strengthen the competition of the European textile industry. European citizens do not believe today that the Shanghai agreement was the most correct framework; or they probably believe that it was very late coming. Just as European citizens believe that the September agreement achieved by the Commission will not stand up. The problem will bounce back even more strongly next year.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very difficult, Commissioner, to persuade the European citizens losing their jobs and finding themselves unemployed that the European Union has every interest in full liberalisation because it can export its goods and services to China. This is simply because not all European countries have heavy industry, they do not all produce cars and airbuses.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission needs to formulate a new integrated strategy for the textile industry in the run-up to the crucial milestone of 2008. It needs to be more proactive in defending the rights of the European Union at the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I call on the Commissioner for the European Commission to tell us what it intends to do about the textile companies financed from Community funds which then either relocated outside Europe or closed. It is a particularly important issue which requires an immediate response from the European Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We went through this painful experience in Austria a few years ago, when the textile industry in the province of Vorarlberg, where it had traditionally been based, collapsed overnight as a result of relocation to other countries – at that time to Hungary, and later to Romania, then Ukraine, now Serbia, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are faced with a global phenomenon. The trade conflict with China has made us all very much aware of this. What did we do? We adapted, we went in for modern technologies, we went into research, we created an economic environment that has made Vorarlberg one of the most modern high-tech locations in Europe and has made it competitive. What I am saying is, we must create an environment where the European Union can be competitive, too.</p>
<p class="contents">What has happened in the past, wavering between liberalisation on the one hand and applying the brake by reintroducing protectionist measures on the other, cannot be the way. We must find more sustainable solutions, sustainable solutions that also ensure that we know the conditions under which products are made. It is clear that China is taking a lot of measures to help state enterprises that are also distorting competition here, such as interest-free loans from state banks, export subsidies, hidden subsidies in the form of free electricity supplies, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">I remember attending a short conference held by one of Europe’s textile manufacturers and traders, who pointed out that China is quite naturally pushing its textile products on to the market because half its earnings have to be in foreign currency. If we are talking to China, we should therefore also be stressing that Chinese firms should be relieved of this pressure. That would unquestionably help the European textile industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has done well with the measures it took in connection with the talks with China.</p>
<p class="contents">Before we spend a long time talking about where the textile industry is going and what we can keep here, it would be better – and I am saying this as a member of a textile trade union – to talk about an orderly withdrawal of the textile and clothing industry within the European Union. That does not mean there will be no textile industry at all – quite the contrary. There will still be the technical textile sector, high-tech with nanotechnology, the beginnings of which we already have. That will be what remains of the textile industry in Europe. There will still be a remnant of <span class="italic">Haute Couture</span> in the European Union, but it will be no more than a remnant. That is why we must talk about an orderly withdrawal. An orderly withdrawal of course needs alternatives for those employed in these sectors. Today the Council is again conspicuous by its absence from this debate. I am saying that specifically for the British Presidency, which has insisted there will be no more money for the European Union. I am not asking for money for the textile industry. I am asking for money for the regions where, despite agreements, employment will plummet by more than a million in the next few years. That is what we need in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also give some thought to a matter about which I would like to ask the Commissioner a question: should we not be talking about textile labelling? Labelling must be discussed with the WTO. I mean labelling that would cover both social and environmental aspects. The WTO should also require China to implement human rights and ILO standards. That is the best way for further development. We must focus on our own workers and also on the workers and on development in China. Then we will be ready for the development we need in world trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A balance must be struck between EU textile protectionism, which costs an extra EUR 270 per year for each four-person household, and complete market distortion. It is a difficult tightrope. Yes, as politicians we are operating in the sphere of practical politics and not pure economic theory.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot have a situation such as that which arose this summer, when the sale of 80 to 90 million items of clothing and textiles was blocked in the warehouses of Europe, paralysing European businesses and damaging their trade relations with Chinese counterparts. We need more flexibility to manage unforeseen changes in global trade.</p>
<p class="contents">That involves setting up a level playing field where everyone plays by the same rules. It is essential that the Commission does its utmost to enforce the terms of trade agreements where exporters to the EU comply with international norms on workers' rights and environmental standards. The Chinese have the advantage of cheap labour and sometimes, by our standards, questionable labour standards. But let us be honest, the textile industry in Europe is one of the lowest paid too and the more educated our workforce becomes, the less inclined they are to take up the sewing machine. There are a lot of circles to be squared here, less revisionism about what conditions were like in our industries years ago, and we need an honest, open dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">There is tension, even within the EU, as to how it should be handled. Since the setting-up of import quotas, Chinese textile exports to the EU are allowed to grow by between 8 and 12% for the next couple of years. The Spanish and the French have one view on how this should be handled, the British, Irish and the Nordic countries another view. Those speaking on behalf of retailers and consumers take one view, whereas those in relation to producers have another view. My own government has in recent years changed its policy and now actively encourages and assists Irish companies to source in the People's Republic of China and elsewhere. We have no choice since we joined the European Union and lost our advantage to the Euro-Mediterranean producers.</p>
<p class="contents">We need open and honest dialogue and need to look to ourselves internally first. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Trade relations should properly be based on mutual respect for Community laws and that is not happening at present. One need only think of the indiscriminate use in those markets of materials, including chemicals, that are now prohibited in Europe and indeed of the abuse of workers who in that economy have no representation, the exploitation of children, prisoners, slaves and in short of those who lack any kind of protection by society.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement that has just been reached and the unblocking of the blocked goods cannot constitute a definitive solution to the problems that have emerged. We need a fundamental change of course to bring us back to equitable conditions and respect for rules binding on both parties. Perhaps a first step might be to investigate the idea of bringing back quotas and customs duties, at any rate on a short-term basis, to limit the damage, as well as considering the issues of traceability and trademarks. Something is now being done to remedy the previous lack of action by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Last July’s text in defence of intellectual property and against counterfeiting and piracy certainly made a start in defending our textile businesses and our economy in general. This is the aim, Mr President, of the two amendments tabled by over 40 Members on which voting will take place this morning. I hope that they will be incorporated in the Lucas report: one of them welcomes the proposal for a directive on penal sanctions and the other concerns respect for environmental measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also grateful for the concerns and critical remarks that have been voiced. I have already addressed some of these in my introductory remarks. The Commission is prepared to learn from the situation and to take on board all relevant concerns and criticisms.</p>
<p class="contents">When we deal with China, we of course take into consideration the geopolitical aspects and the important role China plays in the world. However, in this particular case, we are giving preference to the aspects of trade policy, the interests of our textile industry and even to the possible social consequences of the situation. Our trade policy vis-à-vis China – the memorandum of understanding and even the agreed minutes – are aimed at establishing a sustainable future for the European textile and clothing industry, which is basically competitive. We are very strong in upmarket products, for instance, and we are the second largest exporter of textile and clothing products in the world. The memorandum of understanding has given our textile and clothing industry additional time to prepare for the challenges it faces.</p>
<p class="contents">Measures are also aimed at protecting the interests of the Maghreb states, as well as those poor developing countries which export textile and clothing products. The work on the reform of the rules of origin and origin-marking, which is being considered by the Commission, is also intended to help the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the problems of implementation of the memorandum of understanding and the question of whether the Commission acted too late and lost time before May 2005, I would remind you that we first had to evaluate the situation and examine the quotas. Some Member States were late in submitting or providing the necessary information.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that there has been a huge stockpile of textile products and there were many reasons for that. One of the reasons is that it occurred in a short period between the signing of the memorandum of understanding and its entry into force, and some importers even put in orders in an attempt – ultimately unsuccessful – to block the system. At the end of the day, we had to apply a flexible solution, which was the advance use of the quotas for 2006, but of course this did not result in any increase in the quantity of the textile products which China will be able to export.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreed minutes and the monitoring will prevent similar problems, similar bottlenecks, and the Commission regularly makes the quotas public in order to inform importers.</p>
<p class="contents">Many speakers referred to the burning issue of counterfeiting and there is no question that the Commission is firmly committed to combating it. I want to refer to the customs cooperation agreement we signed with China, which entered into force this spring and for which we have high expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the prospects for the European textile and clothing industry are concerned, several questioners asked whether the industry needs protection. My answer is 'yes' and the measures concerned appear to be good enough, although we are prepared to review them.</p>
<p class="contents">One measure, for instance, is the ongoing anti-dumping investigation on footwear. In reply to another question raised, Chinese garments are subject to the same provisions as EU products.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we cannot extend the quotas after 2008, but as far as other solutions like outsourcing are concerned, my answer is 'yes'. However, the real solution is to further strengthen the competitiveness of the European textile industry through research, innovation and investment, but certainly not at the expense of environmental protection and environmental standards. But we will urge, encourage and help China to respect these same standards, as well as urging it to respect ILO standards. So, we understand the situation in its full complexity.</p>
<p class="contents">These were the most important points raised during the debate. In the limited time available, of course, I cannot answer all the questions raised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
