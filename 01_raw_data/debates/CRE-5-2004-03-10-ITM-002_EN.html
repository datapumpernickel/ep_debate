<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Brok (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I believe it is fair to say at this point, only a few weeks before the first of May, the date that has been set for the enlargement of the European Union, that all ten acceding countries have made massive efforts over the past decade to prepare themselves for that day. They have taken far greater pains – with profound consequences for their peoples – than we in the European Union have done in preparation for enlargement, as the foregoing debate has demonstrated. I hope that the Cyprus question will also be resolved in time for us to welcome a united Cyprus into the fold on the first of May.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, since this is the last report of this type, I have to say that the authors of the country reports from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights and Common Security and Defence Policy have shown great responsibility and commitment in the performance of their task over these past years, and, as chairman of the committee, I should like to take this opportunity to record my thanks to them.</p>
<p class="contents">On the first of May the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, the body of established Community law and practice, as defined in the Treaty of Accession, will enter into force in the new Member States along with the associated transitional provisions. This means that there must be no more discrimination in either direction and that we shall continue to set great store by compliance with this <span class="italic">acquis</span>. We are sure that the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, will take a similar view.</p>
<p class="contents">In respect of compliance, however, there are still weaknesses. We do not say this by way of criticism but as a means of helping, of raising awareness, of creating scope for political action to eliminate these weaknesses. We must appreciate that these countries have had to undertake a complete transformation of their political, economic and social systems, that they have had to make the transition from Communist centralism to a more regionalised form of government. It is obvious that all of this cannot be achieved overnight.</p>
<p class="contents">The same sort of situation obtains with regard to the judicial system, but these weaknesses have implications: if the administrative machinery does not function properly, it will not be able to formulate the regional strategies that are required for access to EU structural funds. The situation is similar with regard to the government departments responsible for agriculture and several other areas of activity. It is therefore in the interests of the acceding countries to do better in these areas. There is therefore a need to keep pursuing the efforts for which the Commission called in its own report last autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also realise that a non-functioning judicial system implies legal uncertainty in some areas of regional activity, for example. Legal uncertainty invariably acts as a barrier to investment. It is essential to create legal certainty in those areas too. This is not simply a matter of enabling individuals to exercise their rights; it also affects economic development in particular regions. This point is appreciated too, and both factors together are relevant to the fight against corruption. As we have heard today, there is corruption in my country, Germany, and indeed there is corruption in football too. But we must ensure that this cancer, which exists everywhere in varying degrees, does not take a grip of the European Union and jeopardise our general development prospects</p>
<p class="contents">Another point that needs to be discussed is the fact that the issue of minority rights is not regulated in the same way everywhere. The position of gypsies in some countries, for example, needs to be addressed, and here we hope to see practical improvements. At the same time, we should also recognise that the Baltic States have made strenuous efforts in this historic context with regard to their minorities, and that the situation of these minorities is no reason for not signing or ratifying the boundary treaties with them. We therefore call on Russia to move forward swiftly so that clarity can be established on this issue too.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to be sure that the cooperation and partnership agreements will apply to the whole European Union. The principle of no renegotiation must apply to all of them. Nor can compensation be claimed on account of the enlargement of the European Union. On the contrary, we must build bridges at the new borders of the European Union, and we must pave the way for the earliest possible application of the Schengen standards there in order to guarantee internal security and hence be able to open the internal borders. This configuration surely constitutes one of the toughest problems we shall have to solve.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, may I say in conclusion – and I believe I can speak for the entire House here – that we are looking forward to the first of May and to the accession of our new partners.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Orden (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, over the past decade we have seen a massive transformation of Bulgaria, hauling itself out of a Communist past and now on track for accession to the European Union by 2007. The turnaround is truly remarkable.</p>
<p class="contents">My report is therefore very optimistic. I see no reason why accession negotiations should not be closed during the summer before the conclusion of the Irish presidency and before the mandate of the present Commission ends. This would be a very important signal to the people of Bulgaria and a reminder that they are not forgotten at a time when ten other countries will have just acceded to the European Union. This means that the Commission and Council must rapidly finalise the EU position on the four remaining chapters: competition, regional policy, agriculture and budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft financial package proposed by the Commission on 10 February – some EUR 4.2 billion over three years – provides an excellent basis for the final phase of negotiations. Indeed, measured as a percentage of per capita GDP, this package can be seen as among the most generous that has been offered to an accession country, although this needs to be kept in perspective as Bulgarian per capita GDP is low.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial package may require adaptation in the light of changes to the overall financial perspective and I am reassured by the Commission's recognition that cooperation with Parliament, as one arm of the Union's budgetary authority, will therefore need to be intensified over the next three years. Bulgaria's accession process has so far been characterised by commitment and good faith on all sides and a shared determination to meet the many deadlines involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The macro-economic indicators have been very positive in Bulgaria. We have seen GDP growing by almost 5%, the rate of inflation dropping significantly, a surge in foreign investment and a major cut in unemployment levels. It will take time for the effects of these improvements to be felt by large sections of the population, particularly in the regions outside of Sofia, but we can expect the upswing to gather pace as accession approaches and confidence in Bulgaria's political and economic transformation grows.</p>
<p class="contents">Confidence is a key factor. It is most important, therefore, that Bulgaria's progress and accession should not in any way be linked to or held back by any other candidate country. As my report clearly states, Bulgaria is part of the current inclusive and irreversible enlargement process that is based on the own merits principle. I was pleased to hear Mr Verheugen state in Parliament last November, and I quote: 'The one country, Bulgaria, should not wait for the other, Romania. And we have also guaranteed this'. I would be grateful for the Commissioner's confirmation of this position. The accession process for other candidate countries, or indeed the addition of new countries to the accession process, should not impact on the timetable for Bulgaria and the assessment of its progress.</p>
<p class="contents">But in spite of this progress, many specific problems still have to be overcome in Bulgaria. These are very much in the hands of the Bulgarian authorities, although we can help. To put this in context, we know that many of the countries acceding to the EU in May also still have many problems to overcome. But in Bulgaria's case, I have highlighted in particular the Roma question. I do not want to get this out of perspective. Many other sections of Bulgarian society face difficulties, but the Roma question is important, not just for the stability and prosperity of Bulgaria, but also because of its potential impact on other countries in the European Union, not least my own, when Bulgaria achieves full membership.</p>
<p class="contents">The full and proper integration of the Roma into mainstream society in Bulgaria requires changes on both sides. The Roma need understanding and massive resources deployed in order to provide them with the essentials of life, education and job opportunities, but equally they have to change their lifestyle. There has to be a willingness to integrate and to adopt family practices and other social attitudes that give confidence to the wider Bulgarian population.</p>
<p class="contents">It is troubling that a large proportion of children in care or in institutions in Bulgaria come from the Roma community. There is something fundamentally wrong with this and it needs to be addressed with real determination. Many of the care homes and schools are in a bad state and my own constituents in Chelmsford provide admirable support for one particular school at Berkovitsa.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as amendments to my report are concerned, I do not support either of the two amendments that have been tabled. The assertion that Bulgaria is the only accession country that lacks implementation mechanisms in the field of gender equality is frankly not correct. The second amendment, regarding energy policy, has been adequately covered in the compromise language already in the text of my report. I do not think the amendments are necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I congratulate Bulgaria and thank the Commission and the Council for all the support they have given to Bulgaria's accession process. Let us make sure that it remains on track for accession in 2007.</p>

The resolution clearly points out that much remains to be done in Romania for political criteria to be adhered to in full. The functioning of Parliament, the relationship with the executive and the judicial system and the overall functioning of the rule of law: all are questioned. This point involves many issues such as corruption, which is widespread in Romania, involving administrative officials, judges, politicians and in its sum undermines the functioning application of the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">This must be the reason why corruption in the area of international adoptions has continually been circumvented by special adoption commissions. The moratorium has been ignored and set aside, meaning that many children, even babies, identified as suitable for adoption by the government, signed off by the prime minister, have in reality been taken from suitable family settings by the authorities, against their will and disregarding the wishes of their foster families whose interest in adopting those same children was denied. I have written evidence of many of these cases and stand happy to show them to anyone who wishes to see them.</p>
<p class="contents">In contrast, my resolution also deals with the achievements of Romania in the economic field, where many structural reforms have been undertaken that we praise. But these must also and will need to be pursued most vigorously in the coming months and years. But we hope too that the Romanian Government will give greater prominence to the needs to the lower strata of society in Romania. In many areas simple, civilisational assets such as running water and sewage disposal systems are missing.</p>
<p class="contents">Surely the preaccession process must also benefit the many millions of poverty stricken citizens. We in the European Parliament want to help them not just to survive, but to thrive. Only if the Romanian Government and its administration are willing to forego corruption in all its insidious forms can poverty ever be conquered in Romania. Honesty has not only a commercial value. Honesty provides the essential bond of trust between the state and citizen upon which democracy relies.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also points out the developments in the area of developing and implementing the <span class="italic">acquis</span>, where much still needs to be done to build up the administrative and judicial capacity not only to have laws on paper and in Parliament, but to ensure that they are implemented in such a way that they can play a real and positive role in the lives of citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">This report as it stands was passed with unanimity in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy with no abstentions. This exceptional consensus across all parties regarding the main thrust of the report has already had a positive impact in Romania. The situation has changed, however. Already there has been root and branch reform of government with many new ministerial positions and responsibilities. Tomorrow I understand there will be a new children's law.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand there is some hesitation and a little confusion among our Socialist colleagues – due to the swiftness of the changes in the situation in Romania – on how to vote. As the vote is now likely to be held tomorrow, I urge the PSE Group to have a new exchange of views on this so that I can fulfil my task as rapporteur and ensure that they have the fullest and most up-to-date information.</p>
<p class="contents">After the vote, I will be calling upon the Commission to report back to Parliament on how the Commissioner's team will now proceed. I believe that such a report must come back to this Parliament before we rise for the European elections in May. I will also call upon the Council to accept the reality of Parliament's clear and unequivocal position. Council cannot simply continue along the old line that all is well in Romania and that entry in 2007 is the done deal that we have been told it is since Rome last year.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not so. In the United Kingdom, the Parliament of which I also had the honour to be a member, is omnipotent and omnicompetent. I have no doubt that other national parliaments of EU Member States hold the same responsibilities. The European people have the final say. We all want Romania to join the European Union, but not at a price that is too high for the European citizens to pay.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the European Parliament is a true friend of Romania. This strongly worded report has been compiled by Members of the European Parliament across the political divide, from all Member States and with Romania's best interests in our hearts. Bucharest must act on the report's recommendations if Romania is to succeed in membership of the European Union. I hope and I believe that it will do just that.</p>

I would also like to thank Mr Van Orden for his insightful report on Bulgaria, and Baroness Nicholson for her thorough and honest report on Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a great honour for me to participate, on behalf of the Council, in your debate on enlargement today. For many years, I lectured students in University College, Dublin, on the European Union and sought to impress upon them how remarkable our Union is. We are now on the eve of another remarkable breakthrough.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement represents one of the most exciting and positive developments, not just in the history of the European Union but in European history as a whole. The ideal of a united, peaceful Europe is behind every effort at European integration over the past fifty years and this enlargement plays a significant part in making that peace a reality. In less than two months, the Union will welcome ten new Member States. For many years enlargement has been a mere aspiration; soon it will be realised. The European Union is rectifying a past wrong: the artificial division of Europe, which lasted for far too long after two appallingly disastrous world wars.</p>
<p class="contents">As presidency, Ireland will be privileged to welcome the new Member States on behalf of the Union on 1 May. We look forward greatly to this day, which will be celebrated around Europe and which we in Ireland will celebrate throughout the country as a special 'Day of Welcomes' for our new partners.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Member States have come through a long and difficult process to get where they are today. It is an exciting moment for them and for us. They have spent many years and made great efforts preparing for membership; the reform of their economic and political systems has been – to put it mildly – highly impressive. The countries of Central and Eastern Europe have very rapidly established stable democracies and functioning market systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The deep reforms carried out were monitored and reviewed closely by the Commission in its regular reports throughout the period of negotiations and most recently in its monitoring reports. The Commission’s comprehensive monitoring reports, published last November, illustrate clearly the huge amount of work done in the new Member States. I wish to congratulate the Commission. In particular I want to congratulate Commissioner Verheugen for his excellent work, extraordinary dedication and excellent management of the whole process.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">More importantly, I want to compliment the new Member States for their efforts. However, while recognising that there have been many achievements to date, it is important not to become complacent. We encourage newly acceding states to continue their efforts for the final two months until accession: now is not a time to rest on their oars. We ask them to concentrate particularly on the areas identified by the Commission as requiring urgent attention and on the effective implementation and enforcement of measures already adopted. It goes without saying that the more work done now, the quicker the newly acceding Member States can benefit fully from membership. We are confident that any difficulties can and will be overcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Accession contains a number of safeguard clauses designed to protect the Union from unforeseen disturbances arising as a result of accession. In addition, other measures are available to the Commission to protect the internal market, if necessary. The smooth and effective integration of the new Member States is one of the highest priorities of the Irish presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">The hard work of the new Member States has been recognised, not only by the Commission in its regular and monitoring reports, but also by the excellent report drawn up by Mr Brok. The enlargement has been described as the best-prepared enlargement ever and I think that is a fair description of what has been done.</p>
<p class="contents">Already the newly acceding Member States are sitting around the Council table and in Parliament. They participated fully, actively and very constructively in the work of the European Convention and in the ensuing Intergovernmental Conference on the Constitutional Treaty. The new Member States are already making valuable input to all aspects of the Union’s business and from 1 May, they will have full voting rights as well and will contribute fully to the formation of the Union’s policies. I believe they will make a remarkable impact on the way we do our business.</p>
<p class="contents">Support among the new Member States for accession was demonstrated by the referenda which were held in nine of the ten countries throughout 2003. In addition, the process of ratification of the Treaty of Accession has seen the parliaments of many current Member States express strong support for enlargement. It is important to underline that enlargement is good not only for the newly acceding Member States but – as Mr Brok reminded us – it is also good for the present Member States. The Union as a whole stands to benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the process of enlargement does not end on 1 May. As we have been reminded, Bulgaria and Romania are both advanced in negotiations. I listened carefully to Mr Van Orden's report on Bulgaria, having met with Meglena Kuneva last week to discuss the position. I was also very interested to hear Baroness Nicholson's very frank and honest report. Last December, the European Council set out a very clear timeframe for the conclusion of negotiations in 2004 with both countries, subject of course to their individual state of readiness, with a view to their accession in January 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the key issues remaining to be agreed among Member States is the financial framework for accession of the two states. Since the Commission published its draft financial package in February, intensive negotiations have been underway to secure agreement among Member States, which the presidency is endeavouring to obtain by the March session of the General Affairs and External Relations Council. Reaching agreement on the financial package will permit the Union to carry forward the negotiations in the remaining finance-related chapters with both countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish presidency is striving to advance progress in accession negotiations to the greatest degree possible. The presidency will ensure that negotiations with both countries are governed by the same principles that guided negotiations with the ten new Member States, notably that of their own individual merits. It is worth recalling that Bulgaria and Romania are part of an irreversible inclusive enlargement process. The pace of negotiations will continue to be determined by progress on the ground and we urge Bulgaria and Romania to ensure full implementation of commitments undertaken to date.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union will continue to monitor very closely the performance of both countries and has noted carefully the views of Parliament, as expressed in particular in the resolutions under consideration today.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, this enlargement is one of the most remarkable achievements of the Union to date. On behalf of the presidency of the Council, I wish to thank Parliament, and you the Members of Parliament, for the very positive and constructive approach taken since the very beginning of the process. We believe that the Union and its citizens stand to benefit greatly from this exciting endeavour.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a remarkable moment, a defining moment in the history of Europe, and one in which we can all take considerable satisfaction.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Verheugen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, this is probably the last big debate of this Parliament on what is a really great and historic project, and for my part I would like to take the opportunity to thank your House most sincerely for its cooperation on this project, in particular the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, its chairman Mr Brok and the rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen what we can achieve – even with so great and difficult a task – when the institutions of the European Union have a clear common objective and when they are determined to work together to achieve it. I will not hide my great satisfaction at the fact that ten new Members will be acceding on 1 May and that we have completed this difficult process, but I cannot deny either that my satisfaction is mixed with a measure of concern.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot overlook the fact that a very broad debate on this enlargement is only now getting under way in the Member States – far too late, I think. For many years, I have repeatedly said in this House that this debate must be conducted in the Member States in order to inform people and take them along this road with us. Only now, when it is about to happen, has it made the European media headlines and become a number one issue for the European public. No one in this House will be surprised – I am not – that all the fears, the concerns and the feelings of uncertainty that we have known about for years and have tried to deal with by providing people with information are now surfacing again.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me be very clear about this: the political elites in the Member States ought to have done more to make public opinion in the Member States understand this great historic task. I am saying this now quite deliberately and also with some bitterness because we really have pointed out often enough how necessary it is. There is still time. The message we have to get across to people is quite clear. Yes, this enlargement will create problems. This enlargement will force us to make adjustments. A lot of things will change completely from what we were used to. There was no sensible alternative, however. We had to do it. We had to accept our historic responsibility of shaping the great change in Europe in such a way politically that it will lead to greater peace, security and prosperity for the people.</p>
<p class="contents">The message must be that this enlargement will not create problems but that it is the only way to solve the problems caused by the great changes that took place in Europe 14 or 15 years ago. Let me say this once again at the beginning of this debate because I really am convinced that the democratic quality of this process depends on Europe’s citizens understanding it and sharing the objective.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as the state of preparedness of the ten countries that will be acceding on 1 May is concerned, ladies and gentlemen, we have kept you informed of the results of our monitoring. I informed the Heads of Government of the ten countries of the results of that monitoring last November and since then we have been working closely with those countries to solve these problems. There have now been further consultations with all ten countries in which we took stock. We found that progress has been made in all areas, in some cases remarkable progress. We are now receiving further information on further progress every day, and I therefore find a very positive trend over all as regards completion of the outstanding tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to hide the fact, however, that there are still problems in a few areas. That is true in particular for the creation of the necessary conditions for the payment of agricultural subsidies. Our system is obviously very complicated. Perhaps we could give some thought to whether the problem really is that the ten new Member States are not intelligent enough or not energetic enough to solve the problem, or whether it is perhaps rather that the system has now become so complicated that a country that has not grown up with it is unable to satisfy our requirements. I have come to have great doubts as to where the problem really lies, whether it is only with the future Member States or whether it is not also for a large part on our side.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Another problematic issue remaining in most countries is food safety, the modernisation of food-processing establishments and their supervision for the protection of public health. My fellow-Commissioner Mr Byrne is in constant close contact with the relevant ministers. Here again I want to make it absolutely clear that the Commission guarantees there will be no compromises on food safety. Only products that meet our standards will come on to the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will use the instruments it has available to solve outstanding problems realistically and responsibly. We are making preparations. I cannot yet tell you whether safeguards will have to be applied or not. The time for such a decision has not yet come. As I said, if it should be necessary we will do it realistically and responsibly and keep you informed.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now say a word about something that is particularly on the minds of all of us these days, namely Cyprus. If this question could still be solved before 1 May, then we would be fully justified in saying that enlargement not only prevents crises but that it also resolves crises and conflicts. That would be an incredibly important signal for the whole region.</p>
<p class="contents">We can say that it was the European Union that got the peace process moving again and enabled the UN Secretary-General to call renewed talks. I was in Cyprus for the start of the talks on 19 February and had good discussions with the UN and the leaders of the two communities. Since then, there have been intensive political and technical contacts. The Commission has said from the outset that it now considers the Cyprus talks a top priority and we have therefore done all in our power to support the peace process. Commission experts are assisting the United Nations team in Cyprus. I have done everything the UN has asked. Whenever extra help was asked for, we always gave it right away. The technical level talks in Cyprus are going very well as a result, and we have also at long last begun to organise content-wise preparations for possible accession with the Turkish community. Late, I have to say, but the responsibility for that rests with Mr Denktash.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now preparing the necessary legal instruments for the accession of a united Cyprus. We will need regulations for the gradual introduction of the <span class="italic">acquis</span> in the north of the island. The use of Turkish as a new official language will require preparations, and we will not be able to get everything done by 1 May. We will therefore have to provide transitional periods in a number of areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say once again that we are in a position to transfer the results of the Cyprus talks into Community law provided those results do not run counter to the principles on which the European Union is founded, namely democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We are of course also setting conditions, and I will reiterate them: We need a new Cyprus that speaks with one voice. We need a new Cyprus that is capable of acting in international fora at all times and does not carry the risk of blocking them. We also need a new Cyprus whose central structures are strong enough to implement and enforce all its international obligations, including Community law. For us, these conditions are absolutely essential.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We are willing to convene an international donors’ conference to help pay the costs of unification, and I urgently call on the two communities, the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots, to take advantage of this unique opportunity and to give a signal of willingness for peace and reconciliation in this part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to say something about Romania and Bulgaria. We will do all we can to assist the Presidency in continuing negotiations with the same tempo and the same quality and in bringing them to a conclusion within the proposed timetable. We have put the proposal for the common financial package for Bulgaria and Romania on the table. Discussions so far show that the Commission proposal has been well received over all. In the light of the financial package for the ten, the financial package for Bulgaria and Romania is fair, balanced and realistic. We shall present the concrete proposals for the negotiating positions in April.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as Bulgaria is concerned, I agree with the assessment made by the rapporteur, Mr Van Orden, and would like to say for my part, too, that remarkable progress has been made. The country still has further efforts to make, especially in strengthening administrative and judicial capacities. We are concentrating on these areas in our cooperation with Bulgaria.</p>
<p class="contents">Romania can also count on our assistance and solidarity. I have followed your debate very attentively and I admire the seriousness with which Parliament is working on the problems in Romania. I believe you have now struck a balance, which means that the report neither paints too rosy a picture nor calls into doubt the European Union’s political commitment to Romanian accession. That is good, because Romania needs encouragement, but it also needs a very clear answer to the question of what is still to be done. The Commission agrees with the rapporteur about the areas in which further efforts are required. These are administrative reform, reform of the legal system and preventing corruption, and I want to make it very clear that when it comes to fighting corruption the political system must be included. It is not enough to put petty officials on trial; their superiors must be in the dock as well. Romania also needs to be more convincing in its handling of European money and, before that, to prepare its negotiating positions better.</p>
<p class="contents">Baroness Nicholson raised the subject of adoption. I want to make the Commission’s position on this clear again. Our policy is geared clearly and unequivocally to the welfare of the child. That is the opposite of a policy that serves the interests of families in all possible countries that are looking for children to adopt. This difference is crucial. Anyone whose focus is not the welfare of the child but the interests of families that are seeking to adopt and the non-governmental organisations that represent their interests is creating a market, and anyone creating a market can expect problems in Romania. That is why the Commission insists that there must be a moratorium on international adoptions until legislation is in force that is fully up to international standards on child protection and until administrative structures are in place to ensure that such legislation is enforced.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, Parliament and the Member States still share the common objective of concluding negotiations in 2004, with accession in 2007. I am sure we will all do everything we can to help Romania and Bulgaria in this. The key to success, however, lies in Sofia and even more in Bucharest.</p>

I share that concern, but I would like to ask what the alternative would be. The alternative – and we must tell people that – would be continuing lack of freedom, the continuation of a totalitarian regime. That is why we should be glad and grateful that the nations of Central Europe – and of course Cyprus and Malta – are joining our union of values under different circumstances, on the basis of human rights, democracy, the rule of law and the market economy. We wish the nations of Central Europe, Malta and Cyprus a warm welcome. It is an occasion for joy. Our group and the entire Parliament have always supported it.</p>
<p class="contents">We will be having the first free elections in Europe. In the accession countries, our political friends and the people there refer to these European elections as Europe’s first free elections. That is why we must reject the call, from the prime minister of one of the accession countries, for there to be a single list. No, ladies and gentlemen; elections are a political competition and we should be glad that such competition is now possible in the countries of Central Europe, too.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The enlargement of the European Union is, however, not just a material question. In essence, it is a question of values, a spiritual question. We should also be saying to our new partners in Central Europe, Malta and Cyprus: do not ask what you can get out of the European Union, but let us all in the present and future European Union ask ourselves what we can do for Europe together to make this Europe strong, to make this Europe democratic and to make this Europe carry weight in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I have great admiration for what the accession countries have already achieved. After more than 50 years of communism, these nations have had to make a tremendous effort. There is still a lot to be done, however. Commissioner Verheugen, Mr Brok and the other rapporteurs have already drawn our attention to that.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we will do it, however. We should put across to the people of the European Union that our experience with enlargement when Spain and Portugal joined shows that in the end everyone will gain, materially and economically too. Tremendous challenges remain in the area of internal security.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just been talking to an expert on internal security from Europol. Of course we must secure the external borders. But that expert explained to me that the drugs mafia, which is already making trouble in the European Union, will also expand its activities to the accession countries. That means we must strengthen Europol and police cooperation as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">One final remark. Commissioner, you and this Commission still have to give an assessment of Turkey. Opinions in our Group differ over whether Turkey should become a member or not. I will not go into that now. However, we expect the Commission, we expect you, to make your assessment on the basis of the Copenhagen criteria and not to make a politically opportunistic recommendation, but to comply with the law. The Commission is bound to do so as guardian of the Treaties, and we will judge you by that yardstick. We will meet and discuss this matter again.</p>

<p class="contents">I have always argued that this enlargement is going to make or break the European Union. If we handle it well, it will greatly strengthen the Union. A recent report by the economists Ernst &amp; Young in the United Kingdom showed the benefits the United Kingdom would receive from enlargement. However, if it is handled badly, it will seriously damage the Union. Thus there is still a lot at stake in making sure that we get it right. That is why it is so crucial for the applicant countries to fully meet the standards required because, if they do not, we run the risk of having a backlash in public opinion not only in the 15 but also in the 10.</p>
<p class="contents">We still need greater emphasis – as Mr Brok stated in the report – on implementation and enforcement. We must have proper transparency on state aid, competition policy and public procurement because, if enlargement is to work, the business community and trade unions have to be convinced that there will be fair play. We must not relax our drive against corruption. Corruption undermines economic progress. The EU country defined by Transparency International as being the least corrupt is Finland. The EU country with the most successful economy is Finland. The two things are closely related. The culture of the brown envelope passing between ministers and senior officials has no part to play in a modern, dynamic economy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the candidate countries also have to realise that by joining the European Union they are committing themselves to the standards of the European Union, such as democracy and human rights. That is why I was so horrified to see in Lithuania that the leading daily newspaper <span class="italic">Respublika</span> has been publishing crude anti-Semitic and homophobic articles, the first of which, on 20 February, contained a cartoon on the front page which is straight out of the Nazi propaganda of the 1930s. Such sentiments have no place in the European Union: racism and xenophobia are cancers that destroy our society. They have done so in the past and will do so again if we drop our guard. We completely condemn these articles. I regret the time it took for the Lithuanian media and authorities to take action and to respond. I hope the Council and the Commission also condemn those articles.</p>
<p class="contents">We must recognise the difficulties that some applicant countries have faced and that they have made enormous progress in a very short period of time. That is why we have always had a very balanced approach and recognised the efforts that the candidate countries have made.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I regret the tone of the original Nicholson report on Romania. We have always said that each country should be judged on its merits and has to meet the standards or we will vote not to admit them. We have never said the negotiations should be suspended in the middle of a process. We know that there are serious problems Romania has to address. We know that past governments did not treat these negotiations seriously, but the current government does and it is making major efforts to catch up, as Baroness Nicholson herself has admitted. Thus our message should be to encourage Romania to intensify its efforts, not to try to pull the rug from underneath its feet at this crucial moment. I fear, given some of the misleading information in the original report, that party politics have more of a role to play than objectivity.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Mixed reactions)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The new countries have a right to criticise the European Union. We have been very niggardly in relation to the free movement of labour. I am appalled at the dreadful populist campaign – which has often been racist – run by sections of the European press. I am even more appalled at certain politicians who have jumped on the bandwagon, including, I am ashamed to say, the British Conservative Party, which said it supported enlargement, has never raised this issue in the past and then started to dance to the tune of its tabloid masters. I hope that when reality – rather than mythology – rears it head after 1 May, Member States can start to ease these restrictions.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that on 1 May we will enter into a brave new world of solidarity and cooperation, not of recriminations and national tensions. We need these countries to work together on economic reform to boost jobs. We need these countries to work together with us to stop multinational crime. We need these countries to work with us to deal with the problem of people trafficking – the 21st century version of slavery. Together we can strengthen Europe. If we can do that, we will have a lot to celebrate. That is what we should be aiming for on 1 May.</p>

In fifty days, Europe will become a united continent, and almost half a billion people will join together to work towards a better and fairer world and to defend European values and together solve common problems: pollution, cross-border crime and, in particular, trafficking in human beings, which everyone has mentioned. EU enlargement is a fantastic example of what we can achieve when we have a clear goal and a clear strategy in the EU. With EU membership as a tempting goal, and hard work on their part, the former communist dictatorships have now become fully functioning democracies and market economies. Potential membership has also contributed to the work of reform in Turkey and to the possibility of perhaps finally solving the Cyprus problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, there remain a great many problems, which Elmar Brok also pointed out in his excellent report. The EU will change dramatically in the next few years, and the main task during the next term of office will be to make this enlarged Europe work. It is therefore extremely important that the Convention’s proposal is actually carried out so that the EU can take decisions and function democratically.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is always particularly concerned about minority rights, which is why we are greatly worried by the unrest within the Roma group in Slovakia. The cuts in social benefits hit this group particularly hard, and we hope that the Commission can continue to monitor the Roma situation in both the old and the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I too regret that we are building walls between ourselves and the new Member States in the shape of various types of transitional rules. One country after another is now introducing more or less discriminatory regulations based on fears that seem completely unfounded and are eagerly encouraged by the press in certain countries. Instead of hindering freedom of movement, we should welcome the fact that it embraces more and more people.</p>

Nor have I heard so good and precise a description of our need to find a solution to our problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the lack of popular involvement and the lack of commitment on the part of the political elite is one of the reasons why we now see more and more Member States choosing to introduce restrictions in relation to workers from the new Member States. That is something I deeply regret. I think it is the wrong signal to send to our new friends and colleagues from Eastern and Central Europe. I am tired of people typically proceeding on the basis of populism and of unreliable figures and information about the way things really are.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that, in the course of enlargement, many forces have been deployed in monitoring the human rights situations in the candidate countries, and I think that this is one of those areas in which we cannot allow ourselves to relax, either now or after 1 May. We need constantly to monitor the situation. We know that there are problems for the Russian minority in Latvia. We know that the Roma have problems in many of the candidate countries, and we also know that they have problems too in the present Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">My recommendation is that we do what we once did in the Council of Europe when that institution admitted quite a lot of new Member States, namely introduce permanent monitoring of democracy, human rights and minority rights, and not only in the new countries but in all the EU Member States. That is what we need to do, Mr President. It will be an important task to persist in monitoring these areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first is that the present discussion on Romania is, in my view, the best possible barometer of the current enlargement round. Indeed, what is evident from this discussion is that the main problems in the new Member States are not related to the fisheries chapter or the transport chapter, important and interesting though these may be. The most persistent problems in the new Member States have to do with the functioning of the constitutional state, the independence of the judiciary and freedom of expression of opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to my second reason, provided that other Members allow me to carry on, Mr President, for noise levels are rather high at the moment. The discussion on Romania is also of major importance for future enlargement rounds including Turkey and the Balkans, and for the reason that we cannot very well insist in Ankara and Zagreb on an improvement of human rights or the rights of minorities if, at the same time, we allow the situation in Bucharest to remain at a standstill and, in fact, to change for the worse in a number of respects.</p>
<p class="contents">So to my third point, which is that the situation in Romania itself remains problematic. To this day, the reform of the constitutional state is in its infancy. To this day, it is impossible for critical journalists to do their jobs. To this day, corruption is an enormous problem right up to the highest political level. In her report, Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne is right to take a critical view of this. To the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would say that advocates of enlargement, even more than its opponents, have a duty to be critical, and they must also remain so. It is encouraging to see, Mr President, that precisely this critical stance is bearing fruit. Over the past few days, the Romanian Government has announced new reforms and accelerated the old ones. The Justice Minister has had to step down because he is held responsible for the stagnation. I would urge the Romanian Government to carry on with the reforms, for if it does not, it may as well forget about joining in 2007. My appeal to NGOs and journalists is to carry on with their critical work and keep us informed. Mr President, the European Union is good at influencing countries by dangling a carrot in front of them, but sometimes an educational rap on the knuckles does wonders too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Who begrudges the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe their personal and national freedom? Their liberation was late in coming; it took until 1989, and our continent will acclaim it on 1 May, the day of the EU's eastward enlargement, of which all those involved are firm advocates, whilst, at the same time, bearing a heavy responsibility. Now that the usefulness of a greatly expanding European Union is the subject of a public debate, politicians in the East and the West need, first of all, to work towards the consolidation and creation of solid constitutional states. This creates a national sense of public responsibility, the very foundation for Europe-wide cooperation. Only a few decades ago, a major authority on Central and Eastern Europe, Mr Hugh Seton-Watson, referred to that region as the sick heart of Europe, for which may the enlarged EU soon show itself to be an effective medicine. This requires a considerable mutual effort, a sincere attending to each other's needs. It is precisely this involvement that I have noticed among grassroots support. My group and I wish to continue on that entirely Christian course. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are still many problems left unsolved. For example, in its recommendation with regard to this report, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has expressed its disquiet at the large-scale corruption in the agricultural sector and at the way in which subsidies will be paid.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem is Cyprus. We are facing the unique situation that part of a future Member State is under the military occupation of a candidate Member State, Turkey. To date, we are uncertain as to whether the entire island will be joining the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Another big question mark is the immigration that may originate in the new Member States. Although most of the present Member States have announced a transitional measure, the question remains of to what extent this will be adhered to. I hope that I am wrong, but the figures used by the Commission lead me to believe that the problem is being grossly underrated, just like the other problems that enlargement will trigger. Most of the new Member States are not yet ready for accession. Everyone knows that, but hardly anyone dares say so out loud. Jacques Delors is one of the few who has said it, and for that he deserves all credit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
