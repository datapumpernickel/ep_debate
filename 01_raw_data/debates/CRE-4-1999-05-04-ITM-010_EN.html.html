<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Liikanen, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. ‐</span> I am in a bit of a difficult position because the audience is more limited here today than it was in the Committee on Budgets yesterday and all the people that are here listened to me yesterday on the same item. So I will be brief.</p>
<p class="contents">With the adoption of the preliminary draft budget for the year 2000 the Commission has launched the budget procedure for the budget authority. But as the question of the new interinstitutional agreement is as yet undecided: it is to be discussed tomorrow and voted on Thursday, and the preliminary draft budget will have to be completed in the autumn. This can be done by means of an amending letter. As the chairman of the Budget Committee mentioned yesterday, in the Budget Committee there is a problem with timing: how to guarantee that both arms of the budget authority can deal properly with the amending letter. That must be discussed in this Commission and with the new President, to find a convenient way.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission envisages a budget for the year 2000 which will require, overall, less commitment of appropriations than the 1999 budget. This is mainly due to a slight decline in agricultural spending and because of the new financial framework for structural funds. The payment rates will, however, grow substantially due to the backlog, in particular for structural funds but also for research and external relations.</p>
<p class="contents">For agriculture, if the interinstitutional agreement is accepted, it means that the new budget structure makes it possible to distinguish clearly between, on the one hand, the traditional market expenditure on income support which will be obligatory and, on the other hand, the new rural development expenditure which would be non‐obligatory expenditure. We must say today that, on the basis of the current estimates, the ceiling on market expenditure adopted in Berlin provides a new and immediately effective element of budget discipline.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to structural expenditure, BDP for the year 2000 is based on the decisions of Berlin. We understand that with certain modifications Parliament is about to follow them. At first glance the budget appears to indicate a radical reduction – 16 % – in commitments from 1999. But the fact is that rebudgeting in 1999 and the transfer of rural structural expenditure to Category I distorts the picture. All things considered, the reduction of structural commitments is more modest, closer to 6 %.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment BDP does not provide for the Community initiative URBAN, but the decisions on this matter will be incorporated into the budget proposal at a later stage in the procedure. The margin for manoeuvre for internal policies is more limited than Agenda 2000 had hoped for but if the interinstitutional agreement is accepted, it will provide a welcome extra breathing space. The Commission has proposed continuing the efforts of recent years to focus the internal policies on growth and employment‐related expenditure, in particular research and technical development, trans‐European networks, education and training, and on the small‐ and medium‐sized enterprises, which has been a parliamentary initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget proposal for 2000 has been prepared in full application of the 1998 agreement on the legal bases. It distinguishes autonomous pilot and preparatory actions and thus provides a reliable base for the decisions of the budgetary authority and for uncontested execution of the 2000 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the external expenditure, there is a marked increase in the total amounts because of the new and reinforced pre‐accession assistance. We must note that the situation in the Balkans may require a substantial addition of financial resources from the Community budget. The institutions have already, for that reason, agreed to review the situation in the light of developments. If necessary there is the possibility of revising the financial perspectives, and that has been declared by the Council also.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, administrative expenditure, which was discussed for Parliament a while ago: given the growth in pension expenditure the ceiling set in Berlin is just about sufficient to finance the <span class="italic">status quo</span> in terms of personnel. This has always been made clear by the Commission. The preliminary draft budget therefore had to postpone the question of possible new staff and its pre‐allocation until the margins which will possibly become available under the new institutional agreement have become clear and until the new Commission has had a chance to define its requirements. Of course all the necessary preparatory work will be done by this Commission. But we find it appropriate that, after the vote of confidence, the new Commission should allocate resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of staff policy will be a key question in the autumn. I agree that the Community institutions require adequate human resources to be able to execute their new tasks properly. There are certainly bottlenecks, in particular in financial management, which will be overcome most quickly with new posts. But still, let us not forget that human resources will always be scarce and measures of redeployment, retraining and flexibility will lose none of their importance for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Further work is required by Parliament, particularly as it debates and votes on Agenda 2000, and by the next Commission and Parliament to complete the Community budget for the year 2000. But today's BDP already gives the first hint that the new financial framework will work for the Union, that a balance has been found between the rigour prevailing throughout Europe and the financial requirements for the key policies of the Union. But very much depends on decisions this week.</p>

Your PDB reflects what you have been able to achieve; it is not entirely to our satisfaction, but we shall not make things difficult for you.</p>
<p class="contents">The exercise is in effect an academic one. You are making a proposal in a context which there is no reason to suppose will be the right one. You quite logically acted on the conclusions reached in Berlin. So if there is an interinstitutional agreement you will have additional margins, and if not, the position will be entirely different. So we have here a text which is more or less academic. You have not sought to hide the fact from us, and we appreciate that.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Category 1 expenditure, the funds are in fact adequate overall, although you are already a little short on sub‐ceiling 1 ‘Organisation of the markets", and you are counting on all this being dealt with by some kind of favourable outturn. But our resources are already limited.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Category 2, there are a number of things which cause us some concern. The reduction in commitments, which you mentioned, seems to us to make sense and we are not worried by that. There is in fact a rebudgeting of earlier commitments which will not happen, since we are at the end of the programme. There will, however, be massive appropriations for payment which we shall have to find. Efforts will be needed to limit, address and settle what we call in French the ‘<span class="italic">RAL</span> ", the balance to be cleared.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to Category 3, internal policies, we are quite frankly unhappy. The proposals you put forward are broadly negative, and we simply see that whatever the scenario adopted, we shall have additional margins.</p>
<p class="contents">The figures for Category 4 are, as you say, totally unrealistic since this is a draft budget which takes no account of Kosovo. And Kosovo will be a factor in our finances. The same applies to Category 5. You cannot plan ahead meaningfully, you have neither the means nor the willingness to do so. You cannot anticipate the administrative reforms which will be carried out in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, this is a starting‐point which will need a good deal of work on our part and yours before it becomes a true budget.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Samland </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">chairman of the Committee on Budgets. – (DE)</span> Madam President, I rise to make just one point, but an important one. It relates to an issue that the Commissioner touched upon rather tangentially. I have in mind the issue of adjusting expenditure in line with a decision that may be taken this week. If we accept the interinstitutional agreement on Thursday, Parliament is then free on the basis of that agreement to implement appropriations from Category 1 to Category 4 at first reading. However, we cannot do this for Category 5, where we need a letter of amendment from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">As I indicated during the discussion with Mr Prodi this afternoon, the present timetable Parliament has set for appointing the new Commission, which involves the Commission being appointed by the earliest in mid‐September, means that there are only two weeks left to submit this letter of amendment. Whatever happens, we ought to have it before the European Parliament's first reading, as otherwise we will be at the mercy of the Council when it comes to making additional appropriations available in Category 5, because if the letter is not submitted until after Parliament's first reading, an amendment will only be permissible if both parts of the budget authority, that is the Council and the Parliament, agree to it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore ask the Commissioner and the officials responsible for this to start work on the preparatory process now. Mr Prodi also gave an undertaking to this effect in the meeting with the committee chairman, so that an appropriate letter of amendment can be presented within this time frame, allowing Parliament to take it at first reading.</p>
