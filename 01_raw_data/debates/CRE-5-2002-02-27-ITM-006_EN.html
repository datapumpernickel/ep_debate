I appeared before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on 7 January, and it is a pleasure for me to be able to present the economic and financial priorities for the six months of the Spanish Presidency, particularly in relation to the Barcelona Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 7 January, when I appeared before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, there have been significant advances on certain aspects, such as the agreements between Parliament, the Commission and the Council, in relation to the harmonisation of financial services. On behalf of the Presidency-in-Office, I would like to thank the parliamentary groups for the efforts they have made, especially the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, to reach an agreement in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">In a little less than two weeks time, the spring European Council will take place under the Spanish Presidency in Barcelona, and I would now like, Mr President, to give details of the main economic issues this Council will deal with. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it is beyond doubt that the launch of the euro, on which a report will be presented to the Barcelona Council, has been a success not only from a monetary and technical point of view but also from a political point of view, as a result of the considerable support it has received from all citizens throughout the European Union, throughout the eurozone, and also the efforts made not only by the European Central Bank and its excellent staff, but also by very important sectors of European society, such as the financial sector and the commercial sector, to make the physical introduction of the euro a success.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, European society owes a debt of gratitude to all those workers and professionals who have contributed to the consumers and families having been able to enter the era of the euro so easily.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is also important to point out, as I did in the meeting of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on 7 January, that the introduction of the euro must be understood as a response, not only of acceptance of the single currency, but also a positive response from the citizens to the processes of European integration and also the processes of economic reform and change. And, in this regard, I believe that the slogan of the Spanish Presidency, ‘more Europe’, is perfectly compatible with the spirit of those millions of European citizens who have accepted from the outset the existence of a single and common currency for us all, or at least for the eurozone. </p>
<p class="contents">One of the characteristics of the beginning of 2002, from an economic point of view, is undoubtedly the slow-down of the European economy, which was more pronounced than initially expected and which saw negative product growths, even in some of the large economies, and the Barcelona Summit is therefore to take place within a context in which the growth potential of the European economy – the capacity of our economies to grow – is becoming one of the citizens’ demands, and the Presidency believes that they must receive a response from government, the European Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, regardless of the speed of the response from the European authorities on some occasions, as in the case of the events of 11 September, what is beyond question from the point of view of economic growth, and given the good macroeconomic foundations of the euro economy, from the point of view of both budgetary stability, which I will refer to later, and from the point of view of inflationary pressures, the Presidency believes that the potential for growth is the key to recovering the confidence of the European citizens in sustainable and stable growth throughout the region.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, it will be the potential for growth in the medium and long term which will lead to an increase in employment and near full employment in the European Union, as indicated in the Bullmann report which is going to be discussed during this same sitting in relation to the spring European Council, that is, the Barcelona Council, together with the Karas report on the economic situation following the attacks of 11 September.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, I believe that the Barcelona Council must highlight certain aspects relating to the coordination of economic policies, but above all, the structural reform aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like very briefly to refer to the coordination of economic policies in EU Member States, particularly those in the eurozone, and indicate that the fundamental instrument for the coordination of these policies, together with the Stability and Growth Pact, are the broad guidelines of economic policy, which, as Parliament well knows, are approved by the Ecofin Council, after being accepted by the European Council in June.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the Presidency believes that the Barcelona European Council will guide Ecofin on the main issues to be included in the broad guidelines of economic policy and these proposals will be included in the Key Issues Paper which the Presidency will communicate to the Barcelona Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In that Presidency document, which is being drawn up at the moment in accordance with the results of the informal debates of Ecofin in February and the next Ecofin of 5 March, with all the countries of the European Union, the Presidency intends to strengthen the coordination of economic policies between the Member States, and particularly in the eurozone, to consolidate the commitments which guarantee budgetary balance, contribute to the sustainability and quality of public finances, and promote, without doubt, the growth potential of the European economy by means of structural reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I will comment on two points in particular: coordination of economic policy and structural reforms. In relation to the coordination of economic policy, there is no doubt that the consolidation of the internal market and greater integration and interdependence amongst the economies of all the Member States points to the need for greater coordination of economic policies throughout the region and particularly in the eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out that the broad guidelines of economic policy are an essential instrument that should be specifically targeted at the eurozone with a greater intensity than on previous occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in relation to the coordination of economic policies, there are requests from various countries, which the Presidency believes to be very well-founded, which point to the need to improve and harmonise European statistics and indicators, both macroeconomic and in relation to structural reform, and also to carry out a periodic analysis of the policy mix in the eurozone, which ensures that the combination of budgetary and monetary policies, with an independent European Central Bank, are consistent with the needs of the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, as I announced on 7 January to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, at the end of January in the Eurogroup there was an initial analysis of the policy mix with a report both by the European Central Bank and by the Commission and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which concluded that, at the present time, the orientation of macroeconomic policies – both monetary and budgetary – in Europe, is suited to the needs of the European economic cycle and the Spanish Presidency intends to hold another specific debate on policy mix before the end of June.</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of the coordination of economic policies, I must mention the need to maintain the principles of macroeconomic stability and reduction of public deficit, which ensure the stability of the eurozone and the whole of the European Union, and, at the same time, guarantee the development of interest rates in the medium and long term which are compatible with a recovery of investment and business confidence, which are essential to the recovery of all the economies of the region.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the political commitment of the European countries to the stability pact and the convergence plans, I would like to repeat that there is currently a commitment from each of the Member States to achieve budgetary balance by the target date of 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we are analysing the sustainability and quality of public finances, analysing the effects of generational pyramids and the ageing of the populations in each of the countries, and the Commission, as Parliament knows, has reiterated to the Member States the need to take measures which ensure the sustainability of public finances.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in these very first few months of the year that the Ecofin Council analyses the Member States’ stability and convergence plans for the current year, that is, for 2002, and that review has taken place in the meetings of January and February; the Commission’s recommendations on each of the convergence and stability plans have been unanimously approved at those meetings. In the case of those countries which were most out of line with their initial forecasts, as a result of the slow-down of the economic cycle in relation to their respective internal demand, there have been clear commitments to comply with the objectives of the stability pact in both the short and the medium term.</p>
<p class="contents">In the chapter on structural reforms, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Barcelona European Council is going to pay particular attention to the liberalisation and opening up of various markets. I would like to refer specifically to three areas which are going to form part of the central nucleus of the Barcelona Council: the reforms of network industries, the liberalisation of the financial and capitals markets and also the reform of the labour markets. I will comment on the three areas in that order, Mr President.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, in relation to the reforms of the network industry, which principally involve transport and energy, there is no doubt that over recent years there have been asymmetrical liberalisations within the European Union, which, in order to update the degree of liberalisation in all the countries of the region, now require movements in the same direction and of the same intensity that will guarantee, on the one hand, the same situation of liberalisation in all European markets, and therefore the absence of disparities which may affect competition throughout the Union, and at the same time also a policy of exchange or of cross-border networks which will allow us to create a genuine market of supply and demand at European level, in relation to both transport and energy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency believes that the Barcelona Council must mark the beginning of a genuine energy market which exceeds the minimum limits laid down in the current directive, and this requires the adoption of ambitious liberalisation timetables in the gas and electricity sectors in order to favour the free choice of provider, especially in the companies market.</p>
<p class="contents">As demonstrated by the experience of the countries which have made most progress in the liberalisation timetables, these measures must be compatible with greater quality of service and with security of supply, in accordance with the public service nature of electricity supply in all the countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, liberalisation must also be accompanied by homogenous instruments for measuring the openness of markets in all the countries of the region and also transparent rules on access to transport networks which ensure the existence of genuine competitiveness for third countries that want to participate in a liberalised domestic market.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the process of liberalisation, as I have said, must be accompanied by quantified objectives for interconnections between the networks of the Member States, and this requires the implementation of the measures contained in the legislative package approved by the Commission on 21 December, including the proposals for the development of infrastructure projects and changes to the system of funding trans-European energy networks.</p>
<p class="contents">From the transport point of view, Mr President, the Presidency believes that the Barcelona Summit should have two objectives: on the one hand, to promote the single sky package for air transport, and on the other, to promote the railways package in order to gradually introduce competition into the provision of services, essentially in relation to the transport of goods.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now refer to the financial markets, Mr President.</p>
<p class="contents">The completion of the process … Mr President ... Is it customary in the European Parliament to offer the speaker water? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not all parliaments are so friendly to the government.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the reform of the capitals and financial services markets, the Presidency believes that completing the process of integrating the European financial system is a fundamental challenge within the general objectives of the Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the efforts to create a genuine financial and capitals market in Europe are concentrated on three important areas: firstly the achievement of a fully integrated share market, that is, of fully integrated European stock exchanges by 2003. Secondly, the achievement of the so-called ‘financial services action plan’ in 2005 and, finally, the achievement of the objectives of the ‘risk capital action plan’, which is essential to the development of the funding of small and medium-sized companies.</p>
<p class="contents">These are, no doubt, ambitious aims, Mr President, which cannot be achieved – and I believe all the European institutions have understood this – without a more rapid and flexible legislative procedure that meets the needs of markets as dynamic as the financial markets, which, furthermore, are fully globalised markets, as we all know.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, and in line with the initiatives taken under the French Presidency, a working group chaired by Mr Lamfalussy was set up and it communicated its recommendations to the European institutions and, after a process of negotiation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament, agreements were reached. I would like once again to congratulate Parliament on its cooperation in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the first directives the Spanish Presidency will try to promote, and which will benefit from the new legislative framework, are those on which there is already a political agreement as a result of the efforts of previous presidencies, and especially the Belgian Presidency, which I would like to acknowledge here.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive on market abuse is essential – as Parliament knows – to guaranteeing the rules of conduct which investment services companies are subject to and which guarantee the protection of all investors on a European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, Parliament is currently studying the directive on financial guarantees, which may be approved under the Spanish Presidency, and to this we must add the regulation on international accounting rules, which will provide a European framework for accounting which will increase the transparency and comparability of information throughout the European financial markets.</p>
<p class="contents">In Barcelona we must also move forward and pay attention to directives which, although they will probably not be adopted during the Spanish Presidency, are going to mean considerable progress and can be adopted under subsequent presidencies; furthermore, the directive on brochures, which is aimed at harmonising the transparency obligations of issuers; secondly, the directive on financial conglomerates, which will provide sensible regulations on a European level, by trying to reduce the so-called systematic risks by means of greater cooperation as established in the Brouwer report;<span class="italic"> </span>thirdly, the directive on pension funds, which is clearly essential in order to achieve a genuine supplementary pension fund market in Europe, which will benefit workers and all citizens, and which requires a suitable balance between their needs, the security of investors, and freedom to diversify the portfolios of these funds within a framework of security; and progress is also being made on other directives which we hope will be given impetus under the Spanish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, I would like to comment on the reform of the European labour market as a priority of the Barcelona Council. There is no doubt that the development of employment in Europe has been satisfactory but not sufficient, as demonstrated by the fact that, at the highest points of the cycle, the European economy maintains structural rates of unemployment, notably greater than those of other regions such as the United States. And furthermore there is no doubt that the labour market’s capacity to adapt to evolutions in the economic cycle ensures quicker recovery of the economies and, therefore, more intense recoveries of employment at times of sustained growth or at the high points in the cycle.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the Presidency believes that more progress must be made on active policies relating to labour markets, focussing on groups which have difficulties accessing the labour market, and also reducing the fiscal burdens relating to employment. There has already been progress in this respect, but we believe that efforts must continue to focus, on the one hand, on measures on work opportunities such as those based on a review of the Luxembourg process, so that we may have a better system of incentives in relation to work creation. With regard to the demand for work, we must promote work-seeking by the unemployed, by means of policies which make it absolutely clear that it is better from both an individual and a collective point of view to work than to be receiving benefit, both in terms of personal development and the financial situation of everybody, and also to promote schemes for extending the retirement age in all our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">There are specific issues such as the increase in the employment of women, special care for women with young children and the reconciliation of their family and work responsibilities, and also introducing greater capacity for European companies to adapt to the evolution of demand, to adapt their costs to European and international demand situations, as well as a system for setting salaries which allows, in addition to the appropriate involvement of social partners, sufficient flexibility and decentralisation which offers companies the margin to adapt to very different geographical and sectorial markets throughout the European economy and the globalised economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mobility is also one of the challenges, not only on a European level, but on a national level, and particularly on a regional level, and here I believe that policies for seeking better practices and comparisons between the policies of each of the countries are essential measures which must be promoted in Barcelona.</p>
<p class="contents">All these issues relating to the labour market must inspire the review of the Luxembourg process and give impetus to the adoption of the necessary structural reforms of the labour markets in each of the countries of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, at the European Council, in addition to these three areas of the financial markets, network industries and the labour market, the Presidency is going to incorporate, for the first time, an analysis of the relationship between growth and the environment, or in other words, the need for environmentally sustainable growth, and to this end, it is clear that we must make progress on formulae which guarantee sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make the following comments in relation to the incorporation of the sustainable development strategy at the Barcelona European Council:</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with what was agreed at the United Nations Assembly in Rio in 1997, the Gothenburg European Council added a third environmental dimension to the process of economic reform, as I have said, and in accordance with these conclusions, the Council took note of the need to draw up a ‘road map’ of an annual nature, with the measures to be taken in the environmental field, within the strategy of sustainable development, and to be taken into account by the Presidency of the Council, in collaboration with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Laeken European Council welcomed the choice of environmental indicators, for the monitoring of the implementation of the sustainable development strategy, and also welcomed the progress made in relation to the European ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">Using the environmental indicators which I have just referred to, which were approved at the Laeken Council on 17 January 2002, a first synthesis report has been presented assessing the process carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Ecofin Council, at its next meeting next week, on 5 March, a report on this issue will be discussed, that is to say a synthesis report which has already been prepared by the Economic Policy Committee and which will allow the Barcelona European Council, as well as successive spring Councils, to continue to guarantee the implementation of the three dimensions of sustainable development. The Barcelona conclusions, together with the Commission’s communication, must allow the Seville European Council at the end of the Spanish Presidency, on 25 and 26 June, to prepare the European Union’s position for the summit on sustainable development which will take place in Johannesburg in September 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I would like to mention the framework for the development of entrepreneurs in Europe, which is another concern that various Councils have demonstrated, and which will be taken into account in Barcelona, especially in relation to the development of a suitable framework for small businesses and new entrepreneurs in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Last weekend, the Presidency held an informal Council of Ministers on small and medium-sized businesses in Aranjuez, in Spain, which came to several conclusions that I would like to communicate to the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the commitment to hold informal Councils on small and medium-sized businesses, before the structural reform summits in the spring, which can communicate specific recommendations to the spring summits in relation to a sector which represents more than 90% of European companies and a considerable proportion of employment in our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, specifically in relation to the Barcelona Summit, the Aranjuez meeting believes that member countries and the Commission must be informed of the need to favour the development framework for European small and medium-sized businesses by means of two methods: firstly, by reducing time limits and administrative costs through the use of new legal instruments which are easier for entrepreneurs to implement and secondly, by using telematic means, and at this first stage of a quicker and less expensive framework in terms of time and costs, to make a detailed analysis of how each of the legislative measures taken affects small and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, legislators and governments must think firstly on a small scale, bearing in mind the effects their legislation and regulatory measures may have on small and medium-sized businesses, and they must do so while taking account of the contacts made with the business organisations for small and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, with regard to priorities of the Spanish Presidency, the Ecofin Council will analyse next week, on 5 March, a priority which responds to a mandate of the Laeken Council, in relation to the need to improve and increase our presence in the development of the countries of the south of the Mediterranean, seeking instruments which take account of costs, but which also allow the countries of the south of the Mediterranean to play a greater role. It is a question of introducing a genuine partnership into the formula for pursuing the economic and social development of these countries. This must focus not only on works and infrastructure, but also on the creation of a genuine fabric of industries and private businesses, a genuine economic civil society in the countries of the south of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">Work is being done in this regard within Ecofin, in the Financial and Economic Committee, together with the European Investment Bank, on proposals which, probably within the field of the European Investment Bank and in cooperation with the Commission, may allow the existence of a development institution in the Mediterranean, with the priority and majority participation of the European institutions, and specifically the European Investment Bank, but also the borrower countries which can cooperate in the design of development programmes, as well as third countries, inside and outside the region, which wish to cooperate with Europe and with the countries of the south of the Mediterranean on this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, the candidate countries will participate in Barcelona and, to this end, the Barcelona European Council has invited not only the Heads of State but also the Economic Ministers, who will hold a meeting on the structural reform of the enlargement countries, together with the European Union’s Economic Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end my speech, Mr President, by thanking the European Parliament for being kind enough to allow the Presidency to participate in this sitting, during which I believe we will not only be able to explain the Presidency’s positions, but also reply to the questions and initiatives which the different parliamentary groups and Members may raise on structural reform in Europe and on the priorities of the Spanish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you very much, Mr President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I will do my best to be very brief, not least because I have already made one speech today in this House and because Mr Rato y Figaredo has already given a detailed explanation of events as regards Lisbon. With any luck, this will also mean that<span class="bold"> </span>I do not need the Presidential glass of water.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The European Council in Barcelona will be the first Council since the euro notes and coins were introduced. The euro has been a great success, it has been welcomed with great enthusiasm and now we must push ahead with related tasks, including the completion of the Lisbon process. This decisive stage which we will be undertaking at Barcelona will take place in a totally different economic climate, for the optimism of Lisbon is no longer present, but the global economic slowdown makes it even more necessary that we complete this strategy. Barcelona will therefore be a milestone along that road.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Rato y Figaredo said, a lot has already been achieved in these first two years, and my genuine thanks go to Parliament for, especially in recent months, we have worked together in perfect harmony and have achieved genuine successes in the fields of telecommunications and financial services and in many social programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">A great deal remains to be done, however: I am thinking of the Community patent, the Galileo project, which seems to have received fresh impetus in the last few hours – and we truly hope that it will be able to make progress – and the new legal framework for public procurement. If we take these decisions, we will certainly be giving a major boost to European development.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there are also many areas of concern: the citizens are wondering whether Europe will have the courage to adopt these measures which are necessary for long-term development, whether it will have the courage to take further steps towards the goal of a more competitive, inclusive society. When I have conversations with citizens and businesses, I hear them expressing grave concerns, for they do not yet see the tangible effects even of the decisions we have already taken, and this is understandable in that we have completed the initial phase of these political decisions but the work is not yet finished. Therefore, it is now up to the Council and to Parliament too, to adopt, without delay, all the legislation, programmes and policies which will complete the Lisbon strategy. We will then, at last, be able to move on to the final stage – the stage of practical implementation – and then the citizens too will understand what we are doing.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the Spring European Council has become a regular event, and this is another good innovation. In spring, we take stock of the economic policies. It is a practical demonstration of the interinstitutional dialogue, and I, like Mr Rato y Figaredo, hope that the Barcelona Summit will deliver tangible progress in terms of stimulating reform, job creation, strengthening cohesion and environmental improvements. And it is precisely the Council which will have to set the priorities in these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Barcelona’s first task must be to confirm the firm commitment to macroeconomic stability based on sound public finances and controlled inflation. We took this line when responding to the questions posed just now and it applies in this context too. This is the basis we need for lasting success, and we will not have wasted the benefits of our hard work or the sacrifices many countries have made in order to be able to enter the eurozone.</p>
<p class="contents">At Barcelona – and this is a sensitive but, I would say, fundamental point of the Commission’s proposals – we will also have to coordinate economic policies more closely, at least within the eurozone. We cannot be content with coordinating monetary policy: quite the opposite, the coordination of monetary policy and the single currency make it imperative that we coordinate macroeconomic policies too; therefore, from this moment onwards, there must be greater transparency, more timely provision of information to the Commission and the other countries and common rules of conduct in the field of monetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the strength of the Lisbon strategy lies in the fact that the measures it contains reinforce one another. Each is important in itself, but together they form the recipe for long-term success.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Barcelona strategy must contain a response to the present economic situation and an assessment of the progress made by the different countries in implementing their various policies, so that we can see which priorities need to be focused on in the coming 12 months. We have to act and invest today to ensure growth and employment throughout the rest of the decade. We will therefore concentrate on employment, economic reform and investing in knowledge, as has already been indicated.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth objective for Barcelona is to take stock of the progress made in the area of sustainable development. We must ensure that sustainable development is at the basis of certain specific decisions we have to take, not least, for instance, when it comes to opening up the energy markets and restructuring the transport sector. Sustainability can also generate growth and create jobs in areas such as clean technologies. This, of course, means that we must provide incentives and resources for this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we expect the European Council to firmly endorse the importance of life sciences and biotechnology: this is an area in which there is no reason why Europe should not lead the world. We have a pool of scientists in both the Member States and the enlargement countries who, with the proper organisation, will soon be able to assume this leading role.</p>
<p class="contents">We also – and this is my last point – need to examine the impact of our policies on the wider world, and I expect the European Council to deliver a major contribution towards preparing for the Johannesburg Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by touching on another subject which will be addressed indirectly but quite extensively at Barcelona, and that is how we should organise our work in the light of the impending enlargement. Indeed, we must launch a dialogue with the candidate countries to identify what they themselves can do to pursue the Lisbon agenda and priorities – with help from the Community, of course. In other words, although the decisions of this summit will, in theory, concern the Member States alone, in practice they will concern the new countries too. We must therefore start off along this common path, this walk together, at Barcelona.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, the candidate countries will be taking part in a European Council working session, during which the discussion will focus on their views on the Lisbon strategy and its implementation. As of 2003, the candidate countries will be included in the structural indicators the Commission uses to assess progress on the Lisbon strategy. They must therefore be actively involved in the Lisbon objectives and working methods. Our strategy must be a help, not an obstacle, to their accession.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I am confident that the Barcelona European Council will be the first of the key milestones before us this year on the road to successful implementation of the Lisbon strategy. Only thus will we be able to build properly on the enthusiasm and heightened public demand for more Europe that we have witnessed at first hand in recent weeks. It is my genuine hope that Barcelona will be a success for the Spanish Presidency but that it will, above all, be a success for the European citizens. A success for the whole of Europe.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to start by welcoming the Commission's presence here in such numbers, with not just President Prodi, but also Vice-President de Palacio and Mrs Reding and Mr Solbes from the Commission itself. I believe – and Mrs Wallström is also present, sitting in the second row; I crave your forbearance for not mentioning you at the outset, but being greeted separately is so much more effective – that this shows the importance we attach to cooperation between the institutions of the Council, the Commission and Parliament, a subject on which I shall make a few concluding remarks.</p>
<p class="contents">What the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission said in Barcelona meets with our entire approval. In your own country, Mr President-in-Office, you and your own policies have been very successful over the past years. You are, though, a natural heir to the tradition of the Lisbon decisions, which are framed in very demanding terms: the most dynamic, most competitive and most sustainable economic area is to come into being. We would all, I think, be the better off for more modest language, as criticism would then be less marked when we fail to act according to these principles and in line with these objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it is clear to us that the Spanish Presidency has been led into a difficult situation here – which is why I do not want to criticise the Presidency too harshly – our group would very much have welcomed it if the Finance Ministers of the EU countries had gone along with the Commission's proposals when what was at issue was the requirement that two EU countries should actually abide by the Stability and Growth Pact. It is, among other things, an institutional problem when those who will be giving out marks at the end of the day who deserve to get bad ones, and when, moreover, these people promise something for 2004, namely, an almost balanced budget, which we already know to be scarcely achievable.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore call for credibility and stability and urge that we should keep to what we agreed in the treaties on the common European currency. Our group stands alongside the Commission, whom I encourage to stick to their stability policy and pursue it consistently, and we would welcome it if the Finance Ministers were to take that on board.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, you were right to speak about small and medium-sized enterprises, and I was glad to hear that an informal Council has been held. I believe that we should, in our economic policy as a whole, give much more attention to small and medium-sized enterprises. The best economic policy would be for us to maintain a moderate tax regime. The more we lift the tax burden from small and medium-sized enterprises and liberate them from bureaucracy as well, the more they will be able to invest and also create jobs. That then benefits the workers, and so it is right to put small and medium-sized enterprises centre stage.</p>
<p class="contents">You were right to speak about the liberalisation of the markets, of the markets in transport, energy, and, I would like to add, postal and financial services. One could get the impression from the use of the expression ‘liberalisation’ that it is something that benefits the income of enterprises. No, ladies and gentlemen, we must say more distinctly that liberalisation means more competition, more competition means reduced prices, and reduced prices benefit precisely those people – that is, consumers – who do not have such high incomes, and that is why it is important that we bring this competition about.</p>
<p class="contents">In order that I do not go over time, this will have to be my last comment. Mr President-in-Office, our group will judge the Spanish Presidency by how it succeeds in reforming the Council. Mr Solana, the Council Secretary-General, will, if I am rightly informed, be submitting proposals in Barcelona for reform of the Council. There is also now a paper by the British Prime Minister and German Chancellor, and Mr Aznar, the President of the Council, has no doubt followed it sympathetically. It is not enough to make public statements, though, if we want to reform the Council; that desire must be communicated to the Permanent Representatives. I get the impression that what is being thought by the Heads of Government has not yet reached the inter-institutional working party set up by the Council, the Commission and Parliament. So I ask you to contribute to the Council's reform of itself, to have it, as a legislature, always sitting in public, and always present here when important debates take place in Parliament. If you achieve that, your Presidency will be counted a success! We want it to be a success, because we want a shared success for Europe. The Commission is, in any case, standing alongside Parliament, and if we take action together, the success will be Europe's, and from the depths of my heart I want some of its lustre to reflect on the Spanish Presidency. By the way, I hope that, next time you visit Parliament, you will at once be given a drink, because we always treat our guests well.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission and the majority of the female representation of the Commission, whose presence we should welcome, ladies and gentlemen, the President-in-Office of the Council began his report with the success of the introduction of the euro, which is a success for our peoples, and which has exceeded any expectations we may have had in any of the European institutions. The President-in-Office of the Council has congratulated the European Central Bank and its staff. I would be grateful if he would expand on his congratulations to the Commission on the work it has done and, in particular, President Prodi and his predecessor in the post of Minister for the Economy, Mr Solbes. I do not say this because I am a fellow countryman, but because of the important work they have done.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, the problem facing us is that the success of the euro demands a response which can only take one form: an active economic policy in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in a new situation. The President-in-Office of the Council has reminded us how the BGEPs, Ecofin and others work; but it has been demonstrated that when faced with problems, things, in the form they were conceived some time ago, do not work well. In this respect, the review relating to the economic evolution of the Member States shows that some, politically, have been hunted hunters. They created a Stability and Growth Pact in order to monitor others and, in the end, they have had to apply the lesson to themselves. But this does not lead me to feel any <span class="italic">Schadenfreude</span>, as the Germans say. The issue is that in the medium term we cannot safeguard the euro with the current economic management structure.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the President-in-Office of the Council mentioned the structural reforms and the policy mix since Lisbon. We see the policy mix as the fight for full employment, social cohesion and sustainable growth, bearing in mind the need for Europe to recover technological leadership through strong investment, above all in human capital. In this respect, the important issue is the composition of this policy mix cocktail<span class="italic">. </span>We believe that it must consist of a harmonious and combined quantity of each of the three elements.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, please allow me to comment on your proposals on liberalisations.</p>
<p class="contents">My group has been committed for many years, and I am thinking of the creation of the single market with its four hundred directives, of the process of structural reforms which has allowed us to create internal markets within the Union. From this point of view, the President-in-Office has spoken firstly about the network industries: energy transport and also, as a network activity, telecommunications. We believe that what we have to do, and we have been doing so for some time, is to make progress on the creation of these markets. What has surprised us, and I would be grateful if the President-in-Office of the Council could explain this to Parliament, is the public statement by the President-in-Office of the Council and President of the Spanish government, and he has not denied it, that, in view of Barcelona, the problem is the confrontation with the Socialist majority, and he mentioned three governments by name, the German, French and Portuguese governments. I do not know what form this confrontation is supposed to take.</p>
<p class="contents">We want organised markets. We do not believe that liberalisation has miraculous effects such as the removal of rules. We believe that what we have to do is establish rules which protect producers and also consumers and citizens. I do not want to go into Spanish matters, but the Minister for the Economy has enough work to do in Spain in order to deal with the problems of the liberalisation of the energy market.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to financial services, I take good note of the fact that the Council values the agreement proposed in the von Wogau report on the so-called Lamfalussy proposal. But I would also like to point out that, while it has allowed us to get out of trouble, it has not resolved our problem. In other words, in terms of democracy, I believe that in the Convention we will have to hold very detailed discussions on the basic legislation and the implementation of the legislation with the possibility of parliamentary control.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, in relation to the liberalisation of the labour market, I believe that many of the things the President-in-Office of the Council has said are reasonable; in other cases he has used so many euphemisms that it is really difficult to know whether the intention is the liberalisation of redundancies or greater flexibility by means of negotiation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express a concern which is felt by our fellow citizens and, if you will allow me, Mr President, I will quote; “we must condemn the errors of unfettered liberalism, with no rules, one of the main problems of which is uncertainty in the workplace and a model of society in which globalisation brings everything down to precariousness, mistrust and individualism without perspectives.” Mr President, this quote is not from Karl Marx but from the Cardinal of Milan, Carlo Maria Martini, who has just retired.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this closely reflects a concern which is widespread amongst our fellow citizens. It is all very well to move ahead with the reform of the labour markets, in a positive fashion, but there is enormous concern about a form of liberalisation which may lead to the disappearance of the rules of the European social model and also a form of liberalisation which replaces public monopolies with private monopolies. In this regard, we hope that the Barcelona Summit is a summit which can bring positive results and does not become a series of pre-electoral confrontations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If the European Union were drawing up an end-of-year report card on the Lisbon process, I suspect that the report would say "must try harder". Over the last year, we have seen some progress on this agenda, in particular the adoption of the telecoms package in Council, the agreement on the European company statute, reduction of the tax burden by three-quarters of 1% of GDP. All of these things help to promote growth and jobs, provided they are consistent with the growth and stability pact, and clearly we need to be shifting the tax burden away from things we want more, like jobs, and onto things that we want less of, like pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">But I am afraid this report card would also show that the Union is failing in too many areas. The Commission communication to the Barcelona European Council speaks of a firm commitment to the growth and stability pact, which will help build confidence. If this is so, it was sadly lacking when the Finance Ministers fudged an early warning decision on Germany and Portugal just recently.</p>
<p class="contents">The rejection of the take-over bids directive is a major setback to competitiveness in the Union and I challenge the other political groups and the Council to join us in speeding through the new Commission proposal under a fast-track procedure, so that we can get it onto the statute book by the end of this year. Another area where we have failed is the failure in Council to adopt a common position on the pensions directive which is essential, not just for a secure retirement for an elderly population, but also for labour market mobility. The European Parliament has done its job. We gave you our first reading opinion in July of last year and we now look to the Spanish Presidency to send us a common position by June of this year, if we are to meet the Commission's target of adoption by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Another area where the schoolteacher would rap the Council over the knuckles is the European patent. If we want to close the innovation gap between Europe and the United States, we need easier and cheaper and faster pan-European patent protection. When it comes to behaviour in class, I am not sure that the Union would score well. I welcome the Commission's decision this afternoon to take the Council to the Court of Justice for an attempt to take away the Commission's powers over state aid. The reason we have state aid rules is to ensure a proper functioning of the single market and we need to abolish barriers to competition and to free trade to allow the Commission to be the policeman, and the Council should frankly be ashamed of challenging the Commission on that.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, our report card would show a pupil which is lacking ambition. If the European Union is to be a star pupil, we need progress on liberalisation of energy and gas markets, on implementation of the financial services action plan, on agreement of a public procurement framework. The process of economic reform is not an end in itself. It is about increasing prosperity of our people and preparing the European Union for enlargement. What message is it that we are sending to applicant states if we are incapable of implementing ourselves the demanding reforms that we are expecting of them?</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to reviewing what happens at Barcelona, we will be judging you by the report card. At the moment, the pupil has to work harder. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We thought, after Gothenburg, that the idea had been established that the Lisbon objective of making Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 was inadequate as it stood, and that it should be supplemented by the goal of making the Union the most ecoefficient economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Evidently, we were wrong. The Spanish Presidency’s commitment to returning to the initial Lisbon philosophy and to confirming the three sacrosanct principles of liberalisation, deregulation and neo-liberal globalisation was matched by the Commission’s marked reluctance to pursue the proposals made last year, despite their<span class="bold"> </span>commendable nature, and by the explicit decision to make the environmental pillar a sort of almost covert addendum to the Barcelona agenda. Indeed, we feel that the Commission communication to the Spring European Council in Barcelona fails to take sufficient account of the environmental factor or of the crucial need for certain changes to the current economic development model. This is serious because it is evidence of the inability of the European institutions to ensure any sort of continuity in their pursuit of priorities established by common agreement, which clearly cannot be reshuffled every six months to suit the political preferences of the Presidency-in-Office.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we feel that the Spanish Presidency’s intention to speed up the process of liberalisation in the most diverse sectors is in direct conflict with the sustainable development strategy. We have many doubts regarding the economic and social model based on deregulation, flexibility and further liberalisation of the internal market, as recently confirmed by Mr Blair and Mr Berlusconi in their joint statement, which, it is no coincidence, made absolutely no reference to sustainable development. We are particularly saddened by this in view of the meeting due to take place in Johannesburg, where all the world’s Heads of State will meet to assess the environmental situation 10 years on from Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we do feel that the Barcelona Summit should be treated as an opportunity to make substantial progress in incorporating environmental issues into the European Union’s policy package and, to this end, it is vital that we assess and review all the sectoral strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to touch briefly on the issue of energy efficiency, Mr President, which is an area that is clearly still extremely problematic. In this context, we feel that it is essential to reiterate the importance of renewable energies. Of course, we are also completely opposed to the increasing pressure, not least from the Spanish Presidency, to reopen the debate on nuclear energy, for it is dangerous and outdated in terms of both acceptance by society and environmental sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, Mr President, we fear that Barcelona will be a wasted opportunity from the point of view of achieving the agreed sustainable development goals. We hope fervently that we are wrong and we look forward to meeting again to review the situation after the Barcelona Summit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It contained two different strategies. The one strategy prioritised cutting-edge technologies, research-based innovations, <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce, the liberalisation of network markets and such like. The second strategy prioritised full employment, social integration and education for all, instead.</p>
<p class="contents">In that way, all the groups could imagine they had won in Lisbon, and everyone could therefore applaud the decisions. Now, however, we see ever more clearly the gulf between the two ways: that which pinned its hopes on the élite and that which put its faith in the ordinary people, often the weaker groups.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, as rapporteur, Mr Bullmann has really endeavoured for as long as possible to preserve unity and the policy of compromise on socio-economic matters. We can nonetheless see how certain Member States and political parties have become increasingly impatient and wish to abandon the route of a compromise policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left view many of the amendments that have come in with great concern. If they were to be adopted tomorrow, the majority of our group would feel compelled to vote against them in the final vote. We should not do that with any pleasure, but there <span class="italic">are</span> limits. One simply cannot just go on compromising. We shall therefore follow the vote, amendment by amendment, before we adopt a position.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to lodge a protest against the fact that almost no account at all has been taken of the candidate countries’ needs and interests in our discussion prior to the Barcelona Summit. There are only a few years left before enlargement, and it is high time that we began to face that reality head on. It is a shame that we have not taken a clearer and more comprehensive view of this state of affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are so many things that remain to be done and so many priorities that were set down at Lisbon, Stockholm, or Cardiff that have yet to be completed, to be achieved and to be reached. We ought to focus more on improving the quality of the proposals that we put forward, ensuring that they respond to the demands and needs of the peoples of Europe, and more importantly, ensure that they lay down a solid foundation for the future development of economic prosperity, of stability and of sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that there is a conflict between economic development and sustainable development, nor that we cannot put in place an aggressive taxation policy to create employment, to ensure that business and industry can have a competitive environment in which to succeed and prosper, and that does not necessarily lead to the detriment of social protection, or of investment in social services like education, health and infrastructure development. I would certainly oppose all measures or any ideas towards harmonisation or coordination of tax policy within the European Union. This is an area that is exclusively within the remit of the Member State governments alone, and it is wrong and has been proven wrong many times, that, to use the simple analogy of previous eras, higher taxation means that you can spend more on social protection.</p>
<p class="contents">That idea has been turned on its head by the economic realities of existing Member States – also by the performances of other Member States, such as in my own country in particular – Ireland, where an aggressive reduction in taxation policy, reducing the cost of labour and the income tax levy and ensuring that business can survive in a harmonious industrial relations environment with the majority of the earnings that the workers are getting going into their pocket and not going into taxation; while at the same time, increasing the levels of protection that are available for those who are most vulnerable within our society and increasing investments in education and health.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a new and different way forward that can succeed and operate for the betterment of the governments and the European Union as a whole, but most importantly for the betterment of the people. What we bring forward from the Lisbon process and the Lisbon summit, most importantly of all, is access to education, training, learning and knowledge. If we do not give the skills to our people in order to take advantage of new employment opportunities that are out there, then we deny them the real human and civil rights of participating fully in society. If anything is to come out of the Barcelona summit, it is a re-endorsement and re-affirmation of the importance of lifelong learning and a knowledge-based society with education and training for all. It is the most important aspect to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, these fine words are not reflected in the plans which are being presented to us under the Spanish Presidency. <span class="italic">Muchas palabras sin hechos</span>. This is why I would call on the Council and Commission to take the Gothenburg environmental agreements seriously, and to translate these into concrete policy plans.</p>
<p class="contents">This means in the first place that an unequivocal system of indicators must be put in place. Strong cohesion between indicators is very important in this respect for the development and assessment of a sustainable environmental policy. This system of indicators must obviously be integrated into the way in which the development of economic and social policy is measured. Secondly, the sustainability impact assessment, as promised by the Commission, is to be developed in the short term.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I should like to ask you to give your attention to the liberalisation of the energy market. Opening up the energy market must not lead to the unwanted formation of monopolies. If there is to be a proper guarantee of the supply of energy, government intervention to ensure supplies must still be possible. Situations such as that in California can still be prevented by intervening in the Commission’s plans in good time.</p>

<p class="contents">Some proposals are, admittedly, based on obvious common sense such as lifelong learning, better coordination of social security systems or the transferability of pension rights. The Commission’s initiative, however, is written from a strange point of view. First of all it states that geographical mobility is five times higher in the United States than in Europe, as if the intention was to render the nations of Europe identical to the United States. This would be a serious misinterpretation. Our real objective, which is what most of our fellow citizens want, is the respect for nations and also for the lifestyle, culture and language to which they are rightfully attached. Let us not switch round the priorities on the sly. To do this would be to take a truly totalitarian approach. The Commission has also slipped calls for a common immigration policy into this action plan which really do not belong there. This is another matter altogether. We should not use this method to force the States to adopt guidelines, of whose existence they are not fully aware. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What, ladies and gentlemen, has been our reaction so far to this discussion? How do we respond to low rates of growth? What is our answer to the resumed increase in the number of unemployed? What, then, are we to expect in definite terms from Barcelona? Lisbon set out ambitious objectives: by 2010, we want to be the most competitive area, make full employment a reality, and establish a society of social partnership which will renew and reform the European social model. Are we to abandon these objectives? Are we to go back to doing things in a small way and contenting ourselves with the status quo? Mr Poettering counselled greater modesty. I support that, for modesty is a respectable human virtue, but, Mr Poettering, we should agree on one thing: let us not confuse modesty with faintheartedness!</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot afford to live in the long term with the under-utilisation of our economic capacity. There is one thing we can afford least of all: when we recall the euphoria and new expectations with which – despite all the scepticism – the citizens of Europe hailed the euro, we cannot afford to disappoint the expectation that the situation we have been placed in would call forth definite action. That is why our report, which we got through both the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs with a three-quarters majority, is written in unmistakable terms. It says ‘yes’ to a pro-active policy, ‘yes’ to Lisbon's integrated political approach and also ‘yes’ to the mobilisation of all resources and to the clearance of every obstacle from the path, to doing everything we can to get back on course for growth.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank most warmly the many fellow MEPs who invested their labour and brought fresh courage to this venture, especially my co-rapporteur, Mr García-Margallo y Marfil of the European People's Party group in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the many shadow rapporteurs in both committees, most of all Thomas Mann in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, all of whom gave a great deal of dedication to our common cause.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, do we expect in real terms from the new Spring Summit in Barcelona? I am firmly convinced, Mr President-in-Office, that the Spring Summits and the preparations for them must be got out of bureaucratic cliques. It is not enough for only the experts to deal with them and for discussions on where and how we are making progress to take place only in small groups. I will tell you why. As we have been reminded in these discussions, there will always be individual Member States which are obstructive for reasons of their own national interests. There will always be Member States in which national elections are being held and in which it seems expedient not to take the next step towards ‘more Europe’, as their slogans put it. I would add that there has already been one or other opposition party that has attempted, in Parliament and out of national egoism, to obstruct Europe's progress. Let me shout it out loud: we have to overcome all this, we have to overcome both these things equally, and get mightily stuck in to the European project together, so that in that way we can go forward together.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us think back to the core of the message we got from Lisbon. What does Lisbon focus on? Lisbon says quite clearly that the strategy is focussed on people, on Europe's citizens. It is all about putting all those who want to participate in Europe's economic and social life – workers, entrepreneurs, trainees, students – in a position to give of their best. That is Lisbon's core strategy; that is what we have to work at, and once that is accepted, it is relatively straightforward to derive from it specific topics and definite demands. We must make decisive improvements to the employment strategy to give everyone the chance to return to the workplace. We must make labour markets flexible but safe, so that workers may make optimum use of their potential with full productivity. Our policies, as has already been said, must set that out clearly, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, which are Europe's principal employers, so that they too may get the green light to participate innovatively in the economy, thereby strengthening Europe as a whole. That must be the message we give out, and that is what we clearly expect of the Spring Summit in Barcelona.</p>

<p class="contents">Although many have returned to their daily business, the attacks on 11 September dealt the Western world a shock, as terrorist acts on this scale had hitherto, in any case, dwelt in the realms of science fiction. At the same time – and this is very important to us – they struck at a crucial stage for the global economy, marked as it was by perceptible slow growth in most of the industrialised countries. It is for this reason that I would like to warn the Member States and enterprises against seeing the events of 11 September as the sole cause of the contraction in economic activity and using it to cloak their own economic and political omissions. Our economic problems were, to a great extent, exacerbated by 11 September. We have to distinguish precisely between the problems that existed even before 11 September and were further aggravated by the attacks, and those which, in contrast, arose only after them. It often, though, seems today as if – thank God – the terrorist attacks' adverse effects on the European economy are being contained, and, as Mr Duisenberg was saying only a few days ago, problems in several areas have now resolved themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The sectors which were disproportionately affected were, and are, the insurance industry, to a slightly lesser extent the tourist industry, above all the conference trade, and the incentives sector. It was fortunate that enhanced economic activity in the internal market in tourism made it possible to regain a great deal of ground. Insurance for large-scale industry, as well as airlines and airports, have been particularly affected. Parliament's report makes a very clear distinction between these two areas.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also glad, and we should say so today, that cooperation between the European Central Bank and the American Federal Reserve, between Mr Greenspan and Mr Duisenberg, has worked. The euro has proved itself in this difficult stage, and the erosion of its value, albeit striking and shocking, has not resulted in a global economic crisis or in a monetary crisis in Europe. At the same time, we have also seen that we are still, and by a long way, insufficiently independent of the American economy, and that our internal market and the economic activity within it is not yet sufficiently independent of global economic developments. This is where we have to begin at home, and so what we ask of the Barcelona Summit is a new offensive on the growth and innovation front, aimed at stimulating growth, investment and employment by means of justifiable optimism about economic activity. We need to look carefully at where there are still hindrances to the internal market. Where are directives not yet being transposed? Where is the implementation of common objectives such as the Action Plan for Financial Services, the Lisbon process or yet others being held up by differences about competences? We must do everything possible to support the establishment and economic structure of small and medium-sized enterprises. My group has therefore tabled an amendment to Mr Bullmann's report, calling on the Commission and the Member States to make it their concern, in the revision of the new capital accords in Basle, to take the structural characteristics of European enterprises into account, help small and medium-sized enterprises and to create the underlying conditions in the new EU capital base framework, so that the process being moved forward in Basle, which is the right one, may not result in adverse consequences, but lead to support for the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that we have to make more use of our right of initiative in order to remove the hindrances to the internal market, become more autonomous and, at the same time, to make fully effective the economic potential that exists in Europe, in line with our objectives. If this happens and we learn the lessons of 11 September and take ourselves seriously, then we will be able to make even better use of the opportunities arising from the new worldview, and of our role in the world in accordance with our supersedence principle, of the environmentally responsible market economy, and perhaps get them more in motion.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jackson (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, this is a debate which is going to take very different routes depending on which committees Members sit on. As a Member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I want to concentrate on environmental issues in the context of Barcelona.</p>
<p class="contents">The first thing is to stress the importance which the Committee on the Environment, and I hope the European Parliament, places on the addition of an environmental dimension to the Lisbon Process of annual assessment of economic growth and social cohesion. Indeed, we were really rather surprised in the Committee on the Environment that the environmental pillar of sustainable development should not be considered of equal importance to the social and economic pillars.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity of expressing thanks on behalf of myself and my colleagues to the European Environment Agency for the work that it has done in relation to the environmental indicators. The director of the Environment Agency, Mr Beltrán, will be retiring soon and we are very grateful for the work that he has done.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that we should not leave these indicators floating in the air while congratulating ourselves on the fact that we have produced them. In the view of the Environment Committee, it is very important that we link their production to clear targets and timetables for the work of the Commission and of the Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would make a domestic point to my colleagues here, namely that we really address the issue of sustainable development better in this Parliament. We ought to organise, for example, an annual debate with an annual assessment of progress in all our committee areas. It is essential to continue to see that environmental considerations are taken into account in other policies. This is something which environment commissioner, Mrs Wallström, has always been very keen on. She faces a tremendous uphill struggle.</p>
<p class="contents">One policy which illustrates the desperate need for environmental considerations to be taken into account within it is fisheries. I represent the south west of England. We have a number of fishing ports and we are currently facing the consequences of a desperate failure to take environmental considerations into account when operating the Common Fisheries Policy. We have exhausted fish stocks. We have fishermen with no fish to catch. We have dead dolphins being washed up on the beaches of Brittany and Cornwall because industrial trawlers are trawling them up in the middle of the channel and then leaving them for dead. That is a very good example of non-sustainable development and the Parliament ought to get involved in doing something about it.</p>
<p class="contents">Sustainable development is going to be very important in the context of enlargement. The likelihood is that the applicant states in eastern and central Europe will want to be like us as soon as possible – heaven help them. That means that they will want more roads, more cars, more transport emissions and so on. More damage to the environment will probably be done and we have to find a way, without being culturally imperialist about it, to ensure that rapid economic development in the countries of eastern and central Europe does not damage the environment, particularly the natural environment, in the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Rio and the Rio Summit is going to bring forth an absolute cascade of words. Whether or not Rio means anything and brings about any concrete results remains to be seen. It is a pity that the Commission has produced its document so late that we cannot give at this point our collective view in the context of Barcelona. That document for Rio contains some very good points, especially the emphasis on providing incentives for environmentally and socially sustainable trade. One thing I would highlight from the position of the Environment Committee is the need for the European Union to sort itself out when it comes to addressing the issue of genetically modified production in the countries of the third world.</p>
<p class="contents">In December in South Africa there was news of a large increase in the acreage in South Africa which is under cultivation for genetically modified products. What is our message to a country like that? Do we say that the more you produce of that, the less you can export to us? Is that going to be a sustainable message to give them when they want to make a living for themselves?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a word on the dreaded Spanish hydrological plan which has moved across the screen of the European Parliament increasingly frequently. It is not a good idea to condemn one Member State for action taken in good faith by a democratically elected government. In this instance, the Spanish government has submitted an environmental impact assessment in relation to the plan and the European Commission is considering it. This is not the point at which we should start condemning Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish hydrological plan will be a very difficult issue for the British Labour Members of the European Parliament to decide how they are going to vote. Even at this moment, Mr Tony Blair is desperately cultivating Mr Aznar as an ally, so the British Labour Members are caught between supporting their Prime Minister and voting against Mrs Roth-Behrendt who has tabled the amendment. That is not an enviable position to be in and I do not envy them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Secondly, as a generic request from both the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I would now ask the Council to involve the European Parliament in both the definition and the monitoring of the strategies established in Barcelona. As Pablo Neruda said, the work we have to do is like the old wine of my country; it is not produced by one man but by many, and not from one plant but from many.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point: the areas of agreement that have been expressed here. I agree with the President-in-Office of the Council that it is absolutely essential to maintain intact and unharmed the dogmas of price stability and budgetary austerity, both for the large countries and for the small ones. We in this Parliament well know how monetary delights and budgetary frugality end: like days of wine and roses. They lead to nothing more than a headache the next morning.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to structural reforms which increase competition, those benches have shown a certain reticence, certain reservations. In the field of the liberalisation of strategic sectors such as transport, electricity, gas, telecommunications or financial services we must not move backwards, even in order to gain momentum.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, I also agree with other speakers that we must attach importance to strategic development factors: lifelong education and support for small businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say a final word to Mrs Jackson. The National Hydrological Plan is not, as the amendment says, an example of unsustainable development. It is a fine example of sustainable development, because it is a question of taking water from where there is a surplus of it to those places where some days we pray for rain and on others we are moving around in boats following a storm. As she has pointed out very correctly, it is a parliamentary decision by a legitimate parliament following a broad discussion and with the almost unanimous support of the National Water Council, in which all the Autonomous Communities, including the Socialist ones, are represented.</p>
<p class="contents">Somebody has been selling false currency in this Parliament. I would ask you to bring them to account and that this false currency be exchanged for a good one, for a genuine one, like the one we now have in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The criticism is levelled over and over again – and, I think, rightly – that we do not engage in debate. The latest consequence of that is that we now have Barcelona, 11 September, and water. I venture to doubt that that will add up to a debate. I will speak, though, on the subject to which my Committee devoted its opinion, the fallout from 11 September. Here are a couple of core theses to add to what Mr Karas, I think quite rightly, had to say: one should not overestimate it as an event, but the experience of its impetus has taught us that we are vulnerable, and the first consequence of 11 September was, and is, that politics has once again become the driving force. It has done so whether you like it or not, as even the leading captains of industry have conceded in the meantime, but we too must be honest about the fact that it is precisely at the European level that politics is failing!</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, 11 September made it even clearer that the greatest peacetime redistribution of assets in human history is jeopardising peace and also taking away market opportunities, and that right across the board, which is leading, through the failure of politics and the new situation in which we are now, to enterprises having demands made on them from the centre. For them, 11 September might well have been an opportunity, if they had gone about it in a credible way, to do what global politics has not been able to do so far, that is, to unreservedly support human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We are discovering something quite independent of 11 September – but, again, taking shape because of that event – the changes in all sectors of the market, with growth in many of them. I am thinking of counter-terrorism, of what we are considering doing in space, and mobility. If neither politics nor business can come up with what they should, consumers have power through their freedom of choice, and they now want enterprises to act in way that is socially, and not only environmentally, responsible. I am therefore very glad that what we got through the Industry Committee, that is, the call to consumers to demonstrate social awareness when buying goods, is now also to be found in the main report. What is missing, though, is the great logical conclusion to this, which we had taken through the Industry Committee, and the absence of which from the main report I regret. We need a global Marshall Plan, without which we will have drawn the wrong conclusions from these events, and without which Barcelona, too, will be ineffective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mann, Thomas (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, in the report for the 2002 Spring Summit, the committees on Employment and Social Affairs and Economic and Monetary Affairs have attempted to point out innovative approaches, and, in many areas, they succeeded. Speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats, I congratulate Mr Udo Bullmann on the work he has done and also on his capacity for dialogue and compromise. What has to be on the agenda in Barcelona? Firstly, reform of the education systems. The PISA study provided something of a salutary shock in Germany. Training and education are at last being given political priority. In order to be moved forward, the pupils need greater demands to be made of them, with all-round education as early as possible, and specialisation as late as possible. It is only through comprehensive knowledge, including languages, that they will have unimpeded access to the labour markets of Europe, which will be open to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, reform of the systems by which people are employed. The total of unemployed people in the EU stands at 13.6 million, and this is a development that is not going to be done away with by giving statistics on the labour market cosmetic treatment. The management of unemployment must give way to perceptibly increased employability through training schemes, market-driven continuing education and connection to the Internet. Simplistically concocted and standardised solutions, such as the reduction of working time across Europe, are of little weight. We need intelligent, discriminating solutions such as more flexible working times, tailored to different sectors and regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, reform of the social partnership. Social dialogue must prove its worth, all the more so when times are hard. The European social model has made a significant contribution to the peace of society and to increased productivity in Europe. As a model, it is flexible and far from rigid, and so it deserves to be extended.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the way in which the social partnership is regulated. Workers have a vested interest in small businesses and trades, which are the backbone of all in the EU's national economies, securing 70% of all jobs and 75% of all apprenticeships. They should be helped to set up and to become innovative. They are in a permanent learning process, through which they achieve a considerable growth in experience. Qualities such as these must not, though, be undermined by the burden of taxes and levies and by the excessive regulation of SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, reform of the States' budgets. Our group insists that the obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact must be adhered to by all the countries in the eurozone without exception. Not even downturns in economic activity may be misused to soften it. It was only the threat of a warning letter that led at last to a consistent austerity policy being at least hinted at in Germany. That all expenditure by the State should be tested applies, though, not only in my own country, but is true of all subsidies. I have great confidence in the Spanish Presidency, which knows the value of our European social model, and how important sustainable economic growth is. Let us trust in its ability to motivate us at the Spring Summit in Barcelona! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Goebbels (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we live in a dangerous world, even if, from the outside, the European Union appears to be a haven of peace. Of course, not everything in Europe is perfect. We must modernise our economic and social structures and we must prepare for the challenges of globalisation in order to seize the opportunities that it presents. In doing so, the Socialists want to protect the European social model. Social justice and social inclusion must remain our constant objectives but this does not prevent us from reforming the employment market. But if flexibility and mobility are a cure-all for full employment, how do you explain the recent rise in unemployment in the United States? In the Silicon Valley, the heart of the new economy, unemployment currently stands at 6%. The workers concerned, who are generally highly qualified, are not moving away. Those who are forced to leave are the 500 000 non-American specialists who had received temporary work permits under a special law. When comparing employment markets, we cannot disregard the fact that there are 2 million Americans in prison, versus 80 000 in Germany or 60 000 in Great Britain. The American model is not always to be commended. To sum up, we accept social reforms but are against ‘social dumping’.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the Lisbon Summit, Barcelona is expected to step up economic reforms. The Socialists do want to achieve a real internal market. Liberalisation, however, does not mean deregulation. Liberalisation calls for better rules and a genuine monitoring of these rules; the Enron affair should be a lesson to us all. By modernising its economy, Europe has a duty to maintain efficient public services for its citizens, particularly the least affluent. At a time when the United States is rediscovering the virtues of public service, Europe must not bring down its own. The Socialists are in favour of macro-economic stability. However, the Stability and Growth Pact must be applied in a non-dogmatic fashion but attention must at the same time be paid to the global situation. We need budgetary discipline, but we need flexibility as well, when the state of the world economy demands this. Today the Americans are showing us their pragmatism in terms of budgetary and fiscal policy. We are also in favour of globalisation, but reject globalisation that has no well-defined and multilaterally accepted rules. We reject globalisation that offers no solidarity, particularly to the developed countries. Yet – and the events of 11 September serve as a cruel reminder of this – the developed countries can only live in peace if they help to resolve conflicts which allow dogmatic agitators throughout the world to convince unemployed young people that they live in a world that has no prospects. It is up to us, Mr President, to show them that a common future is possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Bullmann has done his best, and I thank him for that. My group would nonetheless make reservations about a number of points in the report, certain parts of which are, in our view, pervaded by a fear of liberalisation. For us, there is no contradiction between a free market economy and good social conditions. On the contrary. Experience shows that, in by far the majority of cases, we all benefit as consumers from free competition guaranteeing low prices and good quality.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Barcelona Summit, government leaders will have to adopt positions on a very ambitious plan of action for promoting qualifications and mobility in the EU over the next five years. I think this plan is a really good initiative. Decisions must be made at EU level to make life easier for those who wish to seek new challenges by studying, or taking jobs, in other EU countries. They must be guaranteed social rights. However, there is also a long list of initiatives that the Member States must implement in order to strengthen the various forms of education. This must be done through open coordination, and I think it a splendid idea that we should implement open coordination in this area. I just think it important that it be accompanied by an open debate involving all the parties concerned, for, without such an open debate, there is a democratic deficit in the method of open coordination. I also think we must take care that open coordination is not used out of all proportion and that we do not set common European objectives and quotas for everything under the sun. We should then end up by destroying a good idea, and we are not in any case in favour of open coordination where child care is concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Heads of State and Government will be gauging the progress we have made in meeting the challenge set at Lisbon. Catalonia, however, is expecting a great deal more from Europe than this rather puerile challenge: first of all, it is expecting the European Union to acknowledge Catalonia for what it is, in other words, a major nation. It is also expecting the Union to recognise its ancient language, spoken by almost 8 million people, as an official language and a working language of Parliament. Lastly, it is expecting to be able to fully participate, as the major nation that it is, in the various European bodies. It is hoping for a political Europe where encouraging the spirit of enterprise does not mean discouraging those who crave justice. A Europe where liberalisation does not mean the liquidation of public services. A Europe that is concerned about sustainable development and which is consequently unable to adopt the National Hydrological Plan, in spite of all the pressure that is currently being put upon us to do so. Catalonia is hoping for a Europe that welcomes immigrants and shows solidarity for people who fight against new forms of colonisation.

Consequently, although it acknowledges that we are still seeing worrying levels of poverty and of inequalities in income, the proposals it makes are designed to exert greater pressure for the liberalisation of public markets, the creation of a single market for risk capital by 2003 and of financial services by 2005, the opening up of the electricity market by 2003 and of the gas market by 2004, pushing ahead with a second package of liberalisation in the rail sector and the commitment to reforming the labour markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the document puts forward some positive measures in the social sphere, with the halving of poverty levels by 2010 and the adoption of social inclusion indicators, the fact is that speeding up privatisations, the attempt to make the labour market more flexible and the insistence on applying the rigid criteria of the Stability Pact whilst failing to take account of the diversities of the Member States and the serious social problems that some of them face, will lead to greater poverty and unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">The trust that employers as a class are placing in this Barcelona Summit is telling. Hence our firm opposition to this Commission document. The Bullmann report, which was initially reasonably balanced, was then ruined by moving too close towards the positions put forward by the Commission, another reason why we should oppose it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Through its verbal manoeuvrings, euphemisms and concealments, the EU's Council Presidency is more elegant at overcoming social and global conflicts, but the overall result is the same. It is claimed, for example, that the integrated transport systems programme is of benefit to the environment, but the development of the EU’s motorway network since the Treaty of Maastricht was adopted ten years ago has, alone, led to a 15% increase in traffic-related CO2 emissions, and that is quite independent of the political resolutions to reduce total emissions. There is nothing in the programmes to suggest radical changes. The summit programme represents everything but sustainable development, and that is true not only in an environmental perspective. What, then, of global social and economic sustainability? What Barcelona is mainly about, of course, is consolidating and developing the EU countries’ share of world economic domination. It is not only the environment that is being sacrificed, it is the great majority of the world’s population. The link between the EU’s full-blown capitalism and the political and military oppression it practises is frighteningly clear – only not to the EU élite. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ten years after the Rio do Janeiro Summit, the signs of unsustainability have grown worse and our global response is still inadequate. Against this backdrop, the fact that the Gothenburg Council adopted a European strategy for sustainable development and added an environmental dimension to the Lisbon process was of enormous importance. This decision, as well as the work to save the Kyoto Protocol, clearly demonstrated the European Union’s leadership in the field of the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Barcelona Council, it is crucial that three objectives are fulfilled. First of all, it must focus on action, setting targets, timetables and specific actions to redress the lack of sustainability in the European Union. Secondly, it must indicate when and how we will move forwards with the ‘environmentalisation’ of the European Union’s common policies. Thirdly, it must approve an ambitious set of environmental indicators that will act as a point of reference for an annual assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to make one last comment on Amendment No 10, which condemns the Spanish hydrological plan: the very credibility of the European Parliament and the interinstitutional balance are at stake here. Parliament cannot be turned into an institution of the Court of the Communities, because we would be in danger of setting an extremely serious precedent. Europe’s citizens, and indeed the members of European parliaments, have mechanisms for questioning whether given projects are lawful within the framework of the Community debate. This amendment is unacceptable, threatens the adoption of the resolution itself, and I hope, in any event, that the common sense of those who tabled it will prevail.</p>

I also support many of the – sound – recommendations made in Mr Karas’ report.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the strategic role assumed at Lisbon by the research and development policies of promoting education and lifelong learning and increasing the active population and the employment of older workers requires that these goals be part of an economic and social policy developed and decided by a single entity according to an agreed decision-making process, not least using forms of open cooperation. From this point of view, the delays which have accumulated in public and private investment in research and lifelong training, which – I would remind you again – make the processes of mobility and flexibility dependent on the achievement of the absolutely imperative conditions of security and employability, are cause for concern. Still more disturbing, however, are signs of a slackening of efforts to develop a policy mix which combines responsibility for coordinating economic policies promoting sustainable development with responsibility for coordinating the employment and social cohesion policies, introducing a new era in social dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">If the significance of this sort of approach, which seems currently to prevail – that is, separating once again the common economic policy, which is, moreover, often implicit, from social policy, which is in danger of being relegated to the status of an auxiliary policy – were not actually to be acknowledged at Barcelona or if it were not to be openly discussed, that would irreparably compromise the goals set at Lisbon for the period 2002-2010. This danger is all the more serious in that it appears to coincide with the aim of a transnational political<span class="bold"> </span>front which is openly seeking to distort the strategic content of the Lisbon decisions. This is the case with a document signed by the Italian and British Heads of Government which endorses not structural reform but deregulation of the labour market and the abolition of collective bargaining, making it subject to voluntary opting-in of individual employers and workers. This is a violation of Article 30 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which cannot be accepted or endorsed at Barcelona. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, what we do not do, and what we refrain from doing, is as important as what we are positively trying to do. We should learn in the name of competitiveness to refrain from burdening and cluttering the European Union from excessive regulation or initiatives which are not strictly necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">In that perspective, I hope the Barcelona Summit will turn its attention to the crucial issue of regulatory impact assessment. Too often, initiatives are launched without the full impact on business, on the environment, but also on consumers and administrations, first being fully examined. Let us all turn our attention to tightening up the hurdles which we need to leap over before we actually launch initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">The second warning is this. The Lisbon process – and no doubt this will be picked up at the Barcelona Summit – is now groaning under a whole series of targets. Targets are fine, but they can quickly undermine the credibility of the process if the targets are either not met or are simply met by Member States through a statistical sleight of hand. I would appeal to the Council and the Commission to be wary about implementing and establishing too many targets if those targets are clearly not always going to be met. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If I have to fence my house, put up burglar alarms, catches on the windows, etc., it may be good for the economy, but it is not good for my quality of life. We also criticise the ambition about being the most competitive knowledge-based economy, on the basis that in any competition, there are going to be losers, both within the European Union and globally.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are looking at with Lisbon is that we have to beware that social cohesion, which was another of the goals, does not become a casualty of our search for competitiveness. We are also very much aware that Lisbon is not enough. Gothenburg added the environment and the promise of Spring summits, which Barcelona is, as sustainability summits. In my group's view, all summits should be about sustainability, but I would settle for at least one a year as a start because the environment underpins our economic development, and if you do not have sustainability, you can kiss goodbye to the stability pact.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bullmann's original report gave us a comprehensive reminder of a number of issues concerning employment, social cohesion and the importance of sustainability, but I think we saw considerable tension introduced with that report, with certain EMAC resolutions; not least, paragraph 25 and its push for liberalisation with no qualitative evaluation on the social and environmental side whatsoever, and paragraph 36, which tells us that the European Union did a very good job at Doha in our push for the liberalisation of world trade as the catalyst for international growth. We have to get away from this idea that sustainable growth somehow means 3% year after year, if that is going to eat up our finite resources and pollute our environment. We have to decide as a European Union what we mean by sustainable economic growth and it is not what we are voting about here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The real question, however, is what Europe? At a time when the European Union is in need of strong economic and social growth and must meet the aspirations of its citizens who are making their voice heard, the Barcelona Summit is being heralded as a decisive step in achieving an accelerated liberalisation of public services that the President-in-Office of the Council earlier referred to as ‘a network industry’. Liberalisation provides the magic answer. We face growing expectations of more ambitious and high-quality public services, however. Can this just be national self-interest? I think that this need is universal. The sizeable disparities that exist between countries in terms of people’s access to these services justify drawing up common European standards that will allow harmonisation to be carried out from above. It is not fewer public services that should be on the agenda, but more public services, which have been improved through development, by being made more democratic and through modernisation. The Union still believes that public services, or services of general interest, are an exception to the rules of competition. They must instead become the heart of European social cohesion, the key to action for a progressive Europe, and become one of its reference points and one of its values. When presented with the progress report on cohesion in the Union, will we continue to destroy with one hand what we are trying to achieve with the other? The Barcelona Summit will not restrict itself to this issue, of course, but the fundamental problems are the same: the economic situation, the fight against terrorism, enlargement, the need for more democratic institutions; that is, so many issues which call for renewed consideration of the meaning of the European Union and its goals, with the first meeting of the Convention opening tomorrow. It is no longer sufficient to include the formal reference to 'a more social Europe', and to the fact that we need to be closer to the people. We need strong signs and practical action. The answers predicted to come out of the summit are not yet moving in the right direction – very much the opposite in fact. A more liberal Europe is unfolding behind the <span class="italic">More Europe</span> theme, and this is the credo of the market. The people have other expectations and they will express these expectations forcefully at the demonstrations that will take place on the eve of the Summit. It is crucial that we listen to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nowhere has unemployment fallen so dramatically as in Spain. I calculated a moment ago that the Union’s total unemployment figure has fallen by 1% thanks to Spain’s enormous efforts. Without these efforts, we would have had an unemployment figure of 9.5%; instead it is now 8.5%. I think this is an exceptionally important achievement which should be emulated in some other countries. This achievement has been brought about by a combination of economic reform, social dialogue, etc., and the intention is to follow this example across all European countries.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also a few unfortunate developments, of course. The first one has already been mentioned by Mr Poettering, namely the issue of the warning letter in Germany. How did this come about? I should also like to mention two perfidious features, the first one being that a country that is not a member of the eurozone, namely Great Britain, should intervene in eurozone matters. It is not their concern, they are not involved in it in any way; yet they still help make a qualified majority impossible. This is really outrageous! At this rate, Putin and Bush will soon have a say in our interest rate. This is not acceptable and, in my view, we should put an end to this at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">The second perverse feature, the internal German <span class="italic">Finanzausgleich</span>, is of a different kind. In the Stability Pact, we try to avoid getting into debt, but in the German <span class="italic">Finanzausgleich</span>, the accumulation of debts is rewarded, and federal states which have no need of getting into real debt are forced to do so nevertheless. This must also be put a stop to. If we can manage to do this, this will benefit our economic role which will become more community-oriented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I feel somewhat pessimistic about the possibility of the forthcoming Spring Council developing that approach coherently. I will limit myself to mentioning the three main reasons for this pessimism, in the hope, of course, that I will be proved wrong. Firstly, the slow pace of the attempt to place the environmental dimension on a genuinely equal footing with the economic and social dimensions, evidence of which is the fact that only some of the indicators for assessing progress made have been established thus far. Secondly, the excessively closed way in which the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategy is being managed, without the European Parliament, or the regional authorities or social partners either, being involved as they should. Thirdly, the delay in the endeavours of the Community institutions, including Parliament, to bring their activities into line with the principle of sustainable development, a principle which allows neither completely separate departments nor overlapping responsibilities. This concept of development is based on the principle of policy integration and therefore requires maximum coordination and cooperation and the creation of joint planning, guidance and monitoring instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason for all this is fundamental: innovation, research, training, quantity and quality of work and valuing the environment and culture are increasingly becoming elements of the same policy. These requirements are clearly expressed in both the Bullmann report and the motion for a resolution discussed in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and they therefore have my full support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This strategy, which was finalised at Gothenburg, is becoming a strategy for sustainable development in the environmental and social spheres. We wanted to believe this, we would like to believe this, we still want to believe this, but, in reality, the integration of economic, social and environmental dimensions is still merely an illusion. The Spanish Presidency, however, is not pretending. It is working with great honesty. It perceives the Union’s sustainable development to be the efficiency of markets, goods, services, capital and employment. Can we pretend to believe this? They want to sell us the accelerated liberalisation of the markets, transport, electricity and gas, although they know that this will result in our being less capable of supplying services to combat poverty, to provide social protection; it will bring about less territorial cohesion and fewer high-quality jobs, as all the studies have shown. We are providing flexibility in the employment market and the mobility of employees instead of a real job creation policy. Mr Bullmann’s report is trying to achieve the impossible. He would like to have his cake and eat it. He wants the commitments of the Stability and Growth Pact to be fulfilled and to see investment in education, research, the environment and networks. He wants high-quality employment and flexibility in the market. There is no doubt, in our view, that the real priorities of the Barcelona Summit are the development of the social economy based on solidarity, an independent income, including for young people who are slipping further into poverty, a real definition of services of general interest, a reduction in working time, investment in the environment and lifestyle. These, in our opinion, are the priorities of the Barcelona Summit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, it is to be welcomed that a distinction is drawn between actual economic consequences of 11 September and political and economic deficiencies that preceded them by some considerable time. It goes without saying that the European Union must allow Member States to support enterprises with serious problems that really are attributable to the consequences of the attack, in order to alleviate or prevent adverse effects on their employees, whether these effects are direct and commercial or are associated with these and of a social nature.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, though, it is irresponsible for enterprises to take steps to rationalise – in other words, cut jobs – out of hand, and unjustifiably defend this by reference to the events of 11 September. It would in fact be nonsensical and damaging to use State aid to intervene in such situations.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the assertion that the European Central Bank's cutting of interest rates and the introduction of the euro in Europe could nip an international financial crisis in the bud, is one that I consider incapable of being proven.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, additional adverse consequences for the economic situation, such as the rapporteur fears, might be brought about by increased expenditure on the armed forces and on internal security, can be drastically minimised by a sensible policy of development, which would focus on removing such causes of terrorism as poverty, oppression, exploitation and cultural intolerance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, has mentioned that the biotechnology action plan proposed by the Commission will also be on the agenda. I believe it is a good thing that this will be discussed in Barcelona, as biotechnology offers opportunities for growth and employment. I think it right that the Commission should be advancing so courageously on this issue. I will state openly that most applications of genetic technology and biotechnology throw up no fundamental ethical problems, and so biotechnology should be supported, and, in that we save resources by its astute use, biotechnology can also make a contribution towards sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Mr President of the Commission, there are also well-founded concerns. I get the impression that, in the Commission's action plan, these well-founded concerns tend to be presented as a problem of acceptance, so that all that is needed is enough talk and public information and there will then no longer be a problem. Parliament, though, has always emphasised that there are also requisite boundaries, boundaries that are necessary in themselves and which we have to lay down politically in order to protect health and the environment, but also on ethical grounds. For we are no longer the European Economic Community; we are the European Union, and so we need common values, with the consequences that derive from them. I therefore consider it false of the Commission to deal with stem cell research in a very wholesale way in their document, which does not sufficiently distinguish the ethical problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Aznar has done things very differently in recent days. He has explicitly aired the ethical problems. I would like to call on the Council and the Commission to give their attention to these problems. I wish to ask my fellow Members to support Amendment No 27 to the Jackson resolution, in which we have precisely and even-handedly dealt with this balance between opportunity and risk and call on the Council to act appropriately. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To be vigilant and demanding in relation to the application of the sustainable development criteria in the Member States with regard to their compliance with European legislation and the application of Community funds is the obligation of the Community institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is an initiative which insists on these aspects and it therefore deserves the support of this House. However, to bring a national issue such as the National Hydrological Plan to the European Parliament, in the context of this resolution, is a grave error which has nothing to do with the desire for sustainable development but which has to do with an intention to abandon the principles of subsidiarity and autonomy on the part of the Community institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr de Roo, to try to deprive a Member State, a priori, without good reason, of the Community funds necessary for its economic development and for the social cohesion of its regions is, in reality, to go against the very sustainable development of that Member State. The Spanish National Hydrological Plan is not an enemy of sustainable development. Its approach is based on a total commitment to compliance with Community environmental legislation and the criteria underlying the sustainable development strategy. It has the majority support and approval of the competent national institutions and constant national and Community scientific and technical supervision. Improving the quality of life of more than fifteen million people depends on its implementation and the immense majority of the Spanish population show support and solidarity towards it. Our electors expect us to offer appropriate responses to the issues on which we have to take a position. The best political responses are the result of reflection, prudence and a profound knowledge of the issues; under no circumstances do they result from demagoguery.</p>

However, the Bullmann report calls to our attention that all these measures come to absolutely naught if we do not have an educated citizenry that can create, operate and service these sectors. Therefore, education in the context of a sophisticated manufacturing and entrepreneurial <span class="italic">milieu</span> in a society that requires frequent switches in skills basis and a society that requires mobility across borders, becomes a precondition, a predeterminant, of our success in a knowledge economy, not simply one of the results of its successes.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we hope to have a competitive, dynamic economy when Member States today have substantial proportions of illiteracy, huge inequalities in linguistic capacity, protectionism and discrepancies in occupational and educational qualifications, and numerous financial and legal barriers to mobility. The changes we need, require fundamental cooperation across Member States of a kind that education ministers, vice-chancellors of universities and national qualification agencies find enormously difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore facing these extraordinary difficulties, the one thing at Barcelona that would move us forward immensely would be to provide the framework, the joint commitment and a realistic appraisal of the resources required to ensure that we make these fundamental leaps to promote education as the fundamental step in the future of the competitive knowledge economy in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will be tragic if the European Council cannot also match Europe's urgent needs and their own rhetoric at Lisbon and bring this area of legislation to completion and soon.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond this, I stress the critical importance of research and development and innovation to the future of Europe. Mr Prodi highlighted this policy area and said quite rightly there is no reason why Europe should not lead the world in biotechnology, which is undoubtedly going to be the leading area of science and industry, of employment and improved quality of life for the next few decades. And yet, what do we have? Bickering over the Community patent, moratoria and antagonisms, procedural obstacles which have forestalled all progress in genetically modified crops and a tremendous promise they offer to us in Europe and the developing world especially. What do we have? Over-complex and expensive approval procedures and patenting processes for new products in healthcare and pharmaceuticals. We cannot afford to lose our best scientists to our competitors where they are better appreciated, given scope to realise their ambitions and are suitably rewarded.</p>
<p class="contents">We are already two years past Lisbon, there are only eight more years to 2010 when we are to be the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world.

If the proportion of women in employment is to be increased to 60% by 2010, the Member States will have to become more pro-active – as they did when combating youth unemployment – and set benchmarks, in order to promote women in the seminal information technologies. Their share still ranges only between 10% and 20%, with the percentage of women owning small and medium-sized enterprises under 20%. The representation of women at the top in business management is only 10% at most. What has become of their impetus? Although the structural regulations include equal treatment of women as a priority and the strategy framework on gender mainstreaming holds remedies in readiness, women earn, varying between countries and business sectors, between 20% and 30% less than their male colleagues. Young women expect much from Europe and are demanding flexible child care facilities, and, Mr President-in-Office, so are the children's fathers, because they share responsibilities and want to combine work and family life.</p>
<p class="contents">European initiatives such as lifelong learning and Community initiatives such as EQUAL take this into account. Now is the time for further steps to be taken. New forms need to be created, and we do not want women to be disappointed, as they are by the Convention, where, unfortunately, only 20% of the delegates are women.</p>

Today I can only repeat what I said then and say it more firmly, in the run-up to the Barcelona European Council. At Lisbon, against the backdrop of a difficult international economic climate, the EU Heads of State and Government expressed the desire to make the European Union, in the medium-term, one of the most competitive, most dynamic and most prosperous regions of the world. The Barcelona Summit must ensure that this desire does not turn out to be a vain hope and that the economic, social and environmental reforms contained within this ambitious objective are carried through to completion and that they are not allowed to be deferred. We must take the euro as a starting point to achieve a seamless Europe, where the markets are fully integrated, a Europe where businesses, workers and students can use the whole of the Union as a reference and as a sphere of action. There is no better way for our fellow citizens to achieve social integration than by undertaking a professional career. The new phase in the employment strategy must place more emphasis on the structural barriers to job creation, on the tax regimes and social welfare systems, and enable closer cooperation between the national services that are tackling unemployment. In all these areas, it is not the time to withdraw into oneself, to be overcautious, or reckless. Just as some countries of the European Union are single-handedly conducting a policy resulting in restricting people’s will and ability to start up a business, work, and therefore hire employees, other countries of the Union, of the eurozone, are establishing an environment enabling everyone to develop their spirit of initiative and creativity. I therefore hope that the Barcelona Summit is an opportunity for Europe, for the whole of Europe, to move in another direction, which encourages dynamism, entrepreneurial freedom, competitiveness and responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also wish to state that the previous summit – the Spring Summit in Stockholm – was a success. However, I am not too sure that the Barcelona Summit will be so. That will depend upon the balance between the various issues, for most of the talk I have heard so far has been about liberalising various markets.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself come from a country, Sweden, which has a Social Democratic government and which has done more than many other countries to liberalise the markets. I therefore have nothing against liberalisation as such, but it must be balanced against a vigorous employment strategy, quality of employment, the fight against poverty and, in particular, efforts towards sustainable development. These aspects do not appear to weigh so heavily in the arguments deployed prior to the Barcelona Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">In his report, Mr Bullmann has succeeded in achieving a balance between, on the one hand, liberalisation and, on the other hand, sustainable development, employment strategy and quality of employment. I hope that this balance will be achieved at the Barcelona Summit because that summit will be judged by outsiders on the basis of how successful it is in that respect. It must not just be about liberalisation. The other aspects of the Lisbon strategy must also be dealt with if the Barcelona Summit is to be a success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When populism is introduced into a debate or a discussion, the debate will not bear much fruit. Mr Berlusconi and Mr Blair did not meet out of a desire for formal ceremony. They met in the conviction that there is a labour market model which needs reforming. We have an outdated model which needs modernising. We are also aware that there are conservative forces which protect workers on paper but do not afford them any protection at all in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Karas on his excellent report. It is a faithful, accurate description of the state of the European and world economies following the terrorist attacks of 11 September last year; it is also a working document containing proposals on the future development of the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">To bring about this economic revival, we must start with the rigorous application of Regulation 1466/97, which obliges the Member States of the eurozone to present and comply with stability programmes, while it obliges all the other States, pending total accession, to establish a sound, rigorous economic policy which is very close to that of the Member States. It is absolutely vital that all the acceding States apply these rules rigorously: any deviation or indulgence<span class="bold"> </span>would be counterproductive and would mean that they would subsequently be unable to endorse positions adopted towards other States which appear weaker on paper. The sectors worst affected by the crisis are also identified: insurance companies, the aeronautical industry and tourism. The suggestion put forward of a State reinsurance mechanism is certainly interesting, precisely because these terrorist acts are not committed against individuals but against the community of all people. It is vital that we learn from this crisis for the future. Growing nationalism and our performance of a leading international role must not lead us to disregard poverty and marginalisation. The greatest error we can make is to identify our own security and stability with the weakness of other, potentially enemy countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important that Barcelona does not backtrack on that commitment. It is important that Barcelona realises that if there is going be social cohesion, if we are going to reform and develop our European social model then the equilateral triangular approach to the development of Europe has to be maintained and developed.</p>
<p class="contents">Specifically, I refer to paragraph 22 of the Bullmann report which deals with the question of services of general interest. It is extremely important in my view that this House gives strong support to that paragraph. This an area of the European economy which accounts for something like 16% of investment and close to 9% of employment. Of course it has to be reformed, but at the same time we have to ensure that the services which general interest deliver are delivered in an equitable, fair and a universal way. That cannot be done in an <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> way. It cannot be done by each Commissioner or each Council taking its own <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> approach.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to take on board a proposal of this Parliament that we put in place a directive, not a one-fit-for-all directive, but a directive which would provide a framework for services of general interest, which would establish the principles on which they are to be provided and which would put on an institutional basis an evaluation of how those services are delivered. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission’s resolution clearly contains many interesting points; but in relation to Amendment No 10, which discusses information and the sustainability reports which have to be produced in order to receive Structural Funds and in relation to the Spanish National Hydrological Plan, I wish to say that I am very concerned, because the criteria for sustainability are not well-defined at the moment. We have no good definition of what we consider to be sustainable and this leads to subjective views, propaganda and unjust positions.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is necessary to improve the criteria that are going to define sustainability with an open mind, because the integral policy requires that we incorporate the multifaceted nature of sustainability. But we must also take account of territorial criteria. We must therefore employ objective and territorial parameters, since sustainable development always affects a specific territory. In this respect, climate change, for example, cannot only be applied to gas emissions, but also to desertification, which is perfectly quantifiable, and to rain levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Something else also worries me, however. While we have managed to incorporate sustainability and the environment into a transversal policy, the latter, the environment, must also open the door to social and economic criteria. There cannot be sustainability without an assessment of the social impact, of the habitability of regions, of the negative economic impact and of the costs. We must therefore enrich the criteria for sustainable development, otherwise we will create situations of asymmetry and injustice which make it difficult to implement energy and water policies in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Barcelona Summit next month will therefore be the first opportunity for taking stock of their implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the challenges in the environmental sphere have not been dealt with fully enough either in the Spanish Presidency’s work programme or in the Commission’s discussion paper for the summit. By means of the proposals to be debated tomorrow here in Parliament, those of us in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy have tried to correct some of these deficiencies. Allow me just to mention a couple of examples. I believe it is important to get the Cardiff strategy on environmental integration tightened up so that we might have clear objectives and timetables established for implementing the strategy. It is also important that we arrange for systematic sustainability assessments to be carried out of all the EU’s political initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of agriculture and fisheries, we are all aware of the problems. It is hugely important that, in the new agriculture and fisheries reforms, we should see to it that the requirements in terms of the environment and sustainability are also considered in relation to enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I hope that the European Council will demand of the Commission that work on a new chemicals policy for the EU be hurried along as much as possible. I hope that the Council will listen to Parliament’s eminently justified demands and recommendations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have just two comments to make. The first concerns the strategy for sustainable development in the run up to the Barcelona Summit, which puts flesh on the bones of the endeavour started in Gothenburg last year, when the environmental dimension was woven into economic development and social cohesion, successfully in my view. The common objective of these endeavours is to put the European Union's long-term, global strategy on sustainable development into practice. Biotechnology is an important sector today – and will be even more important tomorrow – and we must not overlook that aspect of it which can play an important part in sustainable development. This point is covered in Amendment No 27 proposed by my group. If used with care, biotechnological applications, and genetically-modified organisms in particular, can make a positive contribution both to the economy and trade and to environmental protection, for numerous reasons which there is no need to reiterate. At the same time, if we are to establish consumer confidence, we need to pay attention to concerns on this count and the call for analytical control methods, as well as markers and tracers, to be applied to genetically modified organisms is a legitimate one. It will guarantee compliance with the principles of safety, responsibility and proper information and, at the same time, create conditions of healthy competition in a highly promising sector.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment concerns the Commission communication on the action plan on mobility. The Commission proposal for a social security card is lacking in substance. Why? Because it does not create a European area of health which meets the demands of European citizens; all it does is simplify bureaucratic procedures. Unless the card includes details and medical data, naturally with the interested party's consent, which can be used in the other Member States, it will do nothing to improve present medical coverage at European level. Naturally, what we need is for the Member States to run compatible medical IT systems. This, of course, is where the Commission comes in and we expect it to take positive action on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, I am of the opinion that the summit should consider whether the objectives laid down in Lisbon can be met. In my view, this is impossible at the sluggish pace which we are currently seeing in Europe. I have studied the figures relating to the development of employment and unemployment. Last year was disappointing, and we will therefore never be able to meet the target. This is partly due to the fact that there is no longer any pressure from the European Union to actually implement the national action plans for employment which Member States are required to submit every year.</p>
<p class="contents">During the initial period of the Luxembourg process, the bad reports which the Commission gave the different Member States were still headline news. News of such reports has now been relegated to token entries on the last pages of some newspapers. This means, therefore, that the pressure to utilise the open coordination method is slowly being reduced. The summit should therefore consider what can be done to increase this pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to mention two specific points. Firstly, the costs to employers of creating employment are far too high. If I look at the difference between the costs and what employees are eventually left with, then non-management staff, for example, retain on average 45% of the costs of employing them, while management retain 35 or 36%. If nothing is done to curb these costs for employers, the level of redundancies will remain high.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the difference between unemployment benefits and wages is too small. Many people remain unemployed and combine this situation with moonlighting, because wages are too low. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is now high time that we provided stronger support for developing and consolidating the process of modernising the European economy and that we made clear our demands for practical measures.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to be able to create a dynamic and competitive Europe, then deregulation, liberalisation, structural changes and tax reductions must be implemented. That will in turn lead to basic conditions being created for new companies and new jobs, as well as to increased prosperity. We shall not obtain a dynamic and competitive Europe though further detailed regulations or through the EU’s taking on responsibility for an increased number of areas.</p>
<p class="contents">What is fundamental to achieving the Lisbon objective is, first of all, an internal energy market characterised by liberalisation, competition and openness. This is of the greatest importance to European industry and the people of Europe if they are to obtain better service and lower prices. The second prerequisite is an internal market for financial services with a view to improving the opportunities for investment and economic growth by means of lower capital costs and increased profitability.</p>
<p class="contents">Modernisation of the European economy is partly aimed at reducing unemployment in Europe, for example by increasing employee mobility, something which is also very important if the common currency is to flourish. Small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, must also be provided with sound basic conditions in which to start up, grow and become larger – or, perhaps, even to become large companies.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that these viewpoints should have been the main content of Parliament’s statements about the continued direction of the Lisbon process prior to the Barcelona Summit. Unfortunately, that has not quite been the case, something which we Conservatives regret. The report even contains a number of points that are in direct conflict with dynamic and competitive development. If the report were really to have supported the Lisbon process, it should have focused upon deregulation, liberalisation and increased competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rato y Figaredo,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Thank you, Mr President. On behalf of the Presidency, I would firstly like to thank all the parliamentary groups for their speeches and I will try to be as concise as possible, bearing in mind that there have been many references which have overlapped or coincided.</p>
<p class="contents">I would firstly like to address those who have noted any kind of defect in the excessive deficit procedures, that is to say, the procedures for monitoring the governments’ stability plans.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to insist that the Eurogroup and the Ecofin Council have had absolutely no hesitation in confirming the validity of the stability pact and that, with regard to the implementation of the early warning procedure in Article 99, by the Commission, the Council believes that the declarations and specific commitments made by two countries in relation to their compliance in the short term, that is, during this year, and in the medium term, from now until 2004, with the objectives of their stability plans and the stability pact in general, with a balance or almost a balance, in 2004, were commitments which met the needs stemming from our stability commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I believe that the Commission has acknowledged that, independently of procedural factors, the efforts and commitments made by both countries are clear and thorough from the point of view of the macroeconomic stability of the European Union and the eurozone in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress that, in Barcelona, from the point of view of competition and liberalisation, the Spanish government, and therefore the Presidency, is going to promote political agreements which represent considerable progress towards the liberalisation of markets, bearing in mind that we are talking about services which in many respects are essential to society, and that they must therefore be accompanied by levels of quality and security of supply, which must not be reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that economic experience does not indicate there are any cases where competition in the market economy has led to the countries involved having worse services than those which do not have competition, but quite the opposite. Nevertheless, efficiency in the allocation of resources, and therefore prices for consumers, can be extraordinarily beneficial. Spain is a good example of this. Spanish family consumers, that is, domestic consumers, have made a saving since 1996 of EUR 2 400 million as a result of the liberalisation of the electricity market, and the same has been true in relation to telecommunications and other markets.</p>
<p class="contents">To continue with the same example, I would highlight the effort that Spanish society has made in relation to the modernisation of the labour market, which has reduced the unemployment rate in Spain from 23% in 1995 to 12% in 2002, and that during the current Spanish legislature, that is, by 2004, that rate will be 9%, which is around the European average.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, liberalisation and competition do not pose a risk for the citizens, but quite the opposite. There is a considerable saving in the cost of public services and a considerable increase in employment, and it is unquestionably the responsibility of the public authorities, the regulators, to guarantee such factors as the quality of service and sufficient supply. I believe that experience, not only in Spain but in many countries of the Union, confirms this.</p>
<p class="contents">What is beyond doubt, ladies and gentlemen, is that we are now fortunately at the end of a recession which has been very intense and relatively rapid, as the President of the Federal Reserve, Mr Greenspan, has assured us this afternoon; and what Europe needs is capacity for economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the objectives which you have raised, such as environmental, social, health, educational and quality of life objectives, require economies whose potential grows, and I must remind the European Parliament that, over the last ten years, the European economy as a whole has only grown by over 3% in one year and by less than 3% in the other years. An economy in these circumstances has to be content with a structural unemployment rate of close to 9 or 10% and I am convinced that not a single parliamentary group present believes that to be a good policy, either in economic or social terms.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the introduction of the euro has demonstrated that European citizens want more Europe and want economic reforms, and – while Mr Barón is present, since he urged me to also congratulate the Commission on the introduction of the euro – I congratulate the Commission, all the central banks, the governments and all the people who have contributed to the introduction of the euro in Europe, and above all the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Various speakers have also mentioned the problems of sustainable development, and I believe that they are perfectly compatible with economic development and furthermore that is the clear definition of the type of economic policy we want in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that the Barcelona Council, in line with the recommendations of the Gothenburg Council, is going to take account of the third dimension of structural reform, that is, the dimension which includes sustainable development and that, following the Laeken European Council, we now have environmental indicators which are going to lead to the first report, which was made public in January 2002, just a month ago, on 17 January, and on 5 March, next week, the Ecofin Council will analyse that report in order to take it finally to the Barcelona European Council which will also allow us to reach agreements establishing the European position, with a view to the Johannesburg Summit on sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">I perfectly understand the demand from the parliamentary groups and Members that environmental issues must be at the forefront in terms of structural reform, and in this respect I would like once again to stress that the Barcelona Summit is going to bear these issues in mind, not in a generic way, but in accordance with the environmental indicators approved by the Laeken Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The candidate countries have been mentioned. The candidate countries are going to be in Barcelona, and they are going to be there to talk about their structural reforms, and therefore, in an informal but effective way, they are going to be able to participate in the debate on the liberalisation of markets in Europe and the increase in growth capacity and I believe that is a good demonstration of the will – not just of the Spanish Presidency, but of all the countries of the European Union and this Parliament – for the candidate countries to participate effectively in the debates on the establishment of European policies, even before the accession process is complete.</p>
<p class="contents">The issues relating to small and medium-sized businesses have also been mentioned; I would like to confirm that we are not talking about generic declarations, that the informal meeting last weekend in Aranjuez, in Spain, is going to bring proposals to the Barcelona Council so that the countries make reductions in timetables, reductions in administrative costs and use new technologies intensively in order to achieve this, and that, furthermore, the Commission, before the end of the Spanish Presidency, will make a series of recommendations on certain issues which are essential to small and medium-sized businesses such as the transfer of ownership of family businesses, which over the next ten years may make up approximately 30 to 40% of property transfers within European companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Issues such as Basilea II, which has been mentioned by the parliamentary groups and by some Members, are going to be analysed during the Spanish Presidency in the informal Ecofin in Oviedo, where we will hold a debate on the new rules which are going to affect the financial sector as a result of the Basilea agreements, known as Basilea II, on how they may affect the funding of all companies and, in particular, small companies.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been rightly pointed out that the labour market is not just a question of flexibility. This is undoubtedly the case, and the public authorities have a role to play on issues such as the defence of workers’ rights, the defence of the creation of active and passive social policies which respond to the needs of workers, the creation of training systems and positive discrimination policies in favour of specific groups such as women or women with young children.</p>
<p class="contents">What is absolutely clear, however, is that the best kind of social and labour policy is one that can generate stable and quality employment, and which accepts the idea that on the one hand we have a policy of social protection and on the other we try to give the European citizens the incentive to work rather than receive benefits. That is being used today as an instrument in all the countries of the European Union, and I believe that the benchmarking procedure is useful for analysing questions relating to direct public spending incentives for people to leave behind unemployment benefit and join the labour market with salaries which do not clearly benefit from the fiscal reductions which are taking place in our countries; with formulae which give people receiving unemployment benefit the incentive to accept job offers and with formulae which reconcile training with the needs of companies, as well as extending working life within our labour markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I would like to refer to the need, which has also been raised by some speakers, for specific timetables to be established in Barcelona. There is no doubt that the Barcelona Council intends to set quantifiable objectives which allow the States to make commitments which the public understands and accepts.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, by reconciling political positions, which are not necessarily similar, no issues which are clearly sensitive, such as the provision of essential services, in which public authorities undoubtedly have a role to play in terms of guaranteeing the concept of public service, and the concept of quality, I also believe that we can establish processes which create genuine European internal markets which put the European economy in a position to compete with other world economies, now that we have taken the gigantic step, in terms of the construction of Europe, of introducing the euro. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
