<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Esteve (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I would firstly like to thank all the groups for their attitude – something which I said in committee – which has been constant throughout the preparation of this sitting. I must also acknowledge the cooperation and dialogue we have maintained with the Commission and the Council, which reflects the unanimous approval of this report by the 49 Members who were present in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now comment on the amendments. Firstly, Mrs Boudjenah tabled seven amendments, of which I am aware that Nos 4, 6, 7 and 8 have been withdrawn and Nos 3, 5 and 9 are maintained. I would say to Mrs Boudjenah firstly that I believe that Amendment No 5, on the harmonisation legislation on immigration, is fully justified in paragraphs 45 and 46 and that the issue of foreign debt is appropriately dealt with in paragraph 29. I would therefore remain opposed to these amendments. However, I believe that Amendment No 3 on public services is positive and improves the report. Therefore I am in favour of it, although I would propose that in the vote we do not accept the place suggested by Mrs Boudjenah, but rather paragraph 26(ii) as the appropriate place.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Amendment No 2 by Mrs Napoletano is a very positive contribution, since the Euroscola programme is a programme for young people which works and therefore I am in favour of it.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendment No 1, which I tabled as rapporteur, I believe that everybody would agree that to include the Security Council Resolutions in the recitals of the report makes great sense. I am obviously referring to Resolutions 1397 and 1402.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Amendment No 10 by Mrs Napoletano on the Euro-Mediterranean Bank is the one that I feel requires most comment. I believe – and in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy we believe this – that the current wording expressed firm support for the creation of the bank. Now, the Barcelona European Council established certain positions and measures which, although they do not move in this direction, neither are they contradictory with the possibility that in one year we could establish the bank. I therefore sincerely believe that the Group of the European Socialist Party has made an effort to achieve consensus which could be valid for the debate in various groups – in my own – and that the amendment it proposes is a positive summary of the situation, since we could maintain a consensus on supporting the bank and advocate that the Commission present a new proposal which, of course, should be debated in depth in this House. I am therefore in favour of Amendment No 10.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I also propose the reordering of four paragraphs. Specifically, I believe that paragraphs 31, 32, 33 and 34 would express their ideas in a more organised fashion if they took the order 33, 32, 34 and 31. I also believe that paragraph 52, which clearly belongs in the economic chapter, must be included in it and not it in the chapter it is in currently. I think that it should come after paragraph 22.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I believe that the important elements of this report, without going into detail, are two issues: the first is that the report will help and guide the Valencia Conference as a priority within Euro-Mediterranean policy and in terms of efficiency. I believe that this is the case, and therefore I hope the vote reflects this, in relation to the part that corresponds to us. Secondly, I am thinking of the grave situation in the Middle East, of the debate we held yesterday, of today’s tragic news from Haifa, of the meeting being held today in Madrid, which we hope will lead to a joint position. Bearing all this in mind, I believe we can state that the Barcelona Process demands positive action in favour of general peace and stability in the region and in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to remind you that, if the meeting in Valencia takes place as expected, it will be the only forum that the Israeli and Palestinian delegations can attend. I sincerely believe that, as the European Union, our instrument of the Barcelona Process is, if not the most important, probably one of the most important instruments for dialogue and cooperation. It is also a process within our reach, because it is our responsibility. I believe that it must continue to carry out its task, and do so genuinely. We hope that that will be the case and I therefore thank you, Mr President, for the way this report has been drawn up and negotiated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have taken the unusual step of asking for the floor following the presentation of this report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, because the Presidency would like to state publicly how grateful it is to the committee and in particular to the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">This report was prepared in the run up to the Valencia Ministerial meeting on Euro-Mediterranean dialogue. It was drafted against the background of the very difficult situation we find ourselves in, and at a critical stage of the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue. As Mr Esteve himself stated, it is the only issue on which all those in the Mediterranean area agree. It may represent the only remaining window of opportunity for Arab and Israeli delegations to engage in productive dialogue along with European delegations. We therefore believe that the report provides the necessary political support from Parliament to encourage the Spanish Presidency not only to go ahead with the event despite the circumstances, but also to give a special impetus to this Euro-Mediterranean dialogue. The Presidency can now further boost the process launched, significantly, in Barcelona in 1995.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is highly symbolic that a Member representing Catalonia in this House should today remind us of the Barcelona spirit. We are hoping to revive that 1995 spirit today and in the near future. To be precise, we would like to see it revived on 22 and 23 April in Valencia. In my view, the involvement of the Committee on Foreign Affairs is absolutely vital and provides the political backing the Presidency needs in these difficult times.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to put on record the Council’s appreciation and thanks for the work undertaken by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the rapporteur, Mr Esteve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would also like to support the proposals that Mr Esteve, our rapporteur, has just made regarding the amendments, and to tell you why there is unanimity. In my view, it was due to the quality of the work, but also to the realisation, since 11 September, that the European Union must not be content to sit back and watch, from afar, what is happening on the other side of the Mediterranean. This unanimity is also the result of the realisation that it is in the EU’s interest to help the African continent to escape from the chaos and poverty that makes it a breeding ground for some of the recruits to Islamic fundamentalism. We have furthermore become aware that it is now impossible for Europe to enclose itself in a fortress, which is certain to be attacked, as all fortresses are – and which has, in fact, already started to be attacked with the growing phenomenon of illegal immigration. Consequently, there is also a need, as you have said, to relaunch the Barcelona Process.</p>
<p class="contents">I was appointed rapporteur by my fellow Members of a joint resolution for the Euro-Mediterranean Forum, held on 6 November in Brussels, and I could see that the cooperation which had developed between our Palestinian and Israeli colleagues within the drafting committee could serve as an extremely valuable symbol of hope, despite the tragedy that is unfolding in Palestine today. Therefore, I too firmly support the conclusions of the report which call for the talks that were launched by the Barcelona Process to be recommenced. These talks were intended to lead not only to joint economic and political efforts but also to intercultural and even inter-faith cooperation. I hope that they will also bring restoration, throughout the Mediterranean region, of this dimension of understanding and mutual respect which, once the difficult phase of decolonisation has been completed and the wounds accompanying this stage have begun to heal, must restore to the Mediterranean that sense of <span class="italic">Mare Nostrum</span>, that sense that we have of sharing with our colleagues values which are the basis of our civilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that it is not only the duty, but it is also in the interest of Europe, currently the leading global economic power, to help establish privileged partnerships with our Euro-Mediterranean partners. It is on this basis that we shall continue our work within the framework of the own-initiative reports on the union of the North African Arab countries which will be submitted to the House at the May part-session. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank the rapporteur for his acceptance of contributions from all the groups to this report, which I believe will be a genuinely useful contribution to the Valencia meeting, and because he has used and accorded due importance to the contributions of all the political groups.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank the Commission for presenting an effective communication containing innovative proposals, which Parliament wishes to strengthen and promote through the Esteve report. In this regard, I would like to emphasise three points. Firstly, the Mediterranean is now the Union’s strategic priority. After enlargement, that is our political priority. We must therefore be consistent as regards both our policies and our resources. Secondly, we need to explode this myth that the partnership primarily concerns the free market. We need to make this partnership a major policy that includes the economic, social and cultural aspects and the questions of training and the parliamentary institutions. We want to enrich this partnership much more than it has been in the past. Thirdly, we need a human rights policy. We cannot oscillate between <span class="italic">Realpolitik</span> and threatening to suspend the agreements; there must be commitment from all the institutions, particularly the Commission, to promoting human rights in the countries of the Mediterranean region. We are concerned – myself, in particular – because the more power the Commission gives to its offices in the Mediterranean countries, the more important it will be that it is efficient and capable of resisting pressure from those regimes. Otherwise, we will be throwing our money away.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I have to say that we would like to strengthen the institutional dimension of this partnership, giving the Parliamentary Assembly a leading role, involving ourselves in the initiative too and strengthening the two institutions proposed by the Commission, namely the Bank and the Foundation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As has already been said, after eastward enlargement, this is becoming an absolute, essential priority, a duty we cannot shirk. To all the reasons for this which have existed thus far must be added the tragic war and terrorism in Israel and Palestine. We are currently faced with the proof, with constant confirmation of the fact that, if Europe does not become more involved and establish policies addressing the root causes of the region’s instability and lack of development, well then, we will be unable to prevent either real or potential conflict or its uncontrollable consequences such as illegal immigration. I therefore look forward to a more effective European Union policy on the Mediterranean; I welcome the idea of exporting the method of European integration, starting with the promotion of a genuine area of free trade facilitating as much south-south trade as possible, even above north-south trade.</p>
<p class="contents">The plan for funding this process, through specialised sections of the EIB now and a Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank in the future, must be welcomed with open arms. However, where the Mediterranean is concerned – and I would stress once again, the Israeli-Palestinian crisis is evidence of this – we need to go deeper. This means concentrating now on recreating the necessary conditions and developing the dialogue between cultures and religions, a dialogue facilitating that mutual awareness and understanding which – we must realise – is no longer sufficient to avoid conflict between the Western and Islamic worlds, between Europe and the other Mediterranean cultures and between the Mediterranean cultures themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Good intentions or occasional interventions are not enough to achieve this: we need ongoing work with a lasting impact. That is why I feel I must support and call strongly for the immediate initiation of the work of the Euro-Mediterranean Foundation mentioned in the Commission communication. The Mediterranean is steeped in history and full of symbolic places in which the intercultural and interfaith dialogue has developed over the centuries. I come from a city, Venice, which has a tradition in that area, and I am sure that, if the Foundation taps into all these energy sources, the many energy sources present in the Mediterranean, the many tales and experiences of cooperation and understanding, we will certainly be able to address the root of the matter. We tend to see the cultural element as an optional extra in our programmes, as something which is second to politics and the economy, but in this case it must be given pride of place for it is the very foundation stone which will make it possible for politics and the economy to play their role too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This subject will certainly be at the centre of the discussions in Valencia. Sympathy for the colonised Palestinian people, which is felt well beyond Arab societies, is increasing in these countries in particular, due to the endless cultural, social and political humiliations and frustrations that the people suffer and for which they hold Arab and Western leaders jointly responsible. That is why the desire for a dignified life where they and the law are respected is leading the people of these countries increasingly to take the dangerous path of anti-Western nationalism, be it Arab or religious. This development, which is heightened by the international community’s inability to put an end to the massacre and restore respect for law in the Middle East, is detrimental to the cultural and civil dialogue called for by the Barcelona Process. It also demonstrates the urgent and important need for this dialogue. In fact, the only thing the Barcelona Process can do – the challenge before it – is to provide the support it has hitherto failed to provide for democratisation in the countries of the Mediterranean. If we do not suspend the Association Agreement with Israel, then not only will the Israeli tanks have crushed the territories, they will have also crushed Article 2 of this Agreement, as well as Article 2 of all the Association Agreements. What would we be able to say in response to the constitutional <span class="italic">coup d’état</span> of<span class="italic"> </span>Ben Ali in Tunisia? How would we be able to respond to the aspirations of Algerian society, which has been taken hostage by two camps that are both enemies of democracy?</p>
<p class="contents">The notion that economic development necessarily leads to democracy is absolute nonsense. The aim of sustainable development, namely ecological development and development of solidarity, in the Mediterranean, cannot be reduced to the concept of the free-trade area. Do we have any idea as to the consequences for employment, public services, and people’s lives, the consequences of the measures to liberalise this trade? From this perspective, democracy is certainly a condition for development. The requirement for democracy is not only a necessity, which some people describe as neo-colonial, it is, in fact, a fundamental element of the relations that we must establish in this region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Esteve has presented a well-balanced document which is certainly positive whilst also taking account of all the suggestions made by the various groups</p>
<p class="contents">It is indeed vital for the European Union to give due consideration to the future role of the Euro-Mediterranean area as regards peace, economic development, democracy, energy provision and economic investment. This report and the meeting to be held in Valencia to deal with these matters are therefore crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">It is nonetheless worth mentioning a number of issues giving rise to concern. Firstly, as has already been stated, we have to come up with a decisive response to the situation in the Middle East. I refer to the military invasion of Palestine, and would point out that there has been no military incursion into Israel by the Palestinians. If we fail to come up with such a response, I fear this conflict will dash all the hopes vested in European Union development in the area and put an end to it. We should also keep Western Sahara in mind. That conflict is only simmering at present, but could boil over at any moment. As we have always maintained, it is essential to recognise the decisions taken by the Security Council of the United Nations and hold the referendum on self-determination. It might then be possible to defuse a possible conflict in line with the conflict prevention strategy advocated by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been stated, it is important to make it quite clear that respect for democracy and human rights must be re-established in several countries in the area. The future of the region as a whole is being compromised.</p>
<p class="contents">Another worrying issue concerns the paradoxical situation whereby if investment in the area is made without preserving the necessary balance, undesirable consequences ensue. Unemployment increases unexpectedly and peasants flock to the cities. They then fail to find work. This in turn boosts emigration, illegal or otherwise.</p>
<p class="contents">We ought therefore to take these important issues into account. I believe that the suggestion of setting up an Association Agreement for this area, along the lines of the one for the European Union, and allowing us to be involved is helpful. It should however be worked on more energetically and with a greater degree of urgency. I therefore also recognise the importance of the latest proposal by the Parliamentary Assembly, crucial to the development of the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I refer of course to the way in which the report was drafted. As already stated it received the unanimous support of the committee. The content is outstanding too, and represents an improvement on the splendid proposal previously presented by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to focus on an aspect I believe to be of fundamental importance, namely political dialogue. The relationships enshrined in the Barcelona Process can only flourish on the basis of political dialogue and political will. Both the Member States and our Mediterranean partners need to be involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the rapporteur has put forward positive proposals in his report. Clearly too, Parliament can and must play a key role where political dialogue and political will are concerned, to give credibility to our plan for integration. We therefore very much welcome the initiative to set up a Euro-Mediterranean Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also clear that this revived dialogue requires a broader agenda providing for a whole series of issues to be taken into account. I have in mind challenges to governance, conflict prevention and important issues relating to democratisation and the defence of human rights. In our view, the war on terrorism also has a significant bearing on this political dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, this is clearly not the only approach. We are proposing a financial and economic partnership extending beyond commercial matters. It should also take account of the opportunities for mobilising an ever-increasing flow of foreign investment. In addition it should promote integration processes within the Mediterranean partner countries and strengthen our dialogue in the field of economic policy. In this connection, we believe that the proposal to set up a Euro-Mediterranean Bank could promote the dialogue and economic and financial partnership we are advocating.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly also, priority should be given to setting up intercultural dialogue and establishing a genuine Euro-Mediterranean partnership in the social, cultural and human fields.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to say a few words on the issue of financing. This is a key element insofar as there is a need for better recognition of the commitments made by the European Union and improved and more effective management of the MEDA programme funds. This does obviously involve a greater capacity for absorption on the part of our Euro-Mediterranean partners and the decentralisation of those programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in my estimation the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue will prove a vital asset in overcoming the conflict in the Middle East. I am also convinced that in life, in politics, in science and in society, it is important to have more than a superficial acquaintance with other people. Rather, we should strive to have a true understanding of those who are seeking the same truth, harmony and solidarity as we are, though they might be travelling along a different road. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has done so by unanimously endorsing the policy summarised clearly and positively in Mr Esteve’s report. At the same time, I am bound to say not just how disappointed but bitter I feel. I imagine there must by now be broad agreement that this Euro-Mediterranean process is like a game of snakes and ladders in which we have just gone down a very long snake and lost all the ground gained.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the economic and social aspects, there is a clear tendency to estrangement and breakdown of the relationship between the European Union and our Mediterranean partners. There is shared responsibility here, but also purely European responsibility. Above all, however, it is in the political sphere that the situation arising as a result of the dreadful events in the Middle East means at least that Euro-Mediterranean relations are exceedingly delicate, if not that the whole process is in danger.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to say that the Valencia Ministers’ meeting will undoubtedly prove a valuable opportunity to bring Israeli and Palestinian representatives together round a table. Nonetheless, attendance by the Palestinian Authority must be a condition <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> for the meeting to be held. It should be remembered that President Arafat himself was present at the previous meeting. The European Union could never be party to the mockery of bringing together Euro-Mediterranean countries whilst the Palestinian Authority’s seat remained empty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Re-launching the Barcelona Process is more necessary than ever in the interests of peace and stability. This should involve strengthening Euro-Mediterranean dialogue. We need to tackle crucial issues such as the need to promote democratic values and fundamental rights, so flagrantly disregarded in the conflict in the Middle East. Other factors to be considered include the terrorist threat and matters relating to economic cooperation, the environmental aspects of development, emigration and drug trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall focus on just a few areas in the short time available to me. Setting up a free trade area might seem the obvious way of stimulating the economy and ensuring that the people of the southern shores of the Mediterranean are not dying of starvation whilst on its northern shores we are being killed by cholesterol. It is important to ensure however that such a free trade area does not become a time bomb that would destroy all the efforts made by countries in southern Europe to achieve genuine convergence and genuine cohesion, something they do not yet enjoy.</p>
<p class="contents">The far-reaching changes anticipated within the European Union should be taken into account when establishing a free trade area. I refer to the reform of the common agricultural policy and to enlargement. Trade in agricultural products is both necessary and useful, but caution is called for.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to promote political dialogue amongst our Mediterranean partners, in addition to dialogue between them and the Union. It does not seem logical to strengthen the Association Agreement without strengthening the South-South dialogue. Closed border situations in diplomatic relations cannot continue. International agreements must be complied with for the coastal nations to be in a credible position in relation to the Union. This is certainly true of the potentially explosive situation in the Western Sahara.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, the need to combat terrorism should not be used as a weapon or an excuse for doing away with a political opponent or an enemy. Yasser Arafat has to be present as a recognised interlocutor if peace is to be achieved. Following the attacks on 11 September, dialogue and mutual understanding have become essential. Those attacks resulted in a deep divide between the two cultures. This has to be bridged. Cultural and social exchanges must therefore be encouraged, through the promotion of mutual information by means of shared means of communication such as Euro-Mediterranean television.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the important role the regions in southern Europe are already playing and will continue to play with regard to Euro-Mediterranean cooperation should not be overlooked. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall, of course, take note of these.</p>
<p class="contents">It is impossible to give thought to Euro-Mediterranean relations without contemplating concerted action to bring an end to the war in the Middle East, at a time when Israeli tanks are crushing the Palestinian population and Shimon Péres himself is speaking of massacre.</p>
<p class="contents">Sharon’s aggressive, murderous and colonial policy is leading not only the Palestinian people, but also all the people of the region – and that includes the Israeli people – towards a bloody and violent dead end.</p>
<p class="contents">We must condemn the crimes and the destruction of infrastructure financed by the European Union. We must call for urgent aid to be sent to the civilian population and for an international protection force to be dispatched to the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Since Mr Solana and Mr Patten claim – as they did yesterday in this very House – that acceptable boundaries have been crossed, the European Union must therefore take swift and objective action. It has the resources that are needed. It can decide to suspend the partnership agreement with Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">The bombings and killings must stop. The settlements must be dismantled. Israel must respect the United Nations’ resolutions. These are all matters of extreme urgency. If the summit in Valencia can assist in achieving this, so much the better, but it would be totally unrealistic to think that everyone is willing to come around the table in a few days’ time – even if the Palestinian leader were able to leave the territories – if the European Union has not adopted a clear position.</p>
<p class="contents">The Mediterranean region is in need of peace so that it can contemplate its future. Another conflict is also placing strain on this partnership, and on relations with North Africa, in particular, and that is the conflict in the Western Sahara. The good relations that the European Union enjoys with Morocco should be used to break the deadlock in this situation and to apply the United Nations’ peace plan which provides for the self-determination of the Western Saharan people.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation that has come about since 11 September means that everyone, on both sides of the Mediterranean, must avoid any religion-terrorism equation and must work together to eradicate terrorism from its breeding grounds, which can only encourage the most violent forms of fundamentalism and nationalism.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, I would like to mention the growing poverty, the pillaging of natural resources and the attempts to curtail and sell off national industries. I am in favour, as Mr Esteve states in his report, of encouraging a dialogue amongst equals, which meets social needs by adopting measures to combat unemployment or which promotes trade between countries of the south. I continue to believe, however, that the path towards shared prosperity has been blocked, for the time being, by agreements which are guided by solely economic and financial interests, thus denying the needs of the people who are already suffering from the burden of debt, the drop in the price of raw materials and the austerity imposed by structural adjustments.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we continue along the path of unbridled liberalisation, which is failing everywhere, without taking stock of previous agreements and ignoring the concerns that are growing in all parts, including the Mediterranean countries?</p>
<p class="contents">Although one of the major objectives of the partnership is to improve the economic and social situation of our partner countries, it is now necessary, in addition to this, to satisfy basic and fundamental requirements in terms of health and education. Unemployment figures, for example, or jobs that are directly threatened due to the abolition of customs barriers – namely, 500 000 in Algeria – illustrate how far off-target we are and would even tend to illustrate that other options must be explored, such as that of cooperation between public services.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it not also a good idea to take a bolder approach, for example, by establishing a Euro-Mediterranean development and cooperation fund, which would enable the people to define and monitor local projects?</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the free movement of individuals should be the condition for an equal and fair partnership. We wish to establish harmonisation in the area of immigration and asylum, but only if this contributes to the development of the country of origin and ensures that migrants, on our soil, enjoy dignified and fair treatment which observes human rights and is based on equal rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Obviously, as both the rapporteur and the Commission stated, the Barcelona Process must not be confused with the Middle East peace process. It is also obvious however that there can be no Barcelona Process without peace in the Middle East. I should therefore like to congratulate the Spanish Presidency on its efforts to bring about peace.</p>
<p class="contents">To my knowledge, the Barcelona declaration is the most strongly worded declaration in existence on this issue. The presence of the President of the Council at the Arab League Summit was a first. The mission to the Middle East did take place. That was a success in itself. Further, it succeeded in retaining its dignity. There was no meeting with Mr Arafat, but none with Mr Sharon either.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say how pleased I am that the EU-Israel Association Council has been convened, as well as the Madrid meeting. This process has to guarantee the security and viability of two states, the Palestinian State and the State of Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">Having clarified the relationship between the peace process and the Barcelona Process, I have to say that in my view the Commission is being unduly self-congratulatory. True, progress has been made regarding the Association Agreement, the Agadir Process has been launched and a development process tentatively put in train. As I understand it, however, all this is simply a drop in the ocean.</p>
<p class="contents">A single statistic suffices to indicate the gap between what is required and the current situation. The Commission has correctly stated that 45 million new jobs need to be created in the coming decade just to retain the present levels of poverty and unemployment. If this is not achieved, the growth of fundamentalism will threaten the security of our southern borders, as Mr Morillon and other speakers pointed out. Our internal security will also be compromised, due to the increased flow of illegal immigration. I therefore believe that Mr Esteve has chosen the points to highlight in his report wisely. I also believe that if we are to move on from words to action we must set up a Euro-Mediterranean Assembly. This would serve as a spearhead, breathing new life into the process and speeding it up, which is urgently required.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad more speakers from non-Mediterranean countries have taken the floor. This has not often been the case when we have dealt with these issues in the past. It suggests that the European Union is starting to understand that it needs to look South as well as East if it is to ensure its own survival. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Barcelona Process is of tremendous significance for peace, stability and prosperity in Europe. Unfortunately it is suffering as a result of the recent intensification of the conflict in the Middle East. Nevertheless, we need to continue this process of rapprochement across the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">We even need to reinvigorate the Barcelona Process with the aim of making the Mediterranean a real <span class="italic">mare nostrum</span> for all of the countries on its shores. The forthcoming meeting in Valencia – and I hope that it will be able to take place – should therefore be seen as a starting point for considering the creation of a new permanent and stable structure for cooperation and coordination. I know that in many cases not even the existing agreements are sufficiently implemented, but it is precisely in the light of recent events – from the attacks of 11 September to the war in the Middle East – that a multilateral organisation embracing the countries and regions on both sides of the Mediterranean is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly the variable records on human rights are still an obstacle to this vision becoming a reality. In fact, human rights need to be a central component of our dialogue. We need to convince our neighbours, firmly and persistently, that respect for and enforcement of human rights do not stand in the way of or contradict the fight against terrorism, but are actually prerequisites for a successful war on terror. However – and I should also like to draw your attention to this – we must not express our opinions self-righteously or arrogantly; we must do so with a willingness to engage in an intensive dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it remains to be said that in the light of the huge social problems, to which various colleagues have already referred – above all unemployment among young people – it is going to be necessary to create many new jobs in the region. To this end we need to fight a joint battle against corruption, nepotism and bureaucracy, but we also need to make it possible for increased investment to be made, in particular in small and medium-sized enterprises. To do this we also need a Mediterranean Bank, in which the European Investment Bank should, admittedly, for logistical reasons, have a majority holding. I might mention once more that the delicate political human rights issues on the one hand and the explosive social situation in this region on the other, in particular in the light of high population growth, are a volatile combination, which may affect all of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of course we have the usual pronouncements about peace and democracy. Conditions on the ground, however, as experienced in Cyprus, where 37% of the island is still occupied, or by the long-suffering people of Palestine, subject to a criminal all-out attack by Israel, unfortunately not just tolerated, but still being funded and armed by the European Union, are somewhat different.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, the adoption of the Euro-Mediterranean charter on peace and stability has been postponed because Euro-Mediterranean cooperation is not being used to serve the peace process in the Middle East, and we have the European Union to blame for that. There can be no doubt that the Euro-Mediterranean cooperation which we are constantly hearing about is not intended to contribute to the viable development of third Mediterranean countries and the prosperity of their people, let alone democracy and peace in the Mediterranean; its purpose is to promote the interests of the European Union's multinationals.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we shall continue to fight against this policy and for a radically different policy to make the Mediterranean an area of peace, mutual benefit and equitable collaboration and coexistence for its people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However as he himself points out, our aim today is not to go over again the strategic targets set by the European Union in Barcelona. No, what we must realise is that the tragedy all around us, with the fight against international terrorism and attempts to establish peace in the Middle East, provide a perfect opportunity for the meeting of ministers in Valencia to demonstrate once and for all that the Member States of the European Union have the political will to put the policies of the Barcelona Process to proper, continuous and efficient use. And both the nations of Europe and the nations of the Mediterranean need this process if we are to achieve an area of security, prosperity and peace for one and all. And that is precisely why I feel that our rapporteur's report is so valuable, because it focuses on the need for a deeper process with global policies which have prospects.</p>
<p class="contents">At institutional level first, the proposed annual summit of the countries involved in the Barcelona Process and the proposed parliamentary assembly, responsible primarily for monitoring Association Agreements, will provide a far-reaching tool which can last the course. The involvement of regional and local society and the involvement of civil society and women in all three pillars of the Barcelona Process rather than just the economy, as the European Parliament recently pointed out in one of its resolutions, will put our efforts on a democratic footing, make our plans sustainable and offer protection for human rights, for which there is a dire need in the region as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Cross-cultural dialogue and a new Mediterranean Research Institute will provide a good basis for the mutual understanding, mutual respect between partners and greater mutual trust needed in order to face up to major challenges such as combating terrorism, managing waves of immigrants and resolving the Arab-Israeli crisis through dialogue. In addition, the European Parliament must support the proposal to set up a European Investment Bank because, as has already been pointed out, it will not just strengthen the development process in the partner countries, it will also establish financial relations and other forms of cooperation between the partners and the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Luckily, the report by Mr Esteve has come along at precisely the right time, just before the ministerial meeting, giving the European Parliament a chance to express its views and, with its proposals and ideas, make a useful contribution to this cooperation, which is proceeding at a snail's pace and has wandered hopelessly far from the spirit and needs which the Barcelona Declaration – and many more meetings and resolutions since – acknowledged and undertook to satisfy in November 1995. The Esteve report quite rightly gives its unreserved support to the Commission's proposed new action plan under the Barcelona Process, which it has improved and enhanced with practical proposals and suggestions of its own.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one issue on which the Esteve report is lacking in my opinion and, unfortunately, it is the key to the success of any initiative concerning the approach to and unanimous cooperation with Europe on the Mediterranean side. As I am sure you can guess, I am talking about the Arab-Israeli conflict, Mr President, the tragic and dangerous Israeli-Palestinian conflict which is again in the headlines.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, things had not reached today's tragic proportions when the Esteve report was drafted and the rapporteur has referred diplomatically to the need to settle the conflict in a way which highlights the new cultural, economic, social, political and institutional approach. But what worries me, although I unreservedly support this new approach by the rapporteur, is that, if the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not settled this time under arrangements acceptable to both sides, I repeat, arrangements acceptable to both sides, this nightmare will simmer below the surface and keep on obstructing the Euro-Mediterranean cooperation wanted and needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must be proactive and move effectively in this direction, quite apart from any other initiatives which it takes. Valencia is a unique opportunity and it must not be wasted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With this report, Europe has unambiguously defined the two priorities of its foreign policy: a policy concentrating on eastward enlargement and a policy focusing on the Mediterranean area as fundamental in the creation of a future of peace and prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Euro-Mediterranean Conference is now the only genuine, existing forum for dialogue between the Arab delegations, the Israeli delegation and the European delegation. Providing that forum for work and dialogue with tools such as the Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank and the Foundation and pursuing the MEDA programmes will allow us to create and foster an area of south-south and north-south free trade, on the one hand, and an area of dialogue, knowledge, training and communication on the other. Only thus will the common values of different civilisations be clearly revealed; only thus will understanding of and respect for the cultures, religions and histories of different peoples grow. Only thus, I feel, will we be able to create a far-reaching area of democracy, economic growth and emergence from poverty, which are essential conditions if we are to promote and uphold the need for an area within which there is a shared policy of respect for the individual and safeguarding of human rights, which is the prerequisite for the success of any peace policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It clearly shows the importance that Parliament gives to the Mediterranean region. I noted Mr Swoboda's remark about his being the only non-Mediterranean participant in the debate – there is in fact more than one, but it can be looked upon as a strength of this Parliament that we have such commitment to and identification with an issue like this.</p>
<p class="contents">From the outset, let me just reiterate, if need be, the strategic importance of the Mediterranean for the EU. On the eve of the next enlargement and in the face of the developing political situation this is truer than ever.</p>
<p class="contents">After a careful reading I must confess my satisfaction with the convergent approach between this report and the Commission’s communication. More has to be done, but the Commission and Parliament are in broad agreement on the way we understand our political, economic and social relations with our southern neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the serious political setbacks in the region – the current dramatic situation in the Middle East being one of them – and a certain scepticism at the end of the 1990s as to whether the Barcelona Process constituted the right means to make the Euro-Mediterranean partnership move forward, the process has stood the test of time.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot ignore the implications for the process of the tragic development of the situation in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank. This is not the occasion today to debate Europe’s role in bringing an end to that conflict but the situation as it is, and the continuation of this dreadful violence, stresses even further the need to continue with the development of the Barcelona Process as a means for Europe to make its contribution to the peace, stability and prosperity of the region. One can always discuss how strong an instrument the Barcelona Process really is, but it is beyond discussion that this process is part of the solution and definitely not part of the problem, so we had better strengthen it.</p>
<p class="contents">In substance, substantial progress has been accomplished since 1996. All Euro-Mediterranean partners are now used to having a permanent dialogue and to working together. The Barcelona Process is the only place where we can hold a 27-member discussion and, more importantly, where the 12 Mediterranean partners can regularly discuss and meet. In the present circumstances, this is a meaningful indication of the resilience of the process.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also made substantial progress towards introducing a free trade area. Most of the association agreements are already ratified, signed or initialled. Intra-regional agreements, such as the Agadir Process, are being negotiated. Yet, although our Euro-Mediterranean trade relations are progressing steadily in North/South terms, South/South trade is still stagnating at a mere 5% of Mediterranean trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Macroeconomic stabilisation has indeed taken place successfully in most Mediterranean countries, but reforms related to the business environment are not progressing at a sufficient pace. The challenge for the Mediterranean partners is to unleash the full potential of their economic forces, and in this regard the Barcelona Process has become the framework of reference for all international donors to relate to and further pursue.</p>
<p class="contents">In the cultural sphere, substantial work has been accomplished. Some hundreds of regional projects have been financed and have promoted a dense network of human exchanges.</p>
<p class="contents">So what is the way ahead? How can we raise the profile of the partnership? How can it better be used to guarantee a common area of peace and stability?</p>
<p class="contents">Politically, we must pursue and reinforce our support for the Barcelona Process as a tool for promoting understanding and political dialogue. The road is well-paved, despite some potholes on its way. A clear example of this dialogue is the senior officials' meeting on terrorism just held on 27 March.</p>
<p class="contents">By the same token, the 27 partners have been able to come a long way towards an agreement around a set of priority actions on an issue as sensitive as Justice and Home Affairs. We hope to reach a final consensus in Valencia. Based on these priorities the Commission will launch this year a regional programme on judicial cooperation, the fight against terrorism and organised crime, and migration. This success marks a milestone for the partnership and demonstrates its political capabilities and potential. In particular, as far as migration issues are concerned, several of the requests by Parliament (observatory on migration flows, network of contacts) will be included in the coming regional programme.</p>
<p class="contents">At an institutional level, further efforts need to be made in order to promote the "co-ownership" of the Barcelona Process. A feeling that the EU "imposes its agenda" exists among the southern partners and needs to be alleviated. In this sense your proposal of launching a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly is more than welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Economically, signs are encouraging. The grid of association agreements is almost completed; South/South trade integration progresses, notably in the framework of the Agadir Process – even if not as fast as we would like. The Meda programme has dramatically improved its delivery – though given the starting point one might say that improvement had to happen – but still, it is happening with a ratio of payments to commitments of 53% in 2001 compared to a mere 26% for the 1995-1999 period. We are catching up.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet the economic situation of the region remains uncertain and demands supplementary efforts from everybody. I am glad that Parliament supports our proposals to further this process, in particular in areas such as investments, environment, transport, infrastructures and energy.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the idea of launching a Euro-Mediterranean Bank did not receive the full assent of the Member States at the Barcelona European Council. Nonetheless, a new European Investment Bank facility will be launched and a representative office of the EIB in the region will be created.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the social and human aspects of the partnership show today, more than ever, its relevance, creating bridges across the Mediterranean and promoting a better understanding of each other’s cultures and societies. I noted that this aspect was given prominence in many of the contributions in the debate here today. The Barcelona Process allows a unique and structured framework that allows this social and cultural dialogue at regional level – not only North/South, but also South/South and indeed South/North.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission has put forward a set of new proposals. I am happy to see that they are very well taken by Parliament, in particular the Euromed Foundation and the cooperation between universities (the Tempus programme).</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the launching of a new Euromed Foundation, the Commission is persuaded that it would contribute to the enhancement of the partnership. However, some Member States do not seem to be as convinced as we are. Some efforts of political persuasion will be required in the coming weeks. The Commission has also proposed the enlargement of the Tempus programme on university cooperation to the Mediterranean. The approval of this extension will be obtained at the Council of Education Ministers on 30 May. Moreover, all existing regional programmes in this area (heritage, audiovisual, youth) will be pursued in the near future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
