Ladies and gentlemen, your interest in this issue, which has been apparent from the amendments you have tabled and the numerous debates and conversations that have taken place, has made it clear that the subject of my report is of great importance to many of you. It is worth mentioning that this report did not simply involve data collection and the analysis of statistics; it also drew on my personal experience. I have managed medium-sized enterprises for the last 15 years, and learnt at grass roots level what conditions are required for the sustainable growth and development of such enterprises. The internal market must become a single economic entity and a driving force for the economy, and this will only happen when all the Member States fully implement the directives concerning the internal market and all the others aimed at improving its operation. A situation in which certain countries move forward by transposing and implementing directives, whilst others drag their feet, is simply unacceptable. The success of the internal market is closely bound up with cooperation between countries, and a concerted effort is the only way of achieving the results we all long for. With this in mind, the European Council suggested a 1.5% limit for the transposition deficit of directives to apply to all Member States. Research contained in the report concerning transposition of the directives by individual Member States, and in particular by the new ones, is surprisingly encouraging. At the beginning of November 2004, the lowest deficit concerning transposition of directives was 2.1%. This was actually recorded in the new Member States, and contrasts with the average for the Union as a whole, namely 5%. Information returned a month later, at the end of November 2004, showed failure to comply in the new Member States had fallen to 1.8%, and the average for the whole Union had fallen to 3.6%. The statistics quoted clearly indicate that the situation regarding transposition is improving. This improvement came about after just one month of effort and commitment. Only when all the countries have transposed and implemented the directives will it be possible to lift the remaining barriers to the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital without delay, thus making the internal market a reality. This is why I am making the following proposals. Firstly, the special procedure introduced by the Commission for dealing with cases of infringement of Community provisions applicable to the new Member States that failed to undertake transposition should become standard for all, and apply to all Member States. Secondly, the so-called Internal Market Scoreboard should be upgraded to become an official European Council document. It should be recognised as the main point of reference regarding the status of transposition in conjunction with data on the state of transposition of directives made available by all the Member States and updated regularly. Thirdly, the Scoreboard should be used to name and shame all Member States lagging behind in the transposition process. Fourthly, proper financial support for the out-of-court conflict resolution instrument from SOLVIT must be ensured, as that method of dealing with problems has already proved a success. In addition to transposition and implementation of directives, account should also be taken of the additional factors contributing to the development of the internal market, and consequently to the growth of the European economy. In this connection, it is essential for the new Member States to invest more in research and development, as their investment is currently below the European average. These new Member States should also create an environment that is more conducive to links between research institutions and business. As a citizen and former entrepreneur from one of the new Member States I am also aware of the need to create a more effective system of education and training. In addition, more information on how the Union works and on its legislation should be made available in the new Member States. A survey of entrepreneurs confirmed this view. In many of the new Member States, the education system is out of date. Students are taught subjects and trades that are not appropriate to the needs of the market. It is important to bear in mind that the better society is educated and informed, the better the quality of work provided will be. Simplification of current Union legislation is called for too. This will promote the development of businesses, trade and services, and stimulate the growth of the European economy. The services directive is also essential to the proper functioning of the internal market. In the context of the economies of both old and new Member States, a good services directive will amount to an opportunity to reduce unemployment and regional disparities. It will lead to the creation of new jobs and to greater competitiveness, as well as to higher quality services and more opportunities for consumers to exercise their right to choose. It is therefore best to rid ourselves of the emotions and fears generated by this directive from the outset. What is actually needed is constructive action to ensure that the most appropriate version of this directive comes into force at the optimum moment for us all. As I conclude, I should like to thank Mrs Kallenbach for her involvement and for the draft amendment she has tabled. Nonetheless, I propose that her amendment be rejected, because discussion of the services directive is ongoing and we do not yet know what form the directive will eventually take. Ladies and gentlemen, I trust that the solutions and suggestions I have proposed will meet with your approval. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since 1 May 2004, the European Union has been by far the biggest internal market in the world, with 25 countries and more than 450 million people. Before May 2004, certain critics stated that the European Union was being enlarged at an excessively fast pace and without adequate preparation, that the candidate countries were still not ready and that everything would end in disaster and tears. In the end, the cataclysm did not happen on 1 May 2004. Enlargement was prepared properly and I should like to add that the new Member States demonstrated a positive stand, efficiency and dedication during preparations for their accession. Today, almost 12 months since the enlargement of Europe, we find that the European Union, and the ten new Member States especially, have made particularly impressive progress. There are numerous aspects and numerous instances of the development of the internal market in the new Member States that one could mention. The Commission is sure that the delegation of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection which is visiting Poland could also cite numerous other such successes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would like to thank the European Parliament for this important own initiative report. We are particularly satisfied with the motion for a resolution by the European Parliament on the internal market in the new Member States. Almost one year after the enlargement of the European Union, the report by Mrs Handzlik comments, we are satisfied to note, with a particularly penetrating eye, on the – to a large degree – positive image of the operation of the internal market in the new Member States. The analysis and recommendations contained in the report summarise the achievements and the objectives which will ensure that the internal market operates as smoothly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to refer briefly to certain points of the report. The proper transposition of Community legislation is prerequisite to the smooth operation of the internal market. The Member States must perform their duties; some do so very well, others are lagging behind. However, what is truly impressive in the new Member States is the targets which have been attained over the last two years. In particular, the new Member States have done very well in transposing Community legislation into national law. According to the most recent information, Lithuania is top of the league of the 25 Member States, with a transposition deficit of just 1%. Certain old Member States have not done as well. The Member States must address more seriously the 1.5% target, which was agreed at various meetings of the European Council. They must also make a greater effort to ensure that directives on the internal market are transposed correctly and on time. The conclusions of the resolution are absolutely in keeping with the Commission's position including, for example, on the need for more intensive administrative cooperation between the authorities of the Member States, as is already happening in the SOLVIT problem-solving network. These procedures for resolving differences amicably satisfy the market players and make a positive contribution to the operation of the internal market in Europe. It is clear that the new Member States are not confining themselves to pronouncements; on the contrary, they are particularly willing to improve their performance and to create the right conditions for the development of innovation, which is most encouraging. This is precisely the approach that guarantees the success of the internal market. We must not forget that the smooth operation of the internal market is one of the basic preconditions to the achievement of the Lisbon objectives. However, I should like to add that the Commission will need, in turn, to do its job. Instead of producing more and more legislation, we will now need to take advantage of the opportunity to focus on doing less but better work. This includes the simplification of legislation, in close cooperation with the new Member States and with the old Member States, and providing better information and guidance in connection with consumer rights and the opportunities citizens have to work and establish in an enlarged Union. In coming years, we must make the European Union a more attractive location for business activity and investment and the creation of a modern and successful internal market certainly constitutes an important first step towards achieving this objective. We are relying on the support of the European Parliament to face this challenge. To close, I should like to say this: we are optimistic and believe that the new Member States bring new momentum to the European Union and are a breath of fresh air which benefits us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With the latest enlargement, 10 new states became members of the European Union as from 1 May 2004, but only in the legal meaning of the word. In reality, our countries will have to carry out a lot of work in various areas in order to gradually become fully fledged Member States. One of these areas is the transposition of directives and other Community acts to their national legal systems with a view to building a functioning, barrier-free common internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">The report gives a concise overview of the state of the transposition of European legislation in individual Member States. Although my country – Slovakia – often called the ‘central European tiger’ under the competent leadership of Prime Minister Mikuláš Dzurinda – belongs among the EU Member States that do not have the best track record of the transposition of European legislation, economic reforms have enabled the country to make big strides in implementing the medium-term economic strategy. To eliminate the remaining obstacles in the internal market, it is absolutely necessary to consolidate and improve the European legislation. The Commission should start revising the existing Community legislation with a view to its simplification. I am firmly opposed to bureaucratic directives that regulate and prescribe everything. We should, in conformity with the subsidiarity principle, let the Member States do what they can do with greater flexibility and effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we need the directives that have liberalising effects. Let us not be afraid to expediently adopt a new service directive, maybe similar to the one of Bolkenstein, that will breathe new life into the revised Lisbon strategy. I firmly believe this and I think so do many of you.</p>

I am especially glad that we are debating this report almost exactly on the first anniversary of the accession.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the report, the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> has not only been fully implemented by several new Member States to the required extent, but often even with extra rigour that most of the existing Members have not yet applied. Interestingly enough, instead of improving the Internal Market, it partly distorted it at the same time, for the following reasons: succeeding the political changeover, the countries have only made partial progress in economic reforms. 98% of the business structure is characterised by small and medium enterprises that struggle with capital deficit and their access to information is limited. The prolonged costs involved with adopting the <span class="italic">acquis</span> will still remain a burden for new Member States for several more years.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, enlargement with these ten plus two Members brought about some less frequently emphasised general changes as well as those which existed earlier. The nearly 150 million new members make up one third of the EU’s population. Around the time of accession, the economies of the existing Member States, unlike those at previous enlargements, are less prosperous and they are awaiting reforms themselves. It is a good thing with the current enlargement, that there no longer exists two world systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Politicians carry a great responsibility. Politicians, who regard the EP as an international stage for national political debate – even though originally it was not their intention – become obstacles to solving EU problems. A European politician strives to create a framework for solution at an EU level, where all Member States may find the crutches that they need in order to take their next step at home. I hope we all belong to this group.</p>
<p class="contents">What should we do? We need a political style that is clear, factual and calms emotions, instead of stirring them up. We need to restore quickly the balance of the Internal Market, which is most definitely guaranteed to limit the movement of the labour force. For the new Member States, completing the Internal Market means proper functioning of the administrative system, while in the case of the majority of existing Member States, it includes meeting their own target of the 1.5% deficit limit. Future European legislation must not lead to the distortion of the Internal Market (like the Service Directive did, for example), nor should it encumber the economy with enormous costs (see Directive on Rice, for instance), especially affecting disadvantaged parties. It is the responsibility of politicians and of the whole institutional system to put law into daily practice governing the life of European citizens. A good example of this is the department of DG Enterprise that supports small enterprises, including the European Information Centres, which are so successful in Hungary and other countries. A negative example, however, is that the forms used to differentiate between enterprises are still not available in all the languages of the Member States. A politician once said, ‘people are not prisoners of their fate, but of their opinions’. We must do our best in order to bring about change, instead of political bluffing ... </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Along with the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, we visited the businesses in her Chamber of Commerce. She must be a paragon of how people in the new Member States view the Internal Market and I think that her report also reflects this and draws on it. I would like to congratulate her on this, and to say, in this connection, that the new Member States have sacrificed a great deal in order to be able to meet Europe’s conditions. They tightened their belts for years and, as the report states, have in many cases, been even more efficient than many old Member States in introducing the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. It would therefore be appropriate for the Commission to be given more scope for imposing sanctions, thereby facilitating the enforced implementation of directives, because that will only stimulate, improve and optimise the free market even more. The internal market has brought us economic prosperity, which, in turn, guarantees political stability, which leads to peace, and I think that was why it was decided at an early stage to add a large number of new Member States to the European Union. I am pleased that Mrs Gebhardt has somewhat broadened the discussion on the Services Directive, because services are one of the key areas which have not been liberalised as yet. I think it is necessary to have a good discussion so as to end up with an excellent result for this Services Directive. I think that the debate thus far sends a very weak message to the new Member States. Indeed, it would be detrimental if we gave the new Member States the idea that despite their many sacrifices, and despite the fact that the old Member States welcome new markets with open arms, we do not appreciate any extra competition. We Liberals take the view that competition leads to innovation, which, in turn, leads to new jobs. It is impossible to keep the cheap workforces in Europe. Unfortunately, we have to establish that they go off to China. I therefore believe that innovative jobs with added value are beneficial to the market, and I hope that we, in that respect, can wrap up the Services Directive in a positive manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Cooperation with you has been good, and we owe you thanks for having taken on board a number of our suggestions, but, despite that, our group has nonetheless voted against this report in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. We have done this not out of some sort of opposition to an open and truly functioning European internal market – quite the contrary, in fact, for it is one of the most important conditions for the European Union to grow together.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor do we have any objection to many of the passages in the report, but we do have misgivings about some of its conclusions. Almost a year ago, we rejoiced with the new Member States, for it was more than a matter of necessity for most of them that, after more than 60 years’ separation from it, they should regain the position in Europe to which their cultural history self-evidently entitled them. Our group does, however, wish to express its opposition to the unhindered operation of what are termed market forces. We have no desire to see unfair competition engaged in to the detriment of highly motivated and dedicated workers from the new Member States. We do not want them to be fobbed off with the lowest wages that employers can get away with paying and to have inadequate access to support from trade unions and social partners. We want quality standards and social factors to continue to be built in all 25 Member States, with the environment and consumers still being protected. As we are at the moment particularly concerned with the Commission’s proposed services directive, we have again tabled an amendment on this subject, which expresses our implacable opposition to the country of origin principle. While I am aware that this is contrary to the rapporteur’s thinking, I would nonetheless ask for your support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree absolutely with this assessment, if and insofar as the reference to economic success concerns businesses. Without doubt, it has indeed been a huge success for them. However, we were under the impression that the internal market was part of the efforts of the European Union to remove regional disparities and offer a better quality of life to all European citizens. From this point of view, the internal market has failed, just as the Lisbon policy has failed and just as all the policies based on the neoliberal philosophy will continue to fail.</p>
<p class="contents">We need radical restructuring and to again make the citizen the centre of interest of the Union; we need a strategy that focuses on people. What we need today is to achieve real convergence in the quality of life of all the citizens of the Union, not convergence of local economies in numerical terms, convergence which contributes to the prosperity and smooth operation of the free market system, but not to the prosperity of European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can see an almost equal proportion of positive and negative examples in both the older and the new Member States. Business people in the new Member States are still having difficulties in acquiring the operating mechanism of the internal market, particularly in sectors which are not harmonised. In the harmonised spheres, however, the infrastructure for conformity assessment is not always accessible to them in their own countries for the products which they produce. I could go on enumerating separate problems, but these cannot eclipse the achievements of the European Union’s internal market. However, even relatively recently, we heard concerns being expressed in all the countries that were then still EU applicant countries that the free movement of goods might be disastrous for economies experiencing the shocks of a change of economic system. Industry that was still weak would not be able to withstand the competition of powerful producers in EU Member States. Certainly, many businesses in the new Member States that had not consolidated their position in the market went bankrupt as a result of competitive pressure from businesses in the older Member States, but business activity has of course not decreased. Quite the contrary: the increase in competition has activated the market, and consumers have, of course, gained from this. We can observe a surprising degree of similarity between the opinions of that time about the threats the European Union common market might pose to the new Member States and today’s debates about the possible threats posed by the European Union services directive to the older Member States. The most striking similarity in these debates is the way consumers’ interests are being ignored. The consumer is not being listened to. It is the opinion of businesses who are worried about a possible increase in competition that is being expressed. The first amendment tabled on today’s agenda, to reject the country of origin principle for services in the internal market, is in point of fact equivalent to a proposal to reject the internal market. The country of origin principle is the ruling principle in European Union internal market legislation, and the decisions of the European Court of Justice have confirmed this. In those service sectors where competition currently exists, the market gains from additional competition and, of course, the consumer also gains. Currently, even successful small and medium-sized enterprises in Member States are prevented from crossing the borders of their own countries in order to offer services in other Member States because of the high financial and bureaucratic costs. The application of the country of origin principle to the provision of services would open up the European Union internal market to the most important service providers in the Member States, that is small and medium-sized enterprises. Arguments about the threat to the European social model are completely rebutted by the directive adopted almost ten years ago concerning the placement of workers in the services sector. Consumers wish to obtain goods and services of the highest possible quality and for the lowest possible price, but the best way to ensure this is a competitive market and the European Union internal ...</p>

I should also like to share with you two thoughts on the report. The average citizen of poorer societies assesses the internal market mainly in terms of the changes in the price of goods and services following accession to the Union. Prices of many basic products and services increased dramatically, and there is no economic justification for this. Mechanisms designed to ensure competitiveness and systems of consumer protection failed. In Socialist times we were supposed to be cheered by the news that the price of locomotives was down even though the price of bread was up. What grounds for optimism are there in the present situation? My second observation concerns the problem of market monopolies. Many concerns have seen their profits double, not because of increased productivity, but also as a result of price policy. There are a great many examples of this, notably fuel. It seems to me that solutions are urgently called for. The Union constitutes a large and attractive market. This should be exploited with a view to regulating …</p>

Mrs Handzlik is a fellow member of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and a compatriot of mine. Her report is important for us not only because, if I am not mistaken, it is the first report drafted by a female Polish MEP, but also because it concerns a particularly important issue, one that is crucial to the economic development of the European Union. I refer to the functioning of a truly common and free market for services within the European Union. If we consider that services account for 70% of the Union’s GDP, the importance of this issue can be readily appreciated. So too can the importance of developing the market for services within the EU. At this time, when there is much debate on the Constitutional Treaty in a number of European countries, the subject of the services directive and of a truly free, open and competitive market for services in Europe constitutes one of the key issues in the debate. There are strong misgivings about opening up the European market for services fully to cooperation. Many fears have been expressed too concerning the possibility of businesses and service providers from the new Member States being able to operate within this market. These views were reflected in some of what Mrs Kallenbach said just now. I should simply like to refer to one important piece of news provided by none other than President Chirac in the course of the important debate currently under way in France. President Chirac stated that as a result of enlargement, exports from France to new EU Member States in Eastern Europe had quadrupled. This translates into something close to EUR 10 billion, and 130 000 new jobs in France. Such then are the consequences of operating a truly broad and free European market. There is no reason to fear enlargement or genuine competition within a market like this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many thanks, too, for the frankness you have shown in cooperating with the other groups. That, I think, is what our cooperation here in this House should be like.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that I will be disappointing Mrs Kallenbach when I say that our group will not be able to support her amendment. As she said, we are fundamentally very much in favour of a services directive being drafted, and of the services market being opened up; we do not, however, want it to happen any old how, but in a truly socially acceptable manner.</p>
<p class="contents">We are able to support Mrs Handzlik’s report, which contains some very important statements. In paragraph 5, for example, it is stated that the new Member States have implemented the mutual recognition principle in their legislation. It is also stated that they have adopted the highest standards as guidelines to achieving harmonisation, which is a crucial objective of the internal market. These things are what matter to the public in the European Union, and I think that is what we have to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee came to an agreement that there would be no place in this report for the provisions to be worked out for the services directive, and that we would, instead, discuss these issues in the report on that directive, which is where they belong. We have kept to that agreement, as has Mrs Handzlik, and I think that is only right and proper.</p>
<p class="contents">We Social Democrats have our own particular reason for endorsing this report, for, in paragraph 14, we agreed that, desirable though a market in services is, we do also take the view that efforts to that end must not prejudice social cohesion in the EU, and that consumers must enjoy a high level of protection. Such is the task we in this House have set ourselves where the services directive is concerned, and we will continue to work at it in future.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, too, I congratulate Mrs Handzlik, and I congratulate this our Parliament on having produced this report on the current state of play in the new Member States, and on the imminent report on consumer protection. At the same time, though, I do hope that this is the last time that we shall do so. I hope that future reports will take as their subject the whole European Union, making no distinction between ‘old’ and ‘new’, but depicting it as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ten new states which had gone through the painful experience of Soviet occupation and were just recently called countries in a transitional market economy, joined the European Union internal market with the four essential freedoms of the market: free movement of persons, services, goods and capital. After one year of work experience in the conditions of the internal market, the statistics of the new states on transposition of the directives related to the internal market proves that the newcomers quite successfully implemented their commitments. In particular, I would like to highlight the progress of Lithuania, the country where I have been elected to the European Parliament. Lithuania is the best amongst the new Member States and better than most of more experienced old Member States at implementing the <span class="italic">acquis</span> of the internal market. One such successful indicator was the Protocol on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products, recommended by the European Commission to the candidate countries as an instrument for preparation to work under the conditions of the internal market. Many countries successfully implemented the directives of the new approach a year before EU membership, but here we talk about the successful implementation of the free movement of goods. A different situation occurs while implementing the movement of services and persons. Revisions of the directive on services, having eliminated the principle of origin, impede the development of the internal market of services. It remains fragmentary, restricted and protected. Talking about the free movement of persons, I would like to remind you that according to the request of the old Member States the transitional period of seven years is applied to the new Member States. Only a few states have opened their labour markets since the enlargement. Therefore, I invite the Parliament, the European Commission and especially the Member States, without postponing the decisions for an indefinite time, to create a fully functional internal market and thus provide real possibilities for implementation of the Lisbon strategy. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One of the reasons for drafting this report was the fact that the new Member States are already teaching all of us a lot about how to deal with the internal market. By happy coincidence the Committee on the Internal Market went on a mission to Poland a few weeks ago. We went to Mrs Handzlik’s home town and we met the businesses in her Chamber of Commerce. There are businesses there, large and small, who are really frustrated about the way that some of the existing Member States are still hampering their access to the European market. Believe me, the new Member States have a lot to teach us. If you look at the reports on the internal market you will find that in many cases the new Member States are at the top of the list for transposing internal market directives.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it not extraordinary that after all this time it is the old Member States that are lagging behind? That is why we wanted to draw up this report, because the new Member States have so much to teach us. Inevitably there has been discussion this morning about the services directive. As the shadow rapporteur I would like to say the biggest problem we face in Europe at the moment is unemployment. Since 1999 the majority of new jobs in Europe have been created in the services business. We have to create an effective and functioning new market for services. We have to get a directive that works satisfactorily. We can deal with the problems that are being raised, but we have to do the job properly.</p>
<p class="contents">On this side of the House we will lead the way in delivering an effective services directive and continuing the transformation of the European economy, with the new Member States coming with us.</p>

As the chairman of that committee, I think her report has been a commendable initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">It is right to emphasise today what the new Member States have achieved instead of to carp at the difficulties and challenges they might pose. In the old Member States we see anxieties and sometimes a state of denial about what the expansion will mean to us. That is playing out now in some of the debates about the Constitution. It is playing out in some of the rhetoric about the fear of what immigration from the new Member States may do. My own view is that it is a task for this Parliament to welcome the expansion of the European Union in the fullest terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently, I have had the opportunity not only to go with the delegation to Poland, but also to go to Hungary in a business delegation with representatives of my own region. We have heard today in the voices of Mrs Handzlik, Mrs Pleštinská and all our friends precisely what their ambitions are and why they should be supported.</p>
<p class="contents">The internal market needs to free up services in a manner consistent with empowering consumers as well as entrepreneurs and in a manner that combines social and economic goals. They cannot be separated out. I must say to our friends in the new Member States that to believe that raw capitalism will give you all you need and will be your servant is an error. All these elements need to be in balance.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say to those who came to my country, the United Kingdom, from the new Member States: you are welcome. I am proud to say in the middle of the British general election campaign that we are right to have given free entry into our market to people from the new Member States. We will prosper, our capital accumulation will prosper, our culture will prosper, our cuisine will prosper! We welcome you, and I am delighted to be able to say that. I hope Mr Harbour will go back and tell the Conservative Party in Britain that it should take that same welcoming view.</p>

We differed from the rest of Europe in nearly every respect and had very little in common with it, other than being located on the same continent. Even that was not always seen in a positive light. Today we are debating details of our life together, the removal of barriers, and overcoming difficulties. Mrs Handzlik’s excellent report identifies the problems faced by all the Member States, and ways of overcoming them. I should like to thank the rapporteur for her efforts and for all the work she has put into drafting the report. It is to be hoped that all 24 points will be implemented as quickly as possible. Many successes have been recorded, but the bitter words uttered in the course of various debates, such as the debates on discrimination in the internal market or on the methods of reciprocity suggest that much still remains to be done. Nothing is perfect, and there is always room for improvement. It is also important to be aware that even the best of provisions are not an instant solution to problems. Member States need to make the necessary efforts to implement provisions if they are to be effective. The record on this varies considerably. Attempts to circumvent directives or to burden the European Union with decisions detrimental to the interests of consumers are an everyday occurrence. Sometimes we seem to be acting as if we had forgotten where we are heading and what the Constitutional Treaty states. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Regarding the amendment tabled by Mrs Kallenbach on the proposed services directive, I would just like to say that we should not use this excellent report as a vehicle to intervene in the current work on the services proposal. This weekend we will be celebrating the first year of the European Union of 25 Member States. The adoption of this report is therefore very timely and it shows that there is good reason for optimism about the internal market. We note that there is still some work ahead of us. This will always be so but overall we see a very positive picture with the ten new Member States performing well, and in a number of cases outperforming the others.</p>
<p class="contents">The move from an internal market of 15 to an internal market of 25 is providing a new dynamic. We should use this dynamic to move ahead in removing barriers and create further opportunities for our companies and our citizens. I would again like to thank Mrs Handzlik for her excellent report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
