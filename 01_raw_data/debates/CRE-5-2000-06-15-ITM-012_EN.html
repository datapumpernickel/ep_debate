<p class="contents">The majority of nut production in the European Union takes place in arid areas and on steep slopes in drought conditions. These crops offer protection against erosion and desertification and play the role of firebreaks. They are of fundamental importance as a source of supplementary income, which is essential to the maintenance of a large number of rural operations in the least-favoured areas. Furthermore, this production is the basis of a significant primary and secondary processing industry, the key to economic diversification in rural areas which suffer very difficult conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community’s level of self-sufficiency in this area is between 50 and 60%. Community production must endure competition from third country producers whose costs are much lower and who are subject to greatly reduced tariff protection. For example, in the case of hazelnuts, the costs of production in the European Union are three times greater than those in Turkey as a result of the differences in labour costs.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of almonds, the cost difference is a result of the fact that in the European Union they are produced in very difficult climate and soil conditions. Tariff protection is very low and is being progressively dismantled following the negotiations within the World Trade Organisation and other preferential agreements. The Commission clearly cannot ignore the fact that, when it holds commercial negotiations, its concessions have effects which sometimes turn out to be negative. For this reason, it must become customary to assess the consequences and automatically establish measures to lessen the negative effects of commercial concessions granted by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the fact that the measures laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 789/89 have had positive results, they have not managed to balance the cost of production with prices on a market dominated by the enormous pressure of imports at low prices. The problem is that the support which this production has relied on is coming to an end, while the severe production conditions have not changed, and the competition from third country production has become tougher. In fact, the tariffs applicable to almonds, for example, are going to be reduced further next month from 4.1 to 3.5% and there is a quota of 90 000 tonnes at 2%. Furthermore, American exports to certain third countries enjoy preferential agreements which the European Union does not have. In fact, over the last ten years the price has remained the same. The tariff for hazelnuts stands at 3.3%. Nevertheless, a lower rate of 3% is applied for products from Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">The pressure of imports is such that there is less and less difference in prices between the select varieties and the common varieties, which has a devastating effect. The difficult growing conditions in the European Union prevent competition with third countries and it is not possible to improve competitivity unless we abandon the current production areas and move production to other regions. This would cause serious environmental damage, serious risks of depopulation and serious problems in terms of land management. For these reasons, Commissioner, the Committee on Agriculture presented the oral question which has led to this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The diagnosis of the problems involved in the needs of Community nut production is well known. This is demonstrated by the fact that all the political groups in this House have agreed on the presentation of a resolution. The pressure of imports and the difficult climate and soil conditions demand, therefore, support for Community nut production.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Agriculture, in the resolutions presented unanimously by the political groups, is responding to the conclusions of the recent appearance of the nut sector before the Committee on Agriculture and, to a certain extent, takes up the requests of the sector, which, as the Commissioner knows, is enormously worried and concerned. These concerns, demands and requests of the Committee on Agriculture and the political groups in Parliament are aimed at seeking a solution which involves the granting of direct aid to the income of producers which, by maintaining that cultivation, will lead to the prevention of environmental damage and depopulation and maintain certain primary and secondary processing industries in the least-favoured areas. However, on the other hand – and this is the aspect which has led to the anguish and concern in the sector today – given that the measures aimed at this sector are coming to an end, it is essential that they be extended until a new support system has been put in place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Part of the reason for this, and you are right in saying this, is undoubtedly the keen international competition which exists, but the main reason is that there are various structural deficiencies in the main nut-growing areas.</p>
<p class="contents">We unfortunately discovered that these structural deficiencies above all result in low productivity and high production costs. In view of these difficulties, a support system was introduced back in 1989. But even at that time it was limited to 10 years, and its objective was to improve the nut quality and marketing. This system involved a significant financial commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">Between 1990 and 1999, this system led to expenditure totalling EUR 725 million. And as the contractual obligations are still in force, and run up to 2006, this year and in the coming years a further EUR 250 million will be paid out. In addition, a separate flat-rate aid for hazelnuts was introduced in 1997. However, as I have already said, it has been clear from the outset, as everyone affected knows, that there is a time limit on the measures to promote sales and that the objective is to facilitate the adjustments necessary to increase competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the fact that the programmes will in part be continuing up to 2006, no further measures are planned under this budget heading. However, I would like to point out that a different form of support for nuts that did not exist previously has now become available. Above all, the general aid scheme for fruit and vegetable growers under the “operational fund” also provides for measures of this kind, and of course additional, non-market-specific measures are also possible under the rural development programmes which had to be submitted this year. However, none of the programmes submitted to us by the Member States, including those Member States with substantial agricultural areas, contains any proposals for measures of this kind, so that no such need was evidently identified when drawing up the programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the present situation, and that also sets out what the Commission is in a position to do in this field so as to counter negative trends. But the Commission should not be attacked if it was agreed beforehand that rural development was to be the responsibility of Member States and included in their programmes, and if at all possible at regional level within the Member States. So that is where priorities for supporting rural development need to be set. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This House will end up as barren as the programme which you are presenting us with for nuts. I would also like to thank all of you who are here to debate the future of nuts in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I had my speech prepared, but having heard the reply which the Commissioner has just given us and the words of Mr Jové in his presentation, I believe that I am going to forget my notes and try to improvise in reply to the Commissioner’s response.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner is aware of the problems of nuts in the European Union and he is aware that we are dependent on a single supplier in many cases: the United States, on the one hand, in the case of almonds, and Turkey, in the case of hazelnuts. The Commissioner is also aware of the benefits – as Mr Jové has stressed – for the arid areas where all these crops are cultivated, and this cultivation is not improvised from year to year, since it takes a long time to grow an almond tree or a walnut tree.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Commissioner, I believe that we are facing a very extensive problem. When you tell us that there are structural problems of low productivity and high production costs in the European Union, we must ask ourselves whether we want a nut sector or whether we want to be totally dependent on outside sources? We only provide 50% of the supply, for the rest we depend on other countries. At this rate, we will end up with nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">You tell us that there have had to be negotiations and that there is already aid from the COM in fruit and also within the framework of the rural development projects. Therefore, I would like to say that, in the COM in fruits, the operational funds are intended for those crops – for those fruits – for which there is large-scale production. In those cases, the operational funds – which are a very small percentage of this global production per hectare, some 1.5 or 2% – are a reasonable amount to work with.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of production per hectare which amounts to little more than ESP 100 000, I believe that the operational funds of the COM in fruits have very little significance and offer very little in terms of resolving the problem of nuts.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the framework of the rural development projects, the Commissioner knows much better than I do that, in rural development, the second pillar of the CAP – which we all view with great hope and we congratulate him for having brought it up and united it in one budgetary line –, in the regions where these fruits are grown – which are basically Objective 1 regions in some cases, and Objective 2 regions in others–, the programmes developed there are LEADER programmes. In these LEADER programmes, and PRODER programmes in the case of Spain, where there are national programmes, which are organised from the bottom up, it will be difficult to consider a specific cultivation as being of strategic interest and as a strategic sector, when these programmes normally deal with problems of general interest.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Commissioner, what we are proposing to you, and I believe that all the political groups are in agreement on this, is the partial continuation, not continuation <span class="italic">sine die,</span> but continuation until a certain date,<span class="bold"> </span>Commissioner, of improvement funds and plans, because in some cases they have still not ended, and in other cases their objectives have still not been fulfilled. However, these funds are absolutely essential to the maintenance of the crop, as long as nuts are subject to differentiated treatment within the coming reform of the COM in fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I believe that we are talking about a sum of money which is not especially large and which can be covered within the miserly budgets which, according to what your department tells us, are available for allocation. Therefore, Commissioner, the extension of these improvement plans, as long as they are organised, used, and allocated according to a differentiated treatment in the coming reform of fruits, which will happen shortly, I believe that this will resolve and calm the fears which Mr Jové has expressed, which are shared by all the nut producers in the European Union, as they communicated to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, where they received our political support.</p>
<p class="contents">Since these producers have the political support of this House, I believe that it would not be justifiable to deny them a few pesetas of economic support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Fischler, the European Commission must not continue to ignore the requests of the sectors affected. You cannot continue to insist that you alone are right and that we are all mistaken. You cannot ignore the fact that, if we do not adopt support measures for nuts and locust beans, many crops will eventually be abandoned. There will be irreparable consequences for many areas of the Union, from both socio-economic and environmental points of view.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be said that both specific measures for nuts and locust beans, as well as the lump sum aid for hazelnuts, were in fact transitional measures aimed at the conversion of the crops, but there is no reason why they cannot be extended.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, a conversion in the agricultural sector cannot be treated as if it were a conversion in the industrial sector. In industry, one can modernise plants and improve productivity, but in the case of certain crops, however much investment is made, however many changes are made in terms of marketing, we cannot alter the fact that certain areas are arid or semi-arid.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot imagine that this problem can be resolved through the scant funds available in the rural development programmes. That is not the place to find a solution for these areas, as the Commissioner and the whole of the Commission seems to think.</p>

<p class="contents">The Commission’s main argument is that which was agreed ten years ago. That is to say, ten years ago there were certain conditions, we established a programme and it has come to an end. I believe that it is precisely the change in conditions compared to ten years ago which weakens the Commission’s position, and it is therefore important for them to be sensitive to an agreement which originates from the action of certain MEPs from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the European Parliament at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, there have been three changes. Firstly, the competition conditions have changed. They are not the same as ten years ago. Secondly, according to the assessment of the agricultural sector, and this one in particular, it should be pointed out that there is much greater sensitivity towards environmental responsibility than there was ten years ago. It is an economic sector, I agree, but it has much greater environmental responsibility than it did ten years ago. Thirdly, if this aid is removed today, the loss of the land recovered over these ten years would be irreversible.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore sincerely believe that there is no margin, either within the framework of rural development or in other areas, because we are not talking about vegetables, we are not talking about any other type of product, we are talking about a very specific product, with very specific circumstances, which were analysed ten years ago and which must be analysed today once again.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I believe that it makes absolute sense to carry out a study of a new framework of aid and, in any event, there should be an extension with immediate effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have had the honey problem – Mr Fischler, you refused a few handfuls of euros for hive subsidies – the olive oil problem, and now it is the turn of walnuts, almonds and hazelnuts.</p>
<p class="contents">Brussels does not want to be involved. We are told: there was the 1989 regulation, but it was provisional. The fixed aid for hazelnuts in 1996 was temporary. These measures have run their course and must come to an end. But to put an end to Community funding is to spoil what has been achieved. In the name of the principle of continuity, coherence and protecting the financial interests of the European Union, the aid that has already been committed must not be ended, especially since another aberration may be added to this one, the fact that we are in deficit. We are importing. And if that is making profits for Turkey, then fair enough, but making profits for California! You tell us that it is expensive, but you are not telling the whole truth. It costs EUR 250 million, but that is for years to come. You are avoiding giving the annual figure, which would represent 0.0 something percent, a tiny fraction of the European budget.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, Commissioner, action must be taken, first in the name of quality, in the name of seasonal employment, but also in the name of common sense, rurality, the environment, beauty. I do not know whether you have seen an almond tree in February, well it is truly a thing of beauty! And as we have told you, we are dealing with regions in Spain, in my native Languedoc-Roussillon, in Greece, where the land is arid. We must prevent a rural exodus. As a minimum, since extending the COM for fruit and vegetables is not a solution, we must set aside a few euros from the European budget to finance this activity.</p>
<p class="contents">But on top of that, Commissioner – you and I were both in Seattle – there is the problem of Community preference. Our honey over Chinese, Canadian or Mexican honey. Our olives instead of North African olives and our Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Greek, Languedoc-Roussillon and French Mediterranean before Anatolia and California, Commissioner. Not for a fistful of dollars, but for a fistful of euros. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that aid was adopted in the past to tackle great difficulties facing the industry, but the problem is that today, ten years later and through no fault of the producers, the circumstances that led to the approval of that aid have not changed.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been pointed out, our tariffs continue to be very low, European products are still unable to compete with those originating above all from Turkey and the United States, as a result of social and labour costs or because the crops, in the case of the United States, are in irrigable areas and are mechanisable while those in the European Union are in drought areas which are not easily accessible, where there is little chance of mechanisation, and it is therefore true that they are less competitive. However, this does not make the production in the European Union any less important.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, despite the importance of this production, we still have a deficit, and the disappearance of this crop – which may occur if the aid to the industry is not continued – would put the consumer in the hands of Turkey and the United States, who would set our prices from their position as a true monopoly. We should also remember, Commissioner, that there is practically no alternative to the cultivation of nuts because of the places in which they are produced.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, it is not surprising that there is enormous concern in the sector at the possibility that aid may be withdrawn, since without it – and we must recognise this –, given that the future of these operations, as a result of the competition from third countries, is in jeopardy and the investment made in the modernisation of the production systems – which has taken place on a significant scale – will have been pointless. I would therefore also like to ask you, Commissioner, on behalf of the producers in the sector and especially on behalf of the producers in Catalonia, for the specific aid to this sector to be continued in the way that has been pointed out here and along the lines of the motion for a resolution which I hope will receive the support of this House. This aid only represents 0.18% of the total budget of the EAGGF-Guarantee and 0.16% of the total agricultural budget, for which, furthermore, it has been pointed out that there is a sufficient financial margin.</p>
<p class="contents">Any other type of aid such as those you have mentioned, above all rural development aid, may be positive in other sectors, it is true, but in this case, given the specific nature of the sector, they are totally insufficient to guarantee the competitiveness, and therefore the survival, of these operations, whose interests the Commission – you, Commissioner – can in no way ignore. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, the producers have worked towards obtaining certification on irrigation, selecting plants, precisely organising the crops, and this work would be completely ruined if the aid that had been given up until now was not maintained at least long enough for the return on investment to take place.</p>
<p class="contents">For walnut trees, for example, the return on investment is around 18 years, and consequently, I believe that economic and financial logic and coherence, and also political coherence, require that for these crops, the Commission should show continuity, logic and common sense. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all I would like to make it as clear as possible that the Commission is definitely against production aids. Even the aids that we had in the past were intended to support improvements in structure and quality – they were not intended to be permanent production aids. In addition, I have to say that any such purely production-related aid would violate all the WTO rules.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been argued that we are talking about a long-term investment here. That is quite right. But every farmer who has made an investment in this area signed a contract at the outset before he made that investment, so that he knew for exactly how many years he would be receiving investment aid. So it is not as if the Commission can now be accused of some kind of cynicism because it is withdrawing support in a way that the farmers affected were not expecting. Every farmer knew for exactly how many years he would be receiving support. We need to be very clear about that here.</p>
<p class="contents">I have explained that there are new options. If a case is being made that this type of farming is absolutely essential for maintaining the landscape and preserving the environment, particularly in these dry areas, then this is an ideal case for environmental measures. It was precisely for this purpose that, amongst other things, we topped up the funding for environmental measures in the context of agricultural development. You cannot be right on both counts. You cannot argue that this is an important form of agriculture if it is obviously not important enough for the regional authorities to give it priority and grant support for it. You cannot have it both ways!</p>
<p class="contents">It has been said that this is all too little and that more money is needed, and it has been argued that this is only nought point something of the total agricultural budget. I am sorry, but the proportion of the budget the Commissioner can spend as he likes is 0.0%, so that if you want aid, you must at least play fair and say who you want to take the money away from! Because the room for manoeuvre is precisely zero, there is no leeway in the budget as has been suggested in this Chamber! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
