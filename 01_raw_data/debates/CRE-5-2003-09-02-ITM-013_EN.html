<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Gröner and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities on this extremely positive report, which concerns the DAPHNE II Programme, the second five-year phase of a programme to combat violence against children, young people and women. This proposal is a response to and a direct consequence of the recommendation made by the European Parliament in its interim report on the first DAPHNE Programme, in which it calls for violence to continue to be combated beyond 2003. Parliament's report on the mid-term review of the DAPHNE Programme in 2002 had already presented an opportunity for us to debate some of the initial ideas on a programme that could follow on from the DAPHNE Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">We could, therefore, say that this proposal for DAPHNE II is in line with the discussions we held at that time: an increase in financial and human resources and more sharing of information and best practice, amongst other aspects. The Commission has not made any substantial changes to the objectives, mechanisms or beneficiaries of the programme, because the current DAPHNE Programme is acknowledged to be an instrument that has produced excellent results. In footballing terms, we would say that there is no point in changing a winning team.</p>
<p class="contents">We have, however, proposed some improvements to increase the programme’s impact. The main improvement is doubtless the increase to the programme’s budget: EUR 41 million as compared to EUR 20 million. The need for a larger budget is indeed a concern that the Commission and Parliament share. Since the time that this proposal was presented to Parliament, the needs associated with the European Union’s enlargement have been taken into account with regard to all Commission instruments and, as you can see in the proposal for the 2004 budget, the sum currently earmarked for the DAPHNE II Programme stands at EUR 49.2 million for the period 2004-2008. This sum will provide almost EUR 10 million per year, which represents a 100% increase, a doubling of current resources. This will put us in a better position from which to address the growing demand from organisations in Europe and the consequences of enlargement too.</p>
<p class="contents">A second improvement consists of the list of activities that can be supported and that are referred to in Article 4. The DAPHNE II proposal is clearer than DAPHNE I where this type of activity is concerned. Another change has been made to exchange the information and best practice developed under the programme. The aim of this is to increase the programme’s impact on the groups involved. Specific invitations to submit proposals will be published with a view to identifying and defining the policies to pursue, where possible on the basis of the work already undertaken by the projects that have been funded to date. The aim is also to disseminate on a European scale the good practices developed in projects that have been funded. This could be achieved by producing and making available not only traditional written material but also an increasing number of CD-ROMs, films, videos and websites or by promoting or arranging exchanges of experienced staff between civil society organisations in order to support the implementation of new solutions or practices that have proven to be effective in another context. The last change we have made is to enable non-governmental organisations to use, adapt or transfer the results of the DAPHNE Programme to other parts of the Union or to other categories of beneficiaries.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the basic outlines of the presentation I wish to make, and I look forward to the debate and the questions you might want to ask so that we can obtain Parliament’s approval for this programme which I believe is a milestone in the fight against violence in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The initiative was aimed at funding measures to combat violence against children, young people, and women in Europe, and its great success led to the DAPHNE I Programme, which will now keep on running right up to 2003. A four-year programme, it was funded to the tune of EUR 20 million.</p>
<p class="contents">My report is concerned with the Commission’s proposal for the DAPHNE II Programme, which is to run from 2004 to 2008. Within the programme’s framework, measures can now be promoted to protect the three groups that will benefit – children, young people, and women – as can the relevant preventive measures. These include the establishment of networks for NGOs across Europe, support for collaboration between NGOs and authorities in the same field, measures to protect the target groups and to prevent violence against those belonging to them, studies, research work aimed at discovering the causes of violence, at preventing it, and at the support of groups at risk and their reintegration into society. This includes the sharing of good practice and of information, as well as awareness programmes for the general public, for the victims, the groups at risk and for those who work with them.</p>
<p class="contents">Participation in the DAPHNE I Programme was open to the central and eastern European countries, as well as to Cyprus, Malta, Turkey and the countries belonging to EFTA and the European Economic Area, and there was the possibility of multiannual programmes. Amendment No 11 is now aimed at linking DAPHNE with other Community programmes and sharing the experience of them with third states. The DAPHNE Programme, which supports these projects, is now regarded, both in Europe and far beyond its borders, as exemplary and as an important instrument in combating violence. What we have achieved is a change to framework conditions through regional initiatives with international concepts. The German Protection against Violence Act, for example, has taken on distinct characteristics derived from European experience. Let me also, at this point, mention the Austrian right of exclusion in cases of domestic violence, which keeps perpetrators of violence away from the home.</p>
<p class="contents">DAPHNE I’s budget made it possible to fund 140 projects. The thirty-five projects selected in 2001 focussed on the genital mutilation of women, in which third countries were also involved, and the sexual exploitation of children through paedophilia. It must be made clear, though, that these projects saw the submission of 662 proposals in the last two years, and that these would in fact have necessitated funding to the tune of EUR 65 million. The glut of applications, and the fact that only 13% of all projects in respect of which applications were submitted could be funded, makes it apparent that significantly greater sums need to be made available. We cannot fail to come to the conclusion that funding for DAPHNE II must be increased to EUR 65 million, and my group, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, has supported an amendment to this effect.</p>
<p class="contents">If the praise heaped on DAPHNE I is not to be forgotten – and it is not a matter of controversy to say that it should not be – then this must be made a political priority. The response from the Committee on Women’s Rights has been somewhat timid. In contrast to what my group has proposed, we have come up with the figure of EUR 50 million, so I have submitted the new amendment and ask you to support it.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 39 is intended to set up a helpdesk providing help to women’s organisations in the new Member States, which have as yet little experience of European programmes. We want the European Year against Violence to be based on our experience with DAPHNE and to make a definite mark. This European Year against Violence could become a reality as soon as 2006. I am aware that the idea of a substantial topping-up of funds is meeting with resistance from the Committee on Budgets, but if DAPHNE, which is founded upon the health articles in the Treaties, is not to go unheeded and be dismissed as a game like football – the example given by the Commissioner – for lack of a legal basis specific to it, and if we want to take seriously the problems involved in combating violence, then we must demonstrate political courage and make more funding available. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How much in terms of funding should be allocated to the programme for combating violence against children, young people and women?</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Gröner stated, there has been a lot of interest in seeking funds from the previous DAPHNE Programme, and there were far more high-quality projects than there was money for. The programme has been implemented well and the funds used efficiently and, given the wealth of interest, there are clearly sound reasons for increasing the budget for DAPHNE, and also by an amount larger than the general budget increase we normally give in connection with enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, however, no secret that the multi-annual budgets for this type of policy – an internal policy – has a very low ceiling. There is not a lot of extra money to give away. We must prioritise, and the Committee on Budgets has therefore been unable to give its support for a budget for DAPHNE of EUR 65 million. We have instead proposed that we stick to the budget framework of EUR 49.2 million proposed by the Commission. I can see that, in its report, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities has arrived at a budget of EUR 50 million. It bears quite a lot of resemblance to the Committee on Budgets’ proposal, and it is an amount I would assess as defensible from a budgeting point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say how very pleased the Committee on Budgets is that the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities has adopted our proposal that, after 2006, the commitment appropriations for DAPHNE II be dependent upon an agreement with the budgetary authorities. We shall, of course, only in the end be able to say how the budget for DAPHNE II will look after 2006 once the next multi-annual agreements and financial perspectives for the EU’s budget have been established, and it is of course a traditional proposal we have.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, then, I wish to say that we in the Committee on Budgets are able to support the report as it stands, but we cannot support the amendment designed to increase the budget to EUR 65 million. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In Europe, there are still misapprehensions and false stereotypes surrounding the issue of violence against women and children. The problem is too often treated as an unfortunate and natural part of life. Moreover, the victims – that is to say women and children – are often blamed. That applies to violence within the family, but also to, for example, trafficking in women and structural violence against women. That is something we must combat. Many run a high risk of being exposed to violence and abuse, something that is the concern of all of us. We are responsible for working for the effective combating of violence in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, my efforts have been directed towards ensuring that the purpose of DAPHNE shall be to combat and prevent all forms of violence, be it in the home or elsewhere. That is what my committee has supported, and I am pleased that the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities also agrees with this position. I am also pleased to see again amendments dealing with victims of human trafficking and the vulnerable position of street children.</p>
<p class="contents">The DAPHNE Programme has shown itself to be one of the most successful projects within the EU and has been adapted to many different types of difficulties and of problems involving violence that could not always be foreseen from the beginning. DAPHNE has, for example, funded projects to combat female circumcision which, at the start of the programme, was not a problem that was greatly discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, the DAPHNE Programme is to be extended by a further five years. That is extremely commendable, and I am listening with interest to what the Commissioner has to say. This is an important period, however. The EU is to be enlarged by ten new Member States, which is why an increase in the budget is necessary. In the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, we have supported an amount of EUR 65 million. We believe that this is necessary and hope that our proposal will win a majority in plenary so that we can now show by our actions that we wish to combat violence against women and children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been a very positive programme, very well executed, with very satisfactory results, and the only negative point we see is its financial insufficiency, since there was only EUR 20 million for four years. It is true, though, that at times we have had annual supplements, which have helped to finance some other projects.</p>
<p class="contents">This programme is based above all on the prevention of domestic violence, on combating domestic violence through prevention and education, with a view to preventing domestic violence from taking place and helping its victims.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore very important to take action agreed amongst the Member States because, although it continues to be a private issue, a family issue, it also has repercussions for relations between different countries as a result of the exploitation of women and children by organised mafias who work internationally.</p>
<p class="contents">As was pointed out in the mid-term report on the previous programme, the cooperation of the media in terms of the way they report the news, the way they report on domestic violence taking place in society, is very important. The treatment of this phenomenon by certain television programmes, certain films and by advertising is very important. Particular emphasis should be placed on all of these issues because they have an influence on the awareness of society and on the way this horrendous phenomenon is reported.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also essential that the public institutions participate together with the NGOs, in particular the local institutions, where they can do extremely important work. We have seen that until now there has been very little participation. It was introduced in the previous programme and we hope it will increase with this one.</p>
<p class="contents">Another essential innovation is the right to remove the aggressor from the family home, and this has been introduced into certain national legislations, which are competent to do so. In other countries this is being prepared and we hope that it will soon be a reality in the whole of the European Union, because the victim must be protected. The victim should not have to flee, should not have to hide, should be able to remain in their home, in their own environment, with sufficient protection and far away from the aggressor.</p>
<p class="contents">The DAPHNE II Programme takes up important suggestions which have been made as well as the experience of the DAPHNE I Programme and we in the Group of the European Peoples’ Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are going to support it through certain separate votes which we are going to request.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the fact that the greatest problem is the financial one, we agree with the proposal made by the Group of the European People’s Party in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities that the total contribution for the Programme should be EUR 50 million for the five years. We are doing this, moreover, because we know that the financial perspectives and enlargement do not allow for a greater contribution and we do not want this programme to go to conciliation. We are therefore going to do everything possible to ensure that it is approved before the end of the year and that the DAPHNE Programme can continue as it has until now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities made huge efforts to combat violence immediately after Peking and as a result of these efforts the DAPHNE Programme was adopted, the extension of which until 2008 is the subject of today’s debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee, for whom Mrs Gröner is acting as rapporteur, welcomes the adoption of the second phase of the DAPHNE Programme until 2008 and the increase in its budget. Violence against women and children is known to be a widespread phenomenon, but I should like to refer in particular to something which happened at the height of summer. Of course, this matter would not have received so much publicity in the international press were it not about the daughter of the famous French actor Jean-Louis Trintignant. We know that Marie Trintignant was battered to death by her French partner, the musician Bertrand Cantat. Of course, there are thousands of women who suffer violence on a daily basis within the European Union itself, thousands of women and children daily suffer humiliating treatment and/or fatal violence from men like the worthy Mr Cantat. The UN even maintains that more women die from domestic violence than of cancer. In addition, as flows of immigrants have increased over recent years, we know that thousands of women and children within Europe are the victim of the new form of slavery, trafficking for profit and sexual exploitation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a complete denial of fundamental rights and freedoms, in other words of everything that makes human life dignified, which is why my political group believes, given the size of and rapid increase in the problem over recent years, that a significant increase in the budget is needed, because the programme is the only source of funding for the agencies involved in this issue. During the previous period, funding weaknesses limited the full application of the programme, because it was unable to meet the increased demands which Mrs Avilés Perea also referred to earlier. In addition, it is a known fact that our committee made an effort to raise the awareness of the members of the Convention so that they would adopt a stronger legal basis to combat violence, but unfortunately our call fell on deaf ears.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I think that our rapporteur, Mrs Gröner, has set out our claims in detail and her report is truly excellent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a bizarre distinction between voluntary and forced prostitution with which we are persisting in this House. That is the only thing I deplore, and I hope that it will not affect organisations that work on one aspect or another of the issue of prostitution.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is quite excellent to compare and evaluate the various national legislations. All I can do is mention the Swedish law prohibiting the purchase of sexual services and, of course, the Austrian legislation. The provisions of the Austrian legislation may be compared with a case in which someone goes into a restaurant and begins hitting people. The person is, of course, shown out and probably apprehended by the police, and is not welcome in the restaurant on future occasions. In the same way, someone who hits women and children in the home should not be welcome there again. Just like restaurant customers, women and children must be able to remain where they are and return to a place of safety, while the man should not be able to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that an information campaign directed at our legal bodies is a very good idea. In the last six months, it has emerged in Sweden that, despite an intensive debate, rape victims are treated in an incredibly insulting way. I can make another comparison: that with a man in an Armani suit and wearing a Rolex watch who is walking around drunk in the middle of the night. He is never asked what he is doing out at that time or why he is intoxicated. Nor does anyone suggest that he might be inviting crime. That is, however, what happens in the case of women who are raped.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would again address the issue of the budget. That is precisely what everyone has talked about. I believe that the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities is sometimes accused of being naive and ill at ease on budget issues, but it is our task here to deal with such issues. We are not only talking about enlargement of the EU, but also about the tasks for the DAPHNE Programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can be very happy with the report that is before us. The most remarkable thing about the previous DAPHNE Programme is probably the enormous success it has enjoyed. The fact that demand exceeded the budget eight times gives a clear idea of the need for support for the work that falls within its scope. Consequently, the proposed increase in the budget, of which the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities approves, is certainly not a luxury.</p>
<p class="contents">In this area, we can state without any hesitation that we should not ask ourselves how much the programme is costing the Community, but rather how much it is generating. The DAPHNE Programme has become a very important advertisement for the added value that the European Union can offer. Moreover, not only does it provide a support, but at the same time forms the most important incentive, in the field of equal opportunities and the fight against violence perpetrated against children, young people and women. This is why it is so important to note that the complex nature of the project applications appears to constitute a major stumbling-block. There is the risk that this may create a number of inequalities, certainly for third countries, but also for the new Member States. In order to alleviate this, it should be possible, and even straightforward, to set up a helpdesk or support desk which can guide applicants through the application procedure, as is now also proposed in the report. This will also enhance the quality of the projects submitted.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that perhaps a number of projects had not been drafted all that well is undoubtedly related to the rather limited provision of information. This is why Parliament's report also suggests organising a think tank, as Mrs Gröner has already mentioned. This think tank could suggest possible projects and make it easier to set priorities during the process of selecting them. It is precisely for that reason that the report very definitely wants to mention by name a number of particularly vulnerable groups and situations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All of us in France have been shocked by the Trintignant affair this summer, but similar incidents happen on a daily basis. Again in France, a recent news item told how a father stabbed his two children to death. The children were two and three years of age. This story sends a cold shiver down the spine. It highlights the importance of the DAPHNE II Programme. I would like to point out in this regard, Mr President, that it is a matter of regret that the Conference of Presidents decided to programme debates on disability and violence against children at such a late hour. These are issues of great importance and deserve the full attention of all Members of the house.</p>
<p class="contents">No one would dispute the importance of DAPHNE II. The programme is today widely recognised as an important instrument in combating violence. It also serves as a model of good practice at a European level. Nevertheless, it seems it was conceived initially to bring European added value by complementing measures implemented at a national level. The DAPHNE I Programme will conclude at the end of this year. It has emerged, however, that it was only possible to select 13% of the projects eligible under DAPHNE I. This was because of the increasing number of proposed projects to combat violence. Accordingly, Commissioner, in future I believe we need to target the categories of people who may be concerned more effectively. Greater openness and flexibility may be called for at times. Clearly, all types of violence merit being included within the scope of this text, especially when those most vulnerable are affected. Today, we are talking about children. Tomorrow, it could be old or disabled people.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments tabled draw our attention to the importance of prevention and of raising public awareness. They also suggest a need to collate precise statistics in order to assess the extent of the violence. I do not wish to reiterate what my fellow Members have said about the need for appropriate financial arrangements. I also support Amendment No 39, tabled by Mrs Lulling. It highlights the need to provide a support service to help the NGOs in the new Member States to develop their own projects, given that they have not previously benefited from this community funding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is without doubt one of the most serious problems faced both by societies in the less developed countries and by our societies, which we consider to be democratic and to comply with a genuine rule of law. So we could ask ourselves, what kind of rule of law is this if it does not protect women?</p>
<p class="contents">Violence against women affects all of us, even in countries with relatively egalitarian societies and with women fully incorporated into active and autonomous life. These things do not only take place outside our borders. It appears that violence against women has deep roots and that they are established in the very part of the world that we live in.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union – this Parliament, most directly – must send an unequivocal sign of its firm commitment to combating this violence which kills hundreds of women and which makes thousands of them suffer unjustly and avoidably.</p>
<p class="contents">The DAPHNE Programme has been an essential instrument for trying to combat this violence, but it has been restricted by its budget.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2004 the European Union will be enlarged to 25 countries and the rights of the women and girls of these acceding countries are seriously unprotected and a large number of them, furthermore, are victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation, as well as suffering violence within their families.</p>
<p class="contents">The initial budget is clearly insufficient – everybody has acknowledged this – and this Parliament's message must be crystal clear to all citizens. The increase to EUR 65 million proposed by the Group of the Party of European Socialists is therefore much needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The mid-term assessment of the DAPHNE Programme has demonstrated the need to continue with the programme. The DAPHNE Programme is one of those small grains of sand with which the Union’s institutions can contribute to relieving the pain, exploitation and abuse that many women and children have to live with within our borders.</p>

Why is this an achievement? It is an achievement because we know very well that the situation in our own countries is not easy. I would like to comment on the difficulty of combating violence against women. It is an institutional problem, as the rapporteur, Mrs Gröner, pointed out a moment ago. We do indeed lack a legal basis. The legal basis on health is not in line with the social project at stake in combating violence. This is the only comment I am going to make today. I would, however, like to associate myself with all the comments made about the budget and the late interventions on subjects of such importance.</p>
<p class="contents">A survey of violence against women has just been published in France. I would like to say a few words about this, as I know that in all Member States there are huge difficulties in getting this form of violence recognised. Recognising the need to combat this violence is difficult, but so is recognising the very existence of the problem. The survey revealed a very simple fact. There is a continuum of different types of violence. The various reports on DAPHNE have already highlighted this, but we have to understand that it is difficult to explain this point in our various countries.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a continuum ranging from domestic violence to violence that occurs in public spaces. The existence of this continuum should be acknowledged. It has been called into question in the media debates I have witnessed in my own country. The debate over the dramatic story of the death of Marie Trintignant, that appeared in the newspapers this summer, can either strengthen or weaken this notion.</p>
<p class="contents">My first point, therefore, is that we must explain, affirm, recognise and emphasise the fact that serious and less serious violence are part of one and the same phenomenon affecting women and children.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a media debate on this subject in France. I expect that there have been similar debates in other countries. They have exposed a second problem. This is that some individuals, including some women, have asserted the existence of a kind of victim mentality among women, who tend to exaggerate their status as victims, and the need to reassess the perception of the damage and the violence done to women or to other victims.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I think it is important to understand that we have to combat a sort of confusion in the imagination, where reality is less important than fantasy or the representation of people’s love and sex life in relation to the expression of passion. I think, therefore, that we have a serious challenge before us. We need to say, quite clearly, that there is no such thing as victimisation. We need to acknowledge that violence exists, and that it kills, every single week and in every single country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although the policy for combating violence is the duty of and comes within the jurisdiction of the Member States, DAPHNE Ι made us all more aware of the consequences which violence has on the physical and mental well-being of individuals and of society as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Our ambition with DAPHNE ΙΙ is to raise public awareness in a broader and more systematic way, to improve research into the causes of and practical solutions to the problems and to get closer to target groups and individuals. The results of the research referred to by Mrs Fraisse, who has experience in research, are very important and they convince us that we really need to engage in research more systematically, because we often fund actions which are commonplace and do not offer any added value.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the proposal by the European Commission on the amount of funding for the programme, which our political group has rounded to EUR 50 million. We believe that it is not the money that is lacking, it is the right action directed at the right targets and a suitable legal basis that are lacking. This money, if used properly, will be sufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">In the second stage of the implementation of the DAPHNE Programme, the experience we have acquired must help us so that the actions funded are more qualitative and efficient, complement national policies and are coordinated with national objectives. My political group also believes that this programme must remain within the framework of the countries of the European Union, in other words that it should not be extended to neighbouring countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems we face are already numerous and serious. Violence is a global phenomenon and we are very concerned about the policy we need to apply to combat it in the countries with which we have association agreements and other forms of commercial cooperation, but this needs to be done on the basis of other, special policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No woman, no child in any country is immune from this violence. This violence is both physical and mental, both private and public and it costs the lives of 1.5 million people each year.</p>
<p class="contents">DAPHNE is justifiably a beacon programme that seeks to combat the root causes of violence against the most vulnerable, namely women and children. Action aimed at preventing violence, combating violence and providing support lies at the heart of this programme. The number of DAPHNE projects is constantly increasing, and the first phase of the programme has been enormously successful. This demonstrates that DAPHNE is an appropriate instrument, and that the problems it addresses are of vital concern to the people of Europe. It is important we take account of the increase in the number of projects, the expectations of the NGOs and the enlargement of the European Union. These factors provide ample justification for the need to increase the programme’s budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget only allowed 13% of the projects to be financed. For action to be efficient and effective, a bigger budget is needed. If the allocated budget is not increased, I think Europe would be guilty of failing to assist people in danger. By increasing the budget, the European Union will be sending a strong signal concerning the level of its commitment to this problem, something it could rightly be proud of.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in order to be effective, we need to differentiate our studies and research to take account of gender and age. Combating violence, in all its forms, is not limited to a single programme called DAPHNE. This work should become an integral part of the policy in respect of the dignity that the European Union should afford all its citizens in all its Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Hence the importance of adopting measures to change the situation. Unfortunately, however, the very small sums allocated to the DAPHNE I Programme has only enabled 13% of projects submitted to be accepted, which has disappointed the expectations of the organisations working to combat violence and this has been the case more or less throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore support the proposal to increase funding to EUR 65 million that the rapporteur has tabled for this second five-year phase of the programme. I also regret the fact that the Commission does not support this proposal because it is simply not enough to adopt good proposals and good positions – practical measures must also be adopted, measures that do not involve only this programme, even if funding to combat violence is increased. Priority must be given to policies for social integration, we must invest in educating people about equality, we must increase resources and materials and also legislation that protects and promotes the social integration of victims, that throws rapists out of their homes and that helps to create a new mindset which respects the dignity of women and children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The statistics collated in the Member States reveal extremely high and in some cases terrifying levels of violence. We all agree that violence must be roundly condemned because, as well as constituting a breach of fundamental rights, it has serious consequences for society as a whole and acts as a real barrier to equality between men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">The DAPHNE I Programme, which was set up to combat this major scourge, by implementing policies for prevention, by clamping down on aggressors and by providing victim support has been enormously successful, clearly demonstrating that it has answered a deeply-felt need. The second phase of the programme must consequently be able to help out with more projects to combat violence, whilst taking account of the realities of a Europe of 25 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work and on the various points she has raised, which warrant being pursued in the second phase of the programme. I would highlight in particular the creation of filters that prevent the dissemination of paedophile material on the Internet, the reintegration of street children, and the creation of a European database for missing persons.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that this programme should receive a substantial increase in its funding so that it can accept the proposals submitted to it. We must, however, be pragmatic and realistic. The main aim is to ensure the programme’s continuity. We cannot waste time on protracted negotiations in conciliation. Funding of EUR 50 million, which the Commission has already stated it can accept, will enable the DAPHNE II Programme to enter properly into force in January 2004, in the new Member States too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Up until August 2003, 92 women in Ireland were killed over the previous 92 months: one woman per month on average dies in Ireland as a result of so-called domestic disputes. That is only the tip of the iceberg, because there are thousands of women and children and young people who are being abused constantly. It behoves us to take this matter seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no doubt that those who have spoken here regard it as a serious matter. It is important to recognise that DAPHNE has been one of the most successful European projects. It has made a real change to real people's lives in all of the Member States. People are alive today who would not be alive if this programme did not exist.</p>
<p class="contents">I would appeal to the Members to bear this in mind when they are voting tomorrow in relation to this question of increasing the budget. I cannot accept that it is impossible for us to find an additional EUR 15 million in the vast budget that we will be approving here in a short period of time. It is there: what is missing is the will to search and to find it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to make the point that this issue is not the same as the issue of violence between strangers. This is an issue of violence between people who at some point must have loved each other. It is a question of power and how power is abused. We also have to address that in a serious way if we are to get to the root of this problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The tragic case of Marie Trintignant is no isolated incident. Thousands of women face the self-same fate every day. According to the British Crime Survey, half of the murdered women are killed by their violent partners. Despite this, domestic violence, sexual violence and violence perpetrated against women and children are still a huge taboo. This taboo must be broken. Politics has an important role to play in this. Fortunately, this issue has been on the European agenda and also on the agenda of the Member States for some years, but there is still a great deal left to do. Too many women and children are victims, as was mentioned earlier. Member States must get even more encouragement to tackle perpetrators and protect potential victims. Violence against women is a form of violation of women's rights and cannot be tolerated. Awareness in this area must increase and legislation should be adapted accordingly. This is why we welcome the DAPHNE Programme. DAPHNE I was a runaway success. Many organisations active in the fight against violence against women and children have found their way to DAPHNE and thanks to financial support, have managed to do a great deal of good. DAPHNE I had a budget of EUR 20 million, but that turned out to be insufficient. Only 13% of the requests could be honoured – not because the applications did not meet the requirements, not because the organisations were unable to find their way to the DAPHNE Programme, but because there was simply a lack of funds. Hence the appeal for an increase in the budget. Also, with a view to enlargement, more countries will make a bid for the budget. Agreement has now been reached on 50 million. This is, of course, not enough to be able to do everything that should be done, but I think that this is the best we can hope for at the moment. The new proposal to increase the budget to 65 million is honourable, but not, in my view, realistic. We risk a conciliation procedure and are putting progress with regard to the current activities on the line. An extra increase of the budget of this kind stands in the way of a smooth transition from DAPHNE I to DAPHNE II.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I support the appeal for a European year against violence. The problem is so enormous that it deserves more attention, and in line with this, I hope that as soon as possible, a start can be made on an adequate legal basis for the fight against violence against women and children. Thank you, and thanks also to Mrs Gröner, whom we know to be an extremely committed Member of this House, and I should like to thank her for all the work she has done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

EUR 13 million were spent on the DAPHNE Programme from 1997 to 1999, EUR 20 million for the DAPHNE Programme 2000-2003, whilst, for DAPHNE II and the years from 2004 to 2008, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats believes that EUR 50 million will have to suffice. It is not, however, the money that concerns me.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome our discovery of street children as a new target group. It has been not only in Nepal and India that I have seen their misery. I know what is the fate of many of them in the EU’s candidate countries, and also, for example, in major German cities. Some are from families in which there is physical violence and sexual abuse. Some believe that they survive only by joining together in gangs. They use drug dealing, theft, and small-scale crime as means of keeping their heads above water. Physical and emotional violence, day in and day out, hardens many to all normal feeling. DAPHNE is meant to raise awareness of violence against girls and boys, young people and women, awareness of how it comes about, awareness of its effects, awareness of how it may be overcome. That this is for the Member States to deal with is not a matter of doubt, but there is a dearth of public resources. It is all the more important that help should be given at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Knowledge about the projects is what is needed. Which were successful? How have the victims worked through the violence they have experienced, and what has been learned from the many mistakes? These are topics for seminars, conferences and studies, but always in collaboration with the national NGOs and self-help groups. There is real hope of change through social facilities in which healthy groups can develop, in which friendship can be experienced, solidarity can develop, where children can be motivated to achieve good results at school and be equipped for their integration into the world of work. This is also about adequate accommodation for the victims of violence and about the law standing by the individual. DAPHNE II must succeed in mobilising public awareness.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need support through the media questioning the need for violence rather than merely depicting it or even glorifying it. If, moreover, this can be achieved by way of committed campaigning across national borders, then such collaborative effort will bring with it real added value for Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall confine myself to making three observations, the first of which concerns the budget. We acknowledge that this programme must be accepted to be a priority and this is why we ourselves proposed that its funding be more than doubled in comparison to the DAPHNE I Programme; we believe that EUR 50 million will enable us to manage the programme properly and carefully but we understand the differences of opinion that exist in the House on this matter. If there is one thing that I have learned as Commissioner, it is to be extremely prudent when taking part in debates on budgetary matters in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">My second observation is to say that I accept the majority of proposals for amendments tabled by Parliament. I wish to draw attention to just three, on which my opinion diverges from the proposals that have been tabled. The first concerns the wording of Article 2, which deals with the aims of this programme: I should like to keep a full and open form of wording, which covers all forms of violence and all victims, including women, adolescents and children. As to the issue of street children, which we acknowledge to be a very significant one, and which has in fact already been accepted as a priority for actions for 2003 and also for years to come, I do not believe that the decision to include only some beneficiaries is the right one. We should leave this to the discretion of the Management Committee. I also wish to add that, at the moment, 71% of the DAPHNE Committee is made up of women, which means that in this sphere the Commission has implemented the general decision on the composition of committees and of experts that are consulted. I do not, therefore, believe that any specific regulation is needed on this matter, since in this specific case we have already exceeded the general level set.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendment No 35, I doubt whether there is anything to be gained by institutionalising a ‘think-tank’ with non-governmental organisations. As you all know, we do consult non-governmental organisations closely but institutionalising this system might create a potential source of conflict of interest. The organisations involved in the think-tank might find it difficult to apply for assistance from the fund and yet are often the most appropriate organisations to apply.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to make an observation on the issue of the European database. One already exists, ladies and gentlemen. This European database forms part of the operation of the Schengen information system, which contains specific references, likely to be acted on through the national Sirene network, to all those who are sentenced or prosecuted for perpetrating violent acts against women or children. I do not believe there is any advantage in creating a second, parallel database; we must use the one we have. I wish to confirm that the Commission has funded a project to create a specific database for police investigations in cases of child pornography and paedophilia, managed by Interpol. I shall conclude, Mr President, by saying that given the lateness of the hour, I have not used up the five minutes allocated to me. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
