<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gröner (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, on 28 August 1998, the Commission submitted a proposal for an order by the European Parliament and the Council to introduce the Community action programme, “Youth” for the period 2000-2004. The programme was passed on to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport as the Committee in overall charge. The existing youth programmes, “Youth for Europe III” and “European Voluntary Service” were combined in the Commission’s proposal and their objectives given more concentrated form. Our Committee has worked very quickly and efficiently and, on 28 October 1998, it unanimously adopted the de Coene report with 61 amendments. The plenary sitting accepted this report on a first reading on 5 November. </p>
<p class="contents">We wanted to give equal status to the European Voluntary Service and “Youth for Europe”. The proposed amendments were to bring the programme closer to young people and so to the European Union. Our emphases were, and are, on increasing the budget resources for the programme – the Commission had proposed EUR 600 million and ourselves EUR 800 million – in order to double the number of young people who are being targeted. Through our amendments, we wanted to help simplify the structures, improve communication with the target group, make the implementation procedures transparent, increase the participation of disadvantaged groups, spread information about the programme more broadly in order to improve access to it and, finally, make the age limits for participants more flexible in order, through the commitology, to find horizontal solutions. </p>
<p class="contents">The proposed programme was then blocked in the Council until, under the German Presidency, it resulted in a Common Position’s being adopted on 28 June, based on a proposed five-year programme involving EUR 350 million. That corresponds to an expenditure of less than EUR 0.20 per citizen per year for the youth exchange programme and is in the region of a per mill of the overall budget. I cannot imagine a European family without young people, nor any programme which neglects significant sections of the young population. The European Parliament therefore welcomes the fact that the Common Position in the form of a number of amendments is being passed to ourselves. We have been able, through the programme, to implement respect for human rights and also to combat racism and xenophobia. We have created a situation in which attention has been given to removing discrimination in such a way as to promote equality of opportunity between girls and boys and, in implementing these measures in cooperation with the Commission, the approach is user-friendly and youth oriented. We have succeeded in guaranteeing that the European Voluntary Service does not take the place of any potential or existing paid employment. </p>
<p class="contents">If now, with the unanimous support of Committee 13, I am bringing in further amendments, these relate first and foremost again to funding, duration and prevailing upon Member States to remove obstacles to gaining access to the programme. As the very first priority, social protection and access to medical care for young people must be ensured. Regulations could be laid down in this area, as they have been for student exchanges. It is also a question of introducing a structure for gathering information about young people and for setting up an Internet website for “Youth in Europe” and “Youth for Europe” in order, on an interactive basis, to reach new strata of young Europeans. </p>
<p class="contents">In order to be able to address young citizens directly, the importance of this programme, which is to commence at the beginning of next year, must be clear to everyone involved in the process. The “Socrates” and “Leonardo” programmes have shown that a seven-year programme can be more effective than a programme which runs for just a few years. I therefore recommend that a period of seven years be proposed here and that the financial framework for implementing this programme be set at EUR 980 million. I propose a mid-term review for the middle of the seven-year period, together with an evaluation and reassessment of the youth programme. A prerequisite for the success of the programme is a method of disseminating information which is not only directed at the initiated. We must succeed in getting young people enthusiastic about Europe and helping, for example, to foster in them an appetite for Europe and to mitigate their social or financial problems or the effects of living on the periphery of things. Age limits ought not to be rigidly adhered. The potency and the wealth of Europe lie in its diversity. </p>
<p class="contents">I again appeal to the Member States to make commitments regarding social protection and medical care. We respect the principle of subsidiarity but, in this area, the responsibility of the Member States must also have an effect. It is now a matter of ensuring that deeds follow the fine words spoken at summits. Informal contacts with the Presidency of the Council and with the Commission provide hope of agreement here, for young people and their associations expect not bureaucratic but pragmatic action from the European institutions, as well as cooperation between the latter. As an elected Parliament, we bear a responsibility. </p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I shall do everything humanly possible to find a sustainable compromise, and I urge the Council to approach us, above all when the budget comes round. Europe’s future begins with the youth of today. That must be the message on 1 January when, hopefully, the new programme can come into effect. </p>

As a reminder, I should like again quite briefly to sketch out the new action programme in the youth field for the period 2000 to 2007. The action programme sets out to contribute to the realisation of a European sphere of education which promotes lifelong learning and facilitates the unrestricted exercise of citizens’ rights. By means of this action programme, the various programmes in the youth field which there have been so far ought to be brought together in concentrated form, as the rapporteur has just said. </p>
<p class="contents">Although the new action programme is to take the various programmes there have been so far and bring them together in concentrated form, no single programme is to be preferred. Parliament has already approached the Commission to see to it that the relationship of the one programme to another is well-balanced, thereby guaranteeing a better distribution of financial resources. In this way, the new action programme will, in some ways, be easier to take an overview of and also, therefore, more citizen-friendly than the numerous youth programmes that are all too scattered.</p>
<p class="contents">A further advantage for citizens is the considerable decentralisation of the youth programme which therefore also enables young people to take part in the programmes in their home areas. I think this is very important because it also provides an opportunity for contact with Europe for young people in whom an interest in this area has not been inculcated at home. The earlier young people get together with people of other nationalities in Europe, the sooner they will take an active part in the integration of Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">The youth action programme also promotes the integration of Europe in a further sense by including the applicant countries in the East, Cyprus, Malta and Turkey. In this way, young people have the opportunity to become aware of the cultural diversity, not only of those States which are already members of the European Community, but also of those which are still on the borders of this Community but large groups of whose populations already live in various Member States. This state of affairs in turn has a positive effect upon the struggle for the respect of human rights and against racism, exaggerated nationalism and anti-Semitism. In this way, young people actively contribute to the construction and integration of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">By contributing to programmes with participants from various Member States, young people discover the real Europe in its social and cultural diversity and become alert to new surroundings, something which greatly increases the incentive to learn a foreign language. For a programme of seven years’ duration, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport requires an overall financial package of EUR 980 million. However, the Council is only prepared to approve exactly half of the amount we requested. I believe that I do not have to repeat yet again here that this sum is in fact spread over seven years, meaning an annual amount of EUR 140 million. As Mrs Gröner has already quite rightly said, this money is not being invested just anywhere but in the future of Europe, a future which lies with the youth of Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">The education of European youth is not an area in which money-saving measures are to be taken. It is therefore important that Parliament should agree to the programme with a large majority so that we can enter into negotiations with the Council with definite backing. </p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Taylor (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, the Youth programme has been one of the most successful programmes in getting people from different nationalities to work together and learn from each other. If I can take Scotland, which I represent, as an example, there have been hundreds of Youth programmes benefiting thousands of Scots. For example, in Fort William in the Highlands of Scotland, a Youth group interested in outdoor projects developed a cross-country ski programme with Slovakian counterparts. In Dundee an exchange of views and experiences has developed with a Spanish project concerning the current problems being experienced by young people. In West Lothian a project has been developed on street work with a partnership from Munich. In fact only yesterday a group from the Lothians were here listening to a debate in this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">To end my list of examples: a link between Larkhall in Lanarkshire and a French programme where young people have contributed to the construction of a cycle path in the south of Scotland. From youth work to cross-country skiing, from cycle paths to street work, the issues are as diverse as the participants. And if this is just a small number of examples of how the Youth programme has worked in Scotland, just think what an impact the Youth programme has had across the EU and the potential of what it can achieve in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">However, funding for the Youth programme is not just critical, it is paramount. Young people like myself are the Europeans of the present and the future. We are the first generation to relate to a European identity as well as our own national ones. If these very institutions which we are members of are to have relevance today as well as tomorrow, funding of the Youth programme is essential. I encourage Members to go back to their constituencies and to speak to the organisers, participants and beneficiaries of this work, the work which brings the basic ideas of the European ideal to local communities: the ideal of people from different nationalities working together for the benefit of the common good.</p>

I see cross-border youth exchange programmes as a good opportunity for young people to get to know each other’s cultures, at the same time making a contribution to the edifice of Europe. They enable young people to gain greater awareness of the differences in their surroundings and make it possible for mutual trust to grow, which lessens fear of anything that is unfamiliar. This increases people’s tolerance and their willingness to cooperate and show solidarity. In short, democracy is strengthened and that is what Europe needs. Money is needed for this, on a large scale even, in view of the importance of the programme. But the liberal group feels nonetheless that this programme too must stay within the financial framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would just like to emphasise here how important it is to have good communication with young people. The communication medium par excellence is, of course, the Internet. That is why an Internet site “Youth for Europe” is an absolute must. Young people will then be able to read about all kinds of European and national activities in the field of education, training, sport, media, leisure, and so on and so forth. The possibilities are there, use them. In this way young people will become well informed by doing something which is very appealing to them, that is surfing the digital highway. I expect it to be a website that is challenging, innovative and highly accessible.</p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, the programme must be set up soon. Mrs Gröner was right not to submit too many amendments so as to enable agreement with the Council to be reached quickly. Consequently, the vast majority of the liberal group intends to support her in all aspects of her work, in which it has every confidence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our young people must feel integrated, not separated by borders, and have a more open, free mentality. In short, they must gain that ability to adapt and that speed in cultural exchange, training and professional experience which are increasingly necessary elements in the society of the next millennium. </p>
<p class="contents">“Youth” is a programme which will be able to achieve these aims. Above all, it allows the least well-off and most disadvantaged young people to have experiences of other countries which could prove decisive when they enter the job market. It is therefore a priority to ensure, as highlighted by the rapporteur, a greater diffusion of the programme and to make sure that, in future, Community actions like this one will not remain a privilege for a minority because of a lack of information. </p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with criticisms that the Council has not been willing to increase the budget, which is necessary for equal opportunities of access to the programme. Moreover, it is incredible that full protection of the participants cannot be ensured as far as social protection and medical assistance is concerned. To conclude, I would like to emphasise that in a society which is leaning towards telematics networks and the Internet, and which increasingly invests in their use, for communication, information and services, it is almost ridiculous that the Council has not accepted the amendments on the creation of an Internet site dedicated entirely to young people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As regards an analysis of the factors which have promoted or hampered the social integration of young people, I believe it is essential to include an analysis of the role of the family or lack of family in the young person’s development. In the Council of Europe report on Coherent and Integrated Family Policies it states: “Families play a primary role in socialisation because they communicate the values, standards, customs and behaviour of the social group to which their children belong. Presumably a lack of family structure will also affect the child’s socialisation.”</p>
<p class="contents">Whether a child is raised within or without a family, both circumstances will have a profound effect upon that child’s social development. Therefore reference to the role of the family should be, I believe, included in the European Community Youth Programme, which hopes to analyse the factors which have promoted or hampered the social integration of young people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet this programme is about investing in our future, investing in young people who will become, as we have heard today, the Europeans of tomorrow. Through these action programmes we will change young lives, offering hope and options where before there were none.</p>

<p class="contents">Finally, it is rather apt, following Mrs Scallon, that I say this: let us remind ourselves in this House that these young people will become the generation that finally rid our continent of racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia and the other discriminations which shame us all!</p>
<p class="contents">It is our duty to support this report and to support the youth programmes. And I would point out to Mrs Scallon that the term “Family” has been used politically to exclude more people than it has ever been used to include. I congratulate the rapporteur.</p>

I would like to say to her that the birth of the euro is a very important thing for us young people too.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community’s Youth Action programme is one of the most important programmes targeted at the citizens of the European Union. It has been a success both in the operational sense and with regard to its publicity value. Although Parliament also decides the framework and main policies of the programme, it is important to remember that the successful implementation of programmes can only be carried out at national level. In the implementation of the Youth programme the Member States must allow for sufficient leeway and provide the necessary support.</p>
<p class="contents">The Youth programme, despite its success, is not ready or complete. The programme’s application procedure has to be further clarified and be made more user-friendly, which is what has already been said here. The problems of youth programmes often originate in the fact that there is an attempt to reach as large a target group as possible with different sector programmes. In this way we try to make it possible for people who are as young as possible to take advantage of the programmes. Experience, however, has shown that a target group that is too heterogeneous increases the amount of administrative work required to assess applications and might even adversely affect the chances of certain special groups to use the programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Youth programme evaluation must clearly be improved. We have to make more use of the ideas of national players in the implementation of programmes. Programme evaluation should also pay attention to the programme’s cost-effectiveness. For example, the group meeting sector programme is considerably cheaper than the European voluntary service and, furthermore, a greater number of young people derive benefit from the group meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">Sport has been included as an added dimension to the Youth programme. This is an important step forward. Before the programme is implemented, we must, however, be clear about what sort of sports the Youth programme funds may be spent on. Funds must be targeted mainly at emphasising the educational dimension of sport. Programme resources can easily be used up in mere sporting events unless restrictions are imposed.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An hour ago, someone in my Group said: “Fatuzzo, you must have bumped your head – you are from the Pensioners’ Party and are speaking about the youth programme!”. Yes, two days ago I did indeed have a slight accident, but that is not why I am talking about the youth programme. I am speaking about it because I want people to know that in Italy, the Pensioners’ Party and the pensioners – and I think all Europe’s elderly people too – agree with this youth programme, and are in favour of young people meeting each other, learning languages, going from Ireland to Italy, to Portugal, to Finland. This programme is extremely important because it brings Europe to young people. However, I also tried replacing the word “young” with “elderly” in the programme we are discussing today and I saw a wonderful project appearing, which would be worthwhile too, because it is true, as Mr Taylor said, that this is the first generation who have a European identity and, as Mrs Gröner said, that the future of Europe starts with the young. But the elderly who constructed Europe – do we think about them sometimes? Well, I am taking the adoption of this youth programme as a starting point to say: “Build, let us build together a programme for cultural exchange among the elderly too!”. Maybe we will not spend a billion in seven years, given the age of the elderly, but seven billion in one year. It is not very much, but it certainly is positive.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> I must also highlight the very positive attitude of the Finnish Presidency, which has also done its best to ensure that work progresses, and I think that the cooperation established between the two institutions in order to take the negotiation forwards as quickly as possible is quite exemplary.</p>
<p class="contents">As the point has been raised, I would like to inform you, on the subject of information on the “Youth” programmes, that the Eurodesk network, a combination of Internet sites and youth advisory services, is available in all the countries of the Union and in all its languages. This is a first step towards achieving what Parliament is requesting and I shall say, for the sake of the anecdote, that it is a programme that was developed on the basis of a Scottish project. This shows that the things that work well in the regions are taken up by the Commission. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to tell you that the Commission is receptive to the conclusions of the report that your Parliament has produced. I am therefore able to accept almost all of the amendments. The 13 amendments tabled by Mrs Gröner will be totally or partially accepted at second reading. </p>
<p class="contents">We rejected certain parts of amendments for what are basically institutional reasons. This is the case, for example, regarding the interinstitutional declaration on the significance of the sums deemed necessary, amendment 9 part 3. One aspect of the amendment may also concern implementation. I am thinking here of amendment 12, part 2. </p>
<p class="contents">Concerning finances, I have listened very closely to what you have said and I agree with you. As you know, in the initial proposal, and in accordance with the priorities established in Agenda 2000, the Commission proposes a financial package of EUR 600 million over a period of five years. Given that I agree with your amendment to extend the period from five to seven years, we will of course have to review the sum provided by the budget accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, like your rapporteur, that in order to maintain consistency between the programmes on education, training and youth, we must extend the length of the period from five to seven years. I have indeed just confirmed this. I also consider it essential to find a solution to the obstacles that remain in the area of youth mobility, whilst of course respecting each State’s own competences. This is why we are able to accept amendments 2, 3 and 6. Besides, some amendments provide useful clarification for the text of the Council’s common proposal and we feel able to accept these too. These are amendments 1, 4, 5, 9 part 2, 10, 11, 12 part 1, as well as amendment 13, tabled by Mrs Gröner and Mrs Scallon. </p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that article 7 concerning the programming committee will have to take into account the new decision on commitology. We are thus able to accept, in principle, amendments 7 and 8, as long as the appropriate wording can be found of course. </p>
<p class="contents">In order to follow up this report, I am intending to propose to the Commission that we adopt a modified proposal on the basis of the amendments that we can accept. We will present this modified proposal to the Commission before the Council meeting due to take place on 23 November in order to assist the Ministers for Youth in reaching a decision. </p>
<p class="contents">As you well know, ladies and gentlemen, we still have a small battle to fight, but I remain confident in the objectives and stakes of the “Youth” programmes, and I have no doubts that these objectives will be accepted just as completely by the Council and by the Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">I must tell you how delighted I have been to note the enthusiasm that has been expressed here, the enthusiasm with which young and not so young Members have committed themselves to ensuring that the youth of our continent may, in future – even more so than in the past, because everyone was also in agreement in pointing out that the “Youth” programme has already given a great deal to millions of young people – build on what has already been well done. </p>
<p class="contents">Young people are our present. Together with us they are building the future. They are building their future. With this programme we will be giving them a helping hand. I thank you, on behalf of the young people of Europe, for having contributed towards giving them this helping hand. </p>
