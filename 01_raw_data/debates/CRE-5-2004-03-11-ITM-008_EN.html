Its low- and medium-frequency pulses can disturb cetaceans and there is also information to suggest that these sounds may impact on other types of fish and their behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">European legislation – particularly the Habitats Directive – obliges EU Member States to take the necessary measures to establish a system of strict protection for all cetaceans present in European waters. Nevertheless, in the absence of an exhaustive and authorised analysis taking up all the information available in relation to the effects of sonar, it is extremely difficult to adopt a clear position on it.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue was raised by the Commission at the meeting of the Habitats Committee on 20 November 2002 and the highly complex information subsequently obtained from the Member States and regional marine environment organisations in this regard must be considered together with additional scientific studies.</p>
<p class="contents">On 25 September 2003, the Commission asked a specialised and independent scientific body – the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, in Denmark – to produce a report and a scientific evaluation of all the relevant information regarding the effects of sonar on cetaceans and fish, to highlight the gaps in our current knowledge and to produce recommendations with regard to future research.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also interested in hearing points of view on other possible measures which may reduce the effect of sonar on this type of marine animal.</p>
<p class="contents">Only on the basis of solid scientific information will it be possible to determine at Community level, in a coherent and cooperative manner, the measures necessary in order not to disturb cetaceans by means of sonar related activities, guaranteeing compliance with the provisions of our Habitats Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission is aware of the possible effects of military activities on the environment but it is not possible to take more Community measures to regulate the development of new military technologies owing to the lack of Union competences in this specific area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In January last year my oral question to the Commission on the environmental impact of the LFAS radar system was discussed. Commissioner Solbes Mira, you promised then that the Commission would send all the Member States a communication on the matter. Thank you for saying that the possible adverse effects on the environment of radar equipment contravene the Habitats Directive on the protection of nature. The Commission stated that action must be taken to look into the effects of LFAS. It is good that the matter is making progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Last October, as part of a delegation from Parliament, we handed in a petition on this issue signed by 85 000 people and 68 environmental organisations at NATO’s headquarters in Brussels. In the wake of this initiative, more scientific evidence on the matter was also obtained. Recently, Nature magazine published an article on the subject which made a reference to 14 whales that beached in the Canary Islands last year in September, all of which died. At the same time naval exercises were being undertaken in the area, and four hours after they had begun the whales started to beach themselves. They were found to have suffered from serious haematomas, damage to the liver and internal organs. and they showed signs of divers’ disease, as it is known.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore continue to appeal to the NATO member states that they should restrict the use of radar systems until their environmental effects and connection with the recent whale deaths have been fully investigated. Low-frequency radar systems developed by the United States of America and the NATO countries might be causing whales to stray onto beaches and doing damage to their internal organs leading to death. The high-decibel and low-frequency sound of the radar can travel thousands of kilometres in the sea. The United States has been developing the LFAS system since the 1980s to watch submarines that use new technology, which are hard to see using the former passive radar systems. The monitoring of territorial waters is a legitimate objective, but the harmful effects of the LFAS system does not seem justified. Alternative technologies should therefore be developed.</p>
<p class="contents">Whale deaths have occurred in areas where the United States has tested the system. In March 2000, in the Bahamas, 17 whales were beached and eight of them died at the same time as the navy’s radar system was being tested at sea. Post mortems conducted on the dead whales revealed haematomas in their brains and inner ears produced by extremely loud noise. The US navy stated in its report on the Bahamas case that the radar system had been the most likely cause of death. Loud noise drove the whales onto the beach, where they died of heatstroke and finally, also, of internal haematomas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Medina Ortega (PSE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, the issue we are dealing with has been occupying the European Parliament for years, although with low intensity. That is, there is a European Parliament Resolution from 1999 on the effects of military technology on the environment and, in relation to this specific issue, there are a couple of written questions to the Commission, the first presented by Mr Sturdy and replied to by Mr Busquin, which indicated that no aid had been requested for research into this issue, and the second, subsequently, by Mrs Caroline Lucas, replied to by Commissioner Wallström, on the effect of low-frequency sonar.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Wallström has agreed – or at least Mr Solbes now agrees with what she told us at the time – that this issue falls within the scope of the Habitats Directive. That is to say that the Community has some competence in this area, even though it is of a military nature.</p>
<p class="contents">We must remember that at the moment the United States federal courts have issued a ban against the US Navy to prevent it from using high-power and low-frequency sonar in the Pacific Ocean, in order to prevent damage to marine fauna.</p>
<p class="contents">As my predecessor, Mrs Korhola, pointed out, NATO military operations were carried out in 2002 with the participation of European Union ships in waters of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote and as a result 14 whales were beached.</p>
<p class="contents">Studies have been carried out by two professors, one from the University of London, Mr Paul Jepson, and the other by Mr Fernández from the University of Las Palmas, published in ‘Nature’ magazine in November 2003, which highlight the effect of sonar operations on whales. They apparently produce disorientation in whales which makes them surface suddenly; this gives rise to the phenomenon of decompression, nitrogen accumulates in the whales’ blood and this produces the classic phenomenon of the bends. In other words, from a scientific point of view the connection is proven.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about a species of small whales, similar to dolphins, beaked whales, which are in a very desperate situation and the question we are currently asking is what is this military technology for? Because the reason why the United States are developing this new low-frequency sonar is in order to detect silent submarines which only they manufacture. In other words, if no other country in the world currently has the technology to manufacture these silent submarines, what is the point in our ships, which belong to NATO and are linked to the United States Navy, developing this technology?</p>
<p class="contents">Immediate damage is being done to these species. I believe that the Commissioner has replied correctly, but, in view of the scientific studies we already have and the existence of that European Parliament Resolution of 1999 – which the Commissioner knows about since he knows the waters I am talking about very well – I believe the time has come for the Commission to consider the possibility of taking initiatives which, within the context of maintaining the Commission’s competences, allow the Community institutions to deal with this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner knows, the European Union is currently heading towards some type of defence and security policy. At least it is already included in the Union Treaty, and I believe that, within the framework of this Union defence and security policy, we must also consider the negative effects of such a policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that this first Commission statement will mark the start of a new Community policy and that, at least during the next legislature, this Parliament will receive some indication from the Commission about the direction we are taking. On the basis of the study in ‘Nature’ magazine by Professors Jepson and Fernández, I have the impression that, from a scientific point of view, the effects of this low-frequency sonar on the survival of cetacean species is clear.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have to begin to recommend concrete measures, calling on the States, at least within the framework of intergovernmental cooperation, to take account of these conclusions in order to contribute to maintaining our already suffering marine fauna. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, as the two Members who spoke before me mentioned, this question has been discussed here, in this House, on several occasions and we have already been told, in particular by Commissioner Solbes Mira, that we needed more information. We learn today that a study has been commissioned by a Danish organisation, but it could end up seeming rather odd that additional information has been so long in coming.</p>
<p class="contents">In actual fact, if we apply the precautionary principle in accordance with the Treaties, we already have enough proof of serious risk ensuing from the use of these sonars, in particular for whales. This justifies the immediate establishment of a moratorium on their use, in order to collect the necessary information to establish additional scientific proof. Do we really have to wait for the worst-case scenario to happen before we do something?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are well aware of the worrying state of fish stocks today, both in Europe and on a global scale. It is not surprising that we have heard that there are elements indicating that the signals sent by these low-frequency sonars affect the movements of shoals of fish, which could carry them to dangerous zones that threaten their very existence. Can we allow ourselves the luxury of developing and using a technology that, when it is tested in peacetime, risks worsening the situation of the disappearance of fish stocks?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the EU has taken the first steps towards a common defence policy and also a common arms industry. This will without a doubt impact on European research, industrial policy and the general development of the EU. At a time when our societies are showing a growing demand for environmentally friendly solutions, we must prove that Europe, in pursuing the Lisbon objectives, is capable of being a world leader in sustainable technologies. Will we be able to do so if we are incapable of effectively reacting to the development of the use of technologies that are as suspect as low-frequency sonars?</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, it is imperative, if development is to be environmentally, socially and economically sustainable, that we do all we can as MEPs to influence, with the means available, the basic joint decisions that are being taken in the area of the arms industry. This is why I am strongly calling on Members to support my proposal to conclude this debate with a resolution in our next part-session, here, in Strasbourg. This is the only way that Parliament will have a significant position to communicate to the various actors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are aware that the scientific evidence of the problems caused by this kind of sonar is increasing. Nevertheless, we believe it is essential to carry out a more exhaustive analysis of the current scientific knowledge, which will undoubtedly incorporate the progress already made – such as that mentioned by Mr Medina Ortega in relation to the article by Professors Jepson and Fernández.</p>
<p class="contents">When taking decisions, the Commission will undoubtedly have to consider the aspects within its competence, national responsibility in relation to habitats directives and the Member States’ margin for manoeuvre in applying the precautionary principle and, unquestionably, the specific reservations on military issues which must not stop us from insisting that NATO and the military authorities pay due attention to these problems, particularly in relation to those cases which do not raise specific problems in the short term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
