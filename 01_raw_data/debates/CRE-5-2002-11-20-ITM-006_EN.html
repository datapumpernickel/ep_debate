<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Haarder,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, just over three years ago General Musharraf took power in Pakistan in a military coup. This caused great concern in the democratic world and led to much condemnation. The coup was later approved by the Pakistan Supreme Court provided that Pakistan re-established democracy within three years of the military coup, that is, by 12 October this year.</p>
<p class="contents">On 14 August last year, General Musharraf published his so-called ‘Road Map To Democracy’, which described how he proposed to comply with the decision of the Pakistan Supreme Court and restore democracy in Pakistan. This plan was made up of four parts: 1) the establishment of local elected councils (this took place in August 2001), 2) preparation for provincial and federal elections with the establishment of an electoral commission and the preparation of registers of electors, ID cards etc., as well as the implementation of a number of constitutional amendments, 3) the holding of the actual elections, and 4) the transfer of governmental power to elected civil provincial and federal assemblies, as well as election of the presidents of the assemblies, etc. This was to take place in October/November this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The election on 10 October this year was monitored by election observers, especially from the EU. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Cushnahan for the great work that he and the other members of the Mission carried out in this connection. For security reasons alone, it was extremely difficult to implement the election monitoring but, despite this, Mr Cushnahan and his team completed the task that they had been given.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Cushnahan has remarked in his report on the election monitoring, there are a number of things in connection with the election in Pakistan that one might have wished had been different. We have noted in particular the report’s criticism of the circumstances in the run-up to the actual elections, especially the constitutional amendments introduced by President Musharraf this summer. There were unequal opportunities to conduct election campaigns and unequal access to resources and to the media, and there were reports of manipulation in connection with the elections. Taken together, these factors gave cause for concern.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, it is the Council’s assessment that the holding of the elections was an important step along the way towards the restoration of democracy in Pakistan. Throughout the process, the EU has conducted an ongoing dialogue with Pakistan concerning the reintroduction of democracy and, in the course of this, has also had the opportunity to express criticism of factors which have moved in the wrong direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The result of the election of 10 October meant that a coalition government is to be formed. Negotiations are not yet complete. The transfer of executive power to the future prime minister is expected to take place in the course of this month.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and Pakistan issued a joint declaration on signing the cooperation agreement between the EU and Pakistan in Islamabad on 24 November last year. In the light of the current situation, the EU and Pakistan confirmed the importance of the international efforts to combat terrorism. In the same declaration, Pakistan also confirmed its commitment to the restoration of democracy in accordance with the said Road Map, something which was welcomed by the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be stated that President Musharraf has stood by his promise to implement the promised Road Map. The conditions are thus in place for taking the agreement further. Also on the positive side is the fact that the President has implemented a number of reforms aimed at re-establishing the economy and combating corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial to state that implementation of the cooperation agreement does not rubber-stamp Pakistan’s democracy. As I have mentioned, there are many things that we might wish were different, as can be seen from Mr Cushnahan’s report. The agreement includes an initial paragraph in which the parties to the agreement confirm their respect for human rights. With this agreement in our hands, I believe that we have a better instrument with which to discuss democracy and human rights with Pakistan than has previously been the case. The Council will continue to expand the dialogue with Pakistan with a view to helping strengthen Pakistan’s democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">With these words, I would like, moreover, once again to thank Mr Cushnahan for his outstanding work and for the basis he has provided for assessing the democracy in Pakistan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Madam President, the Commission agrees with the Presidency that the National and Provincial Assembly elections held in Pakistan on 10 October should be seen as a first step in the gradual transition from a military to a civilian administration with permanent and well-functioning democratic institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The elections resulted in a fragmented parliament which in turn delayed the inaugural session of the National Assembly. This finally took place on 16 November. The extensive negotiations among political parties demonstrate that a revitalised democratic process has been initiated following the elections. We expect that the new government will be equipped with full executive powers. The Commission will continue to stay engaged with Pakistan throughout the transition process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would like to congratulate the EU election observation mission, led by Mr Cushnahan, on the excellent work achieved under very difficult circumstances, notably a particularly challenging security environment. His dedication went far beyond what would normally be expected of a chief election observer.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission appreciates that the mission was able to carry out its task in full compliance with internationally accepted criteria used for election observation.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also take this opportunity to express the Commission’s satisfaction with the cooperation with the European Parliament in the observation of the election in Pakistan. In particular I would like to thank the members of the European Parliament delegation, led by Mrs Grönfeldt Bergman, for their invaluable work.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, this is not an isolated case. The Commission and Parliament have developed very good working relations in the field of election observation in general.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that the presence of the EU election observation mission has served to enhance the democratic process in Pakistan. Moreover, its recommendations on how to further strengthen this process and improve the election framework will be raised in the dialogue with the Pakistani authorities. The Commission is also prepared to look into possible follow-up activities on the basis of its report. The Commission agrees with the EU election observation mission that a general election does not in itself guarantee the establishment of democracy and that those who support the restoration of democracy should work together to achieve that objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the methodology we applied to observation of the election in Pakistan, the Commission would like to stress that we followed our standard approach. Elections are not one-day events and the whole process, including the pre-voting period, has to be assessed. The criticism made in Pakistan that the mission was exceeding its mandate because it arrived too early and interfered with the internal affairs of the country by analysing the overall election framework is therefore groundless.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the new cooperation agreement between the European Community and Pakistan is concerned, the Commission would like to recall that exceptional circumstances in the region called for a response commensurate to the risk President Musharraf took in siding with the international community on Afghanistan. The aim of the agreement is to engage significantly and visibly with Pakistan, both in political and economic terms, and to encourage Pakistan to adhere to the implementation of the roadmap for the return to democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The reasons why it is important for the EU and the Commission to engage Pakistan in an enhanced political dialogue are well known. They include the fight against terrorism, Pakistan’s difficult relations with India, the need for stability in neighbouring Afghanistan, Pakistan’s deep-rooted economic and social problems and, last but not least, the continuing transition to democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Relevant topics to be raised in that dialogue include basic education, where our aim is to strengthen the secular education system, fostering trade and business links and human rights issues, which are an essential element of the new agreement. In this connection, Pakistan has been designated a focus country under the European Initiative for Human Rights and Democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware that continuing uncertainty over the role and functioning of political institutions in Pakistan means that we need to monitor closely whether there is genuine progress on the transfer of power to the elected parliament in the coming weeks and months. Ratification of the new cooperation agreement would allow us to re-establish the full cooperation dialogue with the new government.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cushnahan (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, first of all I would like to pay tribute to all who served on the recent EU election observation mission to Pakistan, particularly the members of my core team and also the European Parliament delegation led by Miss Grönfeldt Bergman.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to thank the EU Commission personnel involved in election observation.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I would like to express my appreciation for the moral support and political solidarity extended by Commissioner Patten.</p>
<p class="contents">Regrettably, I am unable to add the name of the Council and the Presidency to the list of those I would like to thank. The reason is that I am very angry at the statement issued by the Presidency concerning the election and I regret that the same sentiments were expressed today. I would like to seek clarification on aspects of the statement. How can the Presidency commend the Pakistan authorities for their cooperation with the mission when it was fully aware that we never received a formal invitation from the authorities and that they also refused to sign a memorandum of understanding, including an agreement to provide security cover.</p>
<p class="contents">This information was officially reaffirmed in a <span class="italic">démarche</span> to the Danish Presidency six weeks after we arrived in Pakistan. The Presidency should also have been aware of the public attacks on the EOM by several government ministers, using such inflammatory language as 'these Western whites have no interest in peace in Pakistan; these people come from unfriendly nations and have hostile objectives; this Mission is interfering in the internal affairs of Pakistan'. How can you regard this as cooperation?</p>
<p class="contents">Security cover was indeed finally provided for the second half of our mission, but it came from the provincial governors and not from the federal authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in its statement the Presidency expresses 'concern' about reports of manipulation – very mild indeed – and you ask the Election Commission to follow up such complaints.</p>
<p class="contents">Did you actually read our report? Surely you are aware that we expressed serious criticism of the Election Commission and its lack of independence? To ask the Election Commission to investigate election malpractice is like asking Saddam Hussein to head the UN weapons inspection team in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind the Council that the mission I led was not a Parliament mission, it was an EU mission consisting of 88 dedicated people, who discharged their task professionally in line with internationally accepted criteria for election observation. As you and the Commissioner have said, they worked in a particularly sensitive political and security environment at great personal risk to themselves. Yet within four days of our preliminary report being published in Islamabad you effectively distanced yourself from our conclusions that it was a seriously flawed process.</p>
<p class="contents">You did so despite the fact that Member States received full weekly reports of our observations. I and members of my core team also briefed heads of mission in Islamabad on a weekly basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet never once did anyone challenge our ongoing assessment. And even at the final debriefing of heads of mission in Islamabad, little or no opposition to our analysis was expressed.</p>
<p class="contents">Ironically, by comparison, the Presidency strongly criticised the elections in Togo on 27 October, where there was no EU observation mission, yet you chose to ignore the conclusion of the Pakistan mission that had been operating for two and a half months.</p>
<p class="contents">Why was the initial draft of your reaction to the election toned down? Who influenced you? Who pressurised you?</p>
<p class="contents">And because your statement is being used by Pakistan's embassies worldwide to undermine our report, you betrayed the EU mission you sent into the field and I say on their behalf, shame on you.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to take the opportunity to refute the untrue allegation made by the Pakistan ambassador in Washington that the EU/EOM leaked an interim briefing report. In fact this was leaked by an Islamabad-based diplomat for a Member State government, who was in Europe at the time, and was designed to undermine the work of the EU/EOM.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning to your reaction, not only does your response betray the EU/EOM, it is a betrayal of the interests of the people of Pakistan, especially those who are courageously working for the restoration of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Your failure to endorse the conclusions of the EU/EOM and other observer groups such as ANFREL, NDI and the Commonwealth, compounds your predecessor's mistake in failing to criticise the farcical presidential referendum and is directly responsible for encouraging the Government of Pakistan to behave as it does.</p>
<p class="contents">But as well as betraying the EU/EOM and ordinary Pakistanis, you are also betraying the ideals of your own Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind you that in your own Presidency programme, you set yourself the twin tasks of 'increased effectiveness and greater openness in the field of human rights'. The statement on the Pakistan election showed little commitment to this.</p>
<p class="contents">But worst of all, tailoring your response for geopolitical reasons was a total betrayal of the principles underlying election observation, which is designed to enhance democratisation and human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is also clear that, now more than ever, international relations at various levels, including the economic and commercial levels, must involve honouring commitments that have been given and the careful management of expectations. We all welcomed the support given by the President of Pakistan to the fight against terrorism, which has helped to soften an extremely negative image created by the military coup that removed the elected government led by Nawaz Sharif. We also know that it is impossible to speak of consolidated democracy whilst the military is interfering in the political arena; but we also know from various examples in southern European and Latin American countries, that it is possible to start a process of transition to democracy by making a pact with civilian political representatives, provided that the various phases and arrangements agreed on are respected. It is precisely the respect for these requirements that, in the period of transition to democracy, provides the necessary if insufficient legitimacy for the military to continue in some political role.</p>
<p class="contents">This is precisely where our main concerns lie. In August 2001, the Pakistani president announced the road map for democracy, which included the elections due to take place on 10 October. This was an historic moment. In the end, however, we are sorry to say that this opportunity was largely wasted. We do not wish to issue any kind of judgment on the process of transition to democracy in Pakistan but we can say that this a poor way of promoting it and we hope that the elected members will have the clear-mindedness, the political ability and the courage necessary to lead a new phase of genuine transition to a democratic political power. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although I understand some of the concerns of the people who wrote this resolution, especially in the run-up to the election in Pakistan, particularly that anyone standing for election should have to have a university degree, I do not agree with them.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that President Musharraf took over in a coup. But let me make it clear for the record that this was a bloodless coup; political parties were not banned and no restrictions were placed on the media. Yes, the legal framework order was reintroduced by the president, giving him powers to dismiss the parliament. But my understanding is that such powers exist in some EU countries. The French president, for instance, can dissolve parliament. I think we are looking at it too much from a European perspective. There have been allegations of corruption for centuries in Pakistan.</p>
<p class="contents">These elections are a step in the right direction. The fact that many who oppose President Musharraf were elected surely speaks for itself. All parties in Pakistan welcomed these elections. They have just elected a Speaker. They are about to elect a prime minister. President Musharraf actually met his commitment – as the Council said – to hold these elections. Let us now look forward instead of looking back. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are times when our certainties or our model of democracy disregard the historical and political context of European integration and new forms of an old colonialism can appear, creating mistrust and feelings of injured dignity, or even injured sovereignty.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that democracy is measured not just on election day but on the basis of effective grass-roots participation, civil liberties, equal opportunities, justice and development. Having said that, I do not in the least intend to give up the widely – and internationally – shared view that human rights are universal, which is why no specific context can justify the death penalty, whether in Pakistan or in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">I took part in the election mission to Pakistan led by Mr Cushnahan, to whom we must all be grateful – I am, at least – for the rigorous and thorough nature of his work. I agree with the EU report and the criticisms it contains not so much about the day of the elections, which, as far as I could see, were carried out correctly – we were given a very good reception by the people and the electoral representatives, and, moreover, I am talking about Peshawar, an area where the Islamic religious party prevailed – but rather the entire electoral process, with its restrictions and the erroneous decision to allow only those with a degree to stand as candidates.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the transition from military domination to democratically elected political representation will be difficult: the path of democracy in Pakistan is difficult and, without a doubt, is hindered by the military. I also think it will be extremely difficult to eradicate corruption and poverty, which goes hand in hand with its defeat, and I say so because I myself come from a country that is not poor but where there is still, in actual fact, a lot of corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we must make a major effort in the fields of cooperation and trade and carry out political analysis in the areas of development and education, and I also believe that the human rights of all people should be upheld, even those accused of terrorism. We must therefore call upon the Pakistan Government to comply with the international treaties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Pakistan is now a nuclear power that is even engaging in trade in nuclear technology, if you include North Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">The war in Afghanistan was pretty much an acid test for Pakistan, and I believe that it was only the current regime, the Musharraf regime, that made the anti-terror coalition possible in Pakistan at all. The Kashmir problem has not gone away, and it is one of the major focuses of conflict in Asia. Unfortunately, the anti-terror strategy has meant encroaching upon human rights and slowing down the process of democratisation in Pakistan, as has regrettably been the case in many other countries as well.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part – and in saying this I am simply describing the situation and not wishing to be judgmental – the Musharraf regime is essentially a consequence of the fact that there was previously a string of corrupt governments.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the view that we have heard expressed here: Pakistan has for generations been run by corrupt governments whose leadership of the state has given no evidence of responsibility. That meant that military governments repeatedly came to power. All those governments made a show of democratisation for the benefit of the West and at the same time had to keep the extremists at home happy. That was bound to lead to tensions. One comment about the election: we know that only about 30% of Pakistan's population voted, for a variety of reasons. In Baluchistan and in the north-west of the country, religious fundamentalists were the victors in the election. That is a problem, because it means the country is becoming more and more unstable. The MMA, the party that brings together the various fundamentalist strands, will create problems for Musharraf and for the government that is to be formed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am particularly pleased and happy with the statement made by the Commission. I very carefully note the balance and the content and I say to the Commission representative here this afternoon that it is a statement that is exceptionally relevant to the situation that developed.</p>
<p class="contents">I say to the Council that I expected more. I expected honesty and I expected the facts. I say to the President of the Council that his statement embarrasses me, and if it does that to me it must surely embarrass our colleague, Mr Haarder, who we all have known and respected as a man of principle and integrity since his time in this House. His statement is totally irrelevant to the true situation that emerged. We have heard from our colleague, Mr Cushnahan, who went there at great personal risk to fulfil a mission, who reported honestly and in a principled fashion on the situation that he witnessed. But before his statement could be taken for what it was worth, it was totally undermined by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Haarder, on behalf of his colleagues in Council, did not tell us on what Council's judgement was based. He said: 'Council's judgment was', and the statement that was issued was 'Council's judgment'. It is most regrettable that the Council described the situation in this way. We all want to see democracy restored in Pakistan.</p>
<p class="contents">The general took over in a coup. Bloodless or not bloodless, a coup is a coup. We in this Parliament decided to terminate our parliamentary relationship with Pakistan. Now we have the chief observer on behalf of the European Union being somewhat rubbished by a statement from the Council, which was excellent in its artful dodging and with no reference to the serious flaws in the electoral process, just a bland reference to the reports of manipulation. Elsewhere the Presidency commends the Pakistan authorities for their cooperation with the observer mission for assuring a widely secure and free election day.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I welcome the statements made by the Commission and Mr Cushnahan, but regretfully the statement made by the Council does this House an injustice because it is an insult to our intelligence and for what we stand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, the genuinely exceptional circumstances in Pakistan and the strategic role it plays in relation to stability in Afghanistan, to the international coalition against terrorism and to the stability of all the countries of Central Asia. However, on the other hand, I do not believe that this fact bears any relation to the internal situation in that country, to the increase in Islamic fundamentalism, the interests and people, our allies, who are being attacked in Afghanistan and the human rights situation in the country. There are horrendous cases such as kidnap, extortion and the captivity of the so-called ‘child jockeys’ and, of course, I am also referring to the result of the evaluation of the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Haarder, you know what affection and respect I have had for you since we worked together in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, but I would like to ask you what the point is in sending a mission of European Union electoral observers, the members of which behave in an exemplary manner at great risk to themselves, to carry out an assessment of the situation which furthermore is shared with other international missions, such as that of the Commonwealth and that of ANFREL, if then the representative of the President-in-Office of the Council fails to authorise it. Do we not already have enough differences in the United Nations Security Council, the General Affairs Council or at European Councils without this further demonstration of disagreement and division?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, Madam President, that we must take note of this attitude and work together to prevent any recurrence of this type of situation which presents an image of total fragmentation which, of course, jeopardises the image and prestige of the European Union abroad. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The eyes of the world have of course been on Pakistan since the General <span class="italic">promised</span> to hold elections within three years of the military coup to restore democracy and civil rule in the country. A tiny, tiny part of this promise has been kept: elections have been held. Simply implementing elections does not, however, guarantee democracy. The circumstances surrounding the election must also be considered – firstly, <span class="italic">before</span> the election in the form of legislative changes to increase the power of the military regime and its entitlement to dissolve parliament and dismiss the government, rule changes which restricted the eligibility of four percent of the population and restrictions on conducting election campaigns.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, <span class="italic">during</span> the election in the form of pressure on individual politicians, different rules for different candidates from different parties, irregularities during the election process and restrictions on people’s opportunities to vote.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, <span class="italic">after </span>the election in the form of a clear unwillingness to hand over power to those elected. This all means, unfortunately, that we now have to admit that this was a missed opportunity to restore democracy in Pakistan.</p>
<p class="contents">The consequences for the people of Pakistan cannot be stressed enough. Unemployment, poverty and illiteracy are increasing. The only path that can lead to better standards of living for the people of Pakistan involves democracy, changing from military rule to civil rule and opportunities for a democratically elected government to implement reforms in the areas of education and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I see it as our duty and responsibility here in the European Parliament clearly and truthfully to report on the circumstances surrounding the election, which we were able to observe through an EU delegation which was there. We must also stress the importance of the work on restoring democracy in Pakistan continuing. I therefore support Mr Cushnahan’s statement here today. The government of Pakistan must be urged to work in a democratic direction, and the EU must continue to keep a close and critical eye on developments in Pakistan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Can it be true that I did not even mention Mr Cushnahan’s criticisms? And I see in the script that in fact I did mention and praise Mr Cushnahan and that I mentioned five vehement points of criticism: 1) the constitutional changes which preceded the election, 2) the unequal access to conduct election campaigns, 3) the unequal access of the political parties to resources, 4) the unequal access to the media, and 5) the reports of manipulation in connection with the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to reiterate my thanks to Mr Cushnahan for the fact that he drew attention to these fundamental faults in the democratic process so clearly. But it may be that what made him and also Mr Collins so angry was my subsequent sentence, and I quote: ‘Nonetheless, it is the Council’s assessment that the holding of the election was an important step along the way towards the restoration of democracy in Pakistan’. That is not a backward-looking sentence; rather, it states that despite everything, we are talking about the step from pure dictatorship to something that is less pure dictatorship, that is, something that also has a democratic element, even with all the criticism that can otherwise be mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we can ask, as Mr Cushnahan does, why the Council should make a declaration at all? But I think it is important to establish – for the sake of future election observers as well – that the EU’s observers act entirely independently of the Council. Thus a declaration by them is also entirely independent. That is how things are and it means that even if the Council has said something, the election observers can say something completely different; and if the election observers have said something, then likewise the Council can choose to refer to this a great deal or a little, can choose to look backwards or forwards. The two parties are independent of each other and I think we should retain that.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the Council found cause to make a declaration in this case must naturally be seen in the light of the following. Since the turn of the year the security situation in the region has severely deteriorated, with extensive build-ups of troops in both India and Pakistan. The situation was so acute that there was an increased risk of war. And both countries have nuclear weapons. The Council has been very much involved in the international work to encourage de-escalation, and in this connection the Council saw the election in Pakistan and the provincial elections in the Indian provinces of Jammu and Kashmir as an important step along the way towards an improvement in the situation. The Council’s declaration also called upon both India and Pakistan to take advantage of the opportunities following the elections to improve their bilateral relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in the light of this hope for the future that the Council’s declaration is to be seen. The Council’s declaration does not diminish Mr Cushnahan’s criticism – absolutely not. I would ask Mr Cushnahan to believe this and take comfort from it, and I would like to assure him that Mr Cushnahan’s criticism has not been weakened in any way by the fact that the Council said what it said. Indeed, the Council refers to the criticism and I referred to the criticism. So can we not now allow each other this: that there is a need for election observers, that there is a need for independent reports which draw attention to everything that is not as it should be. I have mentioned five major points of criticism here, but at the same time in such a crisis-ridden region of the world there is a need for the Council to attempt to find something to hold on to in terms of a little bit of progress which can provide a hope of peace and which at any rate provides a hope of avoiding war.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel strongly that it is possible to work towards both – both towards complete democracy and towards pragmatic attempts to improve the opportunities for peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is important. It also illustrates the professionalism in the way we do this and also in the way we work with the European Parliament. In general we have, over the years, managed to build up a global position as a quality electoral observation party. What has been achieved and contributed in this case certainly adds to our track record.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is important not to confuse the task of election observation with handling the relationship in general, the overall agenda vis-à-vis the country in question.</p>
<p class="contents">I liked what Mrs Lynne said about the process. Very shortly after the signature of the cooperation agreement in November last year when Mr Verhofstadt and President Prodi visited President Musharraf, I visited him on my way back from Afghanistan in the first week of December last year and had a very long and frank exchange with him. I share the view that on balance he seems to be more part of the solution than part of the problem for Pakistan today.</p>
<p class="contents">We must avoid over-simplification. We talk more about democratisation than democracy. Working constructively and consistently on the situation as a whole is a better way of dealing with the problems than dwelling too much on the pure and perfect principles of democracy. That is how we are trying to make a difference in Africa and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make one comment about the cooperation agreement. What we are trying to achieve through the agreement is a contribution to the process of democratisation, to the promotion of economic development and progress. I strongly urge Parliament to see this cooperation agreement as a positive European contribution to stability in the region and to foster the dialogue with President Musharraf and the emerging democratic Pakistani leaders in order to speed up progress. That is the thinking behind the cooperation agreement and I hope Parliament will see it from that point of view. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Would he also accept – and I agree with his point about the strategic importance of Pakistan in the region, especially at this critical time – that failed states, abuse of human rights and abuse of democracy are the very things that feed terrorism? The best way to eradicate terrorism is to restore democracy, rather than turning a blind eye to a military regime that is abusing democracy, wants to retain power and does not want to return it to a civilian administration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
