<p class="contents">As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 1, 2 and 3 will be taken together.</p>
<p class="contents"></p>
<p class="contents">Question No 1 by <span class="bold">Richard Corbett </span>(H−0115/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Cost to the taxpayer of the abolition of duty‐free sales</p>
<p class="contents">In reviewing the decision to phase out duty‐free sales by July 1999, will the Council consider the loss to national exchequers of revenue arising from duty‐free sales and the corresponding benefit of ending duty‐free sales?</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Council aware that, for the UK alone, duty‐free sales account for some GBP 1 billion per annum and that this represents a loss in terms of excise duty and VAT of at least an equal amount? Is the Council aware that this represents a shortfall of about GBP 40 per taxpayer?</p>
<p class="contents"></p>
<p class="contents">Question No 2 by <span class="bold">Mark Watts </span>(H−0135/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Duty‐free sales</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will present to the ECOFIN Council on 15 March 1999 its report on addressing the employment problems resulting from any abolition of intra‐EU duty‐free sales. This fulfils part of the instructions from the Heads of State at the Vienna Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission does not include the possibility of an extension to the transitional arrangements for duty‐free sales in its report, will the Council Presidency ask the Commission to bring forward proposals for an extension, in order to meet the reference to a possible extension set out in the conclusions of the Vienna Summit?</p>
<p class="contents"></p>
<p class="contents">Question No 3 by <span class="bold">John Cushnahan </span>(H−0179/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Duty‐free</p>
<p class="contents">On 17 February the Commission presented its Communication as a response to the EU leaders' request at the Vienna Summit. In the document the Commission shows an aggregate job loss figure of 56 000 based on figures of direct job losses from 10 Member States and indirect job losses from a mere 7 states. The document subsequently suggests that any potential job losses arising from duty‐free abolition are not ‘significant' and are not of a ‘macro‐economic level'. Does the European Council share this view?</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to welcome Mr Verheugen and ask him to answer these Members' questions together.</p>

The Council will at the same time try to find appropriate ways to deal with this situation on the basis of Commission proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, I can inform the honourable Members that the Council received a Commission communication on this issue on 19 February 1999. The Council would however like to emphasise that when examining this communication it will take into account all relevant aspects of the conclusions of the Vienna Council.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Corbett </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – I should like to thank the President‐in‐Office for that answer. When the Council reviews the decision on duty‐free it will no doubt be looking at the problem raised, rightly, by several governments about the need to have a workable successor regime in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Does he agree that the review should also look at the cost to public finances if the duty‐free regime were to be continued? Duty‐free is a tax break, and a costly tax break, largely for the benefit of the tobacco and alcohol industries. Surely the President‐in‐Office can think of some better causes – if the finance ministers have extra money at their disposal – than a tax break for the tobacco industry and the alcohol industry.</p>

This includes not only the effects of the abolition of duty‐free on the labour market and the economy as a whole, but of course also the consequences of revoking or changing a decision taken in the European Union. So I can reassure you that all aspects will be taken into account, including the question of whether it is correct and justifiable from a social point of view to abolish a privilege that has until now been available to very ordinary people and is the only privilege available to this section of the population. Here I am referring in particular to people who do not have high incomes and usually do not have access to privileges of any kind, be they tax‐related or others. That will also be included in the full examination to be undertaken by the Council this month.</p>

<p class="contents">Would the German presidency explain the details of the German compromise, which we believe is currently under discussion in Council working groups? It would help the House greatly if we could have details of the German compromise proposal tonight, before ECOFIN next week.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, would he comment on what the legal basis would be for the possibility of an extension to the transitional arrangements?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, would he give a view on how, in view of the very tight timescale until the end of June this year and the fact that we have European Parliament elections in the intervening period, the Council and the Commission will be consulting this Parliament on their proposals – which we hope will be forthcoming from ECOFIN or from Berlin – on a extension to the duty‐free regime?</p>

So you can see how important it is in political terms. Considerable time was devoted to the issue both in Vienna and at the Petersberg meeting in Bonn. It is therefore certainly a central issue in European politics. The Federal Chancellor did indeed put forward a German compromise proposal which involves examining whether a one‐off three‐year extension of the duty‐free regime – that was the original proposal – would be possible. We are currently investigating whether a legal basis exists for this. I am not giving anything away if I say that an immediate reaction to this proposal was that we should perhaps also consider extending it for two and a half years or for three and a half years. This has to do with holiday periods in Europe and is related to the timing of the decision. We are currently looking into whether or not this is possible, and I cannot inform you of the outcome of this investigation as it has not yet been concluded.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cushnahan </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Mr President, it is unbelievable that the Commission rejected our claim about job losses and yet in its communication to the Council when seven Member States supplied complete data on direct and indirect job losses it concluded that about 50 000 jobs would be sacrificed on abolition.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind the presidency that at the Bonn Summit the EU Heads of State and of Government quite rightly rejected the Commission's assertion that job losses could be protected by the application of Community funding and state subsidies and that a 30‐month extension would be necessary to identify the problems associated with the post‐duty‐free regime and to put in place a workable solution to protect employees in that sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask the Council to comment on the fact that a growing number of Member States have expressed serious concern regarding the success of the regime, and that the Commission's recent statement that there is unanimous agreement that the current legislation ‘provides a clear, simple and easily enforceable solution" is totally misleading.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><img src="/doceo/data/img/hr.gif" width="100%" height="1" alt="" /></td><td align="right" width="16"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="buttondocwin"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><a href="#top" title="Top"><img src="/doceo/data/img/navi_top.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0" alt="" /></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></table>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Verheugen, </span>  <span class="italic">Council. – (DE)</span> The Council, or rather in this case the presidency, is of course aware of the status of discussions in the Council bodies, and it is also aware of the views of the individual Member States. I have to agree with you that we have a broad spectrum of different opinions, both on what course of action should be taken and on the consequences of the various possible decisions. So there are some Member States who fear enormous negative consequences if we abolish duty‐free, and there are others who say that these consequences will not arise. There are others who say that there will certainly be consequences, but we must ensure that we come up with a way of softening the blow. There is a broad spectrum here.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it makes sense to gather all the facts first and analyse them, and to attempt to reach agreement, which is always very important. We must see whether the facts and figures form a common basis and, if so, we must use this common basis to find a solution. You know what the legal situation is: there is a decision in force, and this would have to be revoked or replaced by another if we now wanted to take a different course of action. This can only be done by unanimous assent. The requirement of unanimity is to be taken particularly seriously in this context as it is a factor that will be relevant in assessing what is to be done. This is also why the Federal Chancellor, in his capacity as Council President, made the compromise proposal I just described, as he recognised or believed it likely that unanimity probably cannot be achieved for an amended decision.</p>

I am grateful to him for reminding us that any prolongation of duty‐free would require unanimity and I sense that unanimity is not likely to be forthcoming.</p>
<p class="contents">May I also remind him that the job losses referred to are widely exaggerated. The figure of 56 000 was referred to in Mr Cushnahan's question. That appears nowhere in the Commission's study and it contrasts with the figure of 120 000 job losses put about by the duty‐free lobby. So, would the President‐in‐Office please give us an undertaking that he and the Federal Finance Minister and the Federal Chancellor will not be persuaded by the powerful lobbying of what Mr Corbett has referred to as the ‘cigarette and alcohol" lobby?</p>

I wonder whether account will be taken of the consequences that will arise if duty‐free is allowed to continue. Will that not destroy many more jobs in small businesses that are not in the right place and do not have the opportunities available to all the other large firms?</p>

It is one of the aspects of a controversy that we could now almost describe as ideologically charged. You noted this yourself very clearly in your question. There are profoundly different views here, including on the structural impact. I do not deny that by any means.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe I can tell you anything other than that it appears to be necessary, before a final decision is taken on whether to extend the transitional arrangements, to ensure that the economic and social consequences of these decisions are clearly identified, in detail and very precisely, so that the decision can be taken responsibly. This must be examined for both options, and in my opinion the examination must include, as you suggested, the actual consequences of the continuation of duty‐free on the SME‐based retail sector, for example, in certain Member States and in the areas in question. There is no doubt that this is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is very difficult to answer, Mr von Habsburg, because some people claim that the sales in question are impulse buys or purchases that are only made because they are available. They will not be substituted by purchases elsewhere. I do not know if it is correct that pensioners will only buy butter and coffee on ships if they are slightly cheaper. But these are all just theories, and we have market research and all sorts of things here, all of which must be examined. I hope that the results will soon be available so that the issue can be resolved before it begins to seriously disrupt European politics.</p>

<p class="contents">My question to the President is this: is he aware of how unbelievably complicated the scheme is going to be if the decision goes ahead to abolish duty‐free sales from 1 July? It will, in fact, mean that different prices for the same product will be charged depending on which airspace or which territorial waters the flight or the vessel is travelling through. What does he propose? I cannot believe he means this regime to be in place in the manner intended.

However, I do not envisage the complication you have just described, particularly not in air travel. We board a plane in A and disembark in B, and if A and B are both within the European Community the problem does not arise, as in this case there can be no duty‐free sales. If B is outside the European Community this opportunity does exist; it is relatively simple. If a ship travels from one EU country to another and in doing so crosses the waters of a third country, it may be somewhat more complicated, and I am not currently in a position to say how we should deal with this problem. However, I do not see a problem for air travel.</p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Increase in parliamentary powers of control through the next amendment of the Treaties</p>
<p class="contents">Discussions in recent weeks have shown that both the EU's institutional order and the actual policies pursued call for a modern system of checks and balances. The European Parliament has proved that it is willing and able, as the Community's only directly legitimised institution, to perform the control tasks demanded by its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The requirement that the Commission resign as a body if a vote of no‐confidence is passed and the European Parliament's lack of authority to dismiss a Member of the Commission from office no longer seem in keeping with the times. The need for individual political accountability requires an adjustment of the legislation concerned.</p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Responsibility of Commissioners</p>
<p class="contents">By what means is the Council planning to make provision for the individual responsibility of Commissioners? When in its view will it be possible for Commissioners to be confirmed individually by the European Parliament and, where necessary, also to be called to account individually?</p>

Surely one of the questions coming out of the recent events is whether the President of the Commission should have the right to dismiss individual members of the Commission. In a national government, if a minister is guilty of serious misconduct or mismanagement but refuses to resign, then the leader of the government concerned can dismiss him or her. In the European Commission, were that situation ever to arise, the President of the Commission does not have the possibility of asking that member to resign or leave the Commission. Surely that would be the appropriate Treaty amendment to bring forward in the next IGC. If the circumstances arose and then the President of the Commission did not use that power we could then censure the Commission as a whole.</p>

The presidency does not so far intend, in its proposal for the European Council in Cologne in June, to go beyond what was left over from Amsterdam. To date, the position of the presidency has been that we must now make a procedural proposal on how these remaining issues are to be dealt with, in other words on how and when the next intergovernmental conference will take place and with what agenda. The agenda we have hitherto envisaged includes the composition of the Commission, qualified majority voting in the Council and the weighting of votes in the Council. The presidency does not currently intend to make any other proposals to the Council in Cologne.</p>

To the President‐in‐Office, I would like to say that I do not think Mr Rübig was asking a hypothetical question. The question can easily be answered, regardless of the outcome next month of the investigation into the Commission which is currently in progress. We know the answer very well. We cannot fire the whole Commission. You must also be able to give that answer. I seem to remember that in his speech Mr Fischer said the German Presidency was in favour of giving Parliament increased powers, which would in fact be equivalent to it becoming a real parliament and the Commission becoming a real government.

There are two separate issues which must be distinguished here. Firstly, there is a long‐term process of change in the European institutions and in relations between them, with greater democratic legitimacy, improved democratic control and increased transparency. This is the constitutional process – as I would like to call it – that is ongoing in Europe and with which we will be dealing for many years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">The decisions that have to be made at various stages must be seen as a separate issue because they are related to other decisions. This is the case with the famous ‘left‐overs" that I mentioned, which are directly linked to the process of enlargement. There was a general consensus in the EU that these remaining issues would have to be dealt with before the accession of the first new Member State. The question of when this will happen is of great political importance, since the speed with which we act on this, or our failure to do so, will send out a signal to the states wishing to join the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">If we now say that we will deal with these remaining issues at the same time as the far‐reaching constitutional matters, which you addressed and I touched upon, then it means that they will not be resolved for some considerable time, which will be too late for the states wishing to join the Union. This is why we want to restrict ourselves in Cologne to saying how and when and to what extent we want to make the decisions that need to be taken in relation to enlargement, but also to start broader discussions on the issues that you mentioned. Of course the question of strengthening the role of Parliament in the European Union is crucial here. I would also point out that the rights of Parliament will already be increased considerably with the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, which is scheduled for 1 June. But we see that as an ongoing process.</p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Visa‐free access for Hong Kong passport holders</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of the EP report on Hong Kong, the European Parliament adopted a resolution urging the Member States to grant visa‐free access to Hong Kong passport holders. In response, the Commission noted that, pending the introduction of a common visa list, the Commission had no direct responsibility over EU visa policy but that it strongly supported Hong Kong's efforts to secure visa‐free access for HKSAR passport holders. Would the Council inform us what action has been taken in response to Parliament's resolution?</p>
<p class="contents">When will the question of visa‐free access for HKSAR passport holders be considered by the Member States? Furthermore, what are the attitudes of Member States on the subject?</p>
<p class="contents">Has any Member State indicated unwillingness to grant visa‐free access to HKSAR passport holders?</p>

The regulation was declared invalid by the European Court of Justice, but its legal effects were expressly maintained. As Hong Kong inhabitants are not included in the common list of nationalities requiring visas for entry to the European Union, under Article 2 of this regulation it is the Member States alone which decide the entry requirements. On the basis of information supplied by the Member States, the Commission has drawn up a summary of current visa requirements for nationalities not included in the common list, which was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 3 April 1998, page 4 <span class="italic">et seq</span> . According to this, only Ireland and the United Kingdom currently do not require a visa from holders of passports of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The other Member States have announced that they will apply the same visa requirement rules that apply to China to residents of Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council intends, with the involvement of the European Parliament, to adopt an amended regulation on the common visa list, so that Hong Kong residents would no longer be subject to a common visa requirement in the EU Member States. The Member States would continue to decide themselves what entry rules to apply to Hong Kong residents.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope you will understand that I cannot comment on the national visa policies of the Member States, nor, in particular, on what their future policies are likely to be.</p>

Is it realistic to hold this up, when there is no threat of a large‐scale influx of illegal immigrants, merely because there are fears as far as other countries are concerned? In view of the fact that the Hong Kong authorities have made strenuous efforts to make their travel document difficult to forge and that there is the issue of reciprocity, from which European travellers to Hong Kong benefit, is there not a special case at this point to make progress on this issue, which would strengthen relations between the European Union and Hong Kong and, for that matter, between Europe and China?</p>

The fact is that it has been decided in this way. The current rule will continue to apply, so visa‐free access or visa requirements for Hong Kong residents entering the European Union will be decided at national level by the Member States. It is the exclusive right of the Member States to decide what criteria they apply in reaching this decision, and they should most certainly use all the information available to them, including the information you mentioned regarding the problem of forgery and security.</p>

As Parliament's rapporteur on Hong Kong, I am fully behind what they are asking in the House today. Bearing in mind the President‐in‐Office's comments about the exclusive right of Member States, would he not also accept that the policy of the European Union is support for the concept of one country, two systems? Respecting the right of individual Member States, would the Council not coordinate a policy which grants visa‐free access, which, in my view, is the total implementation of the concept of one country, two systems?</p>

On the whole, it is true that we should aspire to a common entry policy and, more generally, a common immigration policy within the European Union. We have that for the Schengen Area, and I hope that it will be extended. However, this does not change the situation that now exists in relation to Hong Kong. The legal situation within the European Union is such that the issue of whether Hong Kong residents require a visa for entry to an EU Member State is a national one. It is not something that can be decided at European level because the Member States are not currently willing to transfer the decision to European level. We can only guess at the reasons for this, as I am sure you are aware.</p>

You belong to a body to which 14 other governments belong, 13 of whom declare themselves to be Socialist governments. They declare that they are Socialists, but in fact they are neo‐Liberals. A few days ago I read the election manifesto of the Party of European Socialists which talks of a social Europe. Are you aware that this year budget spending on a social Europe has fallen? Can you tell me what the political strategy of the Council is to find money for the social face of Europe and for the protection of the environment? Can you tell me whether you intend to debate with the Commission the imposition of tax on speculative capital, so that, with this money, we can help to produce a social Europe and protect the environment?

Because of the current political landscape in Europe – which I need not describe further as you have already done so – it has fortunately become possible to develop fresh momentum in the areas of social justice, employment policy and the environmental market economy. A huge effort is being made in all these areas, and in all these areas the German Presidency is extremely active. One example is the European Employment Pact that is to be adopted at the summit in Cologne. Another is the development of a European charter of fundamental rights, in which special attention will be paid to social rights. I could add many more to this list. My answer to your question is therefore emphatically yes: in European politics today we are seeing a clear trend towards focusing on social and environmental matters.</p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Abduction of Öcalan</p>
<p class="contents">After his futile attempts to find political asylum in any Member State of the European Union or to be tried by an international court (which was a desirable objective according to statements by the Italian and German Foreign Ministers reported in Agence Europe No. 73530), the PKK leader, A.

<p class="contents">Question No 11 by <span class="bold">Alexandros Alavanos </span>(H−0163/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: The Öcalan case and the Kurdish problem</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the latest developments in the Öcalan case and on the basis of its resolutions and decisions on applications for the granting of asylum (Council Resolution 20/6/1995, Agreement 97/C254/01), will the Council say how it judges the obstructive policies pursued by Member States of the European Union and their essential refusal to grant political asylum to the Kurdish leader Abdullah Öcalan? Was it not incumbent upon the Council to adopt a clear position on this matter before Öcalan fell into the hands of Turkish ‘justice'?</p>
<p class="contents">What pressure does the Council intend to exert on Turkey to ensure that the Kurdish leader receives a fair and public trial and that his life is spared? What initiatives does it intend to take to convoke an international conference aimed at finding a solution to the Kurdish problem?</p>
<p class="contents"></p>
<p class="contents">Question No 12 by <span class="bold">Ioannis Theonas </span>(H−0184/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Conditions of detention and threat to the physical and mental integrity and life of Abdullah Öcalan</p>
<p class="contents">Serious misgivings have been expressed about the conditions in which the Kurdish leader, Abdullah Öcalan, is being held in custody; it is also feared that his physical, mental and intellectual integrity, as well as his life, are under threat. It is alleged – and all the indications, such as the footage constantly broadcast in the Turkish media, confirm – that the authorities are keeping the Kurdish leader under the influence of psychoactive drugs in order to render him sluggish and dull his senses as a means of ‘facilitating' the proceedings surrounding his case. Recently, moreover, the Turkish authorities themselves announced that Mr Öcalan had serious heart problems, possibly as a result of the conditions under which he is held.</p>
<p class="contents">The Kurdish leader is being held in solitary confinement in the harshest of prisons, the conditions in which have been repeatedly condemned by all the international human rights organisations, following his ‘arrest' and detention which took place in an atmosphere of hysteria. The fact also that he is being subjected to legal proceedings while under the influence of psychoactive drugs which prevent him from acting and speaking freely, rendering him unrecognisable, is a blatant mockery of justice. Will the Council, therefore, say how it will react to this flagrant violation of the rights and dignity of the prisoner and what measures it will take to enable Abdullah Öcalan to be examined by independent medical experts in order to guarantee his physical and mental integrity throughout his detention and trial, safeguarding the right of the prisoner to his dignity and his life?</p>
<p class="contents">I give the floor to the President‐in‐Office to answer Questions Nos 10, 11 and 12 together.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Verheugen, </span>  <span class="italic">Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, I would like, if I may, to answer the questions separately but in summary form. I will firstly answer the various questions raised by Mr Papayannakis. The Council would refer to the statement issued by the European Union on 22 February 1999, in which the European Union notes the assurances of the Turkish Government that Abdullah Öcalan will receive a fair trial. The European Union expects this to include fair and proper treatment and a public and legal trial before an independent court, access to a legal adviser of his choice and the admission of international observers to the trial.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not currently possible for the Council to judge whether Öcalan"s abduction from Kenya constitutes a violation of international law, as you stated in your question, or, as you also said, perhaps an act of state terrorism. The Council does not have access to any clear and definite information concerning the way in which Abdullah Öcalan was brought to Turkey. It is therefore not possible to assess this. As to whether it can be guaranteed that Mr Öcalan will remain alive and receive a trial worthy of a country governed by the rule of law, I would refer you to the first part of my answer – the EU"s demands in terms of the nature of the trial – and I would also point out that the EU has once again expressed its total rejection of the death penalty in the statement I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on now to the question raised by Mr Alavanos, the first part of your question refers to the asylum problem. I must point out that the implementation of asylum procedures falls within the competence of the individual Member States and the Council cannot comment on them. In reply to your second question I would refer to the EU statement of 22 February 1999 which notes the Turkish Government"s assurances that Abdullah Öcalan will receive a fair trial. I must reiterate what I said in my answer to the first question concerning the demands being made of Turkey on this point, and I would also repeat what I said about the death penalty. I would add that the European Union expects Turkey to solve these problems by political means and with full respect for human rights and the rule of law in a democratic society.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the European Union welcomes all genuine efforts to combat terrorism and to approach political solutions in such a way as to allow the reconciliation of the people concerned and a solution to the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to the question raised by Mr Theonas I would say that the Council has not received any information that Abdullah Öcalan"s rights are being violated in the course of the investigation and legal proceedings. According to a press release by the Council of Europe on 4 March 1999, a delegation from the anti‐torture committee was allowed to visit the prisoner in private. The Council has not been informed of the outcome of this visit. In its statement of 22 February 1999, the European Union said that it expects the Turkish Government"s assurances about a fair trial to include fair and proper treatment.</p>

<p class="contents">Let me begin by thanking the President‐in‐Office for the information he has provided. However, one issue has yet to be dealt with. I would point out first of all that we are also opposed to terrorism. One of the most serious problems affecting our country, Spain, is terrorism, although the situation there fortunately seems to be improving. So we too are opposed to terrorism. However, a group of Members went to Turkey last week to visit Mr Öcalan"s lawyers, whose lives are in danger. They learnt there that Mr Öcalan is not as well as he should be physically and that his personal safety is clearly not guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President‐in‐Office, how does the Council plan to develop the general conditions needed for a political solution to the Kurdish problem, a problem that is not going to end with Mr Öcalan?</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Verheugen, </span>  <span class="italic">Council. – (DE)</span> Mrs González Álvarez, I would like to divide my answer into two parts, discussing firstly the Öcalan case and secondly the broader question. With regard to the Öcalan case, you may rest assured that the Council will keep a constant eye on this case and will comment or take action as developments require. The Council will also take careful note of all information concerning the progress of the trial and the treatment of Öcalan, and will consider whether this information requires it to take action. So I can assure you that this problem will be given regular and continued attention.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the broader issue, I have to point out that, as you know, Turkey has always rejected what it calls the internationalisation of the Kurdish problem. Turkey also regards comments made on this subject as inadmissible interference in its internal affairs and has to date not been prepared to talk to the European Union or anyone else about the Kurdish issue. You probably know better than I do that the official Turkish position is that the Kurdish issue does not exist.</p>
<p class="contents">I must therefore say that I see very, very few ways of exerting a positive influence on Turkey. However, in terms of the position of the German Presidency – which has given greater prominence to Turkey"s status as an EU applicant country than did previous German governments – I would like to make it very clear that the same requirements for membership of the European Union apply to Turkey as to all the others. This means that Turkey is not at an advantage because of its particularly important strategic position, and it is not at a disadvantage because of the fact that it is an Islamic country. Turkey must meet precisely the same conditions as the others, which means that it must be a fully‐developed democracy. We must be certain that human rights are respected and we must be certain that everyone in the country enjoys the same rights. I do not wish to use the term ‘minorities" in relation to the Kurds, as in my opinion this is completely inappropriate in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue here is full equality for all people living in a particular country. This is something we can and must impress on Turkey in relation to its progress towards Europe. If relations develop in such a way that it is possible to discuss a solution to the Kurdish problem in direct talks with Turkey, I have no doubt that we will be prepared to do so, but unfortunately such talks have simply not been possible so far.</p>

I would nevertheless like to ask the President‐in‐Office how she can be sure of the assurances and guarantees given by Turkey. I was present at the trial of Leila Zana and the 16 other convicted members of parliament. Leila Zana was sentenced to 16 years in prison. In front of the international observers, including our group, as well as the international media that was present, Leila Zana, a small and frail woman but a great democrat and a great politician, was beaten – there is no other word for it – by the rifle butts of the soldiers who were there for the trial. And this took place before our very eyes. So I do not believe these verbal guarantees for one moment. Equally, I do not believe that we will help achieve a peaceful solution to the Kurdish problem by continuing to sell arms to Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to know what you base these assurances on. I would also like to know if it would be possible to introduce economic sanctions, especially having seen how pointless it was to believe that approving the customs union would help the country return to democracy. There are many other things I would like to ask you, but unfortunately I have run out of time.</p>

There are no guarantees. I could give you dozens of examples of this from recent history, not only in Europe but in other parts of the world. That is simply the problem we have when we are dealing with countries in which there are certain constitutional shortcomings, and we all consider this to be the case in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">So there are no guarantees. However, what we can do of course is to judge the implications if, for example, Öcalan were not given unrestricted access to lawyers of his choice, or if international trial observers were not given full and unrestricted access. Then we could form an opinion. But I must add that even if that is done there is no absolute guarantee that a trial will really be conducted fairly and properly in all respects. Unfortunately I have to say that there is no guarantee of this even in states where the rule of law is fully developed.</p>

<p class="contents">Subject: Coordination between the EU and the Council of Europe as regards policies for mutual assistance in criminal matters</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States are negotiating an EU Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters. The Council of Europe is negotiating a Second Additional Protocol to the 1959 European Convention on Mutual Assistance. The two drafts largely deal with the same issues but lack any kind of coordination. Have the EU Member States done anything to ensure that the same judicial solutions would be reached within the two fora? If not, what is the reason for pursuing different policies within the EU and the Council of Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mrs Thors's question.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Verheugen, </span>  <span class="italic">Council. – (DE)</span> The coordination of negotiations on an EU Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters and the Council of Europe"s draft for a Second Additional Protocol to the 1959 European Convention on Mutual Assistance has been discussed in detail at EU level.</p>
<p class="contents">The working party on mutual assistance in criminal matters, which is drawing up the new EU convention, last examined the question of coordination at its meeting on 17 and 18 February 1999. The need for coordination between the European Union and the Council of Europe has been discussed on several occasions at the regular meetings between the troika, the K.4 Committee and representatives of the Council of Europe. Particular emphasis was placed on ensuring that their respective objectives in the area of mutual assistance are consistent and that overlaps between the legal instruments are avoided as far as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the concrete results of this coordination process was that the Council Secretariat drew up a technical comparison of the EU draft and the Council of Europe"s text. This document has proved to be a useful aid in the current discussions, and is currently being revised. Certain overlaps between the draft EU convention and the Council of Europe"s draft protocol are unavoidable given that the objective of both new instruments is to improve rules for mutual assistance in criminal matters. The EU convention will impose stricter mutual assistance obligations on the 15 Member States than the Council of Europe protocol, which can be applied to over 40 countries with very different legal systems. This is true in particular of the rules concerning tapping into communications links.</p>

At the beginning of February, I happened to hear one of the Council's representatives, amongst others, say that there had been no coordination. Consequently, I think the time has come for us to consider the principles that are to be applied in the new agreements on mutual assistance in criminal matters.</p>
<p class="contents">It looks as though supervision of the Internet and e‐mail is one of the areas where there has been no coordination in either of the agreements. It would appear that under one of the agreements, the Commission would like to compel the authorities to immediately hand out information about all e‐mail correspondence. Can that be right and is it consistent with European principles, given that no one has yet defined the infringements that will be looked out for or established a corresponding legal requirement? However, it is good to hear that there has been some coordination on the basis of this initiative.</p>

<p class="contents">Can the Council therefore say whether the ECB has drawn up rules applicable to senior officials and Executive Board members in particular on incompatibility and financial relations, bearing in mind that, where such circumstances exist, the independence of the persons concerned may be jeopardised?</p>
<p class="contents">Has the ECB heeded the call from the Ombudsman and drawn up rules governing the release of documents into the public domain in the exercise of its tasks or the right of citizens to gain access to documents produced by and in the possession of the ECB?</p>
<p class="contents">If the answer to the above questions is ‘yes', is information about the income, assets, and secondary occupations of senior officials and Executive Board members made available to the public under all conditions?

The Council must answer these questions, as these matters are its responsibility. The European Central Bank and the national central banks which report to it are part of the EU scheme. The same rules for personnel apply to them as to any other EU institution.

<p class="contents">Mr President‐in‐Office, you have not answered these questions. Instead, you said there is no conflict in a situation where a person of experience receives a salary from the European Central Bank and a pension from some former position.

The question of whether it is possible to receive a salary as a member of the ECB Executive Board and to receive at the same time a pension from a previous job has been answered three times with a definite ‘yes".

<p class="contents">Question No 16 by <span class="bold">Maj Theorin </span>(H−0146/99)</p>
<p class="contents">Subject: Global solidarity</p>
<p class="contents">1.3 bn of the world's population are living in acute poverty, and the number is increasing.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1997 the OECD countries' aid to developing countries fell to 0.22 % of GNP. The indications are that it has continued to fall in 1998. The flow of private capital from the industrialised to the under‐developed countries also declined sharply in 1997 and 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations' target is for the wealthy countries to set aside 0.7 % of their GNP for aid. What does the Council intend to do within the OECD to ensure that this UN target is met?</p>
<p class="contents">I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mrs Theorin's question.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><img src="/doceo/data/img/hr.gif" width="100%" height="1" alt="" /></td><td align="right" width="16"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="buttondocwin"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><a href="#top" title="Top"><img src="/doceo/data/img/navi_top.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0" alt="" /></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></table>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Verheugen, </span>  <span class="italic">Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, Mrs Theorin is quite right to point out that development aid from Member States represented in the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD has fallen as a percentage of GNP. A comparison shows, however, that the figures for EU Member States, averaging 0.33 % of GNP, are much higher than the average figures for the DAC donor countries as a whole, where the corresponding figure is 0.22 % of GNP, whereas the contribution of such an important donor country as the USA is less than 0.09 % of GNP. Some states are seeing a reverse of the negative trend.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the flow of private capital to the developing countries, the European Union is very much aware of the importance of private investment and developments in the private sector in general. Directing private investment to developing countries can best be achieved by strengthening the private sector and creating conditions – particularly economic, legal, administrative and regulatory conditions – that promote investment. This was also the view stated by the European Union recently at the ACP‐EU Ministerial Negotiating Conference on 8 and 9 February 1999 in Dakar, and it was a view which our ACP partners entirely shared.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is also devoting greater attention to the problem of poverty which the honourable Member mentioned. It should be noted here that one of the fundamental points on which agreement was reached in Dakar was that the reduction and possible eventual elimination of poverty must be among the main objectives of the new partnership, along with sustainable development and the gradual integration of the ACP countries into the world economy.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mrs Theorin"s question concerning concrete measures to be taken at OECD level, I must point out that the Council, unlike the individual Member States and the European Commission, is not represented in the DAC and cannot therefore propose any concrete measures.</p>

I was somewhat surprised to be told that some countries have been hiding behind the fact that the USA has given very little assistance to third world countries – that has been a well‐known fact for some time. Nevertheless, there are also some EU countries whose aid budget comes to considerably more than 0.33 %. However, the goal of 0.7 %, established by the UN, serves as a useful target for all countries to aim at, regardless of whether they are in the Council or the OECD.</p>
<p class="contents">Since I first heard that poverty and its repercussions were being given the recognition they deserve – although it is not enough simply to recognise the problem – I have been wondering what measures the Council is proposing to take in order to deal adequately with the problems posed by poverty. What exactly are we willing to do to help third world countries?</p>
<p class="contents">Private capital flows naturally play an important role, as do trade agreements. I would remind the Council that the Trade Agreement with South Africa comes within that category, and I hope it will be signed on 22 March, thereby making it possible to provide assistance.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Verheugen, </span>  <span class="italic">Council. – (DE)</span> Mrs Theorin, I fully agree with you that helping to combat world poverty must be a central aim of European Union policy. Poverty is truly one of the most terrible scourges we are faced with today. As we in Europe are in a better position than most people in the world, it is also in our own interest to ensure that large parts of the world do not decline into ever worsening poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">This ever widening social divide is bound to lead eventually to political and social conflict that may even end in violence. Here our analysis is entirely in line with yours. It is also something we need to get across to people in our own countries, that development cooperation costs money but is in the end an important investment in our own security, an investment that is at least as important as what we invest in our military security. I fully agree with your basic views on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Theorin, you know what possibilities are available and what instruments we employ. The development cooperation provided by the European Union itself is geared towards these objectives, and the same applies to the development cooperation of most Member States. It applies to your country, my country and many others. We are on the right track. But I fully agree with you that a great deal more can be done and in particular that we must shed the notion that development cooperation consists of sending money somewhere in the belief that that will do.</p>
<p class="contents">It is indeed necessary to go for an integrated approach, and part of this involves integrating the developing countries" economies into the world economy, directing the flow of capital and investment to these countries using the measures available, and helping to build structures that are necessary and attractive for investment. All of this is included in our policy. There is never anything that cannot be improved upon. I am therefore grateful for any support we can find in terms of improving our policy"s aims and the opportunities available.</p>

<p class="contents">On this issue the Council confirms the position it has adopted since the beginning of the Euro‐Mediterranean partnership, namely that the door is being kept open for Libya and that Libya may participate in the partnership as soon as it complies with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council. The Council is following developments very closely. It has noted the recent positive developments and encourages the continuation of others" efforts in this area.</p>

<p class="contents">Therefore, if he is telling me that the door will be open as soon as there is an agreement and he knows, as I do, that there already is an agreement, surely we can take it as read that Libya will finally participate in the coming Euro‐Mediterranean Conference in Stuttgart as a full member. This was requested by the Euro‐Mediterranean Forum held in the European Parliament in November and I believe that it is a wise move.</p>
<p class="contents">If that is, in fact, the case, can I assume, too, that Mauritania will also be able to participate? The Final Declaration here in the European Parliament also supported the idea of inviting Mauritania to become a full member.</p>

As far as Libya is concerned, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I would be thankful if I could reach the same conclusion as you; I would be pleased if I could say that all the conditions we laid down had been met, so that Libya could take part in the Barcelona process. However, I do not share your optimism. The requirement is that the Security Council resolution must be implemented in full, and this will not be the case until the suspected assassins have been extradited.</p>
