<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Κaramanou (PSE)</span></span>  , <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, may I start by offering my personal congratulations to Commissioner Vitorino on taking such an important legislative initiative and thank the Swedish Presidency for its support, which will ensure that the Council takes a decision as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The sexual exploitation of children and child pornography are, of course, a scandal in a modern civilisation and it is unthinkable that criminal networks and customers should go unpunished and avoid criminal prosecution by taking advantage of the lack of cooperation between countries and shortcomings in our criminal legislation. It is high time we addressed appalling cases such as the Dutroux case in Belgium, where the inadequate legal framework means that it is still impossible to prove the constituent elements of the crime and hold the trial which has been pending for the last four years, which is why the Union initiative to stamp out this vile crime and create a common reference framework to strengthen judicial and police cooperation between the Member States and bring these criminal syndicates to justice is all the more important.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has worked through the Commission framework proposal line by line and has adopted a series of proposals and amendments which enhance and strengthen the initial legislative text, such as the definition of child pornography, which has been expanded considerably so as to include the various permutations of this crime and ensure there are none which escape prosecution, taking account of course of new technological developments. As far as the sexual exploitation of children is concerned, given the composite nature of the crime and the international networks involved, we have included types of criminal conduct over and above those proposed by the Commission, such as facilitating, buying, selling or transporting a child within or outside national borders. Another important point which we have added apportions responsibility both to the natural persons who care for the child, such as parents, teachers etc. and to legal persons, including distribution companies and Internet service providers, which are now required to design protective mechanisms to prevent new technologies from being used to facilitate the exploitation of children. As far as crimes relating to child pornography are concerned, we have proposed that importing, exporting, purchasing, selling and advertising, and not just producing, distributing and disseminating child pornography should be criminal offences. What is also extremely important is that we have made the possession of pornographic material a criminal offence, subject of course to safety valves which ensure that people who receive material unwittingly, for example by electronic or conventional mail, need not fear prosecution.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as punishment is concerned, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms accepted the proposal by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities for a stricter criminal framework for crimes inflicted on children under the age of 16, rather than the age of 10 proposed by the Commission, with stricter punishment of at least 10 years rather than the 8 years proposed by the Commission. We have also proposed that, in addition to condemnation, any movable or immovable assets which are proceeds from these offences be traced, seized and confiscated and that punishment be accompanied by psychiatric treatment. This is another innovation which we have proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms, we have also made an important contribution on the procedural side by making provision for criminals to be extradited, so that the phenomenon of sexual tourism can be stamped out, and amending legislation on double criminality, so that offenders cannot escape to countries in which crimes against children are punished more leniently. We also propose compensation for victims and a host of measures to protect victims during investigations and hearings and of course afterwards, especially for disabled children. Finally, we propose setting up registers of persons who have committed the offence, in collaboration with Europol, Interpol and national police forces, and involving candidate countries in action to combat the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography.</p>
<p class="contents">I am well aware that promoting legislative arrangements is not the only solution. We need to focus on the causes of the mental and physical abuse and exploitation of children, such as poverty, the lack of fundamental structures to protect children, the lack of control and prevention mechanisms, the breakdown of the family and, of course, the fact that such a market – a market of huge supply and demand – exists and, unfortunately, operates within the European Union, discrediting our European civilisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Klamt (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is estimated that as many as 700 000 women and children are trafficked every year. From the Central and Eastern European states alone, 120 000 women and children are lured to the European Union every year. These are the figures on which the Commission proceeds. The fates of the individuals profiled in the media, but also the statistics highlight the urgent need to combat human trafficking through a coordinated and cooperative approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Combating trafficking in human beings is a very difficult task in itself. However, it is made more difficult through the highly diverse provisions of criminal law at national level. Definitions and penalties differ widely, and in many Member States, ‘human trafficking’ does not even exist as an offence in the criminal code. The European Union has therefore worked for a number of years to develop a comprehensive strategy to combat this trade in human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">With the Palermo protocol, which was signed at the end of 2000, agreement was reached on specific common definitions for the first time. The Commission proposal now aims to lay down, by means of a Framework Decision, minimum rules concerning the constituent elements of criminal acts, and minimum penalties. The imposition of a minimum jail sentence of six years, or ten years where the circumstances make the crime more serious, should be sufficient to bring trafficking in human beings within the scope of other instruments already adopted for the purposes of enhancing police and judicial cooperation in the European Union against organised crime. In my opinion, the Commission's proposal should be viewed positively. I especially welcome the fact that it encompasses not only the criminal act of trafficking in human beings for the purpose of sexual exploitation, but also trafficking in human beings for labour exploitation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also makes a clear distinction between trafficking in human beings, and facilitation of unauthorised entry of migrants, commonly termed ‘smuggling’. While the smuggling of human beings is viewed as an offence against the state, trafficking in human beings is a crime against persons. The Commission's draft and the various amendments proposed by the participating committees will enable us to achieve a uniform Europe-wide definition of trafficking in human beings, set minimum penalties, and give priority to protecting the victims as well as punishing the perpetrators. I should like to thank all the members of the participating committees for their cooperation in achieving this result.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to comment on the requested referral of my report back to the Committee on Home Affairs. At the start of deliberations, such a tight schedule was imposed on the European Parliament by the Council's timetable that tremendous efforts were required to ensure that the substantive work on the draft could take place with the necessary thoroughness and level of detail. The Members involved expressed their willingness to undertake this task and performed outstanding work, to which I wish to pay tribute. However, the Council – without listening to the people's elected representatives – has already progressed so far in its deliberations that the signing of the political agreements is merely a formality. Clearly, the Council has no interest in the decision of the only institution in the European Union with direct democratic legitimation. A revised draft of the Framework Decision with the Council's radical amendments is already available – but not to the European Parliament. In my view, the referral of the report back to the Committee on Home Affairs is urgently required to ensure that this new version, and the Council's unacceptable approach, can be discussed. I would therefore ask you all to vote for the referral back to the Committee on Home Affairs during tomorrow's vote.</p>
<p class="contents">In the second half of my speech, I would like to comment on Mrs Karamanou's report on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography in the Member States, which calls for a Europe-wide coordinated approach. Organised crime – and it is primarily organised crime which is involved here – is not restricted to specific regions or states. Cross-border cooperation between criminals is well-established, especially as regards the sexual exploitation of children.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union therefore urgently requires measures in order to facilitate the cross-border prosecution of these appalling crimes. I am delighted that agreement on this Framework Decision has been achieved across party lines, thus pointing the right way forward towards common definitions of criminal acts, the harmonisation of criminal law, and improving the situation of victims. This also includes extending the definition of child pornography to include the new media and discussing the issue of extraterritorial jurisdiction. In my view, victim protection is especially important.</p>
<p class="contents">Crimes against children, in their most despicable form, that is, sexual exploitation, should no longer be dealt with solely with a view to punishing the perpetrators. The children concerned will suffer for the rest of their lives as a result of the harm inflicted on them by adults. They should therefore be our priority, and they deserve our greatest possible support. During criminal proceedings, their primary role, in legal terms, is to act as witnesses, but we should not forget that they are victims first and foremost. With the support of the European Parliament, all these points should be included in the draft before us. I am convinced that the report by Mrs Karamanou, whom I would like to thank for our good cooperation, will be supported by a substantial majority in this House, enabling us to take a further significant step in combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture, I should also like say a word of thanks for the cross-party cooperation I had in that committee on this most important issue. We must tackle the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography across the EU. Whatever anyone thinks of subsidiarity, for something as important as this we have to make sure we have common rules, particularly because of the Internet and the free movement of people across the EU countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that there are several child pornographers who have set up business in one EU country because if they are caught they know they will get a lesser sentence in that country. We must make sure that we stamp that out.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased that much of the opinion I drafted has been accepted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, particularly the section on penalties and ensuring that we have the same penalties across the EU. I thought the Commission was wrong to bring in tougher penalties for the exploitation of children under 10. I worked very hard in my committee to make sure we also set tougher penalties for those who commit offences against children under 16. I also wanted to bring in children with learning difficulties. I talked a lot with some of the organisations working in this field and they said that disabled children are twice as likely to be abused as any other children. It is important that we protect children with learning disabilities, whose mental age is often much lower than their physical age.</p>

Both are on the increase. For this reason, we must engage in closer cross-border cooperation, work far more intensively to prevent such crimes through information and awareness-raising, and try to include society in this process to a greater extent. Of course, it is also important to amend our criminal law and ensure that it functions on a cross-border basis, as trafficking, abuse and child pornography operate across borders as well.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that various measures are necessary for this purpose. The penalty, that is, the term of imprisonment, should be increased from a minimum of eight to a minimum of 10 years, with stiffer penalties being imposed when the victim is under 16, rather than under 10. I cannot understand what is meant by the reference to child abuse involving ‘particular ruthlessness’. Any form of child abuse is ruthless! There is no such thing as 'mild' child abuse. Anything that happens to a child in this context is ruthless. That is why I believe that the age limit should be raised to a minimum of 16, as the harm suffered by children is just as profound whether they are under 10, or 11, 12 or 13 years of age. I am therefore in favour of raising the age limit to 16. Victim protection for these children must also be safeguarded, not only for the children but also for the families and the witnesses. Legal assistance and psychological support are very important. Children should also be given the opportunity to make their witness statements on video, which is unfortunately not the practice in every country.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, there is not enough time for further comments. However, I would like to thank everyone who supports the work in this field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very disappointed at the fact that, instead, the Palermo protocol has been watered down. I believe that it is incredibly important that we really keep separate the definitions of refugees, which after all have nothing to do with this particular matter, and of the exploitation of labour and of sexual exploitation.</p>
<p class="contents">We now know that roughly 90% of the victims of trafficking in human beings, whom these matters concern, are women whom it is intended to exploit sexually. I realise that the Commission and the Council, just like ourselves here in Parliament, may find it difficult to cooperate on these matters, particularly in view of the fact that there is incredible variation in national legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In Sweden, we have had active legislation for eighteen months now that also addresses the buying of sexual services, that is, the clients have been criminalised. We have thus focused on the man instead of stigmatising the person who is prostituting herself. This is to be seen in the light of the fact that a number of the Member States are now legalising brothels and thus also pimping. What this does is preserve stereotypical images of women’s and men’s sexuality and sexual needs.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Mrs Karamanou’s report is concerned, I would like to state that if Amendment Nos 3, 5, 6 and 13 are carried, then my group will not be able to vote in favour of the report. The definitions of child pornography that we adopted in the women’s committee are much better. In Mrs Karamanou’s report, the definitions are so wide that there is a risk that we will have to cover up the Maneken Pis in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The exploitation of human beings, men, women and children, is an abhorrent phenomenon, whatever its purpose may be: for clandestine work, to work in the sex industry or for any other reason. We therefore have a responsibility to fight this scourge and to create the necessary legislative instruments. This was our aim and we tried to reach a common definition of the elements of these types of crime, and attempted to establish minimum thresholds for the maximum penalties that could be imposed. We also sought to define rules of competence and of police and judicial cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to congratulate Mrs Klamt, Mrs Karamanou and Commissioner Vitorino for the commitment they have demonstrated in these matters. Issues related to the trafficking of human beings and the sexual exploitation of children must indeed be one of the main priorities of the European Union’s political agenda. We must step up the fight against the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography by improving the measures adopted by the joint action of February 1997 and by ensuring that there can be no safe havens for the perpetrators of sex crimes against children when we suspect that they may have committed a crime in a country other than their own. We must also complement the work that has already been undertaken by the Union and the international Community. Amongst these, we should highlight the fact that, in December 2000, the United Nations protocol on trafficking in human beings was adopted under the Convention on transnational organised crime, which was signed by 81 States. Our Parliament’s approval of these proposals would constitute a clear demonstration of our will to wage an effective fight against these unacceptable violations of people’s dignity and human rights. I am delighted that the Council has reached agreement on the basic principles of the proposal for a Framework Decision on the fight against trafficking in human beings, but I am sorry that it could not reach consensus on the level of criminal sanctions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For years this Parliament has wanted clear and common legislation for combating the trafficking and exploitation of human beings, which are odious and widespread crimes. We do not wish to be aware of it, but we only have to look at what is happening with prostitution in our countries to see what is going on.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission’s proposal to define the crime in a common manner and harmonise penalties is truly a step forward in the direction proposed by the United Nations in its Palermo protocol, and I am pleased to accept it.</p>
<p class="contents">However, having debated Mrs Gradin’s proposals in this House, which of course have been very useful to some others, such as the United States, which already have federal legislation to combat human trafficking, I must express my great concern at the Council’s attitude at its last meeting. There was no agreement on this proposal, whereas we saw remnants of legislation proposed by France, on the entry of people without documentation, go ahead, when it is clear that the trafficking and exploitation of human beings is one of the gravest of crimes. It is much more serious than the issue dealt with at the Council meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not understand it, and nor does anybody else, because no explanation has been given. I would like to ask, Mr President, whether tomorrow at the vote the Council will come to explain its position to us, what it intends to do, and whether it intends to introduce any amendments and, if so, which ones. Or, have we instead reached a point of such harmony between the institutions of this Union that, without my realising it, there is only one executive, the Commission, and only one legislative body, Parliament, and that the Council has no part to play. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Anyone who opposes such moves must be prepared to justify traffickers and paedophiles getting off scot-free.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate Mrs Klamt and Mrs Karamanou, but on some points my group is not entirely happy. The first problem, in both reports, is the tendency to be too prescriptive and interfering in the detail of Member States' criminal justice systems. The first example is penalties. It is quite right to harmonise the maximum sentences, so that wherever a criminal flees, he risks the same penalty – no hiding place. But it is not appropriate either to stipulate that the penalty in connection with trafficking must be a prison sentence or to lay down minimum penalties. I do not always agree with the Council, but I agree with its view that approximation of the criminal law of the Member States could be necessary for certain specific types of offences, but when approximating criminal law the specificity of the national systems has to be taken into account. Both reports are also too prescriptive on the treatment of victims and witnesses, and fail to take differing national arrangements into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the definition of child pornography in the Karamanou report, my group has problems with the definition which includes creating the impression that the person depicted is a child. This will give rise to endless argument and is not a sound basis for a legal definition. It is better to target pornography which exploits real children, not pretend ones. I also wish to draw attention to Amendment No 38 from the ELDR, which would make access to sex offenders' registers subject to data protection rules.</p>

What the Council finds important, we deem inadequate and one-sided. What I do welcome in the Council’s report is the commitment towards the Member States. That is a step forward, but the reception and protection of victims is still being afforded too little importance. More guarantees must be offered in this connection. That is why, and certainly for humanitarian reasons, we should not so much aim for interim, but permanent, residence permits.</p>
<p class="contents">Where are the bottlenecks? Mafia groups have capitalised on the globalisation of the economy faster than anyone else. A second bottleneck is the rift between rich and poor regions; and then there is poverty. It is thus not only beneficial to launch dissuasion campaigns against the trafficking in human beings in all those countries of origin, poverty must also be addressed. We should also develop immigration policy and open up the borders more, even if this is at the expense of the countries involved. Despite this, most European countries still prefer a repressive approach in practice, which first and foremost targets the victims themselves. The heavyweights involved in the trafficking in human beings, the entrepreneurs of the trafficking in human beings, and those with vested interests usually remain out of harm’s way, and the current policy on fighting the traffickers has virtually no humanitarian dimension to speak of. And where is development cooperation in this respect? The approach must be international, but the Mafias have international, well-oiled networks at their disposal, with fiscal and financial experts and telecommunication and computer experts of the highest calibre. Those fighting these practices still need to content themselves with proportionately few people, little expertise and few tools, loopholes in legislation and still a distressing lack of actual international cooperation, despite Europol etc. A structural approach is thus necessary, both in terms of criminal law and international migration policy. I should also like to say: do not overlook corruption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The important part, of course, is ‘especially women and children’ and today we have Amendment No 1 in the report by Mrs Klamt, whom I would like to thank, which expressly states that we want to combat trafficking in human beings for the purpose of sexual exploitation and labour exploitation. In my view, it is not sufficient to mention trafficking in human beings alone.</p>
<p class="contents">The clarification regarding women and children was proposed at Palermo. In my view, it is absolutely fair for this amendment to propose that the purpose of sexual exploitation should be mentioned before the purpose of labour exploitation, as we know only too well that trafficking primarily involves women and children, so let us avoid hypocrisy. If we had placed labour exploitation before sexual exploitation, we know that we would not really be facing up to the facts. That is why, in my view, Amendment No 1 is crucial and I hope that the Commission will take this on board.</p>
<p class="contents">A point which I also believe to be important is that trafficking should be treated as a crime and not a misdemeanour. Everything relating to sexual exploitation is a crime and not simply a misdemeanour – we should acknowledge this, highlight this, be aware of this and should not play on this vagueness. I would like to thank the various committees and rapporteurs for having insisted on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add that, out of all the amendments, I believe that the additions relating to the status of the victims are extremely important. These additions affect at least three points. First of all, there is the fact that we can talk about incitement, which can be one of the punishable causes. That means incitement and not just fraud. As you can see, there is a small difference between the two concepts.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the state of vulnerability of the victims, in addition to the pressures that we could easily pinpoint; the vulnerability of the victims is something I see as equally important.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point, which was stressed by the Council of Europe in its recommendation published in May 2000, is that the argument of consent was not relevant. This is another important point. The consent or non-consent of the victim is not always relevant – in fact, it is far from being relevant. I believe that we must be vigilant on this issue, and we should recognise that consent should not be used as an argument for those involved in trafficking to escape punishment.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I believe that these reports are crucial. I would like to thank the two rapporteurs. I would like to say, unlike some Members, that I hope there will be, of course, more cooperation between Member States. How can we combat trafficking if there is no cooperation between Member States? Does this proposal allow for sufficient cooperation? Not exactly, and personally I would hope for more, so that we can identify all the victims, male and female, because men can, of course, also be victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation. Both men and women can be victims, but the main victims are women, especially, and children. I would like to reiterate that one of the amendments proposes we recognise that adulthood begins at the age of 18, and that those under the age of 18 must be considered to be children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like the rest of the House, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report. It is through working together at EU and international level that we can do something important for children, who must be protected from such crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully endorse the proposal that depictions of persons under the age of 18 involved in sexually explicit conduct constitute the sexual exploitation of children. In my view this is compatible with the Convention of the Rights of the Child. The sexual exploitation of children, including child pornography on the Internet, in any form, is abhorrent.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commission points out, tens of thousands of human beings – especially women and children – are trafficked for exploitative purposes each year. None of our countries can claim to be free of these threats. None of our countries can halt these acts on their own. None of our countries should hesitate about signing up to closer cooperation in the fight against such crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has not been ignoring this worrying phenomenon. We have spoken about it many times in Parliament: in 1997 the Council joint action to combat trafficking in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children paved the way for Member States to review the relevant criminal law so as to ensure the criminalisation of certain behaviours and to encourage judicial cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The new proposal brings us a further step forward by hopefully ensuring that each Member State will take the necessary measures to guarantee that facilitating or in any way profiting from child prostitution or child pornography is penalised, including by terms of imprisonment of not less than four years.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we are calling on each Member State to ensure that convictions for such crimes are subject to the tracing, seizure and confiscation of all moveable and immovable assets representing the proceeds of those crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I fully support the compromise agreement reached by our committee on Article 5(4). The maximum penalty of not less than eight years should apply in the case of child pornography and aiding and abetting such crimes, including the exploitation of children, when they involve a child below the age of 16. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

International criminal organisations are ruthless and act with extreme effrontery. That makes it absolutely vital for the EU Member States and the candidate countries to act in close cooperation in order to combat these serious offences against humanity with all lawful means possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteurs, Mrs Karamanou and Mrs Klamt, succeeded in presenting an extremely strong case and managed to table sound amendments. I sincerely hope that their compassionate proposals can stand the test of legislation. However, I share Mrs Ludford’s doubts. I am sure that Commissioner Vitorino would like to expand on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Hard-nosed criminals can only be tackled successfully by a concerted, equally hard-nosed approach by the authorities. Any hesitation or weakening in the policy should therefore be firmly nipped in the bud. This is why, in this area in particular, the government carries the sword of justice for a very good reason.</p>
<p class="contents">The mere fact that, from Central and Eastern Europe, as Mrs Klamt reminded us, 120 000 women and children are enticed into the European Union annually should make us go red in the face with shame. We should never have let things get this far. In addition to punishing the traffickers, we also need better control systems in order to liberate those annual 120 000 victims from their slavery.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we should be greatly concerned about the demise of fundamental values and standards at the margin of our society. That is why I am grateful that we in the European Parliament are fighting these excrescences with considerable unanimity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gollnisch (TDI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during the debate on this report, we can examine this phenomenon, examples of which seem to exist at the highest levels in some Member States, that is, at least, according to public fears.</p>
<p class="contents">The explosion of child pornography has its causes, and it is these that must be examined first of all. I can distinguish two causes, the first of which is the explosion of pornography itself and the second is the unfortunate trend of treating children and childhood with contempt. The explosion of pornography is in itself due to a loss of moral standards and the domination of the spirit of enjoyment, the fruits of which are bitter. We are now counting the cost of this ‘unrestrained pursuit of pleasure’, a rule by which even some of the Members of this Parliament lived during the 1960s. This reckless pursuit of pleasure inevitably leads to the quest for extreme sensations, and also to the pursuit of violence and sadism, and it is a result of the way these things have become increasingly commonplace in newspapers, films and television. This is the first factor.</p>
<p class="contents">The second factor is contempt towards children. This contempt certainly begins at a very early stage, since we are proud about presenting the fact, as if it is a right and as if it represents progress, that we are sending unborn children to their deaths in clinics, at the same time as we discuss the poor treatment to which some children are subjected. We should not be surprised that there is no rhyme or reason to this aspect of our civilisation. The ‘right to a child’ outside the family unit, outside normal sexual relations, the ‘right to adoption’ for example, by homosexuals, are claims which are also gaining ground, including in the conservative press, and all this cannot pass without having some impact.</p>
<p class="contents">However, these issues do not lead us to condemn the excellent provisions in the report that has been submitted. I would, nevertheless, like to speak briefly about the Council’s legal instruments. Why have a Framework Decision rather than a directive, when it is a question of amending several, very important points, several provisions of the penal code in each of the Member States? I would also like to bring up the method which has been used in the report. The Commission text was written in sufficiently general terms so that all types of criminality could be included. We added to them. In some areas, has the wording of the report not been made more cumbersome than is necessary?</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we approve the definition of extreme circumstances such as the use of children under the age of 16 years or children with physical or mental disabilities. A particular point in the text is raised by Amendment No 26, which seeks to amend Article 8(3). Apparently, this amendment applies when a Member State maintains the requirement of double criminality against its nationals who are accused of child pornography. In such cases, the Member State must, nonetheless, take steps. What is meant exactly by the term ‘requirement of double criminality’? Does this refer to the principle that lawyers understand by its Latin name, the <span class="italic">non bis in idem</span> principle? If so, it would, in that case, mean the principle of <span class="italic">non-</span>double criminality, in other words, the refusal to convict nationals if they are involved in legal proceedings in another Member State. I believe that we should revise the wording of this point.</p>
<p class="contents">The definition of pornography is more extensive in the report than in the original text; as is the definition of the material used for child pornography or the responsibility of persons that have children in their care.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would, however, give you a warning as regards the Internet. It is difficult to ask for the impossible. The Internet itself is no more responsible than the postal services for this criminal material, which can be transmitted by post. If we ask Internet service providers to carry out checks, which can only be effective if they are comprehensive, would, in my view, bring about the same pernicious effects as if we asked the postal services to check the content of the mail that they deliver.</p>
<p class="contents">With these reservations, we support the majority of the report, as well as Interpol’s integration with Europol. We hope that, in this way, the report will contribute to eradicating this despicable phenomenon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The proposed measures, which we shall support, aim to preserve the integrity of those who need us most, namely children. They represent the future of this world, they are also the most vulnerable and, I regret to say, they have to suffer from the selfishness of adults even before they are born, when they cannot even plead for mercy as they have no voice and no real identity.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall support these two reports by voting in favour of the amendments that go further than the Council proposal. We would particularly like to say that these are crimes for which we should show no complacency, and that these measures must be applied in cases where the children involved are under 16 years of age, which is what we voted for in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel with these provisions, we should combat the genuine, deep-rooted causes of this evil, one of which is the lax attitude of most European nations towards pornography. Under the pretext of freedom of the press or freedom of the individual, we are allowing a minority to distribute, via films, books, magazines, the <span class="italic">minitel</span> system and, increasingly now over the Internet, a vast library of pornographic material, which scorns the dignity of human beings and, quite freely, shamelessly and disrespectfully, stimulates the sexual instinct in an anarchical manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking pre-emptive action in order to combat this crime is part of a policy that is centred on the family and which encourages proper integration of children within society. Experience tells us that children who are properly integrated within a family are afforded better protection from the evils of today’s society, such as drugs, the trafficking of human beings and pornography. They are also in a better position to resist these evils if they do encounter them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was as a direct result of the horror expressed in this Parliament at those dreadful crimes that we began on the path we are still moving along now towards improving legislation for the protection of children. I should like to congratulate both our colleagues on their excellent reports.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to express my great regret that six years after those heinous crimes were exposed, this man has still not been brought to justice. That perhaps demonstrates that the extent of the crimes was unbelievable to us at the time and that the law was not adequate to deal with them. Yet it remains an absolute disgrace that this man has not yet been brought to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make a few technical remarks about the report. The strong transnational dimension of the problem requires the establishment of high standards of Community law in relation to child sexual exploitation, standards that also apply to the CEEC countries where the problems are even greater than within the Union. The age of consent varies between countries: 13 years in Spain and the Netherlands, 17 years in Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland. So a child abuser can move quite easily between countries where the legislation provides for a lower age of consent. They can do this purely to avoid criminal sanctions. This also presents a considerable obstacle to developing common standards and comparative data protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 5(1) of the Commission text proposes that the penalties for abusing a child under the age of 10 years should be more severe. We reject this because any abuse of children is a criminal offence.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, acquisition and possession of child pornography with the aim of handing it over to the law enforcement authorities should be made an offence. It is a criminal offence to own this pornography, and very often the people using it are only pretending they are collecting it for the police. I do not think we can believe that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a form of slavery which, however, mainly affects women, as Mrs Fraisse has already stated. It is not only about enforced labour, but mainly about the granting of sexual services and forced marriages.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore to be welcomed that the EU’s Framework Decision, following the UN’s Palermo protocol, contains a common definition of trafficking in women which is as broad as possible, thus covering all forms of trafficking in human beings. However, we do not achieve anything with a common definition on paper if no concrete measures are put in place to trace the perpetrators and accessories, and to offer the victims the necessary legal protection.</p>
<p class="contents">What measures? First of all, it is necessary for the victims of trafficking in human beings, once they have reported their case, not to run the risk of being evicted from the country prematurely because they are residing there unlawfully. Actual legal protection and personal support can only be brought about when they obtain an interim residence permit which enables them to take part in their trial.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is necessary for a specific deterrent to be put in place to combat the complicity of officials on duty, such as police and customs officers, since they play a key role, whether they turn a blind eye or effectively fight the trafficking in human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, the Framework Decision to fight trafficking in human beings does reflect the political will of the Member States to tackle trafficking in human beings, but it remains to be seen whether this problem is granted sufficient priority in practice on the agenda of both national and European cooperation at judicial and at police level. I would therefore call for periodic reports from the Council and the Commission to this Parliament, so that we can keep a finger on the pulse and can highlight in good time the need to intensify that policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to comment on Mrs Karamanou’s report on child pornography. I remain in doubt as to whether the definition is worded correctly since it is inadequate in the legal detailing and is too broad, and therefore opens the way for a witch-hunt approach. I am therefore seriously considering abstaining from voting on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this purpose, however, we require a well-thought out definition of child pornography which does not compromise the seriousness of the abuse of children and respects the European rights of both victims and suspects. The very broad definition in Mrs Karamanou’s report therefore gives my group some cause for concern. Indeed, censoring fantasy is taking things too far in our view. Virtual child pornography, pornographic texts and misleading images may be products of an unspeakable fantasy, but cannot be equated with the actual abuse of a child. The accounts of the Marquis de Sade do not strike me as particularly uplifting, but I do not want to impose a legal ban on them via this report either. Equally, I often dislike violence in books and films, such as Pulp Fiction, but only when fantasy touches reality should criminal law be introduced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The sexual exploitation of children, child pornography and trafficking in human beings are appalling crimes which are assuming alarming proportions. Their proliferation is facilitated through globalisation and modern telecommunications technology. These problems can no longer be resolved through national measures. The European Union and its Member States must adopt a joint approach in cooperation with the third countries concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the trafficking in human beings, a clear distinction must be made between two areas: sexual abuse, and the exploitation of labour. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, there are more slaves in the world than were trafficked from Africa in the previous centuries. The United Nations estimates that worldwide, around 200 million people are exploited as slaves. Trafficking in human beings is conducted via well-organised criminal and in some cases international networks.</p>
<p class="contents">The Framework Decision is an important step towards better cooperation between Member States. The harmonisation of Member States' legal provisions will establish a basis for better cooperation between judicial authorities in order to enable Europe to combat this trade in human beings. The same applies to the Framework Decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography.</p>
<p class="contents">All the preventive options must be expanded further. In order to take effective action against these criminal networks, we need targeted training for the police and law enforcement officers. These problems must be considered in the accession negotiations with the Central and East European countries. With regard to the trafficking in human beings, for example, some accession countries have now become countries of origin, transit countries, and even target countries.</p>
<p class="contents">On the European Union's borders, prostitution, sex tourism and the sexual exploitation of children have become a sad reality. Swift measures are therefore required in these countries to combat crime in these areas and strengthen cooperation with the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, it has been introduced into Europe. According to the UN body the IOM, half a million women are lured or forced into Europe every year for a life as sex slaves. This substantially increased trade is more profitable than drug smuggling and is increasingly often controlled by an organised mafia.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, every year over a million children are forced into child prostitution and the growing child pornography industry. These children are increasingly being exploited by tourists and businessmen who, remarkably often, come from Europe. Despite this grim reality, the penalties for the sexual exploitation of children, for child pornography and for trafficking in women are exceedingly low compared with the penalties for drugs smuggling. It may perhaps be a matter of two years’ imprisonment compared with 10-15 years for serious drugs crimes. Few perpetrators are brought before the courts and even fewer are sentenced.</p>
<p class="contents">We are today debating an attempt to turn rhetoric and fine words, to which we have in fact been devoting ourselves for many years, into concrete measures. Our four rapporteurs have carried out excellent work and, on a number of points, go further than the Commission, which moreover I would also compliment. It is essential to achieve a harmonisation of the legislation and to increase the penalties.</p>
<p class="contents">Where the sexual exploitation of children is concerned, our most important demand is that the legislation must encompass all children under 16 years of age, which is entirely in line with the usual definition of children in international conventions. Setting the limit at 10 years of age may even worsen the situation for children who are just 10 years old, because demand for these children will then increase dramatically. The lack of legislation applies not just to measures to combat the criminals, but also to the absence of the laws protecting the victims.</p>
<p class="contents">There are already many of us who support the call to stop the sexual exploitation of women and children, but more are needed. We need more men and more governments to support it, and above all we need more practical action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As regards reflections of an institutional nature, it seems to me that cooperation between Parliament and the Commission on this very sensitive issue is making significant, excellent progress. That is far less the case, though – and here I agree entirely with Mrs Terrón i Cusi – when it comes to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We are dealing with an extremely sensitive issue, an issue that is of fundamental importance to our society. It is important for there to be an interinstitutional relationship which can give concrete form to the guidelines so well specified in these two reports. For the first time since the Charter of Fundamental Rights was adopted at Nice, we have the possibility of converting a policy document into a legal document and implementing Article 24.</p>
<p class="contents">My general comment is that, on such a delicate issue, so well addressed in these reports, we are faced with a society where, increasingly, we see a creed taking root which is very close to a sort of new nihilism. A whole series of personal and interpersonal relationships have been greatly disturbed. We imagine that by giving our children everything they ask for, through the benefits of consumerism – I say this as a father – we are giving them some kind of happiness. We should think carefully about the decisions we take as a European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament synthesises the tensions present in society. The issue we are now dealing with, the exploitation of children, which pervades all societies from the most to the least developed, needs to be dealt with through legislation, as we are now doing, but also in general sociological and societal development terms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is right that we should think not only about how to define child pornography and sexual exploitation but also to what extent and where we set the age limits. It is also right that we should discuss the maximum penalties. I support the proposals put forward in the report. However, I should like to draw your attention to a further point – and I am grateful that it has been included in the reports – namely the problem of minimum, rather than just maximum, penalties. A society's condemnation of a crime is reflected to a substantial extent in the minimum penalties it applies. Even today, in many cases of child pornography crimes, the inadequate minimum penalties available mean that a suspended sentence is imposed. However, child pornography is certainly not a crime where a suspended sentence is appropriate. I therefore call for this House, through its cooperation on defining adequate minimum sentences, to create conditions which ensure that society genuinely recognises that these crimes are the worst form of harm that can be inflicted on a child. Together, through these initiatives, we should lay the foundation stones for this awareness within the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to start with Mrs Klamt's report. The Commission's proposals should be viewed in the context of a more comprehensive policy that includes the closer police and judicial cooperation in the fight against organised crime; the contributions that important Community programmes like STOP and DAPHNE have given to this issue; and, last but not least, the Forum on the Prevention of Organised Crime recently launched by the Commission, which includes a specific workshop on trafficking in human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">However, prevention is only one side of the coin. Providing victims with assistance and protection is equally important. I would like to remind you that in March the Council adopted a Framework Decision on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings. That decision addresses several important issues taken up in some of Parliament's amendments. Furthermore, I would like to reiterate that the Commission will be submitting a proposal on temporary residence permits for those victims of trafficking prepared to cooperate in investigations against their exploiters. Such an initiative should be autonomous and provide a platform for more structured assistance and protection, by clarifying the status of victims vis-à- vis residence. Given the circumstances, and bearing in mind the specific nature of the legal instruments under discussion, the Commission shares the underlying aims of several of the amendments put forward by Parliament. However, we will be unable to accept those that fall within the scope of other Framework Decisions – the Framework Decision on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings, for instance – or those whose detailed nature is incompatible with a specific instrument such as a Framework Decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret to say that, although I wholly favour the idea of creating a fund to protect the victims, such a fund would run counter to the subsidiarity principle that we need to honour in specific instruments such as Framework Decisions. Having said that, the Commission accepts most of the amendments to the recitals, including those inserting references to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to underline the work carried out by Parliament over the years. The Commission also fully shares the objectives of the amendments on the abuse of vulnerability, on vulnerability and debt bondage, and on vulnerability, physical and mental disabilities and illegal residence. It can also support the amendments on transportation in inhuman conditions as an aggravated circumstance.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Klamt report is concerned, I would like to emphasise that the sterling efforts and commitment of the Swedish Presidency have culminated in a basic agreement on several provisions, but sadly, no consensus has been achieved on the severity of sanctions. The Commission has not, therefore, submitted a revised proposal. We will await Parliament's opinions and then incorporate them into our own position.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to Mrs Karamanou's report. I would like to praise her approach and to add that, indeed, action should always take practical as well as legal form. For those actions to succeed it will be vital to harmonise criminal law and criminal regulations relating both to sanctions and to the definitions of child pornography, and child pornography on the Internet in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Here again, we share the objectives of some of the amendments that have been put forward, but we sincerely feel that they come under the provisions of other legal instruments such as the Framework Decisions on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings. Regarding the amendments concerned with the definition of child pornography and the offence of child pornography, we believe that the definitions decided by the Union should be as much in line as possible with the definitions taken on board by the draft Convention on Cyber Crime drawn up by the Council of Europe. Coherence between these two instruments is, in my opinion, extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would like to highlight its position on two sets of amendments that are particularly difficult from a political point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">First I turn to the amendments suggesting that sexual exploitation of persons below the age of 16 years should be regarded as an aggravated offence. This involves very complicated issues of a legal nature, not least as regards the relation between national law and European Union law – subsidiarity. Under many Member States' criminal law, sexual exploitation is an offence when it involves a person below the age of sexual consent, as soon as the occurrence of a sexual act has been established. This means, in turn, that the amendments setting the age limit for an aggravated offence at 16 will undoubtedly interfere not only with the systematic approaches in the Member States but also with national considerations on the age of consent. We have no legal title to harmonise the issue of the age of consent to sexual relations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot therefore agree with the relevant amendments but would be willing to consider an age limit set at a higher level than in the original proposal, that is, changing the age limit from the age of 10 to 12 years. Secondly, as regards the amendments concerned with jurisdiction and extradition, it should be observed that the articles of the proposal are modelled on provisions reflecting the state of play in regard to specific instruments in this field. The Commission cannot therefore agree to the suggested amendments. At the same time, we are willing to consider these issues in a broader context. However, as regards the extension of the jurisdiction article to habitual residents, the Commission would be prepared to take that amendment on board, as it would all other amendments to the recitals of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I sincerely hope that it will be possible to reach a political agreement in the Council as far as sanctions are concerned. I share the view of those who say that in reality the application of penal law differs in our 15 Member States. That is true. We must not, however, give the wrong message to those who traffic in human beings by not having common sanctions at European level. It would seriously defeat our common aim if we were not capable of agreeing on common sanctions when it comes to trafficking in human beings. We have already achieved agreement when it comes to counterfeiting the euro, when it comes to money-laundering, or when it comes to smugglers' and carriers' liability. I do not see any justification for not reaching political agreement on common sanctions on trafficking in human beings for purposes of economic exploitation and sexual exploitation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
