<p class="contents">Women and science – Mobilising women to enrich European research. The communication proposes two objectives: the first is to stimulate discussion between the Member States and promote best practice in the encouragement of women in the fields of science and technology. The second is to increase the number of women involved in research supported by the Union, thereby meeting the Union’s Treaty commitments to equal opportunities and enriching research, i.e. to implement gender mainstreaming.</p>
<p class="contents">Expenditure on research and technology is the third most important section of the European Union budget, after agriculture and the Structural Funds. We welcome the Commission’s communication and its objectives and invite the Member States to pursue the objective of gender equality and to cooperate with the Commission. We invite the Commission to produce comparable and improved data on the subject of Women and Science, to propose guidelines and further action and to deliver a special report to us here in Parliament within two years. The Commission will henceforth be working for more comparable data on women scientists and will arrange meetings between relevant parties and organise two major conferences which will bring together national civil servants, women scientists and all interested parties.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur expressly welcomes the measures already taken under the fifth framework research programme to increase the involvement of women and to insist that 40% of those participating in both the Marie Curie scholarships and all advisory committees are women and to incorporate the measures already proposed for the sixth framework programme. Women have traditionally been under-represented in scientific research and the women’s movement has had to fight hard to achieve the present position. At the beginning of the century, the first female Europeans attended university in Finland. However, university strongholds are still dominated by men and yet today nearly half the students are women. In my home country of Germany, for example, women entrants outnumbered men for the first time in 1995. The average ratio in Europe is 103 women to 100 men. Germany is bringing up the rear in the EU with 77 women to 100 men. In all events, more women than men graduate, at a ratio of 110:100. In Germany and Ireland this figure is lower. Two-thirds of female students now choose languages and humanities; more impetus is needed in the natural sciences. An understanding of natural sciences and technology must be fostered in the home and promoted generally through education, in school, in the kindergarten, everywhere and new paths must be opened. Coeducation is not always the only way forward; single-sex education can also provide an impetus, especially in the natural sciences and technology.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the new potential to qualify which women now have has still not been implemented in practice; the situation regarding staffing at technical colleges is still disastrous and the number of ordinary chairs in the Union is 5%, hardly any higher than at the beginning of the century in the 1920s.</p>
<p class="contents">However, equal opportunities for women in science must also bring about more input from women as regards content. Women and gender research must be seen as basic research which is of enormous importance to the European Union. The Member States must develop new instruments to increase the unused potential of all women in research and teaching and promote exchanges of experience. Networks of women scientists must be supported and innovative projects promoted and disseminated. For example, Spain and Italy are demonstrating a higher proportion of women in the natural sciences. This must be investigated more closely.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also examples in Germany: Expo 2000 in Hanover in the summer will stage a 100-day international women’s university for technology and culture. One thousand budding female scientists and 100 female professors are working there on an interdisciplinary, research-orientated programme in seven project areas: intelligence, information, the body, water, the city, work and migration. These valuable experiences will be carefully combined and evaluated so that a decision can be taken as to whether the university can be continued as a virtual campus with modern information technologies. As a founder member of the women’s university, I am convinced that this think tank will show us how to resolve many of our problems.</p>
<p class="contents">In the interests of European research and its position with reference to globalisation, the EU must not miss a single opportunity. Another chance will be the UN Peking +5 conference due to take place in the middle of the year in New York. This will take stock of successes and failures in achieving the objectives. The people with political responsibility in the European Union and in all the Member States must take consistent action to ensure that we make structural changes to framework conditions in conjunction with the governors of technical colleges, the boards of research institutes and the economy and introduce a process of change which implements the requirement to safeguard equal opportunities prescribed in the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">Our future lies in the 21st Century, as the rapporteur, Mrs McNally, has quite rightly demonstrated. We are not talking about cosmetic changes here; we need to make courageous incisions. Once again our warmest thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs McNally.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, it is fortunate that a broad consensus was reached in the debate with the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on Mrs McNally’s report, which particularly aims to increase and facilitate the participation of women in research work. In order to avoid any confusion, the concept of equal opportunities must be looked into in greater depth, since it does not seem to mean the same thing to everybody. In fact, the initial version of this opinion adopted a definition that was compatible not only with the legitimate aspirations of women to be given equal access to scientific study and to have accompanying measures established quickly, allowing them to obtain positions of responsibility commensurate with their results, but also with the concept of complementarity, which is the only one capable of justifying a proactive policy in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s discussions must be based on the values inherent in the concept of complementarity, respecting gender differences, and not on an assumption of equality between the sexes, a concept that has its own intrinsic contradictions. If men and women were indeed strictly equivalent, if a woman were, after all, just like any other man, there would be no reason to wish to impose parity between men and women, and only the criteria of competence would have to be taken into consideration in allocating jobs. Balance can be restored better, on the contrary, by acknowledging gender differences and adopting the principle of complementarity. These will support a proactive, realistic and pragmatic policy, particularly aimed at removing tangible obstacles, specific obstacles that are essentially due to their condition as mothers, with which women and only women are faced. An arbitrary quantitative policy based on the practice of quotas will not contribute to solving the fundamental problems.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be good if Parliament could express its commitment regarding women’s access to certain professions, particularly research, where women are still too widely under-represented, in terms that omit, for good, the rhetoric of claiming rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The presence of women in the scientific field has increased considerably in recent years, but is still insufficient. The presence of women in universities, in all fields, has increased, but in the subjects which we would essentially call ‘scientific’ – such as mathematics, information technology, engineering and architecture – they are still under-represented. This is aggravated by the fact that, after finishing their studies with good results, in most cases they do not pursue a scientific career fundamentally because of the difficulties this gives rise to. On the one hand, this is because of the organisation of the development of the scientific profession and also because of the difficulty of reconciling professional life with family life.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it seems to us to be especially important that the Commission has the will to defend the participation of women in the scientific field, in specific programmes, although what we consider to be really important is their participation in the context of the fifth framework programme for technological research and development for 1998-2002. Measures for the integration of women should be adopted in the specific programmes which I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">Through their contribution to research, women can offer all their own qualities which will doubtless enrich the scientific world. Balanced participation should be promoted, with the aim of equal participation, without forgetting that full professional qualifications are essential.</p>
<p class="contents">The promotion of women in this field must start with the more specifically scientific universities and in the subsequent continuation of professional careers.</p>
<p class="contents">The employment of young female researchers should be promoted by means of the Marie Curie grants, which should be granted in sufficient numbers.</p>
<p class="contents">Women must participate at all levels of consultation and decision making, and not only in scientific investigation, since the objective is enrichment and complementarity.</p>
<p class="contents">The participation of women in science should be promoted from school age, and particularly in information technology, since this is enormously important in terms of accessing other scientific fields, not only in the European Union, but also in the associated countries and in the under-developed areas where Union programmes are being carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">From school age, women should be helped to participate in the scientific world and in new technologies. A greater presence of women in the scientific world should reflect the importance of the participation of women in all areas of the social sphere. A greater presence of women in the fifth and sixth framework programmes will be an example of the equality between men and women, easing their incorporation into a sector in which they have been traditionally under-represented.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be necessary to perfect the reconciliation between professional and family lives, since this is essential to a greater presence of women in positions of responsibility. In Parliament, and particularly in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities – we will continue to work towards these fundamental objectives in order to achieve a better balance in society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is a fact that the degree to which women are represented in the field of scientific research and technology is extremely low and in complete disproportion to the progress which they have made in other fields, thanks to European policy, especially education, where we really can speak of a triumph by women now that they outnumber men at nearly all the European universities. Mrs<span class="bold"> </span>Gröner has already given us a great deal of interesting information on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the position of women generally in career posts in scientific research depends to a great extent on the choices which they make while they are in the educational system and on their position in the family. The various directions which the two sexes follow in their studies affect their future development, which is why we need to intervene early, during careers advice at school and explain to young women the consequences which their choices will have on their career.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the preservation of traditional roles and the division of labour by sex have a negative effect on women’s career prospects, which is why, of course, we still need measures to reconcile professional and family life. However, I would like to say that this should apply in particular to men. Men need to combine their career with their family and personal life. Women make up fifty per cent of human resources, half the source of talent, skills and creativity in the world. Maintaining the present imbalance in the crucial field of research is tantamount to a loss of precious resources and impacts directly on the development and the future of the EU. None of the present-day challenges can be met without the input, ideas, imagination and skills of women.</p>
<p class="contents">However, over and above the question of equality of the sexes, there is the development dimension of the issue, i.e. the need to support the competitiveness and the innovation of the Union. The fifth framework programme aims to incorporate political equality of the sexes. We support the initiatives to mobilise the numerous scientific networks run by women and safeguard a balance between the sexes in science and we support the institutions which are shaping policies, selecting and evaluating plans and deciding how resources should be allocated.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on the European Commission and the Member States to consider if women are adequately represented in the common agricultural policy, in the Structural Funds, in the fifth framework programme, in the numerous scientific and technical committees and in key positions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to close, Mr President, by asking the European Commission to use the pre-accession aid programmes to candidate Member States and Turkey in order to target the scientific skills of women and give them a better chance to contribute to scientific and technical research and development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We do find it important, though, that this situation should be highlighted and proposals formulated to improve the position of women. Commissioner Busquin has since also published a report of a study commissioned by the European Commission. </p>
<p class="contents">Twelve top female scientists from different Member States have collated hard evidence which illustrates the imbalance within the world of science. Moreover, they have formulated very concrete proposals to improve the current situation of women. The study clearly shows that the cause of the imbalance must be tackled within the scientific world itself and not amongst the women, who are said to have different interests and ambitions and make other choices. These appear to be prejudices.</p>
<p class="contents">There are pressure points at universities and research institutes and within industry. Within each of these professional circles, there is again an imbalance in the distribution of jobs. For example, the percentage of female professors varies in the Member States from 4% to a maximum of 18% of the total number of professors. Furthermore, it appears that the percentage of female professors within one and the same institution is remarkably lower than the percentage of female assistants. </p>
<p class="contents">From an analysis of job-application data, it appears that women who clearly aspire to a scientific career are selected in much smaller quantities than their male colleagues. Having children does not even seem to be a stumbling block, quite the opposite in fact; women with families are said to publish more than single women. </p>
<p class="contents">It is remarkable to observe that a higher percentage of women have scientific jobs in Southern European countries than in Northern European countries. An explanation for this is that the latter group of countries boasts flexible options for career breaks, with the consequence that re-entry into a scientific career is not so evident. </p>
<p class="contents">One needs to exercise extra vigilance, therefore, when it comes to women and family-friendly measures and take the necessary precautions so as to ensure that women actually retain the same opportunities as men. </p>
<p class="contents">We hope that this study, in conjunction with Mrs McNally’s report, will be an incentive to take further initiatives to meet the need for statistics. We rely on the European Commission to take steps to create the circumstances in which the proposals that have been made can be translated into practice. </p>

Whenever the subject of women comes up, it would seem that we always put the discussion off until after all the other debates, which I think is a pity.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, reading Mrs McNally’s report we know immediately that we are dealing with a vital issue. ‘Women and Science’ is a title that could be misleading, if it were to be seen as part of a never-ending list of ‘Women and …’ whatever subject it may be. Such a list is necessary, but occasionally it is inadequate in terms of highlighting the importance of a problem. Well, in this instance we are dealing with a vital matter that for centuries has given rise to controversy about the equality of the sexes. Can women have similar reasoning powers to men? Are women capable of scientific activity? There is no longer anyone who doubts that, and the reply now and forever must be that they can and they are. But that is where the problems start. If the situation of women in the scientific field is worrying, it is because of a number of problems that are difficult to resolve. Science, as a symbolic activity, remains a male preserve, just like political responsibility. The same obstacles are found whether it is a matter of sharing political power or academic power. In both cases, male power is at stake. So let us propose the same remedies, such as the introduction of parity in politics which has been attempted by some countries in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Girls are very successful at school and there is nothing to justify the fact that there are so few women in the world of research. The obstacles to a scientific career are external to the research itself. In other words, it is not enough to gain access to the scientific arena, this arena needs to make room for women, and not always treat them as guests, as it was put so well at the symposium in April 1998 organised by the Commission. The direction you take at school and university remains an enigma as far as the equality of the sexes is concerned. The exact sciences are often organised in such a way as to discourage girls. Coeducational training, and also the potential sexism of teachers, parents and institutions, are problems that are far from being solved. As for social sciences, they will only have a purpose if they incorporate the need to consider the ‘male-female’ dimension in all social and human problems. It is clearly necessary to have a broad view of science and to know that you cannot think about society without introducing the ‘male-female’ dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are still far short of the target. I believe that Mrs McNally’s report, and I pay tribute to its completeness as well as its complexity, is important, as it emphasises remedies, if not solutions, to the problem of the difficult practice of science, that is to say, of data and figures of course, the presence of women in the different branches, scholarships and diplomas, the introduction of restrictive measures to increase the presence of women in research, the promotion of studies on mechanisms of sexual discrimination and the setting up in the Directorates-General of the Commission of working parties and monitoring bodies. I am delighted that this report has also not omitted the problem of women’s power in science, …</p>

In the field of science and technology, our subject today, they are only present to a very modest degree. Women tend to be employed in less secure jobs and earn less than men. Not even 10% are entrusted with research work or managerial positions. The under-representation of women completely contradicts their talents and skills, their creativity and flexibility at a high level.</p>
<p class="contents">European programmes are already helping significantly to improve the quality of research results and extend cooperation between Member States. Positive change can be based on statistics with gender-specific data and knowledge of various models for promoting women. Other Community programmes, such as parts of SOCRATES and LEONARDO for education and training should be intertwined with measures at national level such as curricula with more lessons in mathematics and the natural sciences. Young women will then gain access to information technology and many will become recognised scientists. In other words, they will forge careers other than in the classical women’s fields of education, medicine or the social professions.</p>
<p class="contents">What do we need? More part-time jobs, more crèches in companies and, more importantly, more women in advisory, selection and decision-making committees for projects and positions. Nonetheless, I am not totally in favour of the need for quotas. Laying down strict requirements for at lest 40% of women in research programmes and institutes undermines the self-confidence of those women who have made or will make their way without any such help. However, given the crass under-representation of women in science I accept it unreservedly as a flexible guideline or point of reference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also want to congratulate my colleague, Mrs McNally, on her excellent report and the proposals which it contains.</p>
<p class="contents">To my mind, this report could not have come at a better time. It is a recognised fact that the participation of women in working life is essential for the future of Europe. The rate of employment in Europe is lower than that in the United States of America and Japan and the low rate of female activity in the majority of the Member States is therefore not surprising.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the role of women is essential in increasing European production, the importance of their contribution to the financing of social security and, therefore, the maintenance of a social model, must also be mentioned. Yet it is not enough just to analyse the amount of work carried out by women in the European Union for the quality of this work is also fundamental. It is also essential for society to recognise that women with professional qualifications are capable of participating in the sectors which are the most demanding in terms of professional training and in which the European Union has major shortages.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has between 700 000 and 800 000 vacant jobs due to a lack of people with the training needed to develop the information society and use new technologies. Women scientists in Europe must therefore be provided with every support and every opening so that in this sector they can play the role which they not only deserve but which is also vital to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is opportune because the Portuguese presidency is going to hold an extraordinary summit in Lisbon next March on employment, economic reforms and cohesion for a Europe of innovation and knowledge. The aim of this summit is to establish the bases of a development model which can put Europe in the vanguard of economic competitiveness at world level. This will not be possible without extensive participation by European women scientists. Positive measures must therefore be taken in this respect, instead of simply allowing societal developments and mainstreaming policies to have an effect. I have high hopes that the Portuguese presidency will give due attention to the participation of women in this programme, not only because the Portuguese Ministry for Equality is committed to this but also – and this is no coincidence – because the coordination of the programme to be presented at the Lisbon Summit was entrusted by the Portuguese Prime Minister to a woman scientist.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the good intentions of the Commission and Council will be translated into specific proposals aimed at improving the participation of European women, in quantitative and qualitative terms, in the areas of science and new technologies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Neither the Commission text nor the report achieve that objective. First of all, they fail to link this issue to the more general women’s issue. They do not present quantitative data which give a clear picture of the situation over and beyond a few statistics on the ratio between the sexes at university. However, there is a huge gap between university and a career in research. The biggest problem in the texts is that they do not go into the problem in depth or indicate the causes of it. In fact, the non-specific reference to the existence of complex structural barriers or to the fact that the prevailing culture of research is generally male cannot be considered as a serious interpretation of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The inability to make full use of productive resources, especially human resources, and the lack of equal opportunity are basic features of the capitalist system. This has significant repercussions, especially on the more sensitive social strata, such as young people and women. It is not by chance that the situation and social position of women was far better in the former Socialist states than it is in the West. The society in which we live has created a framework which is hostile towards women. For example, the policy of constantly reducing social benefits and dismantling national insurance systems has resulted in increased pressure on women to take on their traditional role. This applies all the more so to women scientists.</p>
<p class="contents">For certain, the problem will not be solved by so-called flexibility or by part-time employment, since research calls for dedication and consistent work. No one will have any objection to numerous proposals in the resolution, such as more detailed statistics, a database of female experts etc. However, these measures will not solve the problem. More importantly, the problem will not be solved with quotas. A different policy is needed, a policy which respects people in general and women in particular, the driving force behind which is not profit for a few and the objective of which is not exploitation of the masses. Of course, we do not expect the European Union to pursue such a policy, but we do expect the people of the European Union to impose it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For the first time, I am speaking as representative of the Pensioners’ Party. While I am national secretary of the Pensioners’ Party in Italy, its leader, Giuseppina Cardazzi, is a woman, and we are therefore fully aware of the importance of women. It is more important to achieve equality between men and women in science more than in any other field. We have only had male scientists so far: Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, von Braun, Einstein, to name but a few. </p>
<p class="contents">Just imagine, Commissioner Busquin, what would have happened if women had had the same opportunities as men over the last 2000 years! Just imagine, President Provan, if women had already been, over the last 2000 years, in the position where the Commission now wants them by means of this proposal. I am absolutely certain that, if this had been the case, we would have progressed much further than is actually the case. </p>
<p class="contents">As we know, women live much longer than men. We are still wondering what on earth they have that men do not, but I am sure that this certain something, that we still have not pinpointed, will also become apparent through scientific research. The fact that this measure allows women to express their scientific ability – hidden until today – is much more important than the fact that it offers them job opportunities. This is why I take particular pleasure in declaring my support for this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to thank my colleague for his kind, encouraging words. We all know, however, both from experience and from the discussion here this evening, that it is not down to good intentions nor women alone. There are complex structural barriers, one might even say stereotypical barriers, which have prevented women from taking a more active role in science and research. As women, we are under-represented here and none of the speakers here this evening has claimed otherwise.</p>
<p class="contents">Science and research: anyone who wants to work here, who wants opportunities here must also be permanently available. And that is often very, very difficult for women. We need to be flexible. Women are tied to the family, children, perhaps even their husband’s place of work. We need to offer flexibility, to accommodate women and offer them the possibility for permanent further development in this fast changing area.</p>
<p class="contents">The fifth framework programme makes a special effort to incorporate equal opportunities. Particular account must be taken of the EU’s obligation to safeguard equal opportunities in the field of science. Instruments and methods to encourage women to enter the classical natural sciences must be promoted from an early age. Women are proving their academic abilities on scientific courses and yet women scientists are still being paid less than their male counterparts. They rarely get to the top, they rarely have positions of responsibility. Scientific research by women is often held in lower esteem by committees of experts than research by their male counterparts.</p>
<p class="contents">We have reached agreement in the House here this evening. We look forward to receiving the Commission’s report and hope that this will enable us to achieve progress for more women in science. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, we must welcome Mrs McNally’s report, as well as the corresponding Commission communication, and we hope that it will receive the full support of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight three points which seem to me to be important. The first relates to the fact that, as the report and communication point out, it is precisely in the countries of the South – Italy, Portugal and Spain – where the presence of women in the scientific field is most balanced, which shows us that, in science, it is important, as it is in life in general, not to trust in clichés.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point refers to quotas. It is impossible to avoid quantitative elements in evaluating a policy, but quotas must be understood in a global way and in terms of trends, that is to say, as an objective in the medium or long term, as something to apply in general terms, but not as a rigid number to be imposed automatically in each consultative group, in each assessment and review group.</p>
<p class="contents">Incentives, stimulus, promotion, the removal of obstacles and the elimination of prejudice must be pursued relentlessly. However, what we can never do is put the cart before the horse. It is the old problem of means and ends. The means must be adequate and proportionate and, above all, they must not endanger the most important thing, which is the quality, rigour and achievement of scientific activity.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the third point is that scientific method has no sex. Madame Curie thought in the same way as Lord Rutherford and Madame Kowaleska thought in the same way as Elie Cartán. We must do everything possible to balance the presence of women in the scientific field, but let us not seek short cuts which will cause us to lose our way.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Busquin,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, in presenting this communication, the Commission wished to take a strong political initiative on the subject of the place of women in research. I am pleased to note that this initiative has been very warmly welcomed by Parliament, which I should like to thank for the important role that it plays in the “women and science” debate. The motion for a resolution that we are discussing today largely supports the guidelines drawn up by the Commission. This encouragement is very significant.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the subject of women and science comes within the broader context of research policy in the Union. As I already said to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, the aim is to develop a political strategy to create a European research area. The Commission has just adopted a communication to this effect on 18 January. The creation of such an area will make it easier to harness the potential represented by women scientists and to take up the common challenge of the under-representation of women in research.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of the debate on the quota principle in the matter of women’s participation in general. This debate is also, of course, evolving with regard to the participation of women in scientific research. The Commission has not chosen the mandatory quota approach, as it prefers that of quantitative participation objectives, linked to follow-up and evaluation. The Commission considers that this approach will make it possible to progress the participation of women, while respecting the principle of scientific excellence. Mrs McNally’s report, which was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Women’s Rights, supports the guidelines of the Commission, whose aim is to achieve at least 40% female participation in certain aspects of the implementation of the fifth framework programme. This support is important. Already, the presence of women is 26% in the advisory groups and 24% in the monitoring and evaluation panels, which represents considerable progress compared to the fourth framework programme. There is still work to be done, however, but I feel we are going in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs McNally also recommends that the impact studies on gender in the specific programmes of the fifth framework programme be taken into account for the sixth framework programme. The Commission has already published the call for tenders in respect of these studies. The Commission will evaluate the tenders received. The results of these studies will make it possible to draw up the guidelines for the sixth framework programme.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the promotion of equal opportunities goes beyond the simple framework of the Community research programmes and I understand Parliament’s concern to see this matter taken into account in the other policies of the Union. The Commission is already taking action in this regard and will continue to do so, for example, in the context of guidelines for employment, the fourth pillar and in the regulations on the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">In its reform project outlined in a White Paper, the Commission sets the objective of a broad balance in the representation of the sexes in all fields and at all hierarchical levels. Mrs McNally suggests an examination of the reasons for the gap between the number of women with degrees in science and the number ultimately exercising a profession in these fields. A number of speakers have referred to this. The reasons for this gap are complex and the report published recently by the ETAM experts deals with this question. It is important to continue the analysis in more detail in order to better identify the obstacles and ways to overcome them.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, the implementation of the action plan presented in the communication is also being actively pursued and the report by the ETAM experts, which Mrs Sorensen reported on so aptly, which was presented on 23 November, in the presence of Members of Parliament, including Mrs McNally, reviews the under-representation of women in research. This report, which was written by independent experts, is a very useful tool for encouraging discussion and coming up with specific measures.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> The final version of this document will be sent to Parliament. Other developments are underway, however. I would reiterate that in July this year, a meeting of the networks of women scientists has been organised and a group of national officials met on 29 and 30 November to compare the policies to promote women in the scientific field in the various Member States. In this respect, the Commission is taking steps in cooperation with the Member States – Mrs Gröner highlighted the work being undertaken in Germany. Together with the national specialist groups, we are developing statistical indicators on the participation of women in European research, because it is very important to have reliable indicators at all levels and the national experts are a very great help here.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to point out that on 3 and 4 April in Brussels there will be an important European conference to review the situation with all the parties concerned: national parliaments, national administrations, research institutes and networks. You are, of course, most cordially invited to take part in this work. I would also say that, in accordance with the commitment made in the communication, the Commission intends to inform Parliament on a regular basis of the progress made. We shall, moreover, as you pointed out, issue a communication in 2001 based on all the reports drawn up.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by saying that the subject of ‘Women and science’ compels us to look beyond the research programmes of the Union alone and must be a matter for wide debate. We have done that here, but I feel that the Parliament resolution will provide important support in this context, and I should like to thank you for it.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
