This is the first time that I have spoken under your Presidency. Allow me to congratulate you once again and wish your Presidency the greatest of success. I also hope the institutional relationship which we will undoubtedly maintain between us, with the Parliament over which you are presiding, will be a success. The evidence is there: in the short time that you have been President of Parliament, we have held several meetings, all of them productive, and I hope that that will be the normal pattern for our work to come.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to congratulate the President of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, who I have already had the opportunity to meet on one occasion, and also the new Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, who I was able to receive in my office just a short while ago. Congratulations, good luck and I hope that we will cooperate in the most fruitful possible way.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have just landed from Riyadh, where a very important meeting of the Arab League has taken place and where I believe the European Union has also played a significant role. The meeting has not yet ended and I hope that I will be able to give you the latest information on its progress during this sitting.</p>
<p class="contents">On this first appearance, I would like to tell you that I am extremely pleased to be here with you to debate the foreign policy issues that I know are of crucial importance to the European Parliament, which are of interest to you, in which you are involved and on which I would like to continue to work with the greatest possible dedication, as we have done previously.</p>
<p class="contents">In the time available to us this morning, which is quite a lot, I would like to debate with you some of the most burning issues, some of the most important issues of global foreign policy and which affect us as Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is a good time to do so, Mr President. A few days ago in Berlin, we adopted a Declaration on the 50th Anniversary of the European Union. It was a wonderful event at which Chancellor Merkel, who was here yesterday, presented us with a Declaration that I believe to be important and which can make way in the future for greater development of the European Union in all fields.</p>
<p class="contents">I have absolutely no doubt, Mr President, that a common foreign policy is one of the great challenges that the European Union has to face. There are many reasons for that. It is sufficient just to mention two of them. The first is that when one travels elsewhere in the world, one discovers a great desire for the European Union to play an increasingly prominent role in foreign policy. You have had particular opportunities to witness this when you too have travelled elsewhere in the world, and you are aware of it.</p>
<p class="contents">Our presence is being requested in the most diverse places and conflicts. They are calling for a European way of doing things, with a foreign policy that works, and they are asking for something that we all want to see. At the end of the day, I believe that we should all acknowledge that the fact that that is the case represents a success.</p>
<p class="contents">But our own citizens are also calling for the same thing. There is no question that a regular look at the Eurobarometer demonstrates that the European citizens also have a particular desire for the European Union’s foreign policy to be as European as possible, as common as possible, as coordinated as possible and as visible as possible. Ladies and gentlemen, those are the things I wished to talk about, and I believe that it represents a success that the European Union should be moving in that direction and it should be recognised as such.</p>
<p class="contents">To give you an idea, we currently have ten missions deployed in the world: from Kinshasa to Bosnia and from Gaza to Iraq. We are about to prepare a mission for Afghanistan and two missions in Kosovo, which will undoubtedly be the most difficult ones in view of their size and in view of the importance that Kosovo will have in relation to the future stabilisation of the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that other missions will come later. There will be a demand for other missions later on, both from a civilian point of view and from a military point of view, or both. We must therefore be prepared for what is expected of us, for what is expected of the European Union. This also means having adequate resources, ladies and gentlemen, and our debates will be significant in this regard, because Parliament will undoubtedly have to play an important role here.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning I would like to debate the hottest issues – if you will excuse the expression – of international life, such as the Middle East, with all of its manifestations. I would like to say a few words about Iran and recent events. We will of course have to talk about the Balkans; and I would also like to talk to you about Africa and, briefly, about certain issues involving Eastern Europe that we are currently debating amongst ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall begin with the Middle East. As I have just pointed out, I believe that the Arab League Summit that took place yesterday and which has not yet finished, at which I had the honour of representing the European Union, may be one of the most important summits of the Arab League’s sixty-year history. Sixty years of history that were celebrated on 3 March, a few days ago; while our own Union celebrated fifty years of history last week.</p>
<p class="contents">During that period of time, we have undoubtedly had more than thirty years of close cooperation with the Arab League. I believe that it is important to stress this and I also believe that it is important to insist to you that that cooperation between the European Union and the Arab League is going to be increasingly important.</p>
<p class="contents">There were two significant elements to yesterday’s meeting that I would like to discuss with you. Perhaps the most striking one, in my view, having taken part in many of the Arab League’s meetings, was the clear leadership at all times of His Majesty the King of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, Saudi Arabia has been an important country in the region, but not one of the most active countries from a political point of view. It has been more important from an economic point of view. Today we have a King, Abdullah, who for a long time was, shall we say, acting king ─ because of the illness of his predecessor ─ and who has begun some rather important action within the Arab League with a view to resolving the problems faced by the Arab world, its people and its region.</p>
<p class="contents">The Arab League is being revitalised, therefore, and we believe that to be important, and extremely important issues are being dealt with. I would like to talk specifically about three of them essentially, and I shall refer to them in my speech.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important one, from the point of view of the peace process, is undoubtedly the revitalisation of the Arab League's initiative. The honourable Members will remember that, following the Beirut Summit of 2002, there was an Arab initiative offering mutual recognition between the Arab countries and Israel provided that there was complete withdrawal to the 1967 borders. That initiative, which has been discussed in many fora for several years, was not accepted entirely by Israel and today the Arab countries have put it back on the table with greater energy and determination.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, we Europeans were able to introduce the Arab initiative into the famous road map, and that initiative is therefore a fundamental pillar of any possible final settlement of the Middle East problem and in particular the peace process as a whole, not just the peace process in Israeli-Palestinian terms, but also in relation to issues concerning Libya, Lebanon and Syria. This, therefore, is the first issue still being debated this morning in Riyadh; I believe that giving new impetus to that initiative may be of crucial importance in terms of giving new impetus to the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">The issues relating to Lebanon have also been debated. It is interesting to note that the Arab League has also begun a debate on issues which are of shared concern to both the Arab League and the African Union: issues that have an African component and an Arab component, such as Sudan or Somalia. I shall speak briefly about those two issues in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say firstly, in relation to the Middle East, that the European Union is convinced that the Arab-Israeli conflict lies at the heart of the region’s problems; Europe has been entirely convinced of this for a long time, I am not saying anything new. We have supported the Mecca Agreement, also brokered by the King of Saudi Arabia; we believe that the Mecca Agreement makes a contribution towards putting an end to the conflict amongst Palestinians and finding a solution to the conflict which, as the honourable Members know, and as we have said many times, must involve an end to the occupation that began in 1967, the creation of two States and a broad and overall settlement for the region.</p>
<p class="contents">We unquestionably support the tireless efforts of President Abbas, with whom I spent a good hour yesterday morning, to achieve the objectives of the Palestinian people in accordance with the principles that he himself has repeated endlessly, on two key occasions in particular: the last United Nations General Assembly and, recently, when the new Palestinian Government took office on 17 May.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, there are three of these principles, which the President listed: the first is respect for the agreements previously reached by the PLO and the Palestinian National Authority; the second, mutual recognition; and thirdly, renouncing violence and commitment to negotiation. As the honourable Members know, the European Union has not abandoned and will never abandon the Palestinian people. We have maintained this approach for a long time and we will continue to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I truly believe that we have a new opportunity to give impetus to resolving the conflict. To try to get out of what we might call a crisis management phase and into a new conflict resolution phase. I believe that the objective conditions are in place to be able to enter this phase and to try to move this process forward, with the help of the members of the Quartet.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, with the establishment of the new Palestinian government of national unity we are going to be faced with various problems that we will have to discuss, that we will have to resolve. We will be faced with new problems such as how to deal with that government and how to fund that government. I would like to tell you very briefly what my position is, a position that I am prepared to defend at the weekend when the Foreign Ministers meet in Chemnitz under the German Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">There are people in the new government, ladies and gentlemen, who we know, people who we have known well for a long time. There are other people who we do not know because they belong to Hamas and, since Hamas is on the list of terrorist organisations, we do not deal with them and we do not know them. But there are many people in that government who we know, and, as I have said, we have known them well for a long time; I know them and many of you know them.</p>
<p class="contents">To say that the new Finance Minister is unknown to us would not be true: we have been dealing with him for a long time. We have worked with him very effectively and it would be really absurd now to talk about him as if he were someone unknown to us.</p>
<p class="contents">The Foreign Minister is from Gaza, I have dealt with him for many years: he is a person who does not belong to any political formation, he is an intellectual man, and a man who has a passport from another country – not the country from which Palestinians usually have a passport – who for a long time has arranged numerous meetings between many of the honourable Members and members of the Palestinian Authority. I therefore believe that it would be a great mistake to entirely cut off all contacts with people who are part of the new government and with whom we have worked together closely for a long time.</p>
<p class="contents">If you were also to ask me what we should do or how we should use the funding resources, I do not believe that we should change our position with regard to funding overnight, but I do believe that, in any event, one of our objectives should be to listen to the Finance Minister, an old friend of ours, an honest person, a person whose political career we have known. To find out what he is thinking, to find out how to provide financial aid as effectively as possible so that it does not just contribute to greater wellbeing for the Palestinians, but also so that it can contribute to moving the peace process forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that our position should be the one that we have stated within the Quartet. What is most important today is not words, but rather actions. To watch how the Palestinian Government behaves at this point and to act and adapt our action to the way it behaves, not just the words it uses.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that we are determined to make a leap towards resolving the conflict and to get out of the crisis management zone.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Quartet has had more vitality recently, since the beginning of the year. We have met on several occasions and we have held some very important meetings, both with Abbas and with Olmert, and I would like to tell you that in the coming weeks we will have a meeting in the region with the countries with which we have closest affinity, with the countries with which we have the closest relationship with a view to resolving the problem, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the Emirates and Amman. I believe that these are the countries with which we have had most involvement and we want to meet with them.</p>
<p class="contents">In the not too distant future, before the summer, we would like the Quartet, together with the four countries I have mentioned, to also be able to hold a meeting with the parties: that is to say, a meeting with the Palestinians and a meeting with Israel. That would be Israel’s first meeting with the Quartet. Israel has never had a meeting with the Quartet. The Palestinians have met with it, but Israel has not yet done so.</p>
<p class="contents">This is our work programme for the coming months. They are going to be extremely important months during which I know that the President of Parliament is going to travel to the region too. It seems to me absolutely crucial that we coordinate our efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Since I am sure many of the questions and answers will relate to the Middle East, I shall say no more about the peace process and make a few comments about Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday morning in Riyadh I had the opportunity also to meet with the Iranian Foreign Minister, Mr Motaki. I told him very firmly and frankly that the detention of the fifteen British sailors by the Iranian authorities was unacceptable to the European Union. There is no reason whatsoever for that action, nothing illegal had taken place, and the European Union must show solidarity with our British friends with a view to the release of those sailors.</p>
<p class="contents">A word about the nuclear programme: as the honourable Members know, last Saturday, 24 March, at night, while we were in Berlin, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1747 unanimously.</p>
<p class="contents">Resolution 1747 is now the third resolution that the Security Council has adopted unanimously on the subject of Iran, with a view to Iran complying with its obligations, obligations that have arisen from the Vienna reports or opinions, which Dr ElBaradei, as Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, is passing to the Board of Governors for voting on.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that it is very significant that, at this last session, the vote was unanimous from the whole of the international community represented in the Security Council. Given the current make-up of the Security Council, the appreciation of the Iranian issue could, in principle, have been more complex than it was under the previous membership. The countries currently sitting on the United Nations Security Council include countries such as Qatar, Indonesia, an important Islamic country, and South Africa, which symbolically represents the non-aligned countries, as well as many other countries, including five European countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we have the obligation to explain our position very clearly, so that there is no divergence amongst us in terms of our understanding of the difficulty that the non-proliferation issue presents to the world ─ not just to a particular kind of country, but the world in general ─ so that they understand it properly and so that we can have a good debate with them, with the non-aligned countries and with countries such as the ones I have just mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that it was possible to reach a consensus on this Resolution so quickly represents a success. It sends a clear message to the Iranian authorities that their nuclear programme must be compatible with the resolutions of the Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time that the Resolution was made public, a statement was made in Berlin, by myself on behalf of the European members and also of the permanent members of the Security Council, saying that we still believe that the best way to resolve this problem with Iran is by means of a political solution, and that we are still prepared to begin or continue a negotiation; and that a political solution is the only possible kind of solution.</p>
<p class="contents">48 hours later, I was able to talk to Dr Larajani, the Iranian interlocutor, not in order to resolve the problem, not in order to begin a negotiation or a pre-negotiation, but in order to communicate, at least, this clear message from us, a message that was well received by Dr Larajani. Let us hope that over the coming weeks the Iranian leaders have the good sense, not just to resolve their current problem with the United Kingdom, but also to restart negotiations that can lead to a definitive solution to this problem. Negotiation is the only solution, ladies and gentlemen, and we must return to it as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">While we are on the subject of Iran, I would like to say a few words about non-proliferation. As I have said, the issue of non-proliferation is becoming an issue capable of dividing the international community. Nothing could be worse than for us to take a different view depending on whether we are northern countries or southern countries, developed countries or less developed countries, when it comes to such a crucial issue as non-proliferation. We must therefore make every possible effort to explain it well and to share our concerns with them. Non-proliferation is something that affects everybody, that affects the world as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that one of our obligations as Europeans – a fundamental one in my view – is to deal with the non-proliferation debate from three different points of view: firstly, non-proliferation itself. Secondly, the issue of disarmament: I believe that we have abandoned the issue of disarmament for too long, placing the emphasis essentially on the issue of non-proliferation, without placing it also on what the non-proliferation Treaty tells us about disarmament; it also says that the powers with nuclear capabilities must begin to consider how to disarm, so that nuclear weapons can begin to disappear from our planet. We must therefore insist – I believe that this is a fundamental principle that the Europeans must understand perfectly clearly – that the issue of disarmament is fundamental.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must also incorporate the issue of technology transfer into this debate, since that is what makes certain countries feel that there are double standards in relation to the use of nuclear energy.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that to produce a package containing these three elements, to begin a serious negotiation with other countries from outside of the European Union, led by the European Union, may represent the European Union’s great contribution to the construction of a peaceful world and a world in which arms begin to cease being a means of resolving problems and in which problems are resolved by means of words, dialogue and normal language, which is the language that the European Union advocates.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to provide you with a little information on the most recent events in the Balkans, particularly with regard to Kosovo and Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, Martti Ahtisaari, the former President of Finland, a great person of whom we are all aware, who was a great President of Finland, was commissioned by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to try to resolve the problems over the final status of Kosovo. He has been working for a long time with both Serbia and Kosovo in the search for a negotiated solution.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind the honourable Members that the time limit for beginning the final stage of negotiations was extended until 21 February, in order to allow for the elections that were to take place in Serbia at that time.</p>
<p class="contents">President Ahtisaari’s final position, which now forms part of the formal document presented to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, more or less tells us that it is very difficult, not to say impossible, at least for him, to achieve a negotiated solution that is acceptable to both parties. The international community may therefore be obliged to seek a way to impose a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">As the honourable Members know, imposing a solution means a United Nations Security Council resolution under Chapter 7. This will require the commitment of all the members of the Security Council and, as you know, certain difficulties have begun to emerge amongst certain of its member countries. Essentially Russia, and very probably China as well. The process is therefore entering a new phase. Following the phase led by Mr Ahtisaari, we are entering the phase of debate within the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the European Union has been in constant contact with Mr Ahtisaari. We have worked with him on several matters, though responsibility was his, and now we must establish our position.</p>
<p class="contents">So far our position has been to fully support President Ahtisaari and his process, and now we will have to take a decision on supporting the final position that he has adopted. At this point we must wait to see how events unfold in the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to point out that the European Union is going to have a huge responsibility when the final status of Kosovo is defined. Kosovo is part of our continent. It has European prospects, and therefore whatever final resolution the Security Council adopts, we will have certain fundamental obligations: in relation to the office representing the international community in Kosovo; and we will also have a duty, in addition to the economic aspects of which the honourable Members are well aware, a common foreign and security policy duty, a policing and judicial duty, in relation to all aspects of the law and the implementation of the law in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">This will undoubtedly be the European Union’s most important task so far since we have had our foreign and security policy. We will probably have more than 1 500 people deployed in these different areas that I have just mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Parliament will have a huge responsibility in terms of seeing whether we are capable of finding the resources. We have resources, but maybe not everything required to make a success of this difficult job, which is surely the most difficult the European Union has faced in terms of management on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot fail, ladies and gentlemen. If the European Union fails in relation to the stabilisation of the Balkans, if we fail in relation to the stabilisation of Kosovo and Serbia, that failure would have immense consequences, seriously restricting any other opportunities for European Union action that may arise in other parts of the world. If we are not capable of resolving the problems facing us in our neighbourhood quickly and effectively, it will be much more difficult to do so beyond our borders.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a word about Serbia. Ladies and gentlemen, Serbia is a great Balkan country, a great country which we must support fully as well. Serbia is undoubtedly going to face some difficult times: the Montenegro referendum, the final solution to the Kosovo problem. I believe that we have the obligation to help Serbia in the most effective way possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In Serbia, we must continue to negotiate the association and stabilisation agreement, but I would like us to make the most generous effort possible to help that country, ladies and gentlemen. As I have said, Serbia is a great country with a vocation and a desire to be part of the family of European countries.</p>
<p class="contents">You may have seen in the recent election campaign that the position of the current President Tadic, a person we respect and with whom we have very close relations, was an entirely pro-European position. Following what is going to happen during this period of time, I believe that we should be capable of helping the government, which has not yet been formed following the elections, as much as we possibly can to continue to be a pro-European government, a government that defends our values, a government that leads Serbia towards its rightful destiny, which is to have a European future.</p>
<p class="contents">We meet with President Tadic extremely often; he was here recently, he was also in Berlin for the 50th Anniversary of the Rome Treaties, he is a great friend of Europe and, as I have said, I see him relatively often. We discuss all of these issues extremely frankly and in the greatest detail.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have the opportunity to meet Mr Kostunica, who is currently Prime Minister of an acting government, it is true, but Prime Minister of the Government nevertheless, with whom President Tadic will undoubtedly sooner or later have to reach agreement on a coalition that can govern the country in the best possible way, in the most stable possible way, together with the G17 Group, the coalition that previously governed Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents">Another of Mr Tadic’s commitments during the election campaign has been full and effective cooperation with the International Criminal Court, because it is crucial that people who have been so clearly implicated in crimes – some were found guilty by the International Criminal Court in the Hague a few days ago – are found and brought to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we are no doubt going to have to carry on talking about the Kosovo issues every week: from now until the summer, important decisions about Serbia and Kosovo will have to taken practically every week. I would like to say to you that the European operation in Kosovo is ready to go and as soon as the Security Council resolution is approved we will be able to implement it.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not therefore worried about this issue, but we are worried about its duration and about whether there will be sufficient resources to carry it out fully and on time. I would like to assure you, however, that the work is done and ready, and as soon as the Security Council approves the resolution we will be in a position to play our role.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a couple of comments on certain important issues involving Eastern Europe. Over recent days and weeks, I have had the opportunity to meet with the President and the Prime Minister of Ukraine. I would like to share my concern about developments in Ukraine with you, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, following the elections, Ukraine took a long time to create a government. An unexpected coalition was achieved, but in the end it has been settled. The coalition is beginning to operate, but the issue of reforms and the issue of constitutional stability are still problems that should be of concern to us. Ukraine is an extremely important country for us, a large country from a physical point of view, a powerful country from an economic point of view, and also an important country from a strategic point of view. We must therefore attach the utmost importance to Ukraine. We must dedicate a proportion of our energies to it. I am trying to dedicate to this country the same energies I dedicate to resolving some of the frozen conflicts in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem to which we are paying most attention is the problem of Transdnistria. At the last Summit we reached an agreement with President Putin; I hope that that agreement will be revitalised at the next Summit, also in cooperation with the Russian Federation, which will take place in May, in order to see whether within a relatively short space of time we can give impetus to resolving the problem of Transdnistria. There is a new blueprint for doing so, there is greater involvement by the two parties, there is also greater involvement by the Ukrainian Government and I hope that we can achieve some successes in resolving these frozen conflicts in the eastern part of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The same can be said of Belarus. Chancellor Merkel spoke about Belarus yesterday with great skill and warmth. She also did so on the 50th Anniversary. I entirely agree with what she has said.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we cannot currently hold an exchange of opinions on foreign policy without talking about Africa, and essentially about two great problems that may have enormous humanitarian consequences. The first is the old, or at least getting old, problem of Darfur, to which we dedicated a good proportion of our time yesterday in Riyadh, because it is a problem with an African component, as I said previously, but also an Arab League component. The involvement of these two great unions, the African Union and the Arab League, in conjunction with the international community, is crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">We Europeans can feel, if not pride, because nobody can feel proud of what is happening there, then at least a degree of satisfaction at the fact that we have been committed to finding a solution to the Darfur question from the outset. We have worked hard towards the Abuja Agreements, we have funded the African Union force deployed on the ground as generously as possible, but, as you know, the situation is still extremely worrying.</p>
<p class="contents">We spoke again yesterday with President al-Bashir, President of Sudan, to look into the possibility of the United Nations taking over from the African Union security force in Darfur. A full agreement was not reached, but my hope, given that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Ban Ki-moon, was also in Riyadh yesterday, is that the decisions taken there may be decisions that move in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, for we Europeans, the issue of Darfur must be a number one concern from a humanitarian point of view, and not just from a humanitarian point of view, but also from the point of view of seeking a formula that leads to peace. This tackles the, shall we say, East-West problem of Darfur, but there is another fundamental problem that will be back on the table: the North-South problem.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the North-South problem, an agreement was reached, as you know, but we are still waiting for a referendum that may divide the country into two parts. If that is the final solution, we will be seeing the break-up of the big important country of Sudan, which has such crucial energy reserves, and it would be a great disaster for all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">Relations with China are fundamental in this regard, as are relations with India. Those two countries receive the majority, or at least a very significant proportion, of their oil supply from Sudan. The contribution of both countries to the stabilisation of Sudan is absolutely crucial and our foreign policy in relation to China and India must therefore be incorporated into all of our negotiations on this issue as well, an issue which is so important in terms of human rights and the stability of an important region of Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not sure how much more time I have, ladies and gentlemen, but I would like briefly to mention two issues: firstly, the crisis management structure that we are creating, in relation to which the Council is implementing one of the most modern structural operations for crisis management. We have already put it to the test to a certain extent in the case of Kinshasa, with the generosity of our German friends in charge of the operation, but we are trying to create a structure which includes all the elements of possible crisis management from the outset, both civilian and military. We must therefore create a body for planning operations which, as I have said, incorporates all factors, so that we do not find ourselves in the kind of situations that we have seen in other places in the past, situations in which the civilian aspect is out of sync with the military aspect, or the economic aspect with the social construction aspect. Everything must be properly thought out from the outset.</p>
<p class="contents">In a special sitting, if you wish, or in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, it would be useful to provide a more detailed explanation of something that is in the forefront of the European Union’s current thinking and which goes further than what certain Member States of the European Union, or third countries outside of the European Union, are trying to do in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, according to the title of this debate, you wished me to express my views on the issue of the missile defence system. I will be delighted to briefly express my views on this subject. No decision has yet been taken by the European Union. There will very probably be debates on this issue at forthcoming Councils, but I would like to sum up my views on three points that I believe to be very clear.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that the European Union is not a military alliance – as we are very well aware – but it does have a foreign policy and security policy and it can and must debate this issue. I would therefore be in favour of this issue being debated within the European Union. I believe that it should be debated.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is that, as I said before, the European Union is not a defensive alliance and it is certainly not the place to take a decision on this subject, since it is a strictly military alliance issue, but I believe that it would be a mistake for us not to confront and discuss these issues amongst us in the clearest and most open way possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the whole system can affect our relations with a third country, Russia. Fortunately, there was a good development between Russia and the United States yesterday. For the first time, President Bush and President Putin discussed this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The last thing I have to say is that, according to the Treaties in force, security issues still fall within the sovereignty of the countries, but in any event I believe it to be essential to make that right of sovereignty of the countries compatible with the European Union’s general interest in the field of security. I shall therefore recommend that we discuss the issue of the missile defence system not just here, but also, if necessary, within the Atlantic Alliance.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is what the majority of the European Union's political leaders want and I believe that that is what we should do.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall end here, ladies and gentlemen. The foreign and security policy programme for this year, 2007, will be extremely dense. The months between now and the summer will be extremely important, with just the four or five issues I have mentioned to you: immensely important. Furthermore, I believe that, if with the will of the Presidency and of the Chancellor we are able to give impetus also to the institutional issues, we must also make a significant effort to give the greatest possible support to the foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to end by saying that we will do everything we possibly can, in cooperation with the European Parliament, to ensure a good outcome to all of these important issues, which are undoubtedly increasingly affecting us. The European Union was founded fifty years ago as a project of peace and it must continue to be so. It was founded as a project of peace amongst us and henceforth it must be a project of peace not just amongst us, but throughout the world. We have values, we have resources, we have capacities, we have sufficiently high levels of wealth, and we must not therefore close our eyes to what is happening in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore have a fundamental obligation to be increasingly active and cohesive players in the international community, in this global world in which we live. If we are not able to do so, I believe that it would be a great failure for the European Union, something that none of us want to see; we all want success.</p>

The Commission agrees with the points made by the High Representative in the annual programme he has presented.</p>
<p class="contents">European citizens may sometimes be ambivalent about the EU. However, in a world of growing challenges to peace and security and where our values are under threat, individual Member States can do little alone. As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, the European Union has become a global player, with a population of half a billion across 27 countries, accounting for a quarter of world income, over a fifth of world trade and some 60% of global development assistance. We have the means to play our role in world affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The internal market has been the main source of our strength. It has also been the key factor for enlargement, the most successful peace and security initiative ever carried out in Europe, and for the European Neighbourhood Policy, which aims to bring both the eastern European and Mediterranean countries closer to us and our values.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to take on the new long-term challenges, in particular the fight against terror and arms proliferation, poverty and disease, organised crime and illegal migration, climate change and threats to our energy supply, we need a fully joined-up foreign policy – one which includes common foreign and security policy aspects, but also goes well beyond.</p>
<p class="contents">The point of departure must be increased coherence in the use of our instruments. As we said in the Commission’s Communication ‘Europe in the World’, the overall effectiveness and therefore the global influence of the EU depend on optimal use of all available leverage in support of external goals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is already doing this. Experience has shown that dealing with crises is not just a matter of sending soldiers and policemen. It is about rebuilding and strengthening institutions, improving governance, reinforcing human rights and democracy, and setting the conditions for economic life. These are long-term tasks, and they need to bring security together with humanitarian and development aid, trade, investment and all relevant external aspects of internal policies.</p>
<p class="contents">We are present in almost all the hot spots. We will remain a major player in Afghanistan, where we have spent more than a billion euros over the last five years; in the Middle East, where we are using the Temporary International Mechanism to support the Palestinians; and in Iraq, where we are preparing for a long-term engagement.</p>
<p class="contents">Institutionally, there are many recent examples of positive synergies: the EU’s contribution to the Aceh peace process is a mix of common foreign and security policy and Community instruments; the Border Assistance Missions in the Palestinian territories and in Moldova and Ukraine illustrate how Community assistance helps reinforce the impact of the CFSP and vice versa. In Kosovo and Afghanistan, the major ESDP operations under preparation will be supported by Community initiatives. We shall also help finance the future International Civilian Office in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, the biggest challenges for the common foreign and security policy are still before us. It is much easier to agree to set up mechanisms to address instability in the developing world and support effective multilateralism than to make common decisions which affect Member States’ vital bilateral relationships outside the European Union. The risk of splits is always present. We need to have faith in our own strength.</p>
<p class="contents">My conclusions are simple: the more consistent we are, and the clearer we speak with one voice, the stronger we shall be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The enlargements have been among the great successes of our foreign policy as they have encouraged the new countries to emerge from decades of totalitarianism.</p>
<p class="contents">We are very pleased about the pace of the negotiations with Croatia and we are confident that both Croatia and the European Union will be ready to enable Croatians to take part in the 2009 European elections.</p>
<p class="contents">After ten years of ethnic conflict in the Balkans, the European Union has a duty to contribute to peace and stability in that region. Our group supports the plan presented by Martti Ahtisaari, which is crucial to establishing a politically stable and economically viable Kosovo that also respects the rights of minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also make every possible effort to come to the aid of the democratic opposition in Belarus. I am particularly concerned about the intrigues engaged in by the armed forces in Minsk on Sunday and about the rough treatment meted out to Parliament’s Sakharov Prize laureate, Alexander Milinkevitch, as well as to his wife. That being said, Alexander knows that he can rely on our support.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must continue to fight on the human rights front. Our group is deeply concerned about the constant violation of human rights in North Korea and condemns the fact that there are more than 200 000 political prisoners there. North Korea is developing arms and aiming for nuclear supremacy at a time when its people are suffering from malnutrition. Above all, we must remain constantly vigilant.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have in the case of Darfur is veritable genocide. The Sudanese Government must disarm the militias and cooperate with the International Criminal Court and the international community. The European Union must also urgently come down in favour of putting considerable reinforcements in place.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, the crisis in Zimbabwe deserves to be given our full attention. The brutal treatment of the representatives of the Movement for Democratic Change is an affront to us all. If we do not respond, it is Zimbabwe as a whole that is in danger of sliding into chaos.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats argues in favour of a stronger Europe in a safer world. Nuclear proliferation is making our planet still more dangerous. We must continue our efforts to obtain a negotiated solution in connection with the Iranian nuclear programme. Iran will only become a full member of the international community if it complies fully with the resolutions of the Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The capture, last week, of 15 British sailors by the Iranian armed forces is an unacceptable and very worrying development. Everything must be done to free all the British sailors as quickly as possible. Finally, we must strengthen the partnership with the United States, take new steps towards achieving a transatlantic market and, above all, conclude the Doha Round at the World Trade Organisation. This round does need to come to an end, since it is a development round for the world’s poorest people, and I want us very quickly to find a solution where this round is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Solana, we have confidence in you, and we support you in your attempts to make much greater progress towards peace on the Palestine question. As you said this morning, this is very important to us.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of all Europeans, thank you for the action you are taking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We, too, want Croatia to be able to take part in the 2009 European elections, but the fundamental precondition for that – one on which I believe we are still in agreement this morning, having been so yesterday afternoon – is that the EU should be reformed in the way in which it has to be if there are to be any more accessions at all. What that means is that those who want Croatia to be able to accede in 2009 and thus take part in the European elections must tell Messrs Kaczyński and Klaus that they had better give way in the constitutional debate, or else it simply is not going to happen. I hope that is still how we see the situation this morning.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Many thanks, Mr Solana, our High Representative, for setting out so comprehensively the role played by the European Union in international politics. Speaking on behalf of our group, there are two points I should like to pick up on and assure you of our complete solidarity and support. First of all, you commented on the British soldiers who are currently in Iranian captivity, and I am grateful to you for your clear expression of solidarity. What I want to say – speaking on behalf of my group – to Iran is that the value of any and every verbal commitment to peacemaking, however delivered, can be measured by whether or not these soldiers are set free. Demonstrating your willingness to take part in constructive international policy dialogue will take no time at all.</p>
<p class="contents">You also pointed out that the EU is not a defence union, but an alliance that tries, in the first instance, to resolve international conflicts through dialogue. One foreign policy that we can devise for ourselves, one that gives us a sense of identity, is the one that sees the prioritisation of civil and diplomatic – as opposed to military – solutions as the ‘European model’. Your explicit commitment to it shows that your approach really is deserving of support, from my own group at any rate.</p>
<p class="contents">It also means, however, that, if there has to be dialogue, and if dialogue takes precedence over all else, there has to be dialogue with everyone, and that is why I was really pleased to hear you tell this House that we cannot reject the possibility of dialogue with the new government of national unity in Palestine, whose finance minister and foreign minister you mentioned by name, and with whom we have been carrying on talks for years. How, then, could we now declare ourselves unwilling to talk to them on the grounds that they belong to a government which includes representatives of Hamas? We are most obliged to you for being so forthright about this. Our group will be sending a delegation to Palestine, which will be talking to these partners in dialogue among others.</p>
<p class="contents">You made reference to a whole array of things. You reported on Riyadh, you talked about the Kosovo problem, about the situation in the Balkans, about Iran, Ukraine, and the Darfur crisis. You described a veritable plethora of disturbing developments with which we in the European Union have something to do. While listening to you attentively, Mr Solana, I asked myself: which of these problems will actually be solved by installing an anti-missile system in Poland and the Czech Republic? Not one of them!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">A whole lot of things, though, that cause problems have to do with the way in which we – by which I mean the Western world – can find it in ourselves to spend billions on anything except the removal of the causes of these conflicts, which are, as ever, poverty, hunger, epidemics, disease, and under-development. We have money for anything, and, according to what I read this morning, the American President is offering his Russian counterpart a dialogue; I think that is marvellous. That is something after our own heart, but, instead of talking about where they are each going to put their anti-missile systems, they should talk about the need not to have them put anywhere at all, for it is just as worthy of condemnation to put in place an anti-missile system that has little purpose as it is to fail to condemn and outlaw Russian cluster bombs.</p>
<p class="contents">Impressive though your description of your work was, Mr High Representative, the one thing that is clear to us is that any and every anti-missile system, no matter how it is set up, be it bilaterally, under the auspices of NATO, under the <span class="italic">aegis </span>of the European Union, or however else, has no effect other than to unleash a new spiral of competitive rearmament that costs money – the money that is lacking to resolve the conflicts that you have described.</p>

We congratulate you on that, High Representative. We admire your indefatigable energy and your diplomatic skills, and we hope that with a new government in Palestine, the European Union will indeed be able to help in setting this country firmly on the road to a lasting peace and to peaceful co-existence with Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">High Representative, you say that deeds are more important than words, and that we must determine our behaviour towards the new Palestinian Government in response to its actions, but I would urge you, rather, to take the initiative with this new government. It has a great need to establish a functioning administration on its territory. The temporary implementation mechanism is both costly and cumbersome and the commitment of the state of Israel to allowing that new government to work is far from clear. We need to take the initiative, for if we hesitate, we may lose the opportunity to secure a lasting peace and peaceful coexistence.</p>
<p class="contents">High Representative, you certainly do not lack courage. Your efforts in trying to secure peace in the Middle East and the development of democracy and the rule of law are undertaken in probably the most difficult circumstances. My group agrees with you that a political solution is best in our relations with Iran over the nuclear issue. We commend your efforts to restart negotiations with Mr Larijani. We view UN sanctions as being a last resort and we would urge you, in the contacts and the relationships that you are building, to use all of the Union’s efforts to release the British sailors and marines who are being held there. HMS Cornwall is based in my constituency. Many of the people involved are my constituents. We are very keen to see them released as soon as possible. Perhaps you can also turn your attention again to Libya, to see if we cannot get the Bulgarian nurses back to Bulgaria in time to vote in the European elections on 20 May.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">You spoke of Darfur. It has to be at the top of our agenda, not only for the security reasons you mentioned, but because our inability to prevent the first genocide of this century would send the wrong signal about Europe’s role and potential within the world. I urge you to work together with the United States and with other major nations to try to bring a solution there, in particular bringing in UN troops to establish security which the African Union is not capable of achieving.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome your renewed emphasis on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. If the United Kingdom and France renew their nuclear weapons, if the USA builds a missile shield, then the message we are sending to the Russians and others is that we are engaging in a new arms race. Quite apart from the fact that this ‘son of star wars’ might turn out to be a Maginot Line in the sky, we should not be engaging in this kind of diplomacy.</p>
<p class="contents">You say the European Union has no legal powers, but we must discuss the missile shield. However, unless you actually take the initiative and set the agenda, that agenda will be set for you by the actions of the individual Member States. We welcomed the initiative of Commissioner Rehn, when, in the face of growing difficulties with Turkey, he established sanctions by suspending negotiating chapters and brought the Member States around behind him. We would like to see you do that to ensure that we have a common response to the development of this missile shield.</p>
<p class="contents">High Representative, you are responsible for access to documents. We have talked a lot about the need for an agreement on access to documents in the second and third pillars. These documents are not within the purview of national parliaments, and the Solana/Brok accord gives us no solid legal basis. When our temporary committee on extraordinary rendition asked you last year for the minutes of the Committee of Legal Experts of the Member States, they were given a two page document. We later discovered that there is a fuller, six-page document, and I would simply ask you here today if, in the spirit of loyal cooperation set down in Article 10, you would clarify to this House – perhaps to the Conference of Presidents – whether the minutes received by the chairman of our temporary committee were indeed a full or just a partial record of the proceedings of that meeting. You will appreciate the importance of this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the reason for these tensions is not the missile defence shield programme itself. The problem lies in the fact that certain Member States have taken the Russian view on this issue. Russia is intentionally using false arguments.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that ten intercepting stations on Polish territory pose no threat to Russia's defences. Contrary to what has been suggested, consultations with Russia have been, and still are, taking place. By using these false arguments, Russia clearly only wants to cause divisions within the European Union. Paradoxically, locating components of the shield in Europe may only speed up the implementation of similar NATO plans in this field. This would prove to be an unintended, but very beneficial, outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Poland will be as open to these kinds of initiatives as it is today. That is why I am so surprised that the German SPD – former Chancellor Schröder’s party – is so keen to repeat the arguments used by President Putin on this issue. It would be more natural for the Social Democrats to listen to their European Union partners from Denmark, the Czech Republic, Great Britain and Poland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should bring pressure to bear not only on Iran but also on Libya, in order that all these people may be released. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I shall now switch to speaking French so that our colleague, Mr Solana might understand me easily.</p>
<p class="contents">We must say yes to nuclear disarmament. Everyone knows that any large country that has nuclear power for civilian purposes will also start wanting it with military aims in mind. The key to nuclear disarmament is the dismantling of civilian nuclear facilities, as, without the latter, the former will not happen. We have seen this in the case of Korea, and we are now seeing it in the cases of, for example, Iran, India and Pakistan.</p>
<p class="contents">In many countries the two are linked, and that has not always been appreciated. That, I assure you, that is the problem staring us in the face.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to Darfur, the European Union must take the initiative. I agree, and our group agrees, with our former colleague Chris Patten, who has written a very good article on the subject, and I agree with those intellectuals who have called on the European Union to take the initiative. The time for talk is over. We need to prevent the daily massacre of hundreds of people by the Sudanese forces. This has to be emphasised. The more time that we spend talking about the situation, the more deaths that occur. That is why I agree with Mr Watson that we must take the initiative at the United Nations. In order to prevent the killings and rapes that take place between the helicopters landing and taking off again, we must at the very least protect the refugee camps and establish a no-fly zone, as we did for the Kurds in Iraq. That is the very least we can and should do for Darfur. At the same time, a solution also needs to be found.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the terms in which we must speak to the Chinese, who accept all the massacres out of a desire for oil. Human lives are sold by the litre of oil. That is unacceptable to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn now to the anti-missile shield. On this issue, too, we must be clear. I do not know if this anti-missile shield is directed against Russia. I do not know whom it is directed against, but, if it is directed against Iran, that is completely ridiculous. Emphatically so. If the Iranians want to attack us today, how will they go about it? The answer is, through suicide bombings. What star wars-style anti-suicide-bombing shield are you going to invent, for heaven’s sake? It will definitely not work. It would cost billions, and to what purpose? None at all. The problem is that, once again, the Americans are unilaterally defining what is necessary for a part of Europe, and therein lies the political problem. Europeans, Poles, Czechs, French and Germans need to understand that, in seeking to bring about a multi-polar world, European political union is the key to, and the only option for achieving, our independence.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate is political because, in point of fact, the very existence of the European Union is at issue. I refer you to Article 16 of our Treaties. We need to consult each other on foreign policy in order to prevent unilateralism from being imposed in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Even a few weeks ago, there was reason to fear the worst, given the complete political deadlock over an occupation that had become intolerable for the Palestinian people and given the looming prospect of civil war. This appalling danger was averted, not – I am sorry to say – through the efforts of the international community, including the European Union. Instead, the embargo decided on by the Quartet only caused the victims further distress and stirred up the extremists.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is, we owe the unexpected gleam of hope to the authors of the prisoners’ document, in particular Marouane Barghouti, to – as you have said - the tireless efforts of President Mahmoud Abas, to the concerted action of all the Palestinian democratic forces and in addition – as you have also said – to the renewed diplomatic initiatives taken by the Arab countries. The outcome is there to be seen. The Mecca agreement has opened the way to setting up the government of national unity.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, an eminent representative of these democratic forces, who is now a minister in this government – Mr Bassam al Salhi, General Secretary of the Palestinian People’s Party – is right now doing us the honour of visiting the European Parliament. He is following our debates from the gallery, and I should like to greet him and, through him, the whole of this government of unity.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This government agreement was made on the basis of wide-ranging political commitments on the part of the government as a whole. These commitments, which reflect the conditions of the Quartet, unfortunately have no equivalents on the Israeli side.</p>
<p class="contents">In my - indeed, in our – opinion and, I think, in that of many of my fellow Members, it would be a serious mistake, Mr Solana, not to seize this opportunity to foster renewed hope. We therefore call on the European Union to resume giving direct aid to the Palestinian Authority, to recognise the new government of national unity and, from its position within the Quartet, to argue in favour of such recognition.</p>
<p class="contents">This request is at the heart of an appeal by Members of the European Parliament, the initial signatories to which represent a very broad political spectrum and in many cases assume sizeable responsibilities in relation to what is at stake in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">In the hope, Mr Solana, that, following the adoption of the Berlin Declaration, the 27 will be keen to give practical expression to their ambition to constitute a world player in the service of peace, I have the honour of straightaway forwarding to you the text of this appeal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Strong, negative reactions from within the Union, especially based on fear of Putin’s Russia, not only reinforce our own vulnerability, but create at the same time new political tensions between the Member States, the prospect of which, following the European Iraq crisis, should surely fill the High Representative, Mr Solana, with horror.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the facts that speak in favour of the rocket project? There is, first of all, the dogged determination on the part of the Islamic Republic of Iran to have at its disposal in the near future an arsenal of modern ballistic rockets with a range of up to 5 500 km. Add to this Teheran’s ambiguous nuclear effort, and the imminent threat, not least for Europe, is a real one.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, a powerful transatlantic message to Iran is certainly called for. A rocket defence system on our continent is legitimate preventive action against dangerous Persian projections of power. In fulfilling these national ambitions, Teheran is, in turn, highly dependent on Russian and Chinese technical expertise.</p>

<p class="contents">This success comes at a special time, as the President-in-Office of the European Union told us yesterday, when the Union is seeking to consolidate itself internally by means of the constitutional debate and also, as Mr Solana has told us, to project itself externally by means of a visible and effective policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the picture that Mr Solana has painted, I would like to make some comments and put a few questions with regard to the issues that he has raised.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that what he said about the government of national unity and the new situation in Palestine was very prudent, and that we should apply the evangelical maxim ‘you will know them by their fruits’ and not change the European Union’s attitude overnight, but remain open and attentive to what the new situation may bring.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond the issue of Kosovo and Serbia, Mr Solana, perhaps, in this debate on the prospects for the Common Foreign and Security Policy for the European Union, you could very briefly tell us a little about the European prospects of the Western Balkans. I know that we do not have too much time, but perhaps it would be good if you could say a little about this.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue of the missile defence system, you have welcomed the talks that took place yesterday between President Bush and President Putin, and rather in view of the Union's lack of competences, which you have mentioned in this debate, it would be good to know whether the European Union is going to hold the kind of consultation that has taken place between Russia and the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">If possible, I would also like you to tell us something about your view of the comments yesterday by the Kazakh minister, in the presence of the Community troika, to the effect that, if the West believes it can open up an energy corridor in the Caspian Sea without the agreement of Moscow and Tehran, it would involve huge complications.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President – and I shall end here – I would like to know when the guidelines for the negotiation of the association agreements with the Andean and Central American Communities are expected to be available, and whether the Council is going to invite Parliament to the next ministerial summit of the Rio Group, as it has done on other occasions, because no invitation has arrived yet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The negotiations between the United States and two EU Member States about the deployment of a rocket shield in Europe cause us great concern. We are not persuaded of the need for such a system; we do, in fact, fear that the plans will have a divisive effect, and could seriously undermine international efforts at stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The spread of weapons of mass destruction forms an increasing threat to international peace and security, and I am pleased with the general observations Mr Solana made in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has made non-proliferation one of its top priorities, and we realise that it is impossible to maintain the non-proliferation system unless we act in unison and multilaterally. Multilateral cooperation is not an option, it is a necessity, and it is particularly in that light that we are very concerned about Washington’s plans. Persevering with the development of a rocket defence system that is, rightly or wrongly, experienced as a provocation by other recognised nuclear powers is counter-productive. It could even lead to a new arms race.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, since the nuclear aspirations of countries such as North Korea and Iran are also cause of great concern to us, we support the EU’s and UN’s efforts, via dialogue, but also via political and economic sanctions, to thwart their plans. According to the Americans, the rocket shield offers protection against attacks from Iran. Does this not, however, undermine the credibility of the international community at the negotiating table? This does, after all, go against the intention to prevent Iran from developing a new nuclear arms arsenal.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, we are very unhappy about America's recent defence plans and the unilateral way in which they have gone about things, but we are also greatly concerned about the willingness of Poland and the Czech Republic to accept such a one-sided dialogue. Federal Chancellor Merkel was right to invite the two countries to discuss this within NATO. Whilst we support the German Presidency’s proposal, we should also like to ask Mr Solana to discuss this matter further with his colleagues in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Some believe that Member States are free to join forces with third countries bilaterally in the area of defence. The political effects of such a system, however, are not confined to Poland and the Czech Republic, and the deployment of such a rocket shield will adversely affect the security of the whole of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let there be no doubt that we realise this all too well.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, this debate, for which I should like to thank the High Representative and all the Members of this House, is a very interesting one, because it demonstrates, via the intervention of one or other party, how great is the risk of us being used as instruments by Washington on the one hand, or by Russia on the other. Take your pick.</p>
<p class="contents">Whichever way, we run the considerable risk of being played off against each other by these two superpowers. What matters now is to prevent this from happening. We must prevent ending up in another situation where we have to choose sides straight away, with no room for manoeuvre, and in which we sit back and watch another spiral develop which could culminate in yet another arms race. We are at a point where we could avoid this if we made sure that we did not let ourselves be used as pawns and see what is best for us all together and what is best for the world and for world peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Although not quite a pacifist, I do belong to a generation for whom words such as disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation were extremely important, and that also tried to act accordingly, so I should like to thank you, High Representative, for speaking freely on this subject; I wish you the best and would like to say that you can count on our support.</p>

<p class="contents">I think that you ought to be much more active in opposing the arguments or speculations that Russia has put forward on this issue. There is talk about a cold war, and pressure is being exerted on Poland and the Czech Republic. I think this is totally unacceptable; the European Union must adopt a clear position. Otherwise, such failed politicians as Schroeder who is, of course, in Putin’s pay, come out of the woodwork making statements that irritate the European public. I think that it is also unsatisfactory to leave this issue to be dealt with by NATO’s secretary general since, undoubtedly, the United States of America is really talking about the defence of Europe, and much less about the defence of the United States of America. The United States of America is talking about the defence of Europe! What Europe’s citizens therefore expect from you, Mr Solana, as the person responsible for carrying out Europe’s common foreign and security policy, is a clear position.

Mr Solana, I welcome what you had to say about the Middle East. If we try to negotiate with states such as Iran or the Arab League, we should do likewise with Hamas, which has at least been elected.</p>
<p class="contents">While nuclear disarmament, to which you refer, is a cause close to the heart of this House, where is there a united voice criticising the United Kingdom for its renewal of the Trident programme? Even though the governments of two countries – the USA and the United Kingdom – are set to be voted out of office in the near future, they still want to rearm and present new threats to the world. Speaking about Kosovo, you mentioned that you support Ahtisaari, but what form does that support take? Why is it that Europe is not bold enough to say what is now to be done? Why does it not break cover? Supervised independence is what is needed, and yet we avoid using the term as if it carried the plague. It is high time that Europe and its Parliament – which will be voting on the subject today – should at last say that there is no going back, that Kosovo will not be handed back to Serbia, that the <span class="italic">status quo </span>no longer works, and that we have to go down this difficult road instead of organising police missions and waiting for others to clarify where they stand.</p>
<p class="contents">What is needed is a new resolution by the UN Security Council, and the old Resolution 1244, which is still in force, must be thrown out. The ESDP Mission also needs its mandate. It is not enough to wait for others to clarify matters on this front, and so, while I welcome your speech, I would ask you to go on to say whether you endorse Mr Ahtisaari’s letter to the UN Security Council, in which he speaks of ‘supervised independence’ and the statement made by Mr Ban I Moon.

There are two aspects to the issue. Firstly, there is a clear willingness on the part of the government to accept the base despite the public’s misgivings: the latest polls suggest that 60% of those questioned were against the base and 25% in favour. The second point is the split along party lines, whereby the opposition on the left favours a referendum and opposes the base, while the right wing of the government is against the referendum and in favour of the base.</p>
<p class="contents">I mention this because I feel it is crucial for the EU to take a clear stance on this issue. Washing one’s hands of the matter on the grounds that it concerns bilateral relations between the Czech Republic or Poland and the United States is tantamount to sidestepping an issue that will very soon start to take on a Europe-wide dimension. The Union has to be capable of saying unpalatable things. We are told that negotiations with Russia are ongoing. Yet the current indications are that these negotiations serve only to conceal the fact that the global anti-missile defence system has already been built. Mr Solana also negotiated before the order was given to bomb Yugoslavia. There were negotiations before the intervention in Iraq, too. Experience has shown that negotiations are worthless when there is no willingness to compromise. We should not forget that in 1997 a Founding Act was signed between Russia and NATO refraining from the threat or use of force. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On a personal basis, I wish you well in any new career you may choose, Mr Solana, but I am pleased that the role of European Foreign Minister is no longer viable because of the rejection of the proposed European Constitution in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea has always been a non-starter. There can never be a common European foreign policy, because we all have different histories, international commitments, interests and allies. Take Britain, for example. We do not necessarily share with our European neighbours the same perspectives on the international crises we face today. As you will be well aware, Britain faces a very grave situation in Iran, which has illegally detained British troops. It would be ridiculous for an EU Foreign Minister to try to negotiate the release of members of Her Majesty’s Armed Forces. However, Britain is also now in an equally ridiculous position as a result of our membership of the European Union. If diplomatic efforts fail to obtain the release of the British troops, then Iran’s illegal actions may have to be met with sanctions. But Britain could not enact sanctions against Iran, even if it wanted to, because Britain no longer has control over its own trading rules. Trade policy is now under the control of the European Union.</p>

<p class="contents">For a start, what we are debating here is not ‘an’ anti-missile system, but two of them. One of them is the one belonging to the United States, a system on which USD 100 billion have already been spent, and of which the installations planned for Poland and the Czech Republic form part. The anti-missile system has cost nine billion this year so far; we have to ask ourselves what that means in terms of Europe’s security, something for which we, as elected representatives, are responsible, so the question that presents itself to my mind is whether this system is capable of protecting European countries, and, if so, whether it is actually capable of protecting all of them. What must not be allowed to happen is that Europe should be divided into two zones, with one less secure than the other; that is something we have to prevent.</p>
<p class="contents">A second question arises in connection with the NATO anti-missile defence system, which has, so far, got no further than a feasibility study. What is NATO – what is Europe? – going to do on the basis of that feasibility study? Without a doubt, it is NATO, rather than the European Union, that bears responsibility for this, but, if we want to carry on down this road, we have to give some thought to just how the European countries are supposed to operate within the NATO framework, for if, for example, we are to take, on that basis, decisions relating to development or industry, we have the choice of dealing with the USA as 27 countries within the NATO framework or together as the European Union. In the first instance, we will certainly not be partners to the United States; in the second, we will be, but only with junior status, albeit with a chance of being their partner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The establishment of a government of national unity is almost miraculous, but has obviously not occurred by chance, knowing certain members of it as well as we do.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many who have welcomed this political advance. The European Parliament too responded. Last week, the Committee on Foreign Affairs voted in favour of a draft opinion requesting that the economic sanctions against the Palestinian people be lifted. It also adopted the Rocard report on relations between Europe and the Arab world, which will be voted on at noon and which again advocates dialogue and openness.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, a letter signed by Members of the European Parliament and in favour of recognising the new government was forwarded to the Palestinian Minister for Culture, who was visiting Brussels. The signatories, who include Mr Borrell, former President of the European Parliament, are neither hotheads nor enemies of Israel. They are men and women with a great love of peace who know that gleams of hope are so rare that they must not be lost sight of.</p>
<p class="contents">Admittedly, Prime Minister Haniyeh’s inaugural speech did not stick to the letter of the conditions laid down by the Quartet, but it reflected their spirit. This opportunity needs to be seized. All roads lead to peace when the required will exists. It does not matter whether it be the ‘Road Map’ or the Beirut initiative that points the way.</p>
<p class="contents">You have just returned from Riyad, Mr Solana, and we thank you for what you have done. You know that, this time, the offer is a serious one and that we need to be able to seize this opportunity. It is necessary to convince Israel and the Americans, and we would ask you to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">It would not be right to employ selective measures in relation to the new Palestinian Government and so attempt to separate the wheat from the chaff and to isolate Hamas from Fatah. That would be again to threaten Palestinian unity, which is the guarantee against civil wars.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Solana, I would not hide from you the fact that, this last year, we have been disconcerted by European policy towards the Palestinian territories. We did not want that to happen. We did not want so much chaos, so much fruitless suffering and so much destruction. It was sometimes difficult to look at ourselves in the mirror in the morning. We want to be proud again of the European Union. Do, please, pass on that message to the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would be a mistake to think that the short-term interest of any Member State can diverge from, or endanger, the European Union’s common interest in energy security. We need a harmonised approach, effective coordination and the elaboration of decision-making mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">A major task is to establish and strengthen the partnerships necessary in order to diversify our energy sources. Not only do we need to strengthen our foreign policy towards the traditional regions, that is to say, the Near East and Eastern Europe, but equally towards the Caucasus, Central Asia, Africa and Latin America.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been talking about the Nabucco pipeline for years now. Since March it has been considered a priority project. It is high time to move at last into the phase of concrete planning and implementation. Every Member State has a major responsibility not to endanger this extremely important project with its unilateral action, since the venture serves the diversification of the European Union’s energy sources.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in Europe’s fundamental interest to develop or enhance the appropriate competencies for defending its territory and warding off potential threats. Yet, for the time being, it is not able or ready to do so. Until it is able and ready, the Member States have the right to act independently. This right cannot be denied to Poland or the Czech Republic either. Of course it would be better if we could find solutions jointly for warding off these serious threats.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally, the most important foundation of Europe’s foreign policy is solidarity. It is very important that all of us here have expressed our solidarity with the 15 British sailors and in relation to their immediate release, but this has to be expressed not only in words but also in deeds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whatever the fate of the Constitutional Treaty, Mr Solana, you are our Foreign Minister.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for your extensive presentation and in-depth analysis. We have to put all our efforts into making the EU’s genuine common foreign and security policy commensurate with the EU’s ambitions and importance as a global player, and its relevance from the point of view of the Union’s values as proclaimed in the Berlin Declaration for the 50th anniversary. In this context, developing and consolidating democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms should underpin our foreign policy. It should be a value-based foreign policy if it is to be truly European. Our parliamentary diplomacy contributes to that dimension. Our debates in Parliament should aim at possible consensus, rather than creating additional divisions, as has been shown in this debate. We should not merely pronounce our views on the issue; we have to act jointly and promptly when necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">At this particular time our thoughts should go to Belarus. We are bound to react to what happened last weekend: when we were celebrating the 50th anniversary of European integration, Belarusian democrats were being beaten and jailed on our doorstep.</p>
<p class="contents">The common foreign and security policy today is a multifaceted issue. It covers not only classical foreign and security aspects, including the question of nuclear arms, but also a very large range of non-conventional threats to democracy, peace and security on such topics as terrorism, poverty, energy security, climate change and so forth. But broadly, and without referring to all the points which you raised, High Representative – which would be impossible in the time permitted – we share and support the line which you have taken on all the burning issues of foreign policy around us in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The message that I would like to address to the Council and to you personally is the following one: Parliament wants to assert an influential role in CFSP; it is in the interests of the Union, not only Parliament. We do not seek new powers. Rather, we would like to build upon our past experiences and enhance our influence in the field of foreign policy in agreement and cooperation with you and the Commission by adding more legitimacy to it and by bringing it closer to European citizens, making it more understandable and more widely and democratically supported and based.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to do that in cooperation with the European institutions – the Council and Commission. As you know, we are developing close contacts with the Council with your support and with that of the Commission. We would like to use this opportunity to assure both our partners that smooth and effective relations are very important for us and that we should work together, build synergies, complement each other and help in this supremely important, difficult and most delicate area of the Union’s policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Very briefly, on anti-missile defence, as you said, we do not have the authority to take decisions on defence, but we have do have the authority to discuss defence. For that reason, the Committee on Foreign Affairs is proposing a debate on AMD and crisis management on 7 May, in your presence, with the chairs of all the foreign and defence committees of the national parliaments, and possibly Mr De Hoop Scheffer. On 28 June, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Security and Defence Subcommittee will be holding another meeting on the AMD system, this time with General Obering from the US. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is of course the case that Members of this House such as ourselves can think rather more flexibly and more freely, and so I would like to take up what was said by Mrs De Keyser. We represent democracy. The choice is between democracy or part of it. That is why what we did following the elections in Palestine – which we had called for – has to be considered in a very critical light. I absolutely agree with those who say that we have to demand of the Palestinian Government that they commit themselves to the peace process and be willing to renounce terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">We now stand a chance of getting just that sort of government. We are not demanding of Israel that it should permanently abandon all attempts at settlement; Israel, too, does not really recognise the 1967 border as the frontier between two states that recognise one another. It is because Israel does not do that – despite our demands that it should – that we must adopt a fair and even-handed approach, demanding from each side a contribution to peace and supporting both sides as they attempt to make it. That is why the European Union must make it quite plain that it is in this direction that it is going. No matter how disagreeable we may find some of its representatives – and I have to say that I am not exactly a fan of the Israelis’ Mr Liebermann – this government affords us an opportunity that we must not let slip from our grasp, so it is not least in the interests of Europe that we have to seize this opportunity for peacemaking, however much we may dislike certain individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, since I am on the subject of democracy, we all have serious difficulties with having to work together, in the interests of peace, with countries that are not organised on a democratic basis. Saudi Arabia is one that has been mentioned today, and I hope that it manages to make a considerable contribution towards peace. I would say the same about Egypt. We must not, however, take this as a reason for abandoning our campaign for democracy; we must, for example, make it quite plain to Egypt that we find it unacceptable that – as has happened over recent days – the constitution should be amended by means of a so-called referendum called at only a few days’ notice, and with, in any case, a turnout of only 30%. We have to speak up for both peace and democracy in the Middle East; we have to hold the two together. That is Europe’s task. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This area of intergovernmental cooperation limits the authority of all EU actors. At present, attitudes towards the US missile shield are a very important factor, which impacts on the future of the EU and European countries. Is the EU’s answer unanimous or is it that when Secretary of State Rice calls Europe she gets several answers? This is how the EU allows the United States of America to decide what is good for the EU and its Member States. It would not even help us here if there were a new constitution in effect and the EU had one common foreign affairs minister, because unless there is a common will, there is no common policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to bring up the other issue, the question of illegal immigration and immigration policy. Recently there have been expectations of closer cooperation in the EU in order to prevent the entry of illegal immigrants at border control points. It is hardly any wonder that last summer close to the Canary Islands more people, illegal immigrants, died in the Atlantic Ocean than there were victims of war in Lebanon. Much, therefore, needs to be done in the areas of neighbourhood policy for the welfare and security which the EU provides to grow and prevail.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Iran remains a serious problem as it defies the international community in its determination to acquire nuclear weapons, and will openly dissemble on this issue, as it has done recently over its claim of the exact position of the whereabouts of the British servicemen when they were captured.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it not now high time that the EU, with the USA, applied serious economic sanctions against this brutal regime, which publicly executes people for sexual misdemeanours and whose President Ahmadinejad has vowed to wipe Israel off the face of the earth?

<p class="contents">These plans are aimed at weakening Europe’s external and defence policy. Even if they were brought together under the NATO umbrella – as they have yet to be – that would have a detrimental impact on the defence industry in the EU. How then can the Council discard a harmonised approach to the issue between all the Member States? How can it accept plans purporting to protect Europe that are based on dubious technology and that divide the EU by excluding some Member States. What threat is more threatening to Poland and the Czech Republic than to Greece, Cyprus, Spain or Portugal?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Solana, as you pointed out today, we in the EU want to combat proliferation, but these plans – quite apart from other ramifications in relation to Russia – will only serve to encourage it. Consequently, many in the United States, in the US Congress, also reject the plans. They are the people with whom we need to work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I listened with interest to Mr Solana’s detailed speech, for which I thank him. It was a strong, interesting theme. I should like, if I may, to make a few comments.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, Mr Solana emphasised that, as regards Kosovo, the EU cannot afford to fail in its own neighbourhood. I strongly agree and would put it like this: the EU must first show that it is able to solve problems in its close neighbourhood and that it is able to contribute towards the stability and prosperity of the surrounding region, and accordingly to show in practice that it is capable of achieving broader, global ambitions, failing which we are left with just empty words.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as regards the US anti-missile bases, or in the case of the Czech Republic radar bases, the Czech Government yesterday agreed officially to launch negotiations with the USA on the construction of the radar base as a defence system. The Czech Government will of course willingly inform its colleagues and partners in the EU on progress in this matter but there can be no doubt that the ultimate decision lies with the Czech Government.</p>
<p class="contents">I firmly believe that when the base is operational, there will be greater security not only for Central Europe but also for Europe as a whole. We all know that this base is not targeted against Russia, and Russia is well aware of this too. That argument is therefore a red herring. I take the view that implementing this measure will also help strengthen transatlantic ties.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally it will also lead to raising the Czech Republic’s and Poland’s international profile. I trust this is not something that would worry anyone. I should like to remind the House that the EU has its boundaries in terms of security and politics, and that it has in this instance run up against one of these boundaries. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I strongly agree; the people of Europe, including those from the new Member States, expect the EU to coordinate its foreign and security policy, even on issues such as deploying a US anti-missile defence system on EU territory. This system is not, however, a bilateral exercise between the USA and Poland or the Czech Republic, as some MEPs would have us believe. By its very nature, it concerns common foreign and security policy, relations within the EU, the EU’s relations with the USA, NATO and Russia, and various disarmament processes and processes for stopping the spread of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to call on Mr Solana to provide Parliament with an analysis of all of these aspects and of ways of resolving these issues from the standpoint of the common foreign and security policy.

However, it is apparent once again from our debate that the European Union lacks a foreign policy and therefore lacks a common security and defence policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to express my complete solidarity with the United Kingdom over the issue of the sailors detained in Iran, a solidarity that must also be expressed in other countries. I would point out, however, that if we had a common foreign and defence policy we would without doubt have far greater influence in resolving international issues. The absence of a common foreign policy also means that in certain States – my own included – because of individual positions, even affairs of domestic politics take on a rather serious significance. If we continue down the road of the constitutional treaty, begun by Chancellor Merkel, I believe we will be doing a very positive thing.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out a fundamental issue to Mr Solana. Several times this morning mention has been made of the question of the possible US missile defence system, to be located on the territory of the Republic of Poland and of the Czech Republic. It would appear to me – I do not know whether it is true, however – that among other things certain States of the Union will probably not be taken into consideration in respect of such a missile defence system, for example Italy and Greece. I have heard differing positions on this matter, and rightly so.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I personally am in favour of this system, I believe, Mr Solana, that it is important to obtain real information, including that which you have chosen to withhold. I therefore invite you to provide our subcommittee with all possible information without delay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Number two: multilateralism is a key endeavour and we should not fail in this endeavour.</p>
<p class="contents">Number three: the many frozen crises in our eastern neighbourhood are only part of a single coherent problem which is the post-Soviet status of Russia. We must at last build a vision in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Number four: the European Union is not a defensive alliance, but we must create the political environment which could engage Russia and the United States in promoting a global partnership for defence against the contemporary threats, thus rejecting any bilateral anti-missile arrangements which will divide us and expose us more than defend us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me give you just a couple of examples: there is the Middle East, there is Kosovo, there is Iran, there is the energy security issue and a number of others. We must now, however, consider how things are to move forward. For a start, we will, in many of these areas, achieve nothing as the soft power that we claim to be if we do not, on foreign policy matters, speak with a firm and single voice to the end that we influence our partners around the world, and I am thinking here particularly of the trans-Atlantic relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we will get nowhere if we treat the European Union as being made up of zones with different degrees of security. On the energy security front, we have to make sure that every country enjoys the same level of protection, but it is no less intolerable that any one part of the European Union be less protected by an anti-missile shield.</p>
<p class="contents">To put it another way, issues such as these cannot be discussed on a bilateral basis; on the contrary, it must be made clear that its Constitution endows the European Union with enhanced capacities and enables it to speak with one voice, and, speaking with that one voice, we must in turn be prepared to guide NATO towards strategic debates. Not by separate solutions, but only by these two in tandem, will we gain influence. I sometimes get the impression that there are those who – and rightly – demand solidarity for themselves in energy matters, but those who do that must also be forthcoming with the same solidarity in other areas if we are thereby to arrive at a common European position. That is the only way in which we have a chance of survival in this world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would cover part of the European Union if defensive missiles and radars were to be installed in the Czech Republic and Poland. All this is expected to cost 58 billion dollars. This amount of money, used differently, could help millions of starving people and change the very nature of countries proclaiming unpredictable dangers.</p>
<p class="contents">The governments and people of European countries have more than a few misgivings about such plans, which could lead to a new arms race and to dangers for the whole region. Lithuania is in this region; however, there has not been much public debate concerning this topic in the new Member States. Washington's plans should be openly and frankly discussed by NATO and EU countries, and Russia should be included in the discussions as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Unilateral policies without regard to possible dangers and consequences have more than once created situations that were difficult to wade out of. For example, the ‘Star Wars’ projects were a product of the Cold War era.

<p class="contents">First of all, a few years ago the Americans transformed the original <span class="italic">National Missile Defence</span> project into the <span class="italic">Missile Defence</span> project. The aim was to place not only the territory of the United States, but also that of the European Union and NATO member states, under this protective shield (or umbrella). It was done at the clear request of Western European countries, including Germany. Where, then, is this wave of criticism coming from?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we Europeans have, for some years, been building our own European shield, namely the <span class="italic">Theater Ballistic Missile Defence </span>programme (TBMD)<span class="italic">.</span> If you have any doubts concerning this matter, I would like to refer you to the declaration of the last NATO summit in Riga. It is supposed to be ready by 2010 and somehow neither Mr Schulz nor Mr Cohn-Bendit seem to be protesting against it.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Russian objections to the shield are simply another example of the criticism levelled by that country at various American strategic initiatives. Let us remember the wave of criticism levelled at the SDI during the Reagan administration or at the Americans when they withdrew from the ABM Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I ardently support talks with Russia on the subject of the missile defence shield, but I would urge us to remain calm.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, I am also in favour of debates on the issue in the European Parliament, but we must remember that decisions will rest with the sovereign governments of European states. I would like to ask the Left wing parties and the Greens not to use arguments in this discussion that are not true and not to mislead public opinion. Such an approach may have regrettable consequences. It could lead to deeper divisions within the European Union and to an upsurge of anti-American feeling similar to what we saw in 2002 and 2003. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, it could lead to an escalation of existing conflicts throughout the world. We must not start a new arms race: the missile shield is there to protect the United States, first and foremost.</p>
<p class="contents">If anyone were to ask me whether we should defend peace and defend the USA from terrorists, for example, my response would be yes. But the missile defence shield raises many questions. We cannot allow new divisions to be created in Europe and we must search for a peaceful compromise, rather than conflict, with Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">I have addressed the Polish Government on this issue on numerous occasions proposing a public debate on the issue in Poland and in Europe. However, the current right-wing Polish Government is sticking to its anti-European and less than constructive guns, as it did with the Constitutional Treaty. In spite of the fact that the European Union is not a defence alliance, it should be publicly clarified whether the issue of the missile defence system should be subject to joint political decisions made by the EU and NATO. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A missile defence system is all about threat assessment and priorities. The threat is here. We have to protect and strengthen Europe. South-western Europe needs protection against terrorism. South-eastern Europe needs active layered-theatre ballistic missile defence. Within NATO, we have to build national missile defence systems, but we have to accommodate the third pillar. As for Northern Europe, the Czech Republic, Poland and the US East Coast, we can achieve complex missile defence architecture through sharing data and information in NATO command and control. You know it. It is doable. Sharing information costs less than EUR 1 billion. To do it, we need bilateral consultations and NATO consultations, but sovereign state decisions. Most of all we need responsibility: my responsibility and your responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been a long debate with many speeches. Not everybody was here for the whole debate, but I think that a lot of important things have been said. I should also like to express my thanks for the constructive attitude of the majority of the Members of this Parliament. I would like to state once again my willingness to continue discussing the important issues that strategically we have started discussing this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall be brief in my summing-up, as I know that you have an important vote at 11.30.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to condemn in a very clear manner the abduction by Iran of the British sailors, and we must demand that they be freed immediately. I think we are in total agreement after today’s debate and we have made it loud and clear. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention the issue of the Middle East, because I think it is going to be one of the most important issues between now and September. I think something may happen during this period of time if there is goodwill, good cooperation with the United States, good cooperation with the Arab countries, and good cooperation amongst ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">A new situation has been created. A few hours ago I was having dinner in Riyadh: I have only just arrived here. I would have liked to have seen some of you there so that you could see the political foreign policy of the European Union in action. Believe me, when we are there, when we are at those meetings, we count and we count seriously. Please believe that. If I could, I would invite you to accompany me.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">A few hours ago I was still there debating very important topics which are going to be in the newspapers tomorrow. I hope the results of the negotiations will come to fruition over the coming days.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to bring up once again in this House the issue of Lebanon. We have a serious responsibility towards Lebanon. It has not been mentioned sufficiently. I would like to repeat once again that for us the Government of Prime Minister Siniora is the legal government of Lebanon and we have to continue helping that government.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I think the cooperation that we are giving Lebanon through the presence of the European UNIFIL forces in the southern part of that country, and the conference that took place in Paris not long ago to help in the reconstruction of Lebanon, is proof of our commitment to that country. It is fundamental. It is also fundamental to keep supporting the government in Lebanon: a government that can produce results, not a blocked government, which is what some people want.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to set up an international tribunal to deal with the assassinations of Lebanonese leaders, starting with Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, who was killed three years ago. We have to achieve a negotiated solution. We are going to do our utmost to achieve that. At those negotiations there will be representatives from the five Permanent Members of the Security Council plus somebody from the European Union representing all of you – the whole European Union. Never before in our recent history has something like that taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have responsibilities in Africa. Those responsibilities will be fundamental between now and the summer. So until then we have an agenda which is very intense, very dense. If the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs so wishes, I will be very happy to continue following up this agenda here in this House.It is an intense agenda. It is fundamental for stability and peace, not only in the world, but also in the neighbourhood of our continent.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you once again, Mr President. This is the first time I have contributed to a debate in this House which has been chaired by you. You can count on me to support this institution which I greatly respect, whenever necessary. Somebody said I was looking for a job but I am not, but in any case maybe you will invite me to come here more often!</p>

<p class="contents">This initiative needs to be viewed in the context of the change in NATO’s strategic concept, its enlargement to the borders of the Russian Federation and the increasingly aggressive imperialism, as evidenced by intervention in Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Iraq and the Middle East, along with fresh threats to other sovereign states. It is an approach that, despite existing differences within the EU, will exacerbate the continent’s political divisions.</p>

As someone who has been looking at the identical issue vis-à-vis Japan’s deployment of Theatre Missile Defence to ‘defend’ against the supposed threat from North Korea, I can only say we are being misled by the word ‘defence’. These deployments in Japan and Europe are intended to give the US the ability to launch a pre-emptive strike against either North Korea or Iran. They cannot work against any large-scale attack from China or Russia – not that I am suggesting there is any likelihood of that happening – but to defend against any odd remaining missile and warhead after a pre-emptive attack against a country with a limited number of missiles and warheads. The deployment of such technology in Europe will make Europe a more dangerous – rather than safer – place, in the interests of neo-con US Foreign Policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The representative of the EU's foreign policy reiterated its intention to strengthen its imperialist role throughout the world. It is strengthening its militarisation by organising its military structures and its rapid intervention forces. Within this framework, it is promoting the creation of an 'independent' protectorate in Kosovo and preparing to strengthen the European occupation by sending a force of 1 500 men. It continues to tighten the economic noose around the neck of the Palestinian people. It is planning a new wave of imperialist interventions in Belarus and Ukraine. It is strengthening its interventionist policy in Africa, so that it is better placed to plunder its wealth-creating resources and to deal with increased trade with China and India, especially in the energy sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to deal with grassroots reactions to the installation of anti-missile defence systems in the USA, the Czech Republic and Poland, it is trying to manoeuvre by referring the matter to the Member States, while leaving open the possibility of the decision on the installation to be taken within the framework of ΝΑΤΟ, behind the peoples' backs.</p>
