<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Arlene McCarthy (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the coordinators of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for supporting my work as chairwoman in bringing forward the first detailed piece of work the committee has undertaken on transposition and implementation of internal market legislation, in this case to examine the effectiveness of public procurement law.</p>
<p class="contents">The report is a culmination of months of extensive research and informal consultation with Member States, public procurement practitioners and specialists, and staff in the Commission. It has been greatly assisted by the Internal Market Committee’s secretarial staff, to whom I also express my thanks.</p>
<p class="contents">We held a workshop to look at best practice, putting the spotlight on public procurement and demonstrating Parliament’s commitment to better regulation while improving businesses’ experience of EU law and demonstrating the benefits for the citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">Why did we decide to look at public procurement legislation? A series of negative press articles from 2003 to 2006 seemed to suggest that the internal market was failing because of a lack of regard for EU procurement rules, in particular the rules on non-discrimination on grounds of nationality. Concerns were also expressed that the number of illegal direct awards was rising. The public procurement market, estimated to be around 16% of the EU’s GDP and worth some EUR 1.7 trillion, is clearly of enormous economic significance for growth and job creation across the EU. An increasing amount of public procurement is carried out by our local authorities offering potential for more jobs at local level, in particular for SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">Our analysis led us to the view that there are, indeed, a number of problems with the correct application of EU public procurement law, including cases of cross-border discrimination. A significant number of Commission infringement cases deal with matters of public procurement, and we could have drawn up a report naming and shaming bad practices or naming the Member States, five of which have still, in 2007, not implemented the Public Procurement Directives. To have done so would have guaranteed us media headlines.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we believe that, on balance, the opening of the public procurement market across the EU is contributing positively to the health of the internal market and helping the EU to meet the Lisbon goals. Therefore, we chose instead to focus in a constructive way on actions that would improve the record of Member States in tackling persistent – and, indeed, emerging – transposition and implementation problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The report therefore recommends that the Commission propose an action plan strongly encouraging Member States to tackle the problems. We ask for collaborative practices between Member States and the Commission, including informal information sharing at an early stage. We stress the role of informal dispute settlement, alongside formal remedies. We are asking the Commission to publish guidelines on the application of social criteria, once its study in this area is complete, and we want to see more exchange of best practice in public procurement with, for example, systematic training of procurement professionals and coordination of the work of European networks for the exchange of best practice. We are recommending adoption of all optional elements of the new directive, such as e-auctions, and we want to see set up national advisory agencies to assist contracting authorities as well as tenderers.</p>
<p class="contents">We recognise that the Commission needs sufficient human resources in this area to deal with the problems, and we are also calling for better data collection in public procurement, which we know is a very difficult area because of the sheer volume involved and the varying national accounting systems. We want political commitment from the Member States, in particular, to accelerate the correct transposition and implementation of this legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">A current hot issue is in-house service provision and the applicability of the public procurement rules to public-public partnerships. The committee decided there is not currently sufficient ECJ case-law following the Teckal case to provide legal clarity on what public authorities should do. However, we urge the Commission to continue its work in this area to resolve the issues and get legal clarity. I remind colleagues that we recently adopted Mrs Weiler’s report, which makes very good recommendations on public-public partnerships.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is a clear relationship between this report and the future of the single market. Indeed, the Commission is expected to report back on future policy in the autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank all colleagues for their input into this debate and all those who have contributed at our workshop and in many other ways. I look forward to strong support from the Commission for what I believe is a positive and a practical report to improve this important sector of the internal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This autumn, we hope to bring forward our ideas on what should be the focus of single market policy in the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">One major element of our analysis concerns the question of how better to ensure that Community law is correctly applied on the ground. I welcome the fact that you are devoting a report to this issue, which is specifically focused on public procurement, and I commend your rapporteur Mrs McCarthy on the initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">As a key recommendation, the report suggests setting up national advisory bodies to assist contracting authorities as well as tenderers. Such a contact point at national level could play an important role in securing the correct application of public procurement rules. Bringing public procurement advice closer to the numerous contracting authorities and individual tenderers, via a national body, is good idea. The Commission is ready to cooperate with such national contact points and to respond to any inquiry they might have.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States should take up the suggestions in the report and, for example, set up such a national advisory body. Some Member States are currently in the process of setting up contact points, or internal market centres, which could assist firms and citizens in the context of SOLVIT, the free movement of goods, or the Services Directive. I welcome such initiatives and hope that such national bodies will extend their activity to all internal market sectors, including public procurement.</p>
<p class="contents">We also wish to assure you that the Commission is deploying all available means to secure the implementation of 2004 procurement directives as quickly as possible in those Member States which are still lagging behind. I regret that our efforts to give all possible advice and assistance could not prevent the fact that we had to take legal action against a number of Member States for failure to complete their transposition process. However, we cannot afford to lose time in establishing a level playing field among tenderers across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, let me underline that we need Member States’ commitment to the cause of public procurement if we want to achieve progress in correct transposition and implementation. Public procurement cases still represent far too big a share of infringement cases brought against Member States. This is to the detriment of fair competition between tenderers. It is also to the detriment of public finances, and thus taxpayers. Your report highlights the need for improvement, and I thank the House for your support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Lately, I have noticed a tendency in the European Parliament that I, as a European, find worrying: a weakened respect for the ECJ rulings. The ECJ takes no national considerations into account its judgments: it takes the interests of the Union and its citizens into account. Furthermore, it is one of the bases of the Treaty that the case-law of the ECJ is applicable in every Member State. Our role in the European Parliament is mainly legislative. In fulfilling our task it is crucial for us to use the European approach of the ECJ as our loadstone, rather than seeing the ECJ as an enemy – a view that is not so rare nowadays, unfortunately.</p>
<p class="contents">The legislation on public procurement is still suffering from quite a few teething problems. Many of the problems are caused by the lack of, or difficulties with, national implementation. It must always be our goal, and the goal of the Member States, to make the legislation as understandable and adaptable to real needs as possible. SMEs should be able to participate in the cross-border market in reality, not only in theory.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make the framework for the public-private partnerships work and create legal certainty for companies as well as for public authorities, and check that all act according to EU legislation without imposing unnecessary red tape. It is our task to make sure that local and national interests will not overrun our European goal, which is, and should be, the best result for all European citizens and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall finish by expressing confidence in the Commission and in our future good cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have a certain amount of professional practical experience in this field and I must point out that public procurement is the yardstick in the fight against corruption. The transparency and the level of good governance of public administrations are measured according to the level of functioning of legal rules and of their application by the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the Commission on the work that it has done on the application of these legal rules, and acknowledge the Court of Justice's correct application of them. As the rapporteur has pointed out, we cannot accept the current situation, since there are many European Union regulations that have yet to be incorporated into national laws and there are unfortunately still many public administrations within the European Union that are not correctly applying the Community legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is the time – as the rapporteur recommends – for the Commission to produce a great action plan aimed, on the one hand, at compliance with Community legislation and its improvement and, through cooperation with the States, which are responsible for the application of this legislation, at achieving effective application at all levels of administration, because, although some countries may not have corruption, I would say that it is the greatest danger both to the functioning of administrations and to the functioning of our democracy.</p>

I, too, believe that there is a pressing need for us to ensure that the Directives are transposed in practice. If legislation is deficient, legal uncertainty and distortions of competition can result. This is something we should prevent.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, this report reveals that, to date, only 20 of the 27 Member States have transposed the new Directives – despite the fact that the deadline passed on 31 January 2006. The reasons most frequently quoted for unsatisfactory transposition are the lack of legal expertise, human resources and political will in the Member States. These are what we must address, therefore, and I think that the proposals Mrs McCarthy makes are excellent. The committee suggests a Commission action plan to encourage Member States to tackle existing and emerging transposition and implementation problems in public procurement.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, it is also important, however, that the committee has reaffirmed that there is best practice in certain fields that should be exchanged. Member States should actively exchange knowledge and best practice with each other on transposition in the field of public procurement and improve cooperation with the Commission in this area. The committee strongly encourages Member States to coordinate and simplify electronic purchasing techniques and to facilitate access to such procurements. It welcomes the Commission’s handbook on the application of environmental criteria and calls for the publication of guidelines on the application of social criteria. That, too, would help prevent legal uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a further field that must be mentioned when it comes to legal uncertainty, and that is the unresolved problem of public cooperation – known as ‘inter-municipal cooperation’ in Germany. Under this, local authorities – and it is really only local authorities – jointly provide facilities such as kindergartens, water supply, waste-water disposal and waste. They engage in this joint cooperation as a means of controlling the population decline in rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I am now of the opinion that this kind of inter-municipal cooperation has no place in public procurement, and I would expect some clarification from the Commission in this regard once and for all. Hence, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will be withdrawing Amendment 12 and not putting it to the vote tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is precisely the matter with which the European Union properly should concern itself, that is to say the matter of ensuring – as we should do in every case – that we obtain liberal economic solutions in those areas in which we have chosen the market. The focus of the report is therefore perfectly correct.</p>
<p class="contents">It is incredibly important both that the EU and the Commission ensure that the systems of rules are followed and that it is absolutely prohibited to endeavour to favour domestic suppliers at the expense of foreign ones. This is in the interests of people both as consumers and citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">What kind of Eurosceptic would I be, however, if I did not have a few objections? I have two:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I believe it is wrong now to start demanding that more staff with monitoring responsibilities be appointed at the Commission. In the Committee on Budgetary Control, of which I am the first Vice-Chairman, we adopt quite the opposite approach, for what is important is that we demand of the Member States and of leading politicians, including finance ministers and prime ministers, that they be able to guarantee that they really are complying with the rules to which countries are subject when they belong to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must also remember that countries are entitled to opt for other solutions. If a country does not want to deregulate and wishes to have a state-owned post office or some other institution under government control, it is perfectly entitled to adopt that position and so has no need to demand procurement on the terms in question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is agreement right across the political divide that the direction and content of the report are correct, something also demonstrated by the fact that the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection voted clearly in favour of it.</p>
<p class="contents">As a rule, it should be noted that there are differences in consistency in the transposition of public procurement law across the EU by the individual Member States, and that therefore the Commission’s repeated assertion that there are problems with public procurement law in certain Member States is untenable as such on the basis of basic macroeconomic criteria. What is vital, however, is that we improve data collection on the problems surrounding public procurement law in the Member States. Consequently, I am delighted that the report addresses this point and calls on the Commission to expand the data resource on the basis of which the national systems of public procurement law are assessed.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to discuss a few amendments. We reject most of the amendments tabled. I welcome Mrs Rühle’s announcement that Amendment 12 is to be withdrawn. We do not disagree with all the amendments tabled by Mr Lipietz or the Committee on Legal Affairs, but they would weaken the report, which forms a very rounded whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The timely and correct transposition and implementation of public procurement legislation would significantly contribute to meeting the objectives of the EU’s ‘better lawmaking’ programme and to improving the implementation of the Directive in the internal market by means of better, more consistent transposition.</p>
<p class="contents">We would ask the Commission and, in particular, the Council, to put pressure on the Member States to devote more capacity to raising the level of procurement professionalism and sharing best practice to ensure uniform application of these rules in all areas of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the amendment tabled by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I should like to add that, whilst the local authorities presumably welcome the fact that they are to enjoy cooperation free of red tape, ultimately, the case law of the European Court of Justice does not provide any genuinely clear guidelines regarding the opportunities for inter-municipal cooperation or public–public partnerships either in Spain or Traxa. Consequently, the Commission is called upon to look at what further steps are necessary in this field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am particularly grateful because I see this report as following on from the report on public–private partnerships – an approach that is very appropriate and also helpful.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the rapporteur makes excellent proposals, which, in principle, bring us closer to the realisation of the internal market. However, the criticism she mentions deserves consideration by us all, including the public.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the main reasons are ‘lack of national legal expertise or human resources and the lack of political will in the Member States’ is indeed an indictment. We expect proper behaviour from our neighbouring countries, from Asia and Africa, yet we are not meeting our own objectives. I do not want to limit my speech here to accusations, but all the judicial proceedings taking place in this connection are annoying, unnecessary and expensive. That is why it is important that we take action in this field and also support the Commission’s activities.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to reiterate that it is good that environmental and social criteria are being publicised more widely. It is very surprising that, in Member States, it is SMEs, in particular – the upholders of our economic innovative capacity – who are for the most part unaware of the possibilities, and that the public in our Member States mostly think they need concern themselves with only the cheapest tenderers and not be guided by other criteria.</p>

All I would say is that, when I say to Mr Booth that this public procurement regime should represent the biggest possible advantages for small businesses across Europe, I am sure we can find a hat maker to provide him with a hat that he will eat in due course!</p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank Mrs McCarthy not just for this report but for setting out a clear course for our committee in leading the scrutiny of these public procurement directives and raising them in political prominence. After all, the whole public procurement regime was really the first fully worked-through piece of internal market legislation dating back to the 1950s and yet, in many cases, I wonder whether enough businesses see this as a real opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">The prime suggestion here is that Member States really need to get their act together in improving their professionalism in dealing with procurement, opening up opportunities that will not just encourage economic growth across Europe but also deliver better quality services to their citizens by reducing costs and improving quality. We know that, where that has happened, clear benefits are being delivered, and those small businesses need to be catered for in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">My closing point, in thanking Mrs McCarthy for accepting one of my own amendments, is to say that public authorities, with the huge amounts they are buying, also have a real responsibility to be encouraging innovation in products and services. Within the remit of the existing directives, they can set up pre-procurement arrangements or pre-competitive arrangements to pull through into the marketplace innovative solutions that will deliver real benefits to citizens. That is the next development that we need to get to grips with and I know that is something that Mrs McCarthy and the committee – and I speak as the coordinator for my group – will work together on, in order to continue to deliver real benefits for the European economy and all our citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Care should be taken, however, that procuring entities do not apply these criteria in a way discriminating against firms from other Member States. I agree with the rapporteur that setting up national advisory agencies would help contracting agencies to apply public procurement rules properly and to assist tenderers, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, in bidding for public orders.</p>
<p class="contents">A highly professional and depoliticised administration is key to the successful implementation of European legislation. Only professional officials with ample experience in civil service or local government work, as well as regular training, would be able to respond appropriately to the new challenges posed by European legislation. The new post-communist Member States in particular seem to have invented a national sport, whereby a new government after taking office seeks to replace virtually all civil servants in positions which should be filled on the merit of professionalism.</p>
<p class="contents">Based on my many years of experience in civil service and local government positions, and drawing on my track record in public procurement, I am convinced that only a professional and credible administration will be able to transpose EU legislation into national law in a responsible manner. It is important that Member States should not impose responsibilities on individuals and legal entities above and beyond the transposed rules, and, in particular, should not impose an unnecessary administrative burden on small and medium-sized enterprises. I believe that an active exchange of knowledge and best practice regarding the transposition of public procurement legislation between Member States, as well as the modernisation and simplification of public procurement rules, will significantly increase the efficiency of EU public procurement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Current European Union legislation sets minimum standards which have to be met for this type of procurement. However, these standards are often insufficient, mainly due to the problem of transposing them into national law and the lack of an effective system for monitoring whether the procurement procedures meet the requirements laid down in the directive. The rapporteur defines these problems very aptly and draws our attention to the ways in which they can be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems are mainly associated with the preference shown to strong, national business entities, the failure to respect the principles of free and fair competition, and of course corruption, which prevents business entities such as small and medium sized enterprises from participating in the procurement process. Thus, we need to introduce a monitoring system for public procurement which will allow us to prevent illegal, independent awarding of contracts. That is why I agree that the Member States should make better use of the support offered by the European Commission in order to improve the transposition and application of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">It would also be a good idea to set up national advisory agencies in the field of public procurement. In addition to providing assistance to businesses taking part in the public procurement process, they could also monitor the situation in the Member States and send statistical data to the Commission. We should also facilitate access to this kind of procurement by simplifying electronic procurement procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us remember that public procurement is an important indicator of economic growth in the Union, currently accounting for 16% of GDP. The aim of the directive is to eliminate discrimination in Member States and to make the system flexible enough for foreign businesses to have equal access to the markets of other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that in terms of resolving the problem of public procurement procedures we should focus not only on formal solutions, but also informal ones. These include the promotion of good practice, exchange of experiences, organisation of training or the exchange of information between Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission is currently assessing how further to improve the correct application of our rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of public partnerships is of particular concern to a number of Members. Questions have been raised about the need to clarify concepts such as ‘public authority’ or the notion of what constitutes an in-house contract.</p>
<p class="contents">I hear the call for a legislative proposal in this area. Amendments to this effect have been tabled. I have to say, however, that I am not convinced of the need for legislative action. Based on the evidence at hand, I believe it would be premature to go down that route.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is studying national practices in this area. If this research demonstrates that clarification is necessary, we could then decide how best to provide such clarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome your report as a timely contribution to this reflection, and I look forward to working with the European Parliament and making the internal market deliver tangible benefits to consumers and businesses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
