<p class="contents">On 4 October 2006, the European Commission adopted a regulation amending the rules governing airport security. It was certainly guided by the best of intentions. However, it acted in secret, Commissioner, by including in these rules an annex that was declared secret, and therefore hidden from the citizens for whom it is intended, and whose lives it directly affects.</p>
<p class="contents">This text, with its measures and their considerable impact on the entire European Union, was drafted in just one week. It therefore took the European Commission just one week to decide on everything that needed to be done. In the space of a week, the European Commission made a law compulsory for millions of people, on the basis of a secret meeting of the Aviation Safety Committee, held on 27 September 2006. The only information given to the citizens on this subject was given via a press note. The citizens learnt of the regulation directly, and exclusively, through a press note published by the Commission. And even the press note says in point 7: ‘and recognises that this measure is based on the US experience’.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that you can hear the interpreter, I shall switch to Spanish. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(ES) </span>This regulation lays down exceptions, the Commission has told the press. Since the regulation is secret, however, no citizen can apply these exceptions should they need to and should they be faced with someone abusing their authority.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, the European Commission has created legislation that imposes obligations on the citizens, which restricts their rights, but which, as a result of its secret nature, cannot be applied by any court anywhere in the European Union. Commissioner, press releases and information leaflets do not yet carry any weight in the courts.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the way in which these rules have been approved means that their application has been left to the Member States, which are applying them in an utterly chaotic way throughout the Union, and by a chaotic way I mean, in practice, an arbitrary way.</p>
<p class="contents">Each airport acts as it sees fit. In some places, a liquid cheese is seen as a threat to our security, in others it is not. In some places, a cake filled with cream is seen as a threat to security, in others it is not. What is a threat on the flight from Madrid to Barcelona is not a threat on the flight from Barcelona to Madrid. What is a threat in Zurich – because they also apply your rules – or in Heathrow, or in Charles de Gaulle, is not a threat in Milan-Malpensa airport.</p>
<p class="contents">There are supposed to be exceptions to this rule, Commissioner, for passengers in transit for example — you also announced this is in the infamous press release, in paragraph 16 — but in practice, nobody knows how to apply these exceptions to passengers in transit.</p>
<p class="contents">There are supposed to be exceptions for medicines, but nobody knows how the exceptions for medicines should be applied. Furthermore, amongst other things, nothing is said about medicines that do not require a prescription.</p>
<p class="contents">Your press release says that water is prohibited because it is very difficult to distinguish it from other liquids. Are there any bombs that can be drunk, Commissioner? We do not know.</p>
<p class="contents">You have created an entirely arbitrary system, which in some cases verges on the absurd, in the face of which the citizens have no mechanism for defending themselves against the absolute power of the uniformed private agent in front of them. With no defence, in the literal sense, the passengers have no rights. They must keep quiet and obey or cancel their journey.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the citizens have an almost blind faith in the notion that what the authorities do — and you are an authority, as are we — is for their own good and security, but we Members have the obligation — not just the right, but the obligation — to ensure that fear of terrorism is not used as a pretext for restrictions of freedom, which may be pointless unless they are well-founded.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament has not delegated powers to the European Commission to legislate in secret and impose obligations on the citizens, without any kind of jurisdictional control of their application. And it does not even have that power within the context of comitology. I would therefore ask the Commissioner, as other groups are also asking you, what impact analysis has the Commission carried out? What powers does it believe it has, within the framework of comitology, to carry out what it has applied here? What is the theoretical basis and what is the true basis, backed up by studies and reports? What other security models has the Commission employed?</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, rather than promoting it, these measures seriously harm the image of security and the image of the European Union as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This process, in which we are informed without being allowed to enquire further or to seek a legal opinion, cannot remain as it is, for it creates a state of affairs that is ceasing to be sustainable. Even though these measures have been being implemented for some months now, passengers’ criticisms of them are no less strident. Why is this so? The reason is obvious, for we are now in the period of reflection. Let us consider that more closely. If a measure is understood to be directed against terrorism, nobody will reject it, provided that they regard it as necessary, understand what it is meant to do, and know that it can fulfil its purpose, but if – to take one example – people have the liquid for moistening their contact lenses taken off them and find later on that they can buy in the duty-free a bottle of whisky containing more than 100 ml, then nobody is going to think that that makes any sense at all, nor can the point of it be got across to them.</p>
<p class="contents">What is now needed is an explanation of where the logic is in depriving an airline passenger of a bottle of wine that he has brought with him when he can buy the same bottle in the duty-free shop later on. People have to have these things explained to them, or else they will not consent to measures that are needed in the interests of air safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a nuisance, and it has caused still longer waiting times at airports. It has to be asked whether there is any thinking person who believes that this procedure is likely to prevent even one terrorist act. The sole effect, if any, of such bureaucracy will be to make other places containing large numbers of people – for example, buses and underground systems - the replacement targets for acts of terrorism. Instead, all our efforts should be put into preventing terrorism by removing the causes of the hatred and bitterness that are the breeding grounds for terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">How did matters go so badly wrong? It is because the Commission rushed these arrangements through on the basis of secret memoranda of which the citizens were unaware and the quality of which the citizens’ elected representatives were unable to verify. I must therefore urge the Commission, in the strongest possible terms, to stop being so secretive and to reconsider these arrangements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am merely standing in for Mrs Mastenbroek, who could not be here this evening. </p>
<p class="contents">The Council has adopted Commission Regulation (EC) No 1448/2006 on aviation security, which contains a secret annex with restrictive measures on liquids that passengers are allowed to carry on aircraft in their hand luggage.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission explain and illustrate, firstly, how the secrecy of the annex can be brought to comply with the democratic principle of publicity of the law? Which sanctions are applied in the case of refusal to follow or of breach of the rules? How it is intended to avoid arbitrariness in the practical implementation of a secret rule and its exceptions?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, does this text provide for the passengers’ right for information and right of appeal? How can airline passengers contest decisions and sanctions taken on the basis of the new hand luggage rules on the spot or at a later stage and look for legal remedy?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, what is the justification for these measures? Did the Commission carry out an evaluation of the information and evidence presented by the United Kingdom’s secret services upon requesting these restrictions? Was specialised expertise gathered before the decision was made? Are the measures based on proper risk assessment and will they yield an appropriate reduction of security risks? Will they be evaluated after implementation?</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, have these measures been subject to an impact assessment on fundamental rights? Have they been deemed compatible with citizens’ rights, the free movement of persons and goods? On what grounds are these measures to be considered proportionate and necessary in a democratic society in compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights? Have these measures been subject to an impact assessment on consumer rights and the practical impact on airport operations and passenger flows? Was there any prior assessment of the extra costs consumers and airports will face after the implementation of the new rules?</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, the aviation security implementing rules are developed by the Aviation Security Regulatory Committee, established by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002. This committee only gets external advice from the stakeholder advisory group on aviation security. It is an informal body of aviation industry stakeholders. Would the Commission agree that this body needs to be formalised as requested by Parliament during the first reading of the ongoing revision of Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002? Would the Commission accept the idea that this committee also needs systematically to take into account appropriate expertise on civil rights and consumer interests?</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, if I may add one personal question, Commissioner: what happened to my almost-new shaving gel that was confiscated at Brussels Zaventem Airport? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall also avoid repeating the threat that I made in committee of demonstrating in this Chamber the dangerous – albeit non-lethal – potential of mixtures that are easily made from materials to be found in duty-free shops or from other substances not subject to the restrictions that we are debating. Any ill-intentioned person could certainly use materials that can be found on board an aircraft or in any case acquired after boarding control.</p>
<p class="contents">On my frequent trips through airports, I have been saddened and, at the same time, amused to see full containers and harmless items being taken from passengers – mothers and babies not yet able to talk, elderly people perhaps having their first fraught experience of travelling, and other absent-minded travellers who, armed only with common sense but uninformed about the EU’s useless preventive measures, end up being deprived and disarmed of their shaving cream and shampoo, their lethal nail scissors, nail files and penknives, their drinks and whatever else they may have purchased from the duty free shops.</p>
<p class="contents">These controls are, of course, for the sake of everyone’s safety, but to what extent are they really keeping us safe and are not just silly, tiresome annoyances for passengers and additional burdens for both travellers and airport managers?</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, since I do not know of any studies or research that have been carried out on the actual dangers posed by the banned articles or particularly on the statistical frequency of cases where these products have been used for criminal purposes, I wonder whether any studies or research might even have been kept secret, like the annex to the Commission regulation. How many hijackers have used nail files to carry out their crimes? How many have sprayed shaving cream over on-board equipment or held passengers and crew hostage with it? How many have been caught carrying chilled and cushioned cartons to keep their nitroglycerine stable? That would give me and the citizens of Europe a real sense of the need for the measures in question and of the secrecy now surrounding this enigmatic business. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I cannot let it be said that these measures were adopted in a rush and in secret, Mr President. I am going to demonstrate that they were not, even though I always find Parliament’s comments very useful and I listened to the speakers very carefully. However, I should really like to explain, first of all, why new rules restricting the presence of liquids in hand luggage on aircraft were introduced within the Community on 6 November 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, what is the reason for these restrictions? The measures laid down by Regulation (EC) No 1546/2006 should enable us to face up to the new threats created by home made liquid explosives. We have worked on the basis of information communicated by the Member States, in particular the United Kingdom, which indicates that liquid explosives are a genuine threat to civil aviation.</p>
<p class="contents">Last summer, on 10 August 2006, the British secret services uncovered a terrorist plot aimed at blowing up several aeroplanes in mid-flight, with the aid of liquid explosives. According to the results of the investigation, the explosives were home made, and created from chemicals that are relatively easy to acquire. The police discovered liquid explosives hidden in soft drinks bottles, which appeared perfectly harmless. The old security measures would not have made it possible to detect those explosives.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that information on how to make these kinds of bombs may be in circulation, and that the necessary ingredients are easy to get hold of, it was concluded that the threat associated with these devices was genuine. The honourable Members must know that it is possible to disguise the colour and smell of these explosives. Furthermore, they may come not only in the form of a liquid, but also in that of a gel or cream. A solution needed to be found that was both achievable and effective. The Commission wanted, on the one hand, a consistent approach to be applied throughout the European Union and, on the other hand, passengers to clearly understand the situation, so as to provide a uniform level of security in every EU airport and on every flight.</p>
<p class="contents">Imagine, ladies and gentlemen, if very different rules had been laid down in the European Union, without any coordination. Imagine the confusion that that would have caused, especially in the minds of passengers. The management of airport security would have been very problematic as a result. Could these difficult issues have been avoided? Could the Commission have dared wait for a real attack to take place on board an aircraft to show that measures were necessary? Could the Commission have made do with seeing the Member States implement a patchwork of disparate security rules that would have made transiting through Europe's major airports difficult and chaotic?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission thus examined this issue in cooperation with the Member States' aviation security experts and with the technical task force of the European Civil Aviation Conference, ECAC, which brings together experts from throughout Europe. Those experts advised the Commission to limit the authorised capacity of bottles containing liquids to 100 millimetres and the total volume of liquid to that held in a one-litre bag. They deemed that sufficient to prevent a home made bomb, made from liquid explosives, and of a size sufficient to cause catastrophic damage on an aeroplane, from being carried on board.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been in contact with the US authorities, which came to the same conclusion, and the approaches adopted on both sides of the Atlantic are compatible in every respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore decided to establish the provisions necessary to implement this coherent regulation throughout the European Union, pursuant to the framework legislation laid down in Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to procedural issues, because I cannot allow it to be said that we have not complied with the procedures. A number of MEPs had some fears about the way in which the security rules to be applied in airports have been revised.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to remind you of the European legal framework. Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security constitutes the framework legislation. This regulation was adopted by both the Council and the European Parliament, in accordance with the codecision procedure, in the months following on from the World Trade Centre attacks. This regulation established the principle whereby the Member States must lay down common basic rules applicable to aviation security measures, with the aim of ensuring that these measures are systematically complied with throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as is often the case with particularly sensitive issues, this framework legislation does not take up all of the details of the common rules and of the measures laid down for the implementation of those rules. This information appears in annexes that may be adapted in accordance with the comitology procedures. In the case of aviation security, such recourse to comitology is required if certain details need to be able to be amended in due course so as to take account of new information. Many passages in these technical annexes contain sensitive data, insofar as they specify the methods for applying the security measures on the ground in airports. One cannot simply divulge certain precise information on airport security. Public access to these detailed implementing measures could help criminals and potential terrorists get round our security measures. That is why Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 adopted by the European Parliament and by the Council specifically stipulates that this information is secret and must not be published.</p>
<p class="contents">The rules applicable to liquids carried in hand luggage are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1546/2006 of the Commission, and not, Mr President, in Regulation (EC) No 1448/2006, as is indicated in the questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Regulation (EC) No 448/2006 also covers aviation security, but it lays down rules applicable to the explosive detection systems used in airports. May I point out at this stage of the debate that the nine other regulations were adopted by the European Union, that these regulations are in force, and that we followed the same procedures for this tenth regulation, which is the subject of our debate today?</p>
<p class="contents">Regulation (EC) No 1546/2006, which we are discussing, includes an annex classed ‘European Union restricted’, which prohibits its publication in the Official Journal. However, there are no grounds to conclude from this that the adoption of this regulation has been marred by irregularities. It was approved by the EU Member States within the Aviation Security Regulatory Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">It was after this committee had given its approval that Parliament, through your Committee on Transport and Tourism, received the draft regulation, pursuant to the comitology procedures laid down in Council Decision 1999/468/EC and in the framework agreement on relations between the Commission and the European Parliament. In a letter dated 4 October 2006, the Committee on Transport and Tourism informed me that Parliament had exercised its right of scrutiny and that no comment had been made on the draft measures.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be noted that the bodies representing the airline operators and airports fully supported the legislative proposal and played an active part in drafting the rules. It cannot be said that this regulation was adopted secretly and undemocratically. Frankly, if there was a procedural flaw somewhere, I would be the first to acknowledge it.</p>
<p class="contents">The following issue concerns the transparency of the rules. As I have already said, the aviation security rules, particularly those laid down by Regulation (EC) No 1546/2006, have not been published because potential terrorists could use them as a source of information. In that respect, the Community rules are no different from the national rules on aviation security.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be noted, however, that this regulation is intended for the competent authority of each Member State and that, pursuant to Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security, the Member States’ authorities are bound to communicate information to interested parties on a ‘need to know’ basis in accordance with the national rules applicable to the distribution of sensitive information.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that substantial efforts have been made and continue to be made to inform air passengers of what they can or cannot carry. What they need to know in order to prepare for their journey is pointed out to them, and if it appears that this information is not being clearly communicated to passengers, then the Commission will raise this point with the national authority in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I have really taken it upon myself to champion passengers’ rights. I have shown this, not least in my dealings with airline operators, and we are currently conducting an investigation – I have briefed Parliament on the initiative of this investigation – to find out whether passengers’ rights are really being respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, I feel that I cannot be suspected <span class="italic">a priori</span> of not taking an interest in passengers. On this point, the message contained in your questions to me is loud and clear. These questions highlight the difficulty of the issue, but what I would like to say to you first of all is that the procedures have been followed to the letter, in accordance with our regulations, and that, while the application of the measures is causing problems, we are ensuring and are anxious to ensure that the Member States inform us of those problems and allow us – I will make the point, moreover, by replying to the other speakers – to evaluate this arrangement, which I hope will be a temporary one, insofar as developments in technology and equipment will enable us to better detect the risks that I mentioned in liquids.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, what I wish to say is that security still remains a major element of aviation transport in particular and that, while we had to take these measures, we did so with some reluctance; that there really was a risk; and what would have been said, within this European Parliament, and with good reason, if I had not made sure that the measures were consistent throughout the European Union? Just last week, I travelled to Washington, and I can tell you that we are doing everything in our power to ensure that passengers are subject to the same rules on both sides of the Atlantic. Clearly, if this were not the case, the problems would just be transferred to US flights and transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I wanted to show how much of an interest I take in each of the authors and speakers who are going to take the floor and yet reiterate too that, in this difficult matter referred to me, we, together with the Commission, have genuinely complied with all the rules, and I cannot allow it to be said that the measures taken were taken hurriedly and secretively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Good intentions are not, however, always put to good effect, as many of us, and many millions of ordinary Europeans discover on a daily basis when they are confronted, at European airports, with behaviour the rights and wrongs of which they are unable to judge and the point of which escapes them.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, there are three questions that remain to be answered. How far are these measures actually allowed to go? Where is the boundary at which harassment and arbitrary authority begin? I might add that people are not even dealing with officials, but rather, on the whole, with the staff of a security firm, who suddenly put their acting sheriff's hats on and demand everything conceivable of them. Secondly, are the annoyances to which passengers are exposed acceptably proportionate to the gain in security? Thirdly, do these measures really enhance security or are the powers-that-be merely covering their own backs?</p>
<p class="contents">Until such time as we are able to examine for ourselves the actual legal documents by which the inspectors are guided, we will not be able to ascertain whether or not we are being treated properly, and until such time as credible risk assessments are carried out and communicated to the public in proper form, Europeans will be unable to judge whether what is being done is right and proper and really does enhance security or whether – as some feel – it is being used as a form of harassment, something that will end up rebounding on the European Union in a way about which none of us can be indifferent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, in the final analysis, what matters is that we strike the right balance between two things that are very dear to us and that can appear conflicting at times, namely the pursuit of the highest level of effective security and a sense of security on the one hand and protecting fundamental human rights, citizens’ rights, including the right to privacy, and the free movement, to which we have grown so accustomed, on the other. The consequences of the measures that have been taken were quite spectacular: longer waiting times at security check-in, confiscations of large amounts of perfume, drink and other consumer goods, but also many questions the answers to which were only slow in coming, such as what to do with liquid medicines and other items.</p>
<p class="contents">One could say that the rapid reaction of the European security agencies can be interpreted as a sign of decisiveness. On the other hand, we are also faced with two types of questions, the first one concerning the effectiveness of the measures, for we all know that a number of exceptions will inevitably be made for such persons as medical staff, for example, and so we are justified in asking whether well prepared, well informed terrorists would be stopped by these measures, while vast numbers of people are left to suffer the effects. I understand that the Commission will be planning an initial assessment this spring. This is to be welcomed, and should be done on a regular basis. In addition, we should also keep an eye out for side-effects on such things as personal freedoms. This balance is at risk of being lost, and this requires a democratic debate, as we are having this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to a second fundamental issue, which is the democratic control over decisions of this kind and hence the involvement of this House. Commissioner, I am convinced that the Commission has purely formally complied with all the rules. There is no doubt in my mind about that. Indeed, a few days before the regulation was formally ratified, a number of members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism – and I was there – managed to verify the lawfulness of the draft regulation; they did so individually, alone, without staff, without taking legal advice first, without any form of consultation. We were therefore able to conclude that the committee of experts has taken a decision in accordance with the regulation that applies in this context. Allow me, Commissioner, to say that it has become apparent that the comitology procedure applied to this issue is inadequate. We will therefore need to join forces in order to look for ways of holding a truly democratic debate on sensitive issues of this kind that have a major impact on our citizens' way of living. To make it absolutely clear, I am not arguing in favour of Parliament being able to decide on the types of scanners used at airports or determine when a threat is alarming. What is important, though, is to become more involved, more so than today, in the thorough assessments and the impact analyses, for example.

Air passengers that rely on medicines can take these with them if necessary during the flight. These passengers must carry a note with them and if upon arrival, it transpires that their luggage has once again not arrived and they do not have the rest of their medication, then that is their bad luck. It is difficult when you depend on heavy medication. It is unclear where passengers can lodge complaints or appeal in the event of security officials mishandling the situation. As yet, there is no uniform explanation whatsoever in the 27 Member States. If in Member State A, mozzarella is regarded as suspicious, then this presents no problems in Member State B, and so, Commissioner, this confusion among passengers, which you just mentioned, is still there even though there is European legislation in place. What is clear is that the measures are far from watertight. I still try it every time at random airports and I always manage to get a bottle of about 200ml through security. Democratic societies are open societies. It is this openness that makes them appealing and successful, but also, unfortunately, vulnerable. The tendency to minimise that vulnerability to terrorist attack by imposing more rules on society and by taking away some of the privacy, appears to many to be an understandable first reaction. Where, though, does one draw the line? The reasons seem increasingly far-fetched. Of course we should not underestimate the threat, but to what extent does this threat justify these – what does, after all, amount to – far-reaching measures which were issued in quick succession in the past few years and whose effectiveness is far from obvious? For let us be honest, Commissioner, what lacks more than anything in the discussion is insight into the supposed effectiveness. In other words, do all measures taken and planned really give us extra security or is, above all, a false, and expensive, sense of security being introduced? The hand luggage rules have been in place for more than three months. I should like to find out from the Commission and Council, whose absence this evening is unfortunate, whether they consider the rules to be effective and if so, on what basis. Containers full of shower gels, alcohol, water bottles, lotions and suchlike have meanwhile been confiscated and destroyed. What does this produce, Commissioner, other than a considerable cost and much irritation? Are you still convinced that these rules are a bitter necessity in the fight against terrorism? Is this a permanent or temporary measure? If temporary, how do you define temporary?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, of course the procedure followed is lawful. Nobody is in any doubt about this. Do you, though, also actually take the view that this procedure represents a proper manifestation of European democracy? Is this procedure, as you see it, adequate for what we think democracy in the European Union stands for? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Could we have some common sense applied to this issue?</p>
<p class="contents">Several decades ago, the opponents of European integration claimed that the policies of the European institutions at the time led to wasteful butter mountains and wine lakes. The imagery associated with this catch-cry created an unfair and damaging negative perception of the EU when it was in its infancy.</p>
<p class="contents">The new mountains and lakes imagery, which is likely to feed Euro-scepticism today, can be seen in Europe’s airports, where massive volumes of duty free are being confiscated every day from transit air passengers as a direct consequence of the new aviation security measures, signed off behind closed doors without democratic accountability and introduced on 6 November 2006. Under these regulations, as my colleague said, 20 tonnes of duty free products are confiscated every week from passengers travelling through Frankfurt Airport, 1 500 litres of alcohol and perfume daily at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport and 10 000 items every week from transit passengers at Madrid’s Barajas Airport. It therefore comes as no surprise that these actions are causing immense frustration and annoyance to those affected, who blame the EU for their personal financial losses. It is legalised robbery!</p>
<p class="contents">But the story does not end there: fear of having duty free purchases confiscated has meant that increasing numbers of air travellers have stopped buying goods at third country airside retail shops. This will spell economic disaster for European businesses, as many of these non-EU duty free outlets are owned by European companies, such as Ireland’s Aer Rianta International, which has outlets all over the Middle East, Russia and Canada.</p>
<p class="contents">Ireland has a particular interest in this issue: after all, we invented duty free shopping in the first place, and duty free outlets throughout the world have provided a valuable showcase for selling iconic Irish products which have contributed significantly to the Irish economy, such as Irish whiskey and Baileys.</p>
<p class="contents">I would not support any change in a policy which would undermine the safety of our airports or airlines. However, common sense should prevail, and I urge the Commissioner to enter into bilateral agreements with countries in which airport security is at least as good as that which exists at European …</p>

<p class="contents">I have been slightly surprised at the ferocity of the attacks by some of my colleagues on this system. It is clear that there is a serious and more subtle threat to airport security than we have ever faced and that the screening of hand baggage needs to be made as easy as possible. As the Commissioner rightly said, liquid explosives can be disguised as very innocuous substances, and a patchwork of 27 separate regulations would have been unacceptable. I therefore support the initiative he took in introducing these measures but, as he rightly says, these measures can be improved and need to be examined in the light of experience.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to follow on from what Mr Ó Neachtain and Mrs Doyle have said about duty free in transit from third countries. Many Scots have returned to the UK via Frankfurt Airport, Schiphol Airport and other airports and had the duty free they had bought as presents confiscated at the airport. That is unacceptable. As has been said, it has had a serious impact on the sale of duty free – 12% in EU duty free shops, 40% in some of the third-country duty free shops. Scottish whisky uses duty free as a shop window for its sales and does so very successfully. This process has hurt EU companies and it is undermining the confidence of consumers in duty free.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to suggest a very simple solution, as did Mrs Doyle, i.e. that we try and encourage third countries to adopt the tamper-evident bags that we use for duty free inside the European Union. I would argue that this does not undermine European Union security and, indeed, can enhance it if we encourage our third-country partners to improve their security at airports by adopting this system. If we have mutual recognition this will ease flows within airports and prevent a lot of the personal grief that is created around this issue. I hope the Commission will look seriously at this and consider entering into immediate bilateral agreements with suitable third countries such as the US, Canada, Australia, Hong Kong and others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I look at the situation positively. Alcohol that has been confiscated and not drunk is healthier. To me there is no theoretical aspect to the issue. I am one of the millions of victims of this regulation. Like one of my predecessors, my shaving cream and deodorant have been confiscated on two occasions. At the same time, on two occasions I successfully carried a knife in my hand baggage. Granted, it was a penknife, but it was far more capable of doing damage than my shaving cream.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, there is no consistency in this. In addition, the levels of restrictions vary depending on the airport. At some airports you can carry more in your hand luggage, in others less. These regulations should be identical, which would make them easier to accept. But everything is done in an atmosphere of secrecy which causes irritation and leads to obstinacy.</p>

It is fine to talk about citizens’ rights, but safety is of paramount importance, and the most fundamental right of any passenger is the right to, and the guarantee of, travel safety. I genuinely believe that the people who are talking most and criticising the regime in place would be the very first in here if we had another 9/11.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is a problem, Commissioner, because every single day thousands and thousands of litres of duty free alcohol, perfumes and make up are confiscated, as has been said, from transit air passengers arriving at EU airports. These passengers have broken no law whatsoever in bringing these products into the EU – products that can be found in any high street shop in any part of the UK, Ireland or elsewhere in the EU. They are confiscated because of the aviation security rules that were introduced on 6 November, and this has resulted in significant falls in sales. Many of these items being confiscated are well known nationwide. We are talking about, for example, worldwide brands, which include, as has been said, Irish whiskey and Scotch whisky, French perfume, Finnish vodka and Spanish wine; I could go on. Furthermore, many of the third country duty free outlets are European. As has been said by my colleague Mrs Doyle, Ireland’s Aer Rianta owns shops in the United States, Russia, Canada and the Gulf States among others. Germany’s Heinemann owns duty free shops in Turkey, South Africa and the Balkans. Spain’s Aldeasa group has duty free outlets in South America.</p>
<p class="contents">However, solving the transfer passenger problem is relatively simple, as has been said by my Scottish colleague. The travel retail industry and producers have proposed that airports with large passenger flows into Europe introduce the same airport and airport retail supply chain security that exists in the EU. Once recognised by the EU, this would allow passengers departing from these airports and transferring at an EU airport to use a standard tamper-evident bag, just as passengers do within the EU itself. Mutual recognition of airport security standards between the EU and non-EU countries is the solution. Will the Commission consider taking action along these lines as a matter of urgency? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, like some others, I should like to concentrate on the consequences of the implementation of the aviation security regulations after 6 November, which have particularly affected, among the other areas already mentioned, my own region of Northern Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">I have received a large number of complaints from constituents who have had their duty-free goods confiscated as they transited through EU airports on their way home back to Belfast in Northern Ireland. This is primarily a problem for transit passengers coming from third countries; the people from my constituency have suffered tremendously simply because, when they are flying back to Northern Ireland from outside Europe, they have to come through some other airport within Europe, be it Heathrow, Schiphol or even Frankfurt, before they make their way home – we do not have direct flights as other areas do.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue that concerns me as a Northern Ireland MEP is the fact that there has been, as I have learnt, a considerable drop in duty-free sales airside from third countries, and certainly as one of Northern Ireland’s oldest and most prestigious products is a whiskey called Bushmills – Mr Martin would like to hear that, I am sure! – a considerable amount of which is sold worldwide in duty-free shops. Any drop in the sales of that will affect the economy and jobs back home. I am sure you understand that very well, Commissioner, because your own country equally suffers from the continued drop in sales of prestige French products, such as perfume, champagne and wine.</p>

That does not prevent me from understanding the difficulties associated with applying the regulation and from remaining alert to them.</p>
<p class="contents">I am completely open, contrary to what you said. I am open in most cases; the recent visits I have made to Zurich and Washington, in particular, testify to this. On these occasions, I submitted to the same rules as all other passengers; I was even subjected to a fairly systematic search in Zurich.</p>
<p class="contents">Like you, I understand the problems and I do not want to give you the impression that I regard this debate as totally useless. It is important for me to clearly understand the difficulties, and I am grateful to many of you for helping me to understand them. A word of warning, however: just because the controls have flaws, it does not mean that all controls should be condemned. The same applies to speeding on the roads. Just because the controls carried out have shortcomings, it does not mean that those controls are useless.</p>
<p class="contents">I am going to try to respond to some of the points raised, then I will draw some conclusions. I should like first to remind you that we have drafted some fairly detailed guidelines with the aim of ensuring that the rules are applied as uniformly as possible in all of the Member States. That is one thing.</p>
<p class="contents">You raised the problem of transfer passengers. I am going to respond to you in more depth. It is true that we now have to go through the International Civil Aviation Organisation to conclude bilateral agreements. You are right, that is how we should proceed. I believe that we need to resolve this matter of transfers, which is currently unsatisfactory. We fully agree on that. We will have the opportunity, during the International Civil Aviation Organisation General Assembly, to raise the problem and to see what can be done in relation to third-countries. You are perfectly right, and I wanted to stress that.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say to you that I am very aware of the problem of duty-free sales. I myself have received the Irish representatives, who have very solid experience of the duty free system, and you are right in thinking that I myself, as a Frenchman who hails from regions in which prestige products are promoted, am also worried. I do not think that the solution is perfect, but, in view of the regulations that we have adopted, I think that we have tried to find solutions for duty free. However, I too am still very conscious of this problem, and you can obviously write to me personally in this connection.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr El Khadraoui was right in saying that an assessment really needs to be carried out. I should like to confirm to you, ladies and gentlemen, the commitment made by the Commission to re-examine the regulation on a regular basis. Given the developments in technology, the first re-examination – which is currently in preparation – will obviously have an impact on the situation in airports and will affect passengers. You are therefore right, regular assessments need to be carried out. An assessment is under way and, without prejudice to the confidential nature of certain provisions, I will be quite willing to give an account of it.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of research, you state that technology would enable us to avoid restrictive measures for passengers, as a result, for example, of the installation of detectors that are capable of assessing risks. That is obvious. A research effort is therefore required in this instance. During my stay in Washington, I also saw how we could cooperate with the US research services to design equipment that would enable us to avoid these restrictions. This is clearly a major element.</p>
<p class="contents">I did not respond to a point raised in the first part of the debate. It relates to issues concerning the Stakeholder Advisory Group on Aviation Security, known as SAGAS. The Commission created SAGAS so that it could record the opinions of the various industry sectors. It is true that the Group is vital. When Parliament proposed at first reading to amend the new framework regulation aimed at formalising SAGAS, Mr Berman, the Commission gave its support. And I confirm that support. Parliament is absolutely right to want to formalise, as it were, the structure of SAGAS. However, it is true that the opinions of SAGAS only sustain the work of the regulatory committee. Every initiative taken into consideration by the committee is examined by all of the Commission services, and attention is paid to aspects such as civil rights, consumer rights and legal aspects, before the Commission makes a decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I am well aware that I have not responded to everyone. I was asked a question about whether the interim measures will be temporary or long-term. I am convinced that, in this area, we can be hopeful that new technologies and equipment will enable us, at some point, to suspend these emergency provisions on the basis of the unanimous – I must say unanimous – evidence of the experts from each of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are the reasons why we have laid down these rules. Have no doubt that, for me, as someone who is very attached to the development of air transport and to the comfort of passengers, it is with some reluctance that I must oversee the application of this regulation. I can tell you that this debate has been useful and that we will remain more mindful than ever of all the problems that many of you have raised, but that is without forgetting that the security rules will only be genuinely effective if they are applied by the entire international community. In this regard, the body that oversees civil aviation worldwide, the ICAO, also needs to be able to take up the issue quickly and allow us to pass as many bilateral agreements as necessary with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, while thanking the MEPs who have spoken so frankly, I should like to assure them that the procedures have indeed been complied with. However, I am well aware of the many everyday problems caused by the application of these measures; I remain conscious of them and I will take them into account in the very precise assessment that the impact of these measures requires. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That is why new – more restrictive – security measures have been implemented in airports, and I fully endorse the process under way. Nevertheless, attacks on the freedom to travel should remain proportionate.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, while I support the bulk of the measures taken, I remain sceptical about the restrictions on liquids in aircraft cabins and about the way in which they have been decided. Indeed, these measures cause a great deal of bother and many drawbacks in practice for people who travel, and they are not proven to be effective, so different are they from one State to another, and even from one airport to another. Moreover, the MEPs, as elected representatives, were informed of the implementation of these measures only after they had been decided upon.</p>
<p class="contents">I am perfectly aware that some information cannot be divulged because of its highly strategic nature where the fight against terrorism is concerned, but I believe that we should be more involved in the decision-making process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Day-to-day life on Europe’s airports is characterised by impenetrable rules that frequently vary from one airport to another, by hopelessly overworked staff and frequently despairing and angry passengers, who find themselves, for example, deprived even of their contact lens solution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is because it is to the detriment of passengers that they are told they are being kept safe, while that cannot be guaranteed in a crisis situation that the Commission and the Council must revise the relevant regulation. What is needed is for reasonable, understandable and effective rules to be laid down in good time for the holiday season, and it would be sensible, when drafting them, to listen to those who have to put them into practice in airports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
