I am here to address you on what is currently a highly topical issue, namely the Middle East. I know this is an area of great concern to you all.</p>
<p class="contents">The Middle East is giving us cause for alarm once again. Yesterday, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy adopted the report drawn up by Mr Menendez del Valle. This sent out a further signal of Parliament’s strong determination to be actively involved in the peace effort. I am confident this report will be most helpful in the search for peace. It has indeed already proved its worth.</p>
<p class="contents">I have held several discussions with Mr Menendez del Valle. We worked together to ensure the report contained the elements that could help to find a solution in line with the European approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The last few weeks amounted to a respite. They were characterised by tense calm. Sadly, that calm proved all too fragile. It was shattered dramatically by the events of recent days. We have received yet another reminder of the extent to which tension, violence, destruction and death are part of daily life in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am bound to admit to you that I too am overcome by a feeling of frustration. I am frustrated because the Middle East is still bleeding to death. Life after life is still being lost needlessly.</p>
<p class="contents">I am frustrated also because the Israelis and Palestinians have been unable or unwilling to meet the solemn undertakings given at Aqaba a few short weeks ago. I am frustrated because tension in the region has risen to alarming levels. I am frustrated because fewer and fewer people now believe the solution lies in the Road Map sponsored by the Quartet. Above all, I am frustrated because the despair that has overcome so many Arabs and Israelis might also take root amongst us. It might overcome our political leaders and our citizens too.</p>
<p class="contents">It is imperative not to allow this frustration to cloud our vision. On the contrary, the very gravity of the situation and our shared concern must spur us on to greater efforts. They should motivate us to remain on the alert and assume all our duties and responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Each and every one of us is wondering what further action can be taken. We are asking ourselves if there is anything more the Union can do, and whether the Road Map retains any validity. We are also concerned that the present situation might degenerate into a regional conflict. All these concerns have been raised in public and no doubt in private too.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to take a few minutes to deal with each in turn.</p>
<p class="contents">I will begin with the Road Map. I believe the concern expressed is justified. It could certainly be argued that there is little point to a programme of actions to be taken on specific dates, if the parties required to act are disinclined to do so. It is certainly true that without the commitment of all the parties, progress will be negligible. I must also state quite clearly that whilst I recognise the tremendous difficulties confronting us, I do not believe there is any alternative to the Road Map. The much longed-for and shared objective of ensuring that two states, Israel and Palestine, can live in peace and security must not be abandoned following the tragic events of recent days. The Road Map sets an ambitious objective. It is to be met in 2005 when both the aforementioned states should be in existence. Still greater involvement by the international community is therefore called for, if that were possible. Above all, the onus is on the Quartet to step up its efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Europe sponsored the Road Map initiative. Europe was also involved in devising and setting up the Quartet. We proved capable of creating a new political platform to facilitate direct involvement by the United States within the framework of joint action. The debate over who might be an honest broker<span class="bold"> </span>was defused.</p>
<p class="contents">The members of the Quartet met in New York a few days ago. I can assure you that despite recent gloomy prognostications, the Quartet is still active. It remains the focal point for all peace efforts. Members of the Quartet formally undertook to meet again before the end of this year. An announcement to that effect was made at the end of the meeting. As a result of pressure from Europe, it was also agreed that the special representatives should meet regularly. These individuals are resident in the area. They are therefore in the best position to provide Members of the Quartet with an overview of the situation, so that the appropriate joint measures may be taken. Closer cooperation of our efforts will also be fostered.</p>
<p class="contents">A mere declaration of the continuing validity of the Road Map will not suffice, ladies and gentlemen. Specific actions are required if the current stalemate is to be transcended. Each party would then be able to detect in the other a willingness to move forward. Such measures need to be designed to build a minimum of confidence, and they must be verifiable. During the drafting stages of the Road Map, past experience led us to insist on the need for a verification mechanism. It is now urgent for the latter to be operational as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Abu Ala, the new Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority, is likely still to be working on the formation of a new Palestinian Government, probably in extremely trying conditions. He might have succeeded by now. I have known Mr Ala for several years and respect him. Mr Ala has built up a wealth of experience in very difficult circumstances. This new Palestinian Government must assume its responsibilities at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">I have spoken to Mr Ala by telephone almost every day. There is absolutely no doubt that, as regards security, Mr Ala must begin by bringing order to the Palestinian security services. He would be following the lead of Mr Salam Fayad, the minister responsible for the financial sector. Mr Fallad has done a good job in bringing order to the latter. Horrific terrorist attacks of the kind perpetrated all too often against the citizens of Israel with such devastating consequences simply cannot be tolerated. The attack in Haifa on the eve of Yom Kippur is a further example of what must never again be allowed to happen. The Palestinian Government needs to put an end to this scourge, in the interests of the Palestinians themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Likewise, economic and social reform must continue, for the benefit of the people of Palestine. Europe will offer Mr Ala and his government strong and active support for such efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">If the efforts of the new Palestinian Government are to bear fruit, however, it is vitally important for it to be able to count first and foremost on the support of the Israeli Government. There are also a number of key obligations on the Israeli Government pursuant to the Road Map. Israel is required to put an end to its policy on settlements. It is also required to stop building the security wall. This wall encroaches into territory beyond the 1967 borders. Further, Israel is called upon to put an end to its policy of targeted killings. In addition, Israel is called upon to stop other practices we believe to be violations of international law. Israelis and Palestinians need a chance to renew cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot conclude without saying a few words on regional stability. There should be no doubt as to the determination of the European Union, its Member States, institutions and citizens to combat and condemn terrorism. The Israeli Government is entitled to take measures to protect its citizens from terrorism. Indeed it is its duty to do so. Nonetheless, if terrorism is to be dealt with effectively, it must be dealt with within the framework of international law. That is the bottom line. The Middle East is a very volatile part of the world. Action by the parties involved must be such that it reduces rather than increases tension.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Arab friends are also called upon to maintain their commitment to the peace effort. They should also reactivate the initiative launched by Saudi Arabia and formalised at the Beirut Arab League Summit in March of last year. That initiative remains valid and enjoys the full support of the Quartet.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the next few weeks will be decisive. It is essential for all members of the Quartet to remain committed to the process in the days to come. This applies in particular to the United States. The road to peace will be long and difficult. That has already become apparent. We know what the objective is and are aware of the difficulties to be encountered on the way.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must continue to take strong and decisive action in the Middle East. Its actions also need to be creative and consistent. As I said earlier, the next few days and weeks will be crucial. Peace will have another chance, if Prime Minister Ala’s government gets to work and discharges its responsibilities regarding security, and if the Israeli Government is able to demonstrate restraint and generosity so as to reduce tension. It is important not to play into the hands of the terrorists.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, ladies and gentlemen, we shall do all in our power to move the process on as you and all men and women of good will would wish. We remain in touch with all the parties on a daily basis. It is to be hoped that the present vicious circle can be broken. The European Union’s personal representative is in the region every day. We are doing all we can to prevent violence increasing and spiralling out of control.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure we all realise the difficulty of the task before us. Nonetheless, it is essential for us to continue to work day and night to prevent the situation worsening until there can be no possible solution.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Monti,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the High Representative, Mr Javier Solana, has just explained, the political situation in the Middle East has reached a very low point. Apart from the difficulty in implementing the Roadmap so as to find a way out of the dreadful situation in which the Middle East has been plunged for some time now, new threats are looming on the horizon. Instead of feeling sorry for ourselves, however, we must look to the future, find out why we have failed and take remedial action. If we accept that the two-state solution still has the widest support, despite the building of the wall, despite the settlement problem and despite the attacks by Hamas, then the Roadmap needs to be put back on track. Perhaps the gradual approach that has been chosen, whereby the toughest issues are left until last, should be rethought. Solving the difficult problems first – like refugees and territorial division – may help to remove the obstacles that stand in the way of peace. Best practice acquired throughout the world may shed some light on how to approach the non-negotiable issues.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Menéndez del Valle has observed in his draft report, any peace plan depends on the honest commitment of both sides – and, I would add, of the international community – to implement it. It is this commitment that currently seems to be lacking: we therefore have to re-establish the political will to make the two-state solution work.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Israeli side, polls show that the majority of the population favour the two-state solution, although, according to many observers, a large part of the current Israeli Government will not accept the creation of a genuine Palestinian state on the West Bank. This rejection of the two-state solution and the failure to implement the Roadmap seem to be based on ideological reasons or on security fears. Building the wall, the security barrier, which runs deep inside the West Bank, is a consequence of both schools of thought, but it does not solve the concerns that lie at the root of either one. Both Palestinians and Israelis will, in fact, be left on both sides of the dividing line, many Palestinians will be subjected to great humanitarian suffering and some of the settlements will be left on the other side of the wall.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has always recognised Israel’s right to defend itself, but security does not consist solely of preventing terrorists from carrying out their abhorrent attacks; first and foremost, it is a matter of winning the people’s hearts and minds. Building a wall may be an acceptable measure, provided it is kept within Israeli territory. Israel now has to adopt a sufficient number of measures to strengthen trust. All extrajudicial executions and all punitive demolition of homes must stop. All outlying settlements on Palestinian land built since September 2000 must be pulled down, and all activities carried on in them must stop, since they are obstacles to the two-state solution. On the Palestinian side, the government seems to believe in the two-state solution, which means accepting the creation of a Palestinian state on the 1967 land; among the people and opposition groups, however, rejection of this solution is gaining ground. Hamas and others do not recognise Israel’s right to exist, as shown by the terrible suicide attacks and other terrorist acts. In addition, there seems to be a growing lack of any ability, power or willingness to set up efficient institutions, especially in the security field.</p>
<p class="contents">The new government under Prime Minister Abu Ala must take effective control of the Palestinian territories, undertake clear action against those who organise and commit violent attacks on the Israeli population, and publicly reaffirm Israel’s right to exist. It is equally important to make resolute progress on preparing for the elections, drafting the constitution and involving civil society in the reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">It is understandable that the international community should be focusing its attention on the security issue, but we must not forget the need to strengthen institutions and undertake reforms. This is an important aspect, and we should not lose sight of it. Having institutions that work well is the basis for long-term stability and security for both Palestine and Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community should be more decisive in setting targets against which the results achieved by both parties can be measured, in effectively monitoring all areas and not just that of security, and in offering rapid, effective support from donors.</p>
<p class="contents">Is there any hope? Both Israelis and Palestinians have to be persuaded that they have something to gain by moving on from today’s terrible situation. Both sides have signed up to the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and to a guarantee of secure borders for the state of Israel, not to mention full acceptance of Israel by all countries in the region. The international community must now do everything it can to persuade, coax and put pressure on both sides to honour the commitments they have made.</p>

We all thought that after the Iraq War, more intensive efforts would be made to find a solution to this apparently unending Middle East conflict. Unfortunately, this hope has not become reality. We appear to be in a situation of hopelessness, and the spiral of violence is continuing to escalate. On behalf of our group, I would like to state very clearly that every suicide bombing is a crime against the young people who carry it out and a crime against the Israelis whom they take with them into death. This must be made very clear.</p>
<p class="contents">We also say, however, that the ‘selective murder’ response, as Mr Solana has said – the policy of ‘an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth’ – does not help to make peace possible. I would like to thank Commissioner Monti for what he said about the wall, for his great ability – we know he has other abilities as well – but I would particularly like to thank him for saying what he did, and for the way he said it. I would like to thank him very warmly for that. If you would permit me to make a personal remark, I can trace my political commitment back to when, at the start of 1962, I saw a wall in my own country. That is something that profoundly affects people’s hearts and spirits. I am profoundly convinced, ladies and gentlemen, that the construction of this wall is a very great tragedy. It is a tragedy for Israel too, because it will simply lead to more hatred and revulsion. It is not a measure that will genuinely promote peace, and in my view, the wall will not increase Israel’s security either.</p>
<p class="contents">It must also be said that the illegal settlements are an ongoing factor preventing a peaceful solution. Let me say, not only on my own behalf, but also on behalf of my parliamentary group, that if a wall is constructed which leads to more hatred and more humiliation, this is a further argument, to my mind, for having an international peacekeeping force to keep the two hostile parties apart. I hope that a debate will begin, for once, about whether an international peacekeeping force …</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">… involving Europeans would be a way forward. From our point of view, it is clear that the aim must be for Israel to exist in secure borders. The aim must also be a Palestinian state in secure borders. We call on the key actors – Prime Minister Sharon, President Arafat, and the new Prime Minister Abu Ala – to give peace a chance and to overcome what are perhaps personal dislikes. Dialogue is essential, and Mr Solana, I would like to thank you particularly for what you are doing. I believe you really are doing what you have described, and that you are working day and night and talking to the key actors.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, of course, the development must continue. As desperate as the situation may appear, human and political life is never entirely hopeless, for if it were, we would have to give up our efforts altogether. For this reason, a further effort is required from the European Union, the United States, the United Nations and Russia to ensure that the actors on both sides start talking to each other again.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps we have an even greater responsibility than our American friends. After all, we always demand a great deal from the Americans. We criticise them when they do something and we criticise them when they do not. As Europeans, we should now, for once, take the initiative, especially since our American friends have other concerns with the start of the presidential election campaign – and we know how important are the groups in America whose support a candidate needs in order to be elected. We Europeans should therefore launch a genuine initiative here.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying something that especially concerns the issue of human dignity. There are no second-class people. Everyone is equal, and everyone is equal in human dignity. This applies to the Europeans, it applies to the Americans, it applies to the Palestinians, it applies to the Israelis, and it applies to the Chechens and to everyone in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Union, we are currently in the process of adopting a constitution, and this constitution is a process underpinned by values. I think we would do well to make people the focal point, and that is why we must adopt initiatives at this time to ensure that the dignity of the Palestinians is respected and the dignity of the Israelis is respected and that both nations have the chance to move into the future together in peace, in a democratic system. We should play a strong and pro-active role in this context. I would like to thank Mr Solana very warmly for all that he has contributed to date, and I hope that we will be more successful in future than we have been so far.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I have just heard the sad news of the murder of Mr Jose Antonio Bernal Gomez, Press Attaché at the Spanish Embassy in Baghdad. I trust you will convey the deepest condolences of the House to the Government of Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would also like to express our condemnation of the Haifa attack. This attack took place at a particularly sensitive time for Israel, coming as it did on the eve of Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. We express our condolences to all those Israeli and Palestinian families suffering as a result of this escalation of violence. This has come about despite the resumption of dialogue on 30 April, which represented a glimmer of hope and a window of opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">We endorse the content of the Menendez del Valle report. It is worth highlighting that, although there are differences of opinion and divisions amongst us Europeans on a number of matters, the Middle East is one issue on which we are broadly in agreement. This consensus between all the Member States of the European Union dates back to the 1980 Venice Declaration. The broad support for these proposals in the House is also worth noting.</p>
<p class="contents">Further to the statements made by Mr Solana and Commissioner Monti, I believe there is also clear agreement that we must maintain our political, diplomatic and economic effort. Mr President, the issue is not whether the Road Map is valid or not. The issue is that we must go down the road to peace, however difficult and dangerous it proves. After all, the Road Map is simply a way or a means of achieving peace.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, we believe we should make it clear to our Israeli friends that terrorism has to be dealt with within the framework of international law. The attack on Syria in the wake of the terrorist incident is unacceptable under international law. It violates the territorial integrity of a third country and contributes to a dangerous escalation of tension in a part of the world that could most certainly do without it.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe we should make it clear to the Israeli Government and to Mr Sharon that the solution to the conflict does not lie in implementing the law of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. It does not lie either in calls for the murder or removal of the elected representative of the Palestinian people. I recently attended the celebrations at Tel Aviv University in honour of Shimon Peres’s eightieth birthday. Bearing in mind statements made by Mr Peres, statements by other prominent Israeli leaders and statements by Mr Arafat and by the Palestinian Authority, it appears a number of concessions have been made. I refer firstly to the recognition of the right of the State of Israel to exist. This is recognition granted not only by us but also by the Palestinian Authority. Secondly, it has been recognised that peace can only be achieved through negotiation. Thirdly, it has been recognised that negotiations must be based on the 1967 borders. All this is to the credit of the Palestinian Authority. Mr Abu Abas represents this approach. He addressed the House when Mrs Fontaine was President, and was one of the negotiators of the Oslo Agreements. I would like to add also that the Palestinian National Authority could become a role model in democracy for the whole of the Arab world. I have in mind the activities it is currently engaged in and indeed the possibility of fresh elections, if the latter are permitted. In short, a hard intransigent approach leads to strengthening fanatic, anti-democratic and aggressive attitudes.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now turn to the matter of the building of the security fence. Mr Poettering spoke eloquently on the basis of his personal experience. I should point out too that from the Great Wall of China to the Berlin Wall, all such walls have proved utterly useless. We should appeal to the good sense of the Jewish people. They owe their very survival to the absence of walls. We must appeal to them to come to their senses and stop building a fence that does not even respect the 1967 borders. This fence will also make it impossible to achieve what we in the European Union have succeeded in doing, namely establishing a network of inter-connected interests. Links of this kind are just what the Middle East needs. They would result in fewer arms, greater opportunities for cooperation and economic development and greater opportunities for coming closer together.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to support the action taken by Mr Solana and also by our Representative in the Middle East. I believe the Quartet must continue its work. The possibility of establishing an international mandate involving the deployment of an international force on the ground should be considered too. This would be a peace-keeping buffer force supporting the efforts to be made by both parties. In conclusion, Mr President, the Road Map cannot be allowed to fail. Fanaticism, terrorism and intransigence cannot be allowed to ride roughshod over common sense and a just and dignified peace. I wish you well, gentlemen. You can count on our support.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vallvé (ELDR).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I listened carefully to the statement by Mr Solana. Clearly, the Middle East is an area of major concern for us. Only this morning I was reading the <span class="italic">Neue Zürcher Zeitung</span>, a Zurich daily with a fine reputation the world over. It contained an article calling for speedier distribution of funds to victims of the Holocaust. You may well wonder how these two issues are linked. They are linked because they both relate to an event that took place in Europe, and that event gave rise to the conflict in the Middle East we are debating today.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same newspaper I read that the United States Congress is preparing to impose sanctions on Syria. Sanctions will certainly not help to improve the situation. That is not the way to put an end to conflicts. Two days ago, Mr Naser Yusuf, the nominee for Minister of Internal Affairs in Mr Abu Ala’s new government, refused to swear allegiance to Yasser Arafat.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Ariel Sharon acted in the same vein recently too. He declared he was ready to attack enemy targets wherever they might be. This is a threat. It imperils the very stability of the area as described by Mr Solana. Such a threat to the stability of the region will inevitably result in counter threats. In yesterday’s <span class="italic">Frankfurter Allgemeine</span> Syria was reported as stating that it is of course prepared to defend itself against any aggression.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the situation is particularly difficult and extremely complex. The European Parliament is preparing its position on the basis of the report drawn up by Mr Menendez del Valle.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to focus on the first part of the report. In it, the Road Map is presented as the only possible solution to the current conflict. In this part of the report too, particular emphasis is placed on education for peace. Careful consideration should be given to the latter. There is some doubt as to whether education for peace really does exist amongst the Palestinian and Israeli people, or whether what actually exists is education for hatred. There is nothing to be gained from the latter. I believe this matter deserves attention.</p>
<p class="contents">Discussion of what should happen following implementation of the Road Map and the ensuing peace conference is best left until the time comes. I believe it is too early to discuss issues such as Jerusalem, Israel’s withdrawal to the 1967 borders and refugees. There are other more urgent matters to deal with just now. In this connection, I should like to say a few words about the security fence. The sections built beyond the 1967 borders amount to an act of aggression. The sections on the borders may prove to be a mistake. Nonetheless, if it is instrumental in preventing the death of even a single victim, the fence will not have been built in vain.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to refer to an article by Mr Samuel Hadas. He was the first Ambassador of the State of Israel to the Kingdom of Spain and also to the Vatican City State. In his article, Mr Hadas maintains that the Quartet’s Road Map for the Middle East is the only way forward. He also states, however, that currently the way forward seems to lead into a maze from which there appears to be no way out. Mr Hadas concludes by stating that there will be no magic solutions. In his view the United States is the only power able to assist, or in other words, to pressurise the parties to get the peace process back on track. As an aside, I must say that in my opinion it is actually for the Quartet to apply pressure to the parties. Mr Hadas further states that until the United States and the international community understand that in the present circumstances Israelis and Palestinians are not in a position to get the peace process back on track themselves, both parties will continue to teeter on the brink of the abyss. I am convinced that the onus is on the international community and especially on the Quartet. I believe Parliament must support the Quartet and the European Union as they contribute to the Middle East peace process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have too much love and respect, however, for my group’s chairman, Mr Wurtz, who has asked me to speak, and for my colleagues, but, most of all, a symbolic gesture might not work here and so I will have to use words. I must say, Mr Solana, that I feel frustrated, embittered and, above all, highly indignant. Indignation is a political concept, not a state of mind, and I am indignant because, every day, I feel caught up in a spider’s web in which the law, justice, freedom and the truth suffocate and die every day: they perish in the Dance of Death performed by the Sharon government, Hamas and Islamic Jihad. On the one hand – and it is not trite or futile to repeat this – there is an army that is militarily occupying a country; on the other, there is international law, which is constantly being flouted and which we now repeat like a litany. International law should be obeyed, but not a single resolution is being obeyed.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no hesitation in considering Hamas and Jihad to be enemies, even though, as I am non-violent, I have eliminated the concept of enemy. It is clearly criminal to send young people to kill themselves and others; those who do so are responsible for these deaths and I consider it a crime, but please let us also break out of this inertia, this diplomacy that causes more deaths every day and contributes to this crime. I feel responsible, together with you, all of you, for what is happening in that country, because it is not enough just to call for compliance with international law. Of course, it is a good thing to go there, and I, too, thank Mr Solana and I thank Mr Moratinos very much, although I have to say that, at the time of the Quartet, Marc Otte was, in fact, absent because of Ariel Sharon’s blackmail at the most sensitive moment when they were resuming talks on the Roadmap. We were not there at that moment, because we rightly recognised that Ariel Sharon had been legitimately elected. Yasser Arafat, too, was legitimately elected, and he cannot be accused of representing everything that is evil. He is not my leader – I am an autonomous, free-minded independent – but it must be admitted that Yasser Arafat has been a prisoner for the last three years, and that is no minor matter. Yasser Arafat has been a prisoner for the last three years and he certainly cannot be in military control of the Jenin area, where there are Israeli tanks, bulldozers and soldiers. He cannot. He can do what the government under Abu Mazen and now Abu Ala has been trying to do: to come to a political agreement with all the forces, including Hamas and Jihad, the moderate wing, let us say the wing that accepts peace or accepts a total cease-fire. Every time, however – it is not just a trivial thing to say: it really is true, and that is how it is – every time, some leaders get killed. This is of no small importance, and I am very grateful to Mr Poettering and I would not like him to feel embarrassed because the left likes him so much today or because I usually respond to problems in a cross-party way. I thought Mr Poettering’s speech was marvellous, to the point and perfect, even on the subject of the wall. Commissioner Monti, I think you should go and see the wall. As Mr Poettering said, the wall separates, destroys and kills freedom and the chance to communicate. That is not the state that people want to create for Palestinians and Israelis: we want a state in which Palestinians and Moslems communicate together. That wall is an obscenity, it is clear to everyone, I have seen it, I went to see it last Saturday. In Adudis, it cuts the whole village in half. An article in the Israeli newspaper, <span class="italic">Haaretz</span>, by Gideon Levi, who is an amazing journalist, tells of how, in order to cross the road, children have to squeeze through the gaps in the concrete: their thin bodies get through but their schoolbags do not and they throw them over to the other side. It is an obscenity that must be stopped.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, I am convinced that there are many things that can be done; I am also convinced that Parliament must take itself more seriously when it drafts and adopts resolutions. I am tired of writing resolutions and building bridges: the resolutions need to be enforced. We have been saying since time immemorial that we need to set up an arms embargo and that we need to verify the applicability of the association agreement; most importantly, we have decided on a high-level delegation (I have nearly finished) from Parliament. I believe we should do this; we should keep following the Roadmap, and there is a hope … I am sorry, Mr Cox; I am sorry, everyone; I have not written out my speech and so I have lost track of time, but I should like to say one more thing. There is a great hope in Palestine and in Israel: it is those thousands of Palestinians who endure every day and who do not agree with the bombs and the attacks, and those hundreds and thousands of Israelis who are fantastic, like the two pilots last week who were ordered to bomb Nablus and refused. They were over Nablus; the young men felt for the people and turned back; obviously they were suspended from duty. This is extremely important: it shows that a sense of humanity is growing, and we must make it grow within ourselves, in others and among Palestinians and Israelis.</p>

That would be my first point.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, listening to Mr Solana’s speech brought on feelings of despair, weariness, anger and a sense of powerlessness. If I may continue in the same vein as Mr Poettering, I believe that we in this Parliament should have the moral strength to question the assumption underlying the route map, which, as Mr Solana said, reflects the idea of gradual progress towards peace. That was the idea at Oslo and the idea that has been nurtured up to now. I do not believe, however, that this gradual approach is working any more. Is there any political alternative we can propose to this gradual approach?</p>
<p class="contents">Ami Ayalon and Sari Nusseibeh, respectively the former head of Israel’s security services and president of a Palestinian university, argued that we must state where we want to go, and create a political shock on that basis. If we were to take up their idea, what could the European Union propose by way of a political shock? Here is my suggestion. The European Union, by which I mean all the European states with a voice on the Security Council, shall propose a solemn vote in the UN General Assembly on the Palestinian state, modelled on the idea of creating the Israeli state. The motion shall be that the Palestinian state shall receive the same rights and responsibilities as the Israeli state.</p>
<p class="contents">After this motion has been approved, the European Union shall propose, through its representatives on the Security Council, that a UN military force be sent to keep the peace between the Israeli and Palestinian states. Firstly, the Security Council shall accept the European proposal for the immediate disarmament of all military forces in Palestine other than those of the Palestinian state. Secondly, the map of that state shall be redrawn along its 1967 borders. The Security Council shall then give both the Israeli state and the Palestinian state two, three or four months to disarm and to withdraw from Palestinian territory all colonists living outside Israel’s 1967 borders. Thirdly, the Security Council shall decide that any alterations to those borders should be negotiated and accepted by both sides. After a given deadline, the international community shall take responsibility for compelling any colonists who are not on the right side of the border to leave and for disarming any Palestinian terrorist groups who have not been disarmed by the Palestinian National Authority. Finally, the UN shall decide that Palestinian refugees shall be permitted to return only to Palestine, and Israeli – by which I mean Jewish – refugees only to Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">What I am proposing, then, is that we administer a real political shock. If we do not do so, we will always remain in the same impasse, endowed with extraordinary moral strength, but powerless. Once and for all, we must seize an initiative which will have very harsh political and military consequences for us, but which is our only chance of helping the Palestinians and Israelis.</p>

Who, too, will dare to give a real warning to the other countries that are stirring up conflict between Palestine and Israel, headed by Syria and Iran? Instead of supporting Israel in this, prominent EU Member States are falling headlong upon the Jewish state. Not to mention European expressions of support to Syria, which, let it be noted, whilst being a member of the UN Security Council, has for years functioned as a training camp and base for Lebanese and Palestinian terrorist networks! Is the European Union really going to enter into an association agreement with Syria, as Commissioner Patten very recently proposed in this House?

Very often, especially on the Israeli-Palestinian question, people see the problems on one side but often forget about those on the other. They forget, for instance, that the Palestinian constitution denies the existence of Israel; they forget that Palestinian school books teach that Israel does not exist and that its people do not exist and never have existed; they forget that, in 1999 or 2000, the Camp David initiative failed because of Yasser Arafat’s clumsiness at negotiating and accepting a compromise that might, perhaps, have resulted in a very different situation from the one we have today; they also forget everything about which we are quite rightly indignant, because we demand a lot from Israel, a democratic people, and we are also entitled to demand a lot from peoples that are not democratic but, we hope, will become so. Clearly, however, we can only conclude that what is happening is a response to attacks that society would normally be unable to tolerate but which have, however, become the daily bread of Israeli society.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Europe is failing in its duty; it is unable to do its job despite the efforts of our High Representative, despite the efforts made in the Quartet. There is no doubt that Europe is stepping back, and, very often, this can be positive in hindsight, as has been the case over the last six months, when the Roadmap has not, I think, been altogether unanimously accepted by many European governments, which may have wanted to split the front so as not to accept the US line. Therefore, I believe that, if all this is true, we Europeans should also examine our consciences. If our outlook were more balanced, more pragmatic and more objective, we would not be seen by one of the sides involved as being of little consequence in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would be appropriate for condolences to be sent to the victims in Haifa. I would also ask for our condolences to be sent to the family of Jose Manuel Bernal Gomez, the Spanish official accredited in Baghdad. All terrorism is reprehensible, regardless of its origin.</p>
<p class="contents">This week the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy adopted the report on the Middle East drawn up by Mr Menendez del Valle. I should like to say here and now, in advance of the vote at the next part-session, how much I welcome the effort made by all the political groups to agree on compromise amendments. If these are not changed in plenary, they will enable the text to be adopted with a substantial majority.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not sure how much bearing the document will have on the situation, though I am sure it will be less than we hope for. Nonetheless, I am quite sure European Parliament resolutions that do not enjoy the support of a substantial majority are meaningless.</p>
<p class="contents">Be that as it may, I would like to point out that the willingness of all the parliamentary groups to reach an agreement underlines the critical nature of the situation. Everyone has lost out during the three years of the Intifada. The only winners have been the extremists and they have taken the debate onto their own violent ground.</p>
<p class="contents">We certainly all agree that the quality of life of both Palestinians and Israelis is now worse than it was three years ago. Regardless of the method of comparison used, it is clear that both groups have lost out as regards social welfare, freedom and security.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, it is simplistic and therefore useless to attempt to apportion blame to individuals on one or other side. I believe all those involved share the blame for the present situation. I agree with Mrs Morgantini on this. Obviously, we each have different views and sensitivities regarding the conflict. I am sure, however, that we all agree on our dislike of walls such as the so-called security wall.</p>
<p class="contents">Undoubtedly, the Israeli Government does have a duty to defend its citizens against terrorism, but this is not the best way to do so. I believe we are all of one mind as regards condemnation of targeted killings. We are all alarmed too at the danger of the conflict spreading to neighbouring countries. Further, I believe we all agree that we would like to see in place a Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority who would be willing and able to act against terrorist organisations and put an end to them. Control of the security forces is required, obviously. Mr Abu Mazen was unsuccessful in this regard. We are as yet unsure how the government being formed by Mr Abu Ala will fare. His track record has earned him the support of the House.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask honourable Members to take a moment to reflect on how they might be feeling if during the last three years terrorist attacks had become almost weekly events in their countries, and if these attacks had caused nearly 500 civilian victims. I therefore believe we must continue to back the Quartet. There is currently no alternative to the Road Map, and the European Union’s foreign policy needs to be supported. We must believe in ourselves. We would all prefer the Union’s foreign policy to have more resources at its disposal and enjoy greater visibility. We would also like it to be able to call on a joint diplomatic service. Nonetheless, the Union’s foreign policy does sometimes have more influence than we might think. This is particularly so in the case of the Middle East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should first like to thank him for doing so. I should also like to thank Commissioner Monti for his kind words. I broadly endorse Mr Poettering’s remarks also. They provide an indication of the degree of consensus reached.</p>
<p class="contents">The title of the report I have been privileged to draft refers to peace and dignity in the Middle East. I chose these two words deliberately, because I think they provide a clear indication of how things stand and what we need to aim at.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights Common Security and Defence Policy adopted this report by a broad majority. I am therefore now in a position to have the pleasure of speaking on this text on behalf of the committee, not just as a socialist.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth mentioning that the report does enshrine a broad consensus on a number of key issues. This consensus was referred to earlier in the House. Given the short time at my disposal, I shall only refer to a few of the relevant issues. For instance, we all hope the Road Map will remain in force. We are all united in calling on both parties to keep it alive.</p>
<p class="contents">We are of course united too in our condemnation of terrorism. Nonetheless, we are adamant that the peace process must not be blocked or put in abeyance because of terrorism. The terrorists would actually see this as a success. We call on the Quartet and on the parties concerned to declare the city of Jerusalem a cultural and religious heritage of mankind. We also call for Jerusalem to become a dual capital, at once the capital of the State of Israel and of the future Palestinian State. We hope this will come about at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, we call for an international presence in the area. We believe that an international force should be dispatched there when the time is right and subject to the consent of both parties. We do of course believe that the State of Israel has the right to defend its citizens and its security. This right must, however, be tempered by the rule of law. The rights of Palestinian citizens must also be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, we invite the Palestinian side to reorganise its security forces and make tangible visible efforts to dismantle terrorist organisations. On the other, we call on the Israeli side to withdraw its army from the autonomous territories. We also call on Israel to put an end to targeted killings, and freeze all settlement activity and the building of the security wall. Many pertinent comments on the latter have been made in the House already.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to refer to an amendment supported by the rapporteur. This is an amendment designed to deal with a hypothetical situation in which the Road Map was blocked. Of course, we hope this will not happen, as it would have drastic consequences and lead to still greater suffering for Israelis and Palestinians. Nonetheless, alternatives need to be in place, notably the establishment of an international mandate in Palestine under the authority of the Quartet. This would include an international force on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should like to conclude on a strictly personal note. The acts of war perpetrated by Israel against Syria last Sunday are a violation of international law and fly in the face of political reason. It is my earnest desire that they do not lead to something even worse.</p>

It is with much regret that we have to observe that the large amount of sympathy always enjoyed by Israel in Europe has sustained significant damage over the last year. That is something that can be inferred from today’s debate in this House, and it can be observed by keeping an eye on the European media and by listening to the announcements by the European governments, parliaments and political parties, including too the very clear European rejection of the decision by Israel’s Security Cabinet to remove Yasser Arafat from the Palestinian territories.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way, we must condemn the Israeli attack on Syria, an action that contravenes international law. Nor does the fact that the United States is now considering sanctions against Syria contribute to a solution to the Middle East conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest trend is, naturally enough, reflected here in the European Parliament and thus in the report that we have just heard discussed and that has been adopted by a large majority of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. This contains probably the toughest criticism of Israel we have seen here in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Israeli Government must withdraw its military forces from the occupied territories and bring them home. It must put a stop to the executions, and it must suspend all activities surrounding the settlements and the construction of the shameful so-called Security Wall. I should like to thank Mr Poettering for his very clear remarks about that wall.</p>
<p class="contents">The Palestinian authorities must secure clear and firm support for the new government’s efforts to reorganise the security forces. They must restore public order. They must clearly demonstrate that they are taking practical and visible steps to combat the terrorist movements, they must implement the reforms already proposed and they must organise, where possible, free, fair and open elections.</p>
<p class="contents">We no doubt all share the High Representative’s frustrations, but we must keep to the Quartet’s road map for peace in the Middle East. We must reach a definitive peace agreement between two equal, democratic and sovereign states that live peacefully together behind secure and recognised borders on the basis of UN Resolution 242 of 22 November 1967. Israel and Palestine cannot resolve the conflict without help from outside, and the international community must continue to put pressure on both parties. It may also be necessary to send an international intervention and observation force to the region, a force that the Quartet must assemble, that, under the auspices of the UN, would monitor developments and that, subsequently, could guarantee that the final peace agreement was being observed by the parties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is indeed an abomination in economic and human terms, but it is also a real provocation in political terms. It brands all the inhabitants of Palestine as terrorists, which is scandalous. The wall will not protect Israeli society from the violence and barbarism of suicide bombings against civilians. The building of this wall makes the destruction of the Palestinian state possible, security for either of the two peoples unlikely, and also dashes any hope of peace in the Middle East. By attempting to use the attack on Syria to exact revenge for the Haifa bombing, in contravention of all international law, Sharon has assumed responsibility for putting the whole region to fire and the sword.</p>
<p class="contents">This killing frenzy will abate only if force is used. The European Union has the means to intervene, if it chooses to do so. The Council must, therefore, suspend the association agreement while the occupation lasts. The European Union can also demand that this illegal wall be destroyed, in accordance with the famous Roadmap. The European Union must prevent the threats against President Arafat from being carried out. Unfortunately, however, it will not do so without a mass demonstration of solidarity on the part of the people of Europe, appalled by the humiliation, destitution and despair of the Palestinians. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Queiró (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, we are still seeing positions being taken on the conflict in the Middle East which either favour Israel against Palestine or censure the Israelis to the benefit of the Palestinians. There are probably arguments in favour of both sides. The inalienable right of innocent Israeli communities to defend themselves and the natural desire of Palestinians freely to determine their own future are, of course, among those arguments. What is beyond all doubt is that there is no argument to justify the terrorist tactics embraced by both peoples in the region. Our group believes that any remaining hope of peace between Israelis and Palestinians still lies in the road map. This initiative, which involves not only the belligerents but also the United States, Russia, the United Nations and the European Union, must be improved, but cannot be abandoned. Its objectives remain valid, aiming as they do to resolve the conflict by 2005, putting an end to the violence and terrorism and allowing a future Palestinian state to exist peacefully alongside Israel. That coexistence requires effective democracy based on tolerance and freedom; we must recognise that such democracy is not yet in place.</p>
<p class="contents">It is absolutely crucial to begin moving forward again following the logic of give-and-take, expecting each party to honour its commitments at every stage. We cannot accept matters as they stand at present. There have been few, precious few positive steps, and those that have been taken have been answered with violence. If the conditions for producing solid ties of mutual trust cannot be created, we will not only witness the deaths of more innocent civilians but also, some day soon, the day when hope itself dies.</p>
<p class="contents">The <span class="italic">status quo</span>, therefore, is unacceptable. In consequence, the European Union must, in partnership with other interested parties, increase the pressure to make the resumption of the peace process possible and enduring. Unlike some of the honourable Members who have spoken here, our group doubts very much indeed that the solution is to send a military force made up of armed units from a coalition of countries to intervene in the area. Of course, we do not accept the construction of a wall separating the two countries. What seems unacceptable is attempting to replace that wall with a human barricade, even if it is well armed, organised and authorised by the international community. Besides, this would be a traditional military response which would not resolve the current situation, typical of urban guerrilla warfare. We feel that the full force of European diplomatic pressure should be thrown behind the drive to make it clear to the Palestinian authorities that the despicable suicide attacks against the Israeli civilian population must cease forthwith and for good. On the other hand, it is also crucial to ensure that the response of the democratic Israeli Government is restrained, and also to warn neighbouring countries in the region to refrain from harbouring terrorist groups in whose bases criminal activities are sustained and undertaken.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have reiterated on many occasions, there is no such thing as good terrorism, just as there is no such thing as bad terrorism. Furthermore, no type of terrorism is ever justified. Or justifiable. We cannot tolerate any argument for resorting to it, otherwise we recognise its ends as legitimate. Wherever terrorism lurks, wherever it rears its head, whatever form it takes, the European Union must not shrink from fighting it. That is because we are fully convinced that the resolution of the conflict in the Middle East would deprive international terrorism of a powerful ideological prop. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The responsibility that Israel must assume was expressed in the demands made of Israel that we find in Mr Menéndez del Valle’s report, and I am able fully to endorse these. I could, however, do with learning, in this House today, what the EU quite specifically intends to do to force Israel to comply with all these requirements and to force it, for example, also to put a stop to its state terrorism that has, of course, led to the deaths of very many more Palestinians than of Israelis. That is because, as long as we, here in the EU, do not force Israel to comply with these conditions, Abu Allah does not have an earthly chance of stopping the Palestinian suicide bombers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For, while it is true that there can be no peace without security, there can be no peace without justice either. In the light of this thought, then, what is the fundamental problem? It is knowing whether or not Israel, which has, in the course of the conflicts, come to occupy 72% of the former British Mandate over Palestine, is prepared to hand over the remaining 28% to the Palestinian people, in order for a free and sovereign state to be founded there. Is Israel prepared, after thirty-five years of military occupation, to evacuate these territories and cede power back to the Palestinian Authority?</p>
<p class="contents">If the answer is in the negative – and one is reluctantly forced to admit that nothing hitherto could induce one to think that it might be anything else – then the violence will continue: violence in retaliation, retaliation through violence, colonisation through wall-building. New wars will be waged in defence of the principle of retaliation. We believe that both Israel and Palestine have a right to security within recognised, respected borders, but it is no good weeping over the number of victims if we cannot propose a political solution. One might disagree with Mr Cohn-Bendit’s suggestions – I certainly do – but his plan at least has the virtue of existing. Let us clearly state where we want to go.

We in the European Community must consider what contribution we can make to ensuring that, in the long term, peace is restored to this tormented territory. The question is this: What contribution can the European Community make? Indeed, is the European Community powerful enough to make an effective contribution here? The European Community is certainly powerful in the economic field, and its economic contribution to stabilising this territory in the past undoubtedly outstrips the contribution made by others in the same way.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet on the other hand, when it comes to taking final decisions and to providing final guarantees to one side or the other that its people can live in peace and security in this territory in the long term, the European Community in its present state is obviously still too weak to make this vital contribution. That is why I too have a question for the High Representative, who is working with great commitment in this region: What role does this territory play in the European Union’s security strategy, which is currently being drafted? I am aware, Mr Solana, that your staff are working very intensively on this security strategy. This security strategy also involves the circle of friends with which the European Community is surrounding itself, and so my question is this: how much priority will be given to this particular conflict within that framework, and in developing this circle of friends, will the dreadful conflict which we are discussing here today be given adequate priority? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is now more than 1000 days into the Intifada and 3000 people have lost their lives. It is time for the killing to stop. Terrorism is inexcusable and the Palestinians' legitimate national aspirations cannot be achieved through violence. European and worldwide support for their cause is weakened with every suicide bombing.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, Israel must meet her obligations by freezing settlement activity, restoring Palestinian freedom of movement, ending targeted assassinations and ensuring that the security fence does not encroach on Palestinian land. In this European Parliament, more than anywhere else, we understand the prospect for generation after generation of division and fear which this new Berlin wall represents.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly support Mr Solana's reiteration this morning that the fight against terrorism must take place within international law. I call on him to press the undoubted case that Israel's treatment of the Palestinians in the occupied territories is illegal under the fourth Geneva Convention. I welcome the agreement reached by EU foreign ministers to freeze the assets of Hamas, but regret their delay in coming to this decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I am proud that the EU's single biggest external aid programme is its contribution to the Palestinian authority.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, however, I spoke to friends and colleagues in the NGO UNA International Service, which is active in the region. They tell me that all EU-funded development projects have had to be halted because of the emergency in the Middle East. The UK's department for international development is on record as saying that development there is dependent on the relaxation of Israeli curfews, closures and checkpoints, and eventual withdrawal.</p>
<p class="contents">We should roundly condemn the fact that Israeli defence force attacks since 2001 have effectively destroyed EUR 25 million of EU development projects. I do not believe those who accuse the EU of unconsciously subsidising the occupation, but Israel should be forced to pay more than one piece of compensation to the European Union for this unjustified destruction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When we were unable to prevent the United States’ war in Iraq, or, worse, when we supported it, as most European governments did, we knew of the heightened security risks we were causing in that region, just as we also knew that the next stop after Baghdad might be Damascus. One has only to listen to the language of US and Israeli leaders, the criticisms they have directed at the Syrian regime over the last few months: support for Iraq’s Ba’athist leaders, possession of weapons of mass destruction, chemical weapons programmes, harbouring terrorists. These are the same fallacious arguments which had already served as a pretext for the US occupation of Iraq. They are now being mobilised again against the leaders of Syria. The US Congress draws up a pre-emptive embargo against Syria, and then, hey presto! Israel begins pre-emptive strikes on Syrian territory.</p>
<p class="contents">All the speakers here have condemned the Haifa bombings, and I, of course join them in so doing. I would rather not have waited until Mr Barón Crespo’s speech, however, to hear express condemnation of Israel’s violation of Syria’s territorial sovereignty. In the same way, I would also like to have heard some reminder of how difficult it is to speak of European foreign policy at a time when certain European countries are involved in the military occupation of Iraq. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is undeniable that between President Assad, who is sticking to a rigid political stance and whose duty it is, therefore, to react strongly to the serious provocation represented by an attack on Syrian soil, and Prime Minister Sharon who, 13 months away from the US elections, can feel that he has a particularly free rein, there are elements that could further inflame tensions and result in the entire region becoming engulfed. What we are seeing at the moment, however, is the modest and slow nature of the initial reaction from Damascus, which has undeniably brought the global weakness of Syria’s current position to the fore. The little success it has had in submitting its case to the Security Council has shown its isolation at international level, which adds to its relative regional isolation since the war in Iraq and its military weakness since Damascus has stopped receiving supplies of sophisticated weapons sold on credit. With military decoupling from Israel increasing greatly, it is difficult to imagine Syria taking the risk of military escalation in the Golan Heights. The Republic of Syria will, therefore, no doubt do so on the Blue Line with the intervention of the Shiite Hezbollah.</p>
<p class="contents">This indirect response is not without risk. In this sensitive phase European diplomacy could, therefore, play a useful mediating role alongside the two players to help prevent the spiral of another regional escalation from being set in motion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this way, the Palestinian Prime Minister has provided absolutely the best grounds for pessimism to all those who do not think there is a future for the Middle East and all those who do not believe there can be peace there.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Solana, I want you to broach this subject with the Palestinian Prime Minister. Among the necessary preconditions for peace in the Middle East are that the Palestinian terrorist groups should be disarmed and that their terrorist activities should not continue. If the Palestinian Government neither wishes, nor is effectively able, to do anything about terrorist groups in the Middle East, Israel will do something about them.</p>
<p class="contents">Approximately a week ago, 19 people died in a suicide attack in Haifa. In a democratic country such as Israel, which is a sign to the rest of the world that democracy exists in the Middle East, every such suicide attack carried out by a terrorist group will make Israeli opinion less willing to compromise with the Palestinian Authority and less well disposed towards handing land over to the Palestinians.</p>
<p class="contents">No country, including Israel, is obliged in the long term to accept as neighbours either countries that make land available to terrorists who carry out attacks or countries that fail to intervene against such movements in their territories. The Palestinian Prime Minister’s, Ahmad Quray’s, impotence in the face of terrorism is perhaps in itself entirely understandable. It is difficult to get at armed groups of that size. He must nonetheless indicate, politically and in terms of the action he takes, that that is his ambition. Nor has the President of the Palestinian Authority, Yasser Arafat, dared to intervene vigorously against the terrorist groups, in spite of the fact that Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other terrorist groups are indirectly and deliberately sabotaging the peace process with its associated two-state solution, of which the Palestinian Government officially professes itself an adherent.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to sum up before I move on to another area. The Palestinian Prime Minister must clearly let it be known, in words and action, that there can be no room for terrorist activity in a future two-state solution, least of all in the territory of the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p class="contents">The second matter I intended to address concerns the way in which religion is misused. This has to do with relations between the West and the Islam-dominated world. I find it depressing that Muslim religious leaders do not explain much more clearly that suicide attacks cannot be compatible with a religion of love, reconciliation and goodness. Religion must stand for love and shared humanity. It must stand for reconciliation and for the good, and not for the deaths of innocent people, as in the case of the suicide bombing in Haifa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is for sure, in all events, is that a lot of work is needed in order for the sun to revolve.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the Middle East crisis is escalating. Crises which we thought were over are returning to both Lebanon and Syria, unfortunately on the responsibility of the very person who today is the prime minister of Israel. In all events, terrorism of any form is unacceptable and condemnable. However, it cannot be used as a pretext for new escalations. I should underline here the clear positions taken by Commissioner Monti and the very rare unanimity among the speakers.</p>
<p class="contents">The picture is clear. The European Union must take decisive initiatives in order to prevent any danger of expansion and must propose specific solutions and ways of applying them. It must intervene decisively and with the force of a third agent. The role of umpire between the Israelis and the Palestinians is not enough. The role of umpire leads to neutrality and neutrality in crises is not the best option. We are not historical journalists. We are politicians. Now we must decide. Now the road map, the Rabin/Arafat agreements must acquire substance through application, even with the presence of UN forces.

This is because a wall, Mr President, can be rebuilt, but a life cannot, and I agree with Mrs Morgantini when she says that it is not enough to call for international law to be respected. Does international law allow a State to protect terrorist cells that are going to attack the civil population of another State? I ask you that. I agree with her when she says that it is our duty to intervene and I share her indignation that we cannot be happy with moral stances, as we so often are, stances that ease our consciences, but, ladies and gentlemen, a clear conscience is the opposite of real conscience. Yes, Mr Cohn-Bendit, we need a political shock!</p>
<p class="contents">Nor can I let it be said that this wall is the same as the Berlin wall, as I heard mentioned just now. I personally am against this wall, because I am against the line that it follows. A wall dividing one nation in two and a wall that aims to create a border, even if the border is completely open to argument, cannot, however, be considered to be the same thing. I would like to add that I was one of those that signed a petition against the line the wall follows, in particular at Abu Dis.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone is calling for a return to the 1967 borders and I am surprised to note that today there are passionate calls for what, yesterday, was rejected just as passionately. This is because, in the end, what the more moderate amongst us are asking for today, is nothing more than a return to the Clinton parameters, the parameters that were recently rejected altogether.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Monti quite rightly said that Hamas and Islamic Jihad do not recognise Israel’s right to exist, as the suicide attacks have shown. We are deeply embroiled in the matter and there is in actual fact not just one conflict; there are four. There is a war being waged by the Palestinian authority for the legitimate liberation of the Palestinian state and we are supporting it. There is war being waged by the Israeli State for its safety. We are supporting this too. There is also, and this has to be said, a type of colonial war being waged by some Israelis and there is, and we really cannot overlook this one, a war to destroy the Israeli State being waged by some Palestinian factions. If we are not aware of these four conflicts then we cannot understand what is happening. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What did those of our parents who lived in occupied countries 60 years ago do? They put up resistance.</p>
<p class="contents">When I saw the Berlin Wall in 1961, it was the first such wall I had ever seen. Now, Israel is building a wall of shame. Saddam Hussein was toppled because he was suspected of having weapons of mass destruction. We know that Israel has weapons of mass destruction. The South Africa of apartheid fell because racist oppression was being practised in the country. We know that Israel is built entirely upon racist oppression. The military junta in Chile fell partly because politicians were being murdered. We know that Israel has politicians murdered the whole time.</p>
<p class="contents">East Germany, Saddam Hussein, apartheid and the Chilean junta are gone, but Sharon’s regime of oppression remains. What are we doing? What is the EU doing? We are not doing a lot. We are not even applying the Association Agreement. We are not even breaking off trade relations. Why cannot we send our fantastic peace troops to Palestine in order to protect the Palestinian people?</p>
<p class="contents">Israel will not continue to exist if the present development continues. The Middle East is often compared with the Crusader empires that lasted for 200 years. A quarter of that period has elapsed. It is possible that Israel will continue to exist for 100 years with the help of US money and weapons and the EU’s passivity; but, if no one intervenes, our grandchildren will perhaps witness the destruction of Israel.

In that short time, I shall do my best to respond to some of the main issues raised during this morning’s sitting. I shall also endeavour to restate once again the position we are endeavouring to defend on behalf of the European Union regarding this dramatic conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make some things quite clear from the start. Having listened to those Members of the House who took the floor, it seems that essentially we all agree that the present situation is extremely serious. The gravity of the situation cannot be underestimated. It is becoming increasingly difficult. Consequently, it is incumbent on us to pull together and redouble our efforts on behalf of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The high degree of consensus between the various honourable Members who spoke this morning is worthy of mention. It should be noted that almost without exception they all endorsed the Road Map as the best instrument for attaining the desired objective. That objective involves making it possible for a State of Israel and a Palestinian State to coexist in peace and prosperity within a reasonable period of time. The Road Map stipulates a short time period. I believe the aforementioned objective is our shared objective.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is also fair to say there is a significant degree of consensus across the House that recent events may lead to an escalation of tension in the region. This could be the case in either Syria or Lebanon. All this when we are striving to bring the temperature in the region down rather than allowing it to rise.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, I feel all or most honourable Members would agree that the United States might possibly become less engaged, and that this could have a negative effect on the situation. Mr Poettering made it quite clear that the forthcoming election campaign in the United States is likely to result in the United States becoming disengaged, if I may resort to an English term. Every effort must be made to pre-empt this. On the contrary, it is imperative for the United States to remain committed to the process. The European Union will certainly maintain its commitment. The Union cannot become a mere observer of a deteriorating process, nor can it simply become a sleeping partner in a process sliding down an increasingly slippery and difficult slope.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Poettering also referred to Iraq. I should like to follow up on this. I have visited all the countries in the region, and it has become clear to me that the issue of Iraq has a bearing on the Palestinian problem. I would venture to suggest that if discussions were held with any Arab political leader at the present juncture, that leader would speak of a process deemed by the Arab world to be a Western campaign against Arabs. Great care is needed to ensure that Arab political leaders do not perceive this process as a move against the Islamic world. They must not see it as an attack by the Western world on the Arab world. It is therefore important to reiterate time and again that this is not a fight against particular civilisations or religions. Rather, we are engaged in a struggle to defend the values of peace and stability in both areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cohn-Bendit rightly said that we are involved in what could be termed an incremental process. This so-called incremental process began with the Oslo process, and the Road Map is a further stage of it. Mr Cohn-Bendit suggested the solution might lie in electric shock treatment. Ladies and gentlemen, I am inclined to doubt that there is currently sufficient political energy in both parties and in the international community for strong electric shock treatment to be an option.</p>
<p class="contents">Only today we have witnessed another difficult and complicated debate in the United Nations Security Council. The purpose of the debate was to adopt a common stance regarding the situation in Syria. No agreement was reached. I am therefore of the opinion that there is currently insufficient energy to permit the application of electric shock treatment. It is perhaps incumbent on us Europeans to generate the energy required.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, a verification process is the first thing to set up. The Road Map will not implement itself. It will be well-nigh impossible to see the Road Map through without a verification process in place. It is therefore important to ensure that any verification mechanisms are such that they can be implemented immediately. This was also discussed at the New York meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to refer to the situation that is likely to arise this morning. A new Palestinian Government will probably be in place, led by Mr Abu Ala. This government is entitled to our support if it complies with our requests. We need to insist it wages a determined war on terrorism, and that it pursues its reforms. These are essential features of a State. We are doing all we can to ensure that a Palestinian State is established as soon as reasonably possible. One key feature of a State is that it should have a single financial system. The necessary effort in this direction has been made. The Finance Minister has brought this about. Another key feature is that the State should have control over arms. Prime Minister Abu Ala must therefore be urged to ensure his government takes all possible steps to control the security forces and allow only legitimate weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to urge the Israeli Government to improve living conditions for Palestinian citizens, and to call a halt to the building of the wall. I was moved by Mr Poettering’s emotional account of what a wall can mean to individuals who have experience of being kept apart by one. Israel must also be urged to tackle the matter of the settlements seriously. The latter is not something new in the Road Map. It featured in the Mitchell report several years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">I think I have outlined what I feel we can and should do here and now as Europeans to try and overcome the present crisis. In December we should be in a position to conduct a final review. It will then be possible to consider how best to go forward into the coming year, in full awareness of the parameters of the solution. I am confident that the latter are known to all. They are not very far removed from those mentioned by some honourable Members who took the floor in the House today.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to thank the House for its cooperation. We all need to keep our eyes wide open and our determination well alive. Only then will it be possible to control the situation that is unfortunately unfolding in a land so close to our hearts.</p>
<p class="contents">I was asked how the Middle East is to be dealt with within the security strategy. These people are our neighbours. Their land adjoins ours. The issue must therefore continue to one of our main concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving me the opportunity to address you. It will be my pleasure to communicate any further information to Parliament personally, as soon as we are in a position to do so.</p>

On the issue of a peace-keeping force – mentioned so eloquently by Mr Poettering and also, in a different context, by Mr Cohn-Bendit and others – we support anything that bears the prospect of hope. However, it is clear that both parties need to agree. Unfortunately, we do not see this happening for a number of reasons: the Israelis mistrust of international involvement, the impossibility of separating parties as a result of settlements and the lack of a guarantee that the international force will not be drawn into conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Syria Association Agreement referred to by Mr Belder, the agreement will help draw Syria into a more constructive engagement and will give us an opportunity to discuss the issues of mutual concern. It is clear that all countries must actively comply with UN Security Council Resolution 1373. The Association Agreement will include a clause on cooperation against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue mentioned by Mrs Vachetta and others of the sanctions against Israel, I am afraid to say that economic sanctions have a rather bad track record of success. They simply do not work. What works is engagement and dialogue. The Association Agreement with Israel provides for exactly that. That political dialogue allows us to raise all issues of concern. We believe that suspending the agreement would deprive us of this opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Von Wogau referred to the ring of friends. Our policy is one of openness and inclusiveness This is not a political condition, but it is clear that the ongoing conflict will not allow our partners to reap the benefits of our new initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Howitt mentioned the situation of the EU programmes on the ground. Given the circumstances on the ground it has indeed become very difficult and rather costly to deliver our assistance, particularly as regards infrastructure projects and humanitarian aid. We are more successful in keeping our software projects going, particularly as far as institution-building and reform are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to express the Commission's appreciation for this highly interesting debate.</p>

As far as I am concerned, Palestine is not the Middle East. In French it is what we call the Near East. It seems that there is a Middle Eastern country that has completely disappeared from our radar screens; Iraq. I am not seeking to force a debate on Iraq, but personally I had prepared a speech on that country. I would simply like to ask a question which I feel is relevant to this House, which is so mindful of human rights: what exactly do we know today, in terms of international law, about the fate of the former head of the Iraqi diplomatic corps, Mr Tariq Aziz? This is an extremely relevant question, perhaps to be debated at our next meeting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has persisted in the military occupation, in destroying infrastructure, housing and other installations, in carrying out targeted killings, and in holding more than 7 000 Palestinian prisoners, almost 340 of whom are children, in Israeli jails. It has continued to violate the most fundamental rights of the Palestinian people on a regular basis, attacking Syria and conducting a campaign of genuine state terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with frustration and indignation, therefore, that one hears speeches by Members of this House demanding respect for the Rule of Law. How can one demand that President Arafat and the Palestinian Government take steps to combat acts of terrorism while the Israeli military is occupying Palestine?</p>

<p class="contents">Solana, as his master's voice, condemns the Palestinian resistance, while calling on Israel to show restraint and generosity.
