We are dealing with a sensitive issue here.</p>
<p class="contents">Doing away with an instrument such as maize intervention, as the Commission has proposed, is never easy. But in this case it is necessary and the evidence shows that we are faced with a structural problem with maize intervention. It is no longer a safety net but has become a real market outlet. In one Member State about one third of the harvest in 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 was offered to intervention. Farmers are producing directly for intervention. Is this normal at a time where market prices are at a normal level? EU maize intervention stocks doubled from 2003-2004 to 2004-2005 from 2.8 million tonnes to 5.6 million tonnes. If this growth continues, the European Union will have 15.6 million tonnes in its stocks by 2013. This is hardly a development the Commission wants to see at a time when the CAP reforms are doing away with stocks in other commodities.</p>
<p class="contents">The report suggests that the Commission’s proposal is inconsistent with the principle of legitimate expectations, is founded on incorrect market estimates and would have negative effects on cereal markets. I would like to explain why the Commission does not share these views, beginning with the legitimate expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">Farmers’ sowing decisions are based on a series of considerations and mainly the marketability of their crop. The Commission’s proposal does not interfere with the broad range of potential commercial outlets for maize. Market and income stability are not threatened in any way and the legitimate expectations of farmers are fully preserved.</p>
<p class="contents">On the economics of the proposal, I would stress that Commission’s estimates are based on long-term trends. Forecasts by independent research institutes support the Commission’s own analysis that maintaining the status quo is simply not sustainable. The lack of intervention offers during the ongoing campaign and the resale of intervention stocks in the internal market cannot be presented as conclusive evidence that the market has found a new balance. Indeed, this is far from the case and the economics of maize production indicate that with price levels back to normal maize will once again be offered massively to intervention in some Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission sees from this that there is a need to act. We cannot defend a simple status quo. It is not in the interests of the agricultural sector to insist on a scheme that so clearly has departed from its original objective. We wanted to act quickly and we proposed abolishing the scheme immediately, but we realise that this would create some difficulties. We are therefore prepared to discuss a phased reduction of the maize intervention scheme. This could be done over a period of two years and then we would have the opportunity to assess and discuss the future of the scheme in the context of the health check. Commissioner Fischer Boel is prepared to have such a discussion. But for the Parliament simply to refuse any considerations on altering the maize intervention scheme, as proposed by Mr Glattfelder, is not acceptable to the Commission. We therefore sincerely hope that the European Parliament will not support the recommendation to reject the Commission’s proposal and will instead engage in a debate on how to design a phased reduction of the unsustainable maize intervention scheme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first perspective is whether the proposal is justified, the second is whether it is lawful.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the first perspective is concerned, our task is fairly easy, for what we need to examine is whether the reasons offered in the submitted proposal are still valid today. Half a year ago, when the Commission submitted its proposal, it claimed that by now, by this day, there would be 9 million tonnes and by the end of this year 11 million tonnes of intervention corn. This has not turned out to be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">The intervention stocks currently comprise only 3 million tonnes, rather than 9 million, and at present the stocks are not increasing, there was no intervention offer in 2006, and there will not be any in 2009 either. The stocks are steadily decreasing, and by the end of the year intervention stocks may even reach zero, instead of 11 million tonnes.</p>
<p class="contents">The current prices are considerably higher than the intervention price. Contrary to the justification offered by the Commission, the market prospects for corn are good. It would be worth it for the Commission to read its own market forecasts. Last week DG Agriculture published an entirely new market forecast. According to this report, prices will continue to rise. Consumption in the EU is growing more rapidly than production. We should not base our present decisions on the flawed forecasts of half a year ago, but on these most recent predictions, which are supported by market trends.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me add that since 2004 sales of intervention stocks have in every case been at prices above the intervention price. The EU gets more money for corn than the amount for which it bought it. At the moment the price of corn in Hungary is around 130 euro, as compared to the intervention price of 101 euro. For the corn growers, however, in 2005 the buying up of the stock made it possible to avoid a loss of around 200 million euro. Sales of the produce that was bought up has in turn made it possible for livestock farmers, primarily in the Netherlands, Germany, Italy and Poland to purchase feed at prices well below those of the world market.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past four years, not only did European growers benefit from the intervention, but consumers did as well. The Commission began, however, to panic because during two years of record production, intervention stocks rose significantly. Now there is no longer any reason for panic. During years of lower production it was proven that stocks began to fall, and according to the latest forecasts made by the Commission, these stocks will continue in future to remain at a low level. It can be established, therefore, that the proposal, in the form in which the Commission submitted it, is no longer justified, and the original reasons for it have turned out to be false.</p>
<p class="contents">So let us look at whether the proposal is lawful. The proposal seeks to terminate intervention as from this year. The farmers already planted their corn back in April, the plants have sprouted and are now this big. Please, look at this: this is how big the corn is! I picked this corn here along the Rhine. I hope the grower will not be angry about this, for after all I am defending his interests and rights as well. Even the European Commission cannot order this corn back into the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, the growers had to prepare for sowing quite a while ago. In the autumn they set aside the field in which they would plant corn. They ordered the planting seed and plant protection products, and spent money on these things. During the year, any sort of restriction to the intervention system constitutes a retroactive regulation. This is a serious breach of legal security and of growers’ legitimate expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, which is so proud of its principles and its liberal rule of law, cannot allow this to happen. This proposal is not only contrary to our principles, but also to the Commission’s own earlier practice. In the course of earlier reforms – sugar reform, the abolition of the rye intervention – they allowed sufficient time for preparation. For instance, when the rye intervention was abolished, a year went by between the publication of the regulation and its implementation. Why do the corn growers not have a right to equal treatment? Are they not equal citizens of the European Union? If this can be done to the farmers, who will be next?</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Parliament does not protect citizens’ rights, how can it protect its own rights? For in this case this is what is needed. The Council in fact did not wait for the opinion of Parliament to be accepted. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development already decided last week to abolish the intervention with retroactive effect. They also decided that at the next Council of Ministers meeting, they would vote on this without debate.</p>
<p class="contents">No matter what decision we take, we can no longer influence the Council. Tomorrow we will not be deciding on the future of the common agricultural policy, but will debate this instead within the context of the ‘health check’. We will decide that we do not accept regulations with retroactive effect, and now we can afford to be honest, we can stick to our principles, which means that we must reject the Commission’s unlawful proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that if there is to be a change in policy it has to be phased in over a period, regardless of what policy it is, to allow for production to adapt to change.</p>
<p class="contents">When I became a Member of this Parliament – a number of years ago now – we had butter mountains, we had milk lakes, we had cold stores bursting at the seams with beef. And now to a large extent all this is behind us. We have come through many reforms of the common agricultural policy that have taken place over the years, from MacSharry to Agenda 2000 to the Mid-Term Review, and now – the Commissioner is not with us tonight and I know why – we await the proposals for the health check.</p>
<p class="contents">We are living in a world of changing markets and it can be very difficult to speculate upon what future prices may be at any particular time. You only have to look at the present world prices for milk to see the change that can occur in a very short period of time.</p>
<p class="contents">Intervention can be nothing but a short-term solution for farmers because in the long term they will achieve better returns from the market. I believe the new Member States must look in the long term to other solutions for maize, rather than simply for food. There is an alternative use where it can be put to even greater good for everyone. I believe the new Member States should investigate the alternatives and we should support them in this. In the long term they will be more rewarding than continuing in intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">There must be some degree of compromise in this particular area between the Commission, the Council and Parliament. I believe that the four compromise amendments recognising the problem of the new Member States represent the best way to move forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I agree with the Commission’s arguments on the need to reform the mechanism of intervention, but implementing the planned changes overnight may do more harm than good. Reforming the cereal market should be gradual, and the measures taken should solve the existing problem in a comprehensive manner. Farmers must be given enough time to prepare for the changes. Instead of suddenly excluding maize from the intervention scheme, one solution would be to maintain intervention until 2008, and then gradually reduce or phase out the maize intervention scheme by establishing maximum intervention limits for individual Member States depending on their production levels, as is currently the case with the rice market (such a solution would increase the transparency of the system and make it easier to control the market); and eventually to maintain the maize intervention scheme for a transitional period of two years, as long as control is tightened to avoid the accumulation of excessive surpluses.</p>
<p class="contents">These solutions would allow us to phase out maize intervention without suddenly upsetting the market, as it is not just an intervention scheme, but also an export support scheme from the free market in the form of export refunds. In this context we also need to modify our current export support instruments for cereals from the free market to enable the export of goods from countries with unfavourable locations such as Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary. The main market for EU cereal exports is North Africa and the Middle East, which means that for the countries mentioned any exported cereals require expensive sea transportation over a longer distance than cereals exported from ports in the west or the south of Europe. This solution would also increase the efficiency of cereal exports. This mechanism is also worth maintaining in the coming economic year.</p>
<p class="contents">Please do not regard my speech as an attempt to purely and solely express my solidarity with the wonderful Hungarian people (according to the famous Polish and Hungarian proverb ‘Poles and Hungarians are brothers, both in the sword and in the glass’, although in this case I would say ‘Poles and Hungarians are brothers, both in the sword and in cereal’, which in Hungarian would be <span class="italic">lengyel, magyar két jóbarát, együtt harcol s arat gabonát</span>), but rather as a means of logically phasing out the maize intervention scheme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The maize crop has already been planted, and we cannot change the conditions of maize intervention for farmers in the middle of the production cycle. The idea of excluding only maize from the regulation could have unintended repercussions on the entire cereal market. The demand for cereals, including maize, will increase with increased consumption of meat, as will their use for the developing biofuels industry which is extremely important for the future of this market.</p>

I join my Hungarian colleagues in opposing this radical restriction on intervention in the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst it is true that there is room for change, instead of throwing out the intervention scheme altogether we should provide opportunities for the EU cereals market to develop and be supported. Not so long ago, the Commission adopted very harsh criteria relating to maize intervention; perhaps we should wait and see how the results of these restrictions turn out. Furthermore, the Commission should take current market trends into account. There are EU Member States that have to import maize to meet their demand. For this reason we should first of all improve the fluidity and operation of this market within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission has to develop proper solutions requiring the effective removal of cereal surpluses from countries which are unfavourably located, and where transport costs are significantly higher. For example, we should support the export of cereals to third countries, and in particular those countries situated in a difficult location. If EU limits are placed on the purchase of maize, as our German colleagues and the Council propose in their amendments, it seems that the best solution would to share the limits among the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">În primul rând, eliminarea stocului de intervenţie la porumb reprezintă o schimbare din mers a politicii agricole comune. După un efort susţinut de transpunere şi adaptare la legislaţia europeană în agricultură, şi ţin să vă amintesc că este vorba de un corp de legi care însumează în jur de 20 de mii de pagini, agricultorii români au devenit participanţi la o politică instabilă şi care le înşeală aşteptările. Indiferent de calităţile politicii de intervenţie, dacă aceasta este o măsură bună sau nu, aceasta nu trebuie schimbată înainte de a avea o discuţie generală între toate instituţiile Uniunii şi statele membre. Această discuţie este prevăzută să aibă loc în cadrul controlului sănătăţii finanţelor europene din 2008-2009. De asemenea, o reformă cuprinzătoare a politicii agricole comune nu trebuie şi nu poate fi pusă în practică înainte de 2013. Cert este faptul că măsura propusă de Comisie creează efecte retroactive. La fel ca şi în Ungaria şi alte state membre, agricultorii români au semănat deja cultura de porumb şi este nedrept faţă de ei ca în cazul unor surplusuri neabsorbite de piaţă să nu beneficieze de plasa de siguranţă ce o reprezintă stocul de intervenţie.</p>
<p class="contents">Doamnelor şi domnilor, România a devenit după aderare al doilea producător din Uniune, cu o cotă estimată de 17 procente. Comisia a argumentat că sistemul intervenţiei este abuzat de fermierii din Uniune pentru care stocul de intervenţie a devenit un debuşeu comercial important, dar acest argument nu este universal valabil, nu se poate în nici un fel spune că planificarea agricultorilor români ar fi depins de un calcul prealabil privind vânzarea către intervenţie. Dacă vor apărea stocuri în România, acest lucru va reprezenta pur şi simplu şi va rezulta din mecanismele pieţei. De asemenea, vreau să accentuez faptul că susţin raportul domnului Glattfelder aşa cum este el. Amendamentele depuse la propunerea de regulament nu corectează neajunsurile documentului legislativ, întrucât orice limitare impusă posterior campaniei de semănare, indiferent de amploarea ei, este incorectă faţă de agricultori. Nu trebuie să neglijăm nici aspectele de ordin instituţional: acordul la care s-a ajuns în Consiliu nu respectă procedura de consultare a Parlamentului care se aplică în privinţa politicii agricole comune. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have listened very carefully to what they have said and should like to reply to some of the specific issues that were raised.</p>
<p class="contents">An important point concerns the question of whether legitimate expectations of growth were respected. The Commission is convinced that they were and that they are still. The maize-sowing season is in March and April. Farmers deciding to plant maize in the spring of 2007 are aware that there might not be any intervention for the 2007 harvest. In this regard, a communication to maize producers was published in the Official Journal in December 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">It was mentioned that we have not seen major offers of maize intervention in the current market year. This is true. However, the current high prices for cereals are not driven by the internal market but by the situation in the international market. The boom in the bioethanol industry, particularly in the USA, has also played a role in keeping cereal prices high. Situations change from one year to the next. It is possible that the 2007-2008 marketing year might be similar to the last two marketing years, with massive intervention offers.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue that was raised is that this proposal moves the problem from maize to other cereals. As I have explained, this proposal is aimed at solving the current maize problem. It is true that the removal of maize intervention could lead to a relative loss of competitiveness for barley and possibly soft wheat, triggering the risk of increasing public stocks for cereals. A full examination of the cereal intervention system is certainly necessary. This will be done in the framework of the health check.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the discussion has clarified some points, it has also confirmed that the fundamentals of the Commission’s proposals are right. As I made clear in my opening statement, the maize sector needs this proposal. The Commission is prepared to be flexible in finding options to provide operators with a soft landing but it cannot simply agree to maintain the status quo. As already stated, the Commission is also ready to accept a phasing-out over two years, as many have requested. If the Glattfelder report is adopted in its present form as a rejection of the Commission proposal, Mrs Fischer Boel will certainly go back to the College, but her position on this issue remains quite clear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is yet another example of the European Commission neglecting to consider in particular the interests of the new Member States. This measure is completely unlawful, since by December the growers had already bought the seeds for planting corn and signed their contracts, and can therefore no longer transform their production mechanisms. The proposal is all the stranger because not quite two months before it was made, the rules for purchasing corn under the intervention regime were changed, which suggests that the European Commission is flailing around without any particular ideas. The European Court of Justice will be starting hearings on this case in a matter of days, upon the submission made by the Hungarian Government.</p>
<p class="contents">Putting an end to the intervention system is unjustified, and is to the disadvantage of the entire Union, since according to prognoses, in a few years there may even be a shortage of corn with the EU. Our competitive position on an international scale will suffer if the abolition of the corn intervention now leads to a fall in prices. </p>
