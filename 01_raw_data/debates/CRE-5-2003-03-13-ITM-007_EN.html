<p class="contents">It has been noted that the military regime is continuing to prevent the parliament elected in 1990 and the parliamentary Committee created in 1998 which represents it from carrying out any democratic activity. It has been noted that, although no longer under house arrest, Aung San Suu Kyi is being subjected to pressure, threats and intimidation. It has been noted that the systematic use of torture, extrajudicial executions and forced labour is widespread in Burma.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, the requests are quite clear and direct. We call upon the Commission to bring the case of forced labour in Burma to the attention of the World Trade Organisation, pointing out that, in the Singapore Declaration, the WTO stated that the ILO is the competent body to deal with matters of respect for labour law. We also call upon the Council not to show any signs of openness towards the regime in Rangoon and to preserve and strengthen the Common Position, bringing all possible pressure to bear on the country, including pressure on foreign investments.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the very clear appeal that Parliament is making. We expect a response from the Commission. It is a pity that we cannot have a response from the Council, but the request is contained in the resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What fears it should inspire in the military junta currently in power, if this resolution determines the EU’s policy with regard to Burma.</p>
<p class="contents">Until now, the measures taken by the European Union to improve living conditions in Burma, to try to humanise the situation of its millions of inhabitants, have been limited to theory and political statements that have never been followed by action. The political and moral responsibility of the EU is now involved. Perhaps it should be involved to the point of criminal prosecution. Surely the very significant investments made by the Member States, regardless of any development in the military regime, represent <span class="italic">de facto</span> collaboration in maintaining the junta in power? Surely European businesses are cynically exploiting the workforce in this prison-State, which has become a general labour camp, where the concept of citizenship no longer applies?</p>
<p class="contents">This country is certainly far from the European continent and European legislation! Although we are aware of the totalitarian nature of the Burmese regime, however, and the motions for resolution are coming from all sides, the current state of affairs, in other words, the absence of the rule of law, continues under the Burmese sun. We need to activate the European Union’s economic and industrial lever in order to prohibit any investment by the Member States in undemocratic regimes. We need to ensure that the industrial policy of the Member States is a moral one. We also need to use the force of Community diplomatic and political action throughout this Asian region, which has a shared history with some of the Member States and for which relations with Europe are still so important for its development.</p>
<p class="contents">We must consider the criminals in power in Burma in the current context, in the context of the International Criminal Court that is now permanently operational to prosecute all individuals accused of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The time for theoretical statements has passed. The European Union owes more than that to the winner of the Sakharov Prize and the Nobel Peace Prize, Aung San Suu Kyi, to the 1200 political prisoners, and through them, to the millions of Burmese citizens. This resolution is very strongly worded and comprehensive. Each paragraph should be part of a framework for a genuine Community policy on the military junta, and therefore to the benefit of Burmese civil society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some will call for dialogue, wanting to point out their concerns and encourage the regime to change its ways. Others – the realists – want tough action and opt for isolation of the regime and sanctions. Every situation is distinct and calls for different measures.</p>
<p class="contents">It can be said with some confidence that tyrants rarely listen to reason and only respond when their vital interests – often personal – are seriously under threat. The European Union and the wider international community can be powerful bodies when they act with unity, consistency and determination. When they are divided or make seemingly empty threats, sending different messages through other channels, then the tyrant sees no need to respond. We are seeing this with Iraq. Saddam clearly feels – wrongly – that he is being let off the hook. Sometimes tough measures are introduced but there is little resolve in implementing them or there are deliberate efforts to undermine them. We have seen this with Zimbabwe, where the very target of an EU sanctions regime is himself given specific exemption in order to be wined and dined in a European capital.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we come once more to Burma – another abominable regime – yet another case where the efforts of the European Union and the international community to encourage change have brought few tangible results. We have been at this for years. Parliament has been adopting resolutions and the Council common positions since 1996. What have we to show for all this? Where is the application and the resolve to achieve some real results? Current sanctions against the Burmese regime are due to expire on 29 April. The Council must renew the sanctions but it should strengthen them, introduce new measures, such as an investment ban, remove exemptions to the travel ban and extend it to include all members of the military junta. The sanctions should be rigorously enforced. In addition, I call upon the Commission and the Council to assess why the action so far has been ineffective and make recommendations to remedy the situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She is not yet free, however, and cannot move about freely.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, however, Burma still continues to be afflicted by the repression of ethnic minorities, rape and violence against women. The elimination of political dissidents and summary executions have not stopped. Torture, detention and forced labour are common practice. Despite the government’s denials, I believe that children are still forced to join the army<span class="bold"> </span>and also, I regret to say, the rebel military forces.</p>
<p class="contents">There are thousands of people suffering who we do not hear about from the media as we did, I am glad to say, in the case of the 13 years of house arrests imposed on the Nobel Peace Prize-winner. Consider, for example, the tragic child-soldier system. ‘It is a good idea to conscript children because they do the same job as adults but they are difficult for the enemy army to see’, one official had the courage to say.</p>
<p class="contents">Forced labour is still common practice: recent Amnesty International surveys have shown that approximately 90% of the population of the State of Shan<span class="bold"> </span>are subject to forced labour. These people have no choice: either forced labour or prison. Their work, for which they are not paid, consists of building military infrastructure, roads, buildings and military camps and even performing military duties. They work without a break from morning until night, with no food except a small quantity of toasted rice.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the fact that the Burmese penal code has banned forced labour, the situation has not changed. It has not changed despite the presence of the International Labour Organisation. Even the recent endeavours of the Thai Government have been frustrated by the categorical opposition of the Burmese authorities, which have even refused to give members of the political opposition permission to leave the country in order to discuss its economic problems. Worst of all is the continued abuse of power by the Burmese army, the military intelligence services, the police and other security forces.</p>
<p class="contents">I genuinely believe, as other Members have said too, that the European Union must both continue to use its influence to press for negotiations between the democratic groupings, the ethnic minorities and the State to resume as soon as possible, and put pressure on the Burmese authorities, continuing, that is, with the current trade policy on Burma and, if possible, taking even stronger measures to curb the scourge of forced labour, in particular. It must also undertake to pursue …</p>

They take no notice of the rest of the world. The military regime is still breaking all records when it comes to violation of human rights, political prisoners, forced labour, child soldiers, media censorship, violation of religious freedoms and violence against minorities. Everything that God has forbidden goes on in Burma. In drawing up a new common position, the European Union must speak with a clear voice. The time is long overdue for the generals to release unconditionally the 1 200 political prisoners who are being held in atrocious conditions and tortured. The Council and the Commission must also give very serious consideration to the systematic rape of women and sexual enslavement and argue for an international investigation into this. The ILO must be given access to all areas where forced labour is going on. The European Commission must denounce these abuses at the WTO. The European Union must also demand that the regime put an end to the climate of impunity, that applies to all those who are guilty of torture, forced labour, deportations or unlawful executions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, it is of the utmost importance that the Burmese refugees in Bangladesh are not forcefully repatriated. While it may be true that the freedom of movement of the NLD of Aung San Suu Kyi has been slightly increased, that seems to be more a question of <span class="italic">window</span> <span class="italic">dressing </span>than of a significant change in policy. The European Union must strengthen the sanctions against Burma. A ban on foreign investments should be introduced. European companies which get Burmese blood on their hands to serve their shareholders must be pilloried. Unfortunately there are still Member States that give more weight to their own business interests than they do to a consistent human rights policy. Only with broad international support do the oppressed Burmese people have a chance of ousting the generals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As Members of this House will be aware, the Common Position has been reinforced a number of times since 1996. In doing this, the Commission and the Member States have endeavoured to formulate precisely targeted sanctions, which will hit the people we want to hit, and to avoid adverse effects on the innocent citizens of that country. It has also been stipulated that, in the future too, the Council will respond appropriately to favourable as well as to adverse developments in Burma.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament will, I think, understand why the Commission cannot act in advance of the results of the current discussions, but I am able to assure you that, whenever the Common Position is extended, the whole range of courses of action open to us will be re-examined.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards humanitarian aid, the Commission and the Community's Member States have already, on a number of occasions, reaffirmed their willingness to provide humanitarian aid to the most needy sections of the Burmese population.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to confirm, as regards forced labour, that the Commission gives unconditional support both to the most recent UN resolution on the human rights situation in Burma and to the ILO's stance in defence of international labour standards. Its explicit statement on the situation in Burma led to the adoption by the International Labour Conference of a resolution on Burma, which is now being implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the proposal that the issue of forced labour be considered by the WTO, the Commission will be examining this more closely, taking into account, as a matter of priority, the forthcoming discussions in the ILO at the end of this month, and the next International Labour Conference, which is to be held in June. The Commission has no reservations about favouring closer cooperation between the WTO and the ILO and welcomes the informal cooperation that already takes place to some degree. The Commission also favours independent international investigation of the charges laid against the armed forces, namely of sexual violence and other infringements of the civilian population's rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
