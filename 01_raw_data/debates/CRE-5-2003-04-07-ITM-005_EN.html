<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Grosch (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, now that we have reached second reading stage, the Common Position, thanks to the good support from the Commission and its staff, but also to Members' willingness not to trip the discussion up with details, has, in my view, resulted in something very positive, and something that we can put to the vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I see the directives on basic skills – as they are now termed – and training as being all of a piece with driving and rest times, driver attestation and now vocational training. I would in some ways call it a package of social measures in road transport, guaranteeing on the one hand proper liberalisation, whilst on the other hand also having the effect that these limitations on work are not at the expense of safety, work quality or training. Knowing as we do how tough competition is, particularly in road transport, we attached the highest importance to these regulatory measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Here in Parliament, we saw the Common Position as largely satisfactory. Whatever else it did, it did adopt two-thirds of the proposed amendments, which were dealt with at a rate and with a timetable quite astonishing for some sorts of work in this House. The overlap with the driving licence has been done away with, which means that those with proper training for their driving licence no longer need to have these basis skills certified. What was very important to us was that it was not the drivers' country of origin that was to be the decisive factor, but the place where they drive, the firm or business or its country of origin in the fifteen countries. People from third countries are also to acquire these basic skills.</p>
<p class="contents">The programmes are no longer so rigid. Even in in-service training, learning objectives have been laid down. The seven hours per annum rhythm is a good solution for both in-service training and from the businesses' point of view. It can also be assumed that this was harmonised with the new provisions on admission to the occupation, which means that, in this respect too, there are no weak points left.</p>
<p class="contents">We find it regrettable that there is no guarantee of mobility during training. We will shortly be discussing a project which will call on students to study the length and breadth of Europe, whilst drivers will not do so. Speaking as an inhabitant of a border area, I greatly regret this, but I can understand that there might still be problems with controls in certain cases. In any case, I am not abandoning hope, for, at the end of an evaluation that should be carried out over two years, the Commission, supported by the Council, may well come up with the idea of providing for a bit more mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">What we saw as worse than this was the fact that provision was made for a test without training, to be opted for not by the candidate, but by the country. We hope, however, that this will be re-examined in the course of the evaluation, for I believe that this amendment that we have tabled is an important one. After two years' implementation, there is not only to be an evaluation of to what extent this is applied in the Member States, but also of to what extent the objectives have been achieved, and, as this is to do only with examinations, this will of course be a very important aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">The change that we are proposing is the one that I have just mentioned. It is of course also about the training of drivers covering criminality in the broadest sense of the word, as they can very often be the victims of certain criminal acts. The training centres must be of high quality; my colleague has already incorporated this requirement into the recitals, and I believe it to be important that reference be made to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to time limits, it is the desire of us all that this directive be transposed as quickly as possible, but, on the other hand, I believe that things must be looked at in a pragmatic light, as, in our experiment with the drivers' licence, the time limits may perhaps seem very long. I will ask, though, that the time limit should not be shortened whatever happens. Flexibility is important, and the bottom line is that, no matter how good these directives may be, and no matter how much we agree to their enactment, they will yield nothing if – as has become almost a recurrent theme in this Parliament – there are no subsequent controls and if they are not properly implemented. We therefore again urge the Commission, and, through them, the Council and the Member States that, if we want to create this liberalised European transport area, in which, however, this job can also be done under proper conditions, in which working conditions are right, and in which training will now also be right, these texts will remain nothing but fine words if the Member States are not willing to systematically implement them.</p>
<p class="contents">I will close with a reference to ECMT licences. I hope that we will soon be able to take certain steps at this level as well, where unfair competition continues, so that, in certain cases, all the good preparatory work that we have done can be taken into account.</p>

<p class="contents">The adoption of this directive will be an important step forward and will contribute to the harmonisation of social conditions, a better quality of professional driver and better road transport standards in general.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that the Council’s Common Position, which to a large extent takes account of Parliament’s first reading, is a well-balanced attempt to achieve these objectives, and we should therefore try not to spoil this balance and try to adopt this directive at second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the amendments proposed improve on the Council’s Common Position and the Commission takes a positive view of them.</p>
<p class="contents">There are certain amendments, however, which the Commission cannot accept, such as No 3, No 4, No 8 and No 9.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments No 3 and 4 must be rejected for two reasons: firstly, because they are not viable in practice. In fact, in 13 Member States there is currently no obligatory training and only around 5 to 10% of the drivers in question would be able to be trained, and it would therefore be impossible for these 13 countries to transpose the directive correctly in two years.</p>
<p class="contents">In certain countries, particularly those with a federal structure, the transposition of such a complex and new piece of Community legislation would be practically impossible for procedural reasons, and would only lead to infringement procedures for lack of implementation at a later date.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, if these amendments are adopted, we could end up in a conciliation procedure with the Council, with the prospect of achieving transposition into national legislation just one year before, of which six months would be lost through conciliation and from which ultimately nothing would be gained.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 8 and 9 were both proposed by the European Parliament at first reading as well. They were rejected by the Commission and the Council did not take them up in its Common Position either. Amendment No 8 intends to authorise an individual to obtain the initial qualification or periodic training in the Member State of their choice. This could allow drivers to avoid the most demanding rules. Amendment No 9 lays down control by the competent authorities of the setting of tests. This means that the tests can be carried out by authorities other than the competent authorities. The tests should be carried out by the competent authorities or by bodies which are under their direct control. Therefore, the control requested is not necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I would appeal to you not to let these two amendments cause us to miss the opportunity to approve this legislation at second reading and therefore not to delay its adoption by this Parliament and the Council even further, as well as its subsequent transposition.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, your vote tomorrow will have a great influence on the legislative process. It will facilitate a speedy adoption of the directive and consequently an improvement in the conditions of millions of lorry and bus drivers who work in our Member States. I am counting on your support in order to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to the rapporteur that he is absolutely right, that the effectiveness of all these measures will be assessed according to the Member States’ capacity for control in their various areas of responsibility. To this end we are analysing the possibilities for further convergence of the types of control carried out in the different Member States with the rules and requirements that we have agreed at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur is well aware that this is a complex task, but I would like to say to him that – as I have repeated on various occasions – I hope to present a proposal on this area to Parliament and the Council as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sommer (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to express my gratitude to Mr Grosch – for whom I have a high regard – for this quite excellent report. A few weeks ago, ladies and gentlemen, we discussed in this plenary the Transport White Paper and voted on what position Parliament should take in relation to it. This Transport White Paper has lofty objectives, one of the most essential of which, apart from the reduction of environmentally harmful and unhealthy emissions such as greenhouse gases and noise, is that of raising the standard of traffic safety overall. We are all aware that it does this against the backdrop of 41 000 fatal traffic accidents per annum in the European Union as a whole, to which we have to add a multitude of people injured, some being left with permanent and severe disabilities. All these things are the result of road traffic accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">If we really want to achieve the objective of increased safety on the roads, we need a multi-faceted strategy. Vehicles must of course be made safer, but that will be of little use unless their drivers are safer too. Those who work in the transport sector, that is, those who drive vehicles, have to be better trained. This will make manifestly superfluous the establishment of a Road Transport Safety Agency, which a majority of the plenary called for when the Transport White Paper was debated and which, I might add, I regard as absolutely nonsensical. What distinguishes the road transport sector from other transport sectors – such as sea or air transport – is the large number of people working in it.</p>
<p class="contents">The essential element in road transport safety, namely the way individuals drive, cannot be regulated by any one European agency, and so this draft on the training of professional drivers in goods and passenger transport is much to be welcomed. I am from the Ruhr, a densely populated region, indeed the most densely populated industrial region in the European Union, and one where there are innumerable motorways and an enormous amount of traffic. I myself travel by car a very great deal, as my electoral district is a large one, and I am also obliged to be always driving to Brussels and Strasbourg. Anyone who spends as much time travelling on motorways and other roads as I do, and as many of my fellow Members do, knows what they are like.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, anyone who has observed how much freight traffic by road has increased in the last three to four years alone, and how many HGVs are using the roads, will know that situations in which lives are at risk are all too frequent. This does, of course, also have to do with the central and eastern European states being about to join the European Union – in part. The drivers from our own Member States are not absolutely safe either. A very large number of vehicles from the candidate countries are already on the move right across the European Union, and there are worrying indications that the amount of goods traffic on the roads is increasing. They are worrying especially for a transit country like Germany, and that is why we need to be certain that drivers know what they are doing, to be certain that they are continuing their training, that that training is tested, and that road traffic generally is better controlled at national level. When we are, a Road Traffic Agency will become quite superfluous. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This directive is important for several reasons. I should like us to make a leap of imagination and imagine that we were about to develop a road transport system today. Would that transport system look like our present one? I hardly think so. We would have significantly more stringent safety requirements, we would construct our roads differently and we should definitely require road construction workers to be properly trained.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why this directive is important, for we must first of all be able to make certain demands of drivers of road vehicles for the carriage of goods or passengers, making of course stringent demands in terms of, for example, safety. Secondly, our directive would raise the status of their profession. That, I believe, would mean a very great deal, for quality would be guaranteed by those who do the work. Thirdly, well trained drivers would obviously do work that was better from a safety point of view, because they would be more aware of, and more involved in the consequences of, different situations. That too is reflected in the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the rest of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would hope to avoid conciliation when it comes to this directive. I should have liked it if training could have taken place during working hours. We have tabled an amendment to that effect, but it was unfortunately not accepted. Following mature consideration, we have accepted the possibility of choosing between tests and courses, for we are aware of the fact that there is an extremely large number of people to be trained. What is important now is that we have high-quality training courses and that there are authorised training centres. It is therefore important that Amendment No 8 not be accepted, for it would involve a danger of social dumping where training conditions were concerned, with the shortest courses being chosen and in those places that are most convenient. If we agree to being able to choose between tests and courses, we cannot, unfortunately, agree to being able, at the same time, to choose in which country the courses are to be taken. That is not possible. It would be just too risky. I do not therefore believe that we can accept Amendment No 8.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I hope that we can avoid conciliation. I understood from the Commissioner that the road safety programme would come on stream quite soon, something for which I am most sincerely grateful. We have waited a long time for this and shall examine it with great interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It looks as if compulsory professional training for drivers will soon become a reality. It is high time professional drivers took and were obliged to take follow-up training in addition to passing their driving tests. Road safety for drivers and other road users is important. Unfortunately accidents involving lorries often result in fatalities. It would be nice if we could reduce this percentage in future.</p>
<p class="contents">The vote on this directive tomorrow will give a significant impetus to driving as a profession. Experience in the Netherlands has taught us that drivers who undergo professional training see their job satisfaction levels increase substantially. Driving a lorry is a profession with its own challenges. It is important for the sector that people who decide to become professional drivers remain in the industry. This continuity will increase if drivers become aware of the great social significance of their profession. The sector is itself looking for good professional drivers. After all, without transport, the economy will grind to a halt.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself had submitted two amendments to this report on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform party, relating to control of the quality of training and the opportunity to train in other EU Member States. I am withdrawing these amendments out of my concern that certain Member States will use this to follow a mediation procedure after all. I think that the fact that the report will be accepted tomorrow and will in fact be implemented is much more important. I hope that it will be possible to put it into force quickly. My proposals now simply go too far. Like Mr Grosch, I hope that the vote at the plenary session tomorrow will be favourable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think that the aim of the directive is very clear. We want to improve road safety. We also want to try to improve the environment on our roads by means of training, because if drivers know how that works, they will be able to influence it. Ultimately, of course, it is also a social package. I will not go into all the details. I think that it was a good thing that Mr Vermeer withdrew a couple of amendments, otherwise it may have resulted in the social dumping we have been talking about.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, a catch, and I would like to speak to the Commissioner briefly about this. It is as follows. Over the past few days, the case of hauliers Willi Betz has shown us that there are problems with the CEMT licences. We all know that the driver’s certificate that Mr Van Dam worked on, and which is based on community licences, came into effect on 19 March. It is still possible to evade the CEMT licences, as Mr Grosch mentioned at the end of his speech. I would like to ask the Commissioner how we can get the CEMT to pay attention to the specialist training and follow-up training we are aiming towards for members from Member States and drivers working for companies registered in those Member States, otherwise we will be left with an unresolved problem. For this reason, I would like to ask you to give your attention to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I think that we are dealing with social matters here, and I will soon be raising the issue of whether we should really be dealing with this via the RETT or the EMPL. I will be coming back to this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the motives for limiting driving times is that driving a vehicle for long periods of time can create risks to road safety. Honesty compels me, however, to say that it is not only mental and physical fitness that contributes to road safety but also properly developed professional skills. That is why we support the proposal to lay down minimum requirements for the training of professional drivers. So far only two Member States have this kind of training. Extending this to all Member States will significantly promote the professional quality of drivers and safety on our roads to a comparable level.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that such training relates as much as possible both to the qualities of the individual driver and to day-to-day practice. This requires the training programme to be flexible. In that regard, therefore, I am happy with the different training methods proposed by the Council. Whereas the emphasis in the original plans was on attendance, it is now actually on demonstrating personal skills during the examination. The supervisory bodies who have to guarantee the quality of these exams therefore have an important task.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to keep abreast of developments in training techniques. During the training it will most likely not be possible to cover every conceivable traffic situation. Combining numerous traffic situations in a simulator is therefore a step in the right direction. The use of simulators in training should therefore be encouraged in order to prepare drivers as thoroughly as possible for all possible situations.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not only be paying attention to road safety but also to the personal safety of the drivers. On 14 and 15 October, the Justice and Home Affairs Council stated that heavy goods vehicles carrying valuable commercial goods are increasingly becoming an easy target for criminal organisations. The signals from insurance companies on this are clear. This brings with it considerable risks for the drivers. In order to fight these criminal activities, attention must also be paid in training courses to preventive measures. Not only to protect the cargo but also the driver.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we regard the common position, including the proposed amendments, as a good basis for driver training right across the European Union. It will enable Member States to set up and maintain practice-oriented training. Many thanks to the rapporteur for his excellent work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing an issue which never ceases to be very tragic and relevant. Once again, in my country, last Saturday, on Saturday night, there was yet another case of what we call Saturday–night carnage. Four young people were killed on the roads. These incidents have become regular now, occurring with tragic frequency, and they have rightly led to an increase in social alarm at the unnecessary carnage on our roads. There is no doubt that one of the most effective solutions lies in training. Like Mrs Sommer, I expressed my opposition to the creation of a European Road Safety Agency when it was discussed. Indeed, we do not need any more centralised bodies, which would probably mean more red tape – we need road safety policies. There is a difference. Today, I am pleased to say that, with this directive, we are making progress in one of the key areas towards the goal we must all set ourselves: the goal of safe roads. Why is this one of the key factors? Because, as has already been reiterated by many of the Members, this directive of ours makes training ongoing, as it needs to be. The requirement to pass a driving test is no longer a sufficient safeguard: we must ensure that especially those whose jobs consist of driving, such as goods-vehicle and professional drivers, are constantly monitored, for their own safety, first and foremost, but also in the interests of the safety of other road users.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank the rapporteur and the Commission, which I see has already undertaken to cooperate, for if we are to have training, we all have to agree on what we mean. It must be a serious undertaking, not a formality, and so the structures which our States are to certify as capable of performing training and to accredit with the necessary authorisation must be responsible centres whose professionalism is proven and consolidated. In this regard, in my country at least, the experience possessed by driving schools is a very useful factor which should be exploited. In this way, I believe that the directive will help to achieve effective training and so make our roads safer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The directive will serve to improve the professional skills of drivers as well as road safety, as has been said here. Harmonised regulations concerning initial professional qualifications will raise the social status of drivers and furthermore heighten the esteem the profession is held in. Improved basic training will also enable the Member States to reduce the minimum age limit for drivers of many classes of vehicle, which will make the profession more attractive and improve the supply of labour in the transport sector.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Council has taken the committee’s amendments very much into consideration in the common position, we should proceed without conciliation and swiftly move this issue forward. In my opinion, we should still think carefully about the aim to bring forward by one year the deadline for the transposition of the measures into national law. The Member States have highlighted the problems arising from a tighter timetable, since the directive will mean a great deal of reorganisation with regard to training. The Member States therefore need time to implement this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Compulsory training for lorry drivers is something that we really need and something that we should have had in place a long time ago. I am sometimes surprised at how far behind Europe is in the area of road safety. After the problem with driving times, this problem therefore also needs to be tackled urgently. If a number of problems are to be solved, we have to approve the report tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the transport sector can become more professional. Better drivers should be driving on our roads. The profession of lorry driver should be made more attractive and also respectable. There is absolutely no room for cowboys on our roads.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, training courses for drivers should also pay attention to the rational use of energy. Experiments show that even experienced drivers can permanently cut their fuel consumption by up to 30% after just one day of additional training. This is not insignificant for a Kyoto-sensitive sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, and perhaps the most important point: safety on our roads will also improve. I am thinking here about training in the use of the obligatory blind spot systems and other safety technology on board lorries, as well as teaching a more defensive driving style which will benefit more vulnerable road users in general and cyclists in particular. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In any regulatory system not all controls have equal impact. As regulation increases in complexity and breadth, the law of diminishing returns kicks in. As control further increases it then becomes counterproductive. The case has not been made that these controls, already applying in France and the Netherlands, will make goods vehicles safer. In fact some countries which do not require these additional qualifications already have higher safety values. At the very least therefore, the law has reached the point of diminishing return.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own country, as the ordinary driving test has become more stringent, it becomes harder for working class youngsters to afford. As a result, driving legally has become the privilege of the sons and daughters of the wealthy, while the number of people driving without any licence is estimated at over one million. With increased training and education requirements, driving goods vehicles will similarly become the exclusive domain of the privileged middle classes or of those who are fortunate enough to work for employers who feel obliged or are possibly legally bound to pay all of their training fees, plus the cost of replacement drivers while they take time off work to complete their training courses.</p>
<p class="contents">For small employers, that would be a considerable financial burden which could lead to bankruptcy and subsequent job losses. In the United Kingdom most employers agree that their drivers have already taken strict tests, have undergone thorough medical examinations, and consider themselves quite rightly to be the elite amongst drivers on our roads. They would be insulted by a requirement to constantly improve their driving. Safety is of course paramount, and limits on permitted driving hours make good sense, but that is a completely different subject. Thus what we have here is reverse social engineering. This House is contributing to the process of making more and more jobs unattainable for those who traditionally did them and benefited from so doing. If it carries on in this way, we had better increase the number of places in this House, since that will be the only occupation left that unqualified people would be allowed to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
