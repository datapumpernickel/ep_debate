I know it is appreciated by all my colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware of the benefits of the single market in financial services but I will re-state them because they are so important: cheaper products for consumers, better returns for savers and easier and cheaper finance for business. Sadly, this remains an aspiration rather than a reality. One of the main reasons we are failing to achieve such a single market is poor implementation and inconsistent interpretation. Both of these will be helped by Mr Lamfalussy's proposals, which are sensible and pragmatic.</p>
<p class="contents">We need further assurances and guarantees on transparency and market consultation and on democratic oversight, but I hope we and the other two European Union institutions can find a way to make these proposals work. This is an important political opportunity which should not be wasted and I am glad to hear that the Commission is taking a pragmatic view on its right of initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Bolkestein stated in his introduction, he does not have concerns about the role of the regulators’ committee. We need to see that kind of flexibility from the Council as well and if it is true that the Council is trying to roll back the European Parliament's limited role in the comitology process under present rules, that is unhelpful and regrettable. All three institutions will need to show goodwill and make sacrifices and compromises if this arrangement is to work, but it is a prize well worth fighting for because the single market in securities will yield many benefits for the people we are elected to represent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am not speaking as a member of the Committee on Economic Affairs but as a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and I would like to express my agreement with the comments by Mr Cox, Mr Goebbels and Mr Herzog. In short, we have a legislative problem. We all agree that Community legislation is very complicated, very ornate and very complex, but the reason why Community legislation is so complicated and ornate is the intergovernmental procedure which is used to adopt regulations and the lack of a genuine Community legislative body which has the capacity to adopt clear regulations. Therefore, while we agree basically with Mr Lamfalussy and the committee of experts, and with the need for clear and rapid Community legislation, we cannot agree with the solution they propose because that would mean more committees and more of the famous comitology procedure. In this respect I must remind you of a famous saying that ‘a camel is a horse drawn by a committee’, with many humps, and Community legislation is camel-like. The comitology procedure currently proposed by the Lamfalussy report would create many more camels and would not create satisfactory legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">This type of proposal and the continued insistence on comitology is not therefore the solution. The solution lies in creating a clear legislative procedure which allows Parliament to effectively exercise its powers. Otherwise we would simply be allowing the governments to continue playing amongst themselves and drawing Community legislative camels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is certainly a lot that is being repeated in these speeches.</p>
<p class="contents">I, too, think that the Committee of Wise Men, chaired by Baron Lamfalussy, has done an exceptionally thorough job. The committee’s proposals form a coherent whole and also contain some practical and concrete measures to bring the system into effect. It is generally rare in politics to make such clear proposals and I thank this committee for them.</p>
<p class="contents">We members of the European Parliament agree fully with the view that it is necessary to make regulation of the securities markets more efficient and faster. This is a requirement that we should propose if we want to achieve a genuinely viable European internal market for financial services within the next few years. We can never achieve the ambitious aims of Lisbon if the reform of one directive on the financial markets is to take ten years, as has tended to be the case with the present system, if we take the UCITS directive as an example.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament alone cannot be blamed for the present system’s shortcomings, however. Parliament has taken its role as the EU’s second legislative body seriously and responsibly. During this parliamentary term in particular we have shown that there is no conflict between safeguarding Parliament’s powers of influence and adequate democratic control, on the one hand, and the call for greater speed and efficiency, on the other. Parliament’s principal task is to determine what the core political questions are, and not beat around the bush. For that reason, delegating the responsibility of technical legislation to the committee to be set up is basically not a problem for us. The bosses do not do the work of the secretaries, and <span class="italic">vice versa. </span>In the codecision procedure Parliament and the Council are the bosses and all the others the secretaries. This, however, does not weaken the demand Parliament is making in plain terms in the form of the ‘callback’ mechanism. Parliament must have the legally binding right to refer a matter back for further consideration if things are moving in the wrong direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament is not the only institution that wants to ensure it is safeguarded in this way; the Council has also expressed a similar need to safeguard its own position with the help of the ‘aerosol clause’. This sort of system, which would take the concerns of both Parliament and the Council into account, must also be created on the basis of the Lamfalussy report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, Mr von Wogau said that he welcomes the use of regulations and also the fast-track procedure. I would agree with him in his sentiment. Certainly regulations and a fast-track procedure would help to speed up legislation. Mr von Wogau said that perhaps as a pilot project a pension fund could be used to show how quickly these procedures could be used. Certainly, the Commission would like to see the pension fund directive become a reality as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">However, certain articles in the Treaty concerning the internal market mention directives and not regulations. Naturally we have to stay within the confines of the Treaty, so where the Treaty says "directives" we cannot use regulations. But I agree with Parliament that regulations are usually – although not always – faster than directives.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Goebbels asked if the new procedures would speed up legislation. As I have explained, they would. Also the comitology procedure provides for short deadlines and therefore it would also speed up the whole process. Mr Goebbels then asked whether the Securities Committee would consist of Secretaries of State. I am afraid I cannot answer that question. The Securities Committee has delegates coming from various Member States and it is up to the Member States to decide who represents them on that committee. So I cannot comment on that. As I said, Member States will nominate their own representatives. What is important is that these representatives should show a real European spirit, are prepared to work closely together and are technically competent.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to the matter of transparency, which has been raised by a number of Members of Parliament. I agree with all those who have emphasised the importance of transparency throughout the legislative process and indeed the report by Mr Lamfalussy and his colleagues makes various references to the need for transparency. The Commission wholeheartedly endorses that.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Herzog said this is a cumbersome intergovernmental procedure instead of a single European regulator. The procedures set out in this report are not intergovernmental. For example, the Securities Committee – which is an important committee in this respect – will not be a Council working group. It will be a regulatory committee in the sense of the 1999 comitology decision; it will be chaired by the Commission. So it is not an intergovernmental committee. The decision of the Lamfalussy committee not to propose a single European regulator at this stage is the result of a full and thorough consultation process. As the report states, it may be necessary to look at the possibility of a single regulator when the whole procedure is reviewed in 2004 if the process that is currently proposed is not satisfactory, but not before.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now answer a few points that were raised this evening. I am grateful to Mrs Villiers and Mr Medina Ortega for their kind words, although to me it is only natural that I should be present here when a subject falling within my portfolio is discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Medina Ortega said that the European Union's legislation is complex, which is true. Normally there is a government and a parliament. We have a triangular relationship, the Commission, Parliament and the Council. That makes it more difficult. The fact that there are 15 Member States further complicates the procedure. He said that the whole system for dealing with executive measures under the comitology procedure is like the horse designed by a committee which turns out to be a camel. Indeed there was a committee, the Lamfalussy committee. But the whole idea of a comitology procedure is to get the implementing measures through more speedily. That is a purpose I share.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say, however, that the matter of secondary legislation is a very important one. In many Member States – in Germany and the Netherlands for example – there is a definite procedure for dealing with secondary legislation, which the European Union lacks. There is no provision in the Treaty for dealing with secondary legislation in this way. Parliament, the Council and the Commission would be well advised to think about the need for a proper system of dealing with secondary legislation. Since this whole process will be reviewed in 2004 let us hope that at the same time we can look into the matter of secondary legislation. Then if we manage to work out a clear plan it can be taken up in the Intergovernmental Conference which will hopefully start in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is grateful for the support Mrs Kauppi has given to the report of the Lamfalussy committee. There is no difference of opinion. She want speedier legislation. She is right. The Commission wants it, Mrs Randzio-Plath wants it, everybody wants it. She gave the example of USITs, which it look a long time to agree upon. Fortunately, agreement has now been reached but I would agree with Mrs Kauppi that it has taken a very long time.</p>
<p class="contents">Central to this whole discussion is the possibility of having a callback mechanism as Parliament has requested. I do not have to explain what it is; everybody knows.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission firmly believes that we ought to find a solution within the Treaty – which means Articles 202 and 211 – and that we should stay within the confines of the comitology decision of June 1999. Therefore we cannot see our way to granting Parliament a callback possibility. Having said that, I would ask Parliament to remember what is on the table. Firstly, the Commission will take full account of a resolution approved by Parliament. Secondly, as Mr Cox said this afternoon, it is Parliament – and the Council – that decide on the scope of levels in implementing measures. If the directive contains broad principles and executive measures and Parliament does not agree that a certain executive measure should be called that and relegated to level 2, then Parliament should say so and amend the directive to say that a particular implementing measure should be elevated to the status of a general principle and therefore be dealt with under level 1. So it is in Parliament's own hands to decide on the distinction between general principles and executive measures. That is the second point.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, if Parliament thought the Commission was abusing the system, what do you think would happen the next time the Commission made a proposal concerning a certain directive? Parliament would surely then be in a position to say "Look, you fooled us the last time, now we are going to be extremely strict with you". So Parliament can be certain that the next time it is dealing with a directive under this whole plan it can tighten the screws. The Commission knows that. So why should the Commission frustrate the wishes of Parliament by doing something that is not really proper? That is the third point.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, in the year 2004 there will be a review of the whole process and this – my fifth point – will be steered by the Monitoring Committee, an interinstitutional committee on which Parliament will be represented. The Monitoring Committee will not keep silent if it thinks that the procedures are being abused and the Commission is allowing itself too much latitude.</p>
<p class="contents">My sixth point is Parliament can pass a resolution saying that the Commission is <span class="italic">ultra vires</span>, that it is going beyond what is consistent with the law. Again, the Commission would take full account of that opinion and reconsider the whole proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">These six measures should allay the fear, which I understand but which is not justified, that the Commission would disregard Parliament's opinion. The Commission cannot and will not do so. Therefore, I do not think there are any grounds for wanting a callback possibility. I can find no provision for it in the Treaty or in the 1999 comitology procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, two Members of Parliament have mentioned something they think has happened in the Council, namely that the Council wants to have a stronger position for itself than is consistent with a balanced relationship between the three institutions. I cannot speak for the Council. The Council proceedings are not open and therefore it is very difficult to comment. But if there should be any attempt to lower the bar of a qualified majority vote to a simple majority vote, that would meet with the strongest objections from the Commission. After all, a single majority vote is almost never mentioned in the Treaty. We know what unanimous votes are and we know what qualified majority votes are. Simple majority votes are perhaps used for procedural matters, but not for anything of substance. So the Commission will firmly oppose any moves towards lowering the decision-making system from a qualified majority vote to a simple majority vote. As I said, I cannot speak for the Council and it is only with great reluctance that I am commenting on something that may or may not be true. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No one wants to change the Treaty just now. The point is, can we find a solution within the framework of the 1999 comitology decision? Why not supplement Article 6 and give Parliament a guarantee which secures its callback right, Commissioner, if the Commission or the other institutions do not act as the European Parliament would wish? I think that this would show willing on the part of the institutions and would prove that we live in a European democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I reiterate that the Commission is basing itself on two particular articles in the Treaty and on the comitology decision. When I look not so much at Article 6 but at Article 5 and Article 8 of the comitology decision, I am sorry, but I see no room for a callback procedure. Mrs Randzio-Plath referred this afternoon to a callback procedure or equivalent measure, or words to that effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is here to try to find a balance and if Mrs Randzio-Plath is willing to come forward with a new suggestion, the Commission will, of course, listen to it but once again it must be within the framework of the comitology decision. If Mrs Randzio-Plath or any other Member of this Parliament then says it is time we changed the comitology decision, I am out of my depth. It is not within my remit tonight to pronounce on the possibility of changing the comitology decision, although if we are considering the question of secondary legislation, we might also consider comitology. However that is a big step and I do not think I can make any comment on changes to this delicate and complicated interinstitutional balance tonight.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, if Mrs Randzio-Plath wants to put forward a new proposal which we might not have considered, we will certainly look at it and try to be positive in our reply, always provided that it is within the confines of the comitology decision, </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
