<p class="contents">It would be a mistake to believe that the European Union is not playing an extremely important role in that region. There are clear examples of this. There is a Member amongst you, Mr Rocard, who has headed the whole observer mission, and whom I would like to congratulate on my own behalf and I believe on behalf of all the Members of Parliament and, undoubtedly, on behalf of all the Palestinians and all the men and women of Israel, on the extraordinary work he and the people working with him have done during this extremely complicated election period in Palestine. Thank you very much, therefore, to our friend Michel Rocard, and I wish him the greatest of success in the work he still has before him.</p>
<p class="contents">I can also tell you that I had the privilege, representing the European Union, of being the first person to have talks with the President-elect, Abu Mazen, and also with the Prime Minister, Abu Ala. I believe that the two meetings were fundamental in terms of trying to piece together the future of Palestine and finding the best possible way for we Europeans to contribute to resolving the historic problems which are undoubtedly closer to being resolved today.</p>
<p class="contents">During the week I spent there, which I would like to describe to the honourable Members, I also had the opportunity to visit his Majesty the King of Jordan and his government, as well as President Mubarak and the people in Egypt who are handling the cooperation between Palestinians and Israelis with great determination.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, for the sake of brevity, I would like to divide my speech into three parts: firstly, how I see the situation in Palestine; secondly, how I see it from Israel’s point of view; and, thirdly, how I believe we should move forward, from a European perspective, with a view to supporting the peace process, which I believe requires greater speed, momentum and determination.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, from the Palestinian point of view, I would like to demonstrate and share with you the mood of the citizens of Palestine on the day of the vote and subsequent days. If you will allow me, I would sum up the feeling I experienced over those days in Palestine, whether in Ramallah or in Gaza, in two words. The first word is pride: pride in having been able to handle a very difficult crisis very well; a crisis whose end, when it began, with the arrival of President Arafat in Paris, could not be predicted. They have done so extraordinarily well and with great maturity, and I believe that the international community and we Europeans must take good note of the capacity and skill of a society which, with pride, is able to do things well. And, as well as that sense of pride, there is a general sense of hope; a hope we must be capable of satisfying, and which we cannot allow to fade through lack of political action, whether on the part of Israel or on the part of the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the most difficult time we are going to have to face will undoubtedly be the time from now until July, August or perhaps September. During that period, certain very important events still have to take place. From the Palestinian point of view, the most important is perhaps the legislative elections. The presidential elections are sometimes perhaps the easiest; the legislative elections are going to be more complex, they are going to require more detailed preparation on our part, and, as you know, they are going to be carried out in accordance with an electoral law which has a majority component and also a proportional component. The different political formations throughout Palestinian political life will therefore have the opportunity to participate. It would be very significant for everybody, above all for us and for the Palestinian people, if those wanting the peace process, those wanting to make progress in the direction that President Abu Mazen made very clear during the election campaign, were to represent a majority.</p>
<p class="contents">During the election campaign, President Abu Mazen said some very courageous things, which we have listened to and applauded: issues relating to the violent intifada, the peace process and his willingness to hold dialogue. In truth, we must acknowledge what President Abu Mazen has done, both during the election campaign and during his first days in office, as extraordinary. He had the courage to say the things he had to say and he said them well, and not only has he said them, but he has put his words into practice; he has begun to apply the measures that he said he was going to apply during the election campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore absolutely essential, ladies and gentlemen, that the international community and the European Union support this process. Allow me to point out that this feeling which I would like to share with you not only exists amongst the hierarchy, in the Presidency or amongst the people who lead the Palestinian Authority at the moment. Civil society has the same feeling. I met in Ramallah with leaders from civil society and I saw that they felt and shared the same feelings, the feeling of hope and the feeling of pride, which is felt amongst businessmen and teachers, doctors and people who work in the administration. We, therefore, have the obligation to do what we can to maintain these feelings of pride and hope.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, in order to give you an idea of the situation persisting in the territories and the number of things that have to be done, please allow me to tell you a small anecdote from the meeting I held with a group of businesspeople, businesspeople who are working legitimately in Ramallah or Gaza and who are trying to contribute to economic development, in very difficult conditions. One of them said to me: ‘If I have to take a container of tomatoes, for example, from Ramallah to Gaza, it costs me twice as much as importing that same container from Hamburg (Germany) to Gaza, and takes half as long: two and a half weeks to take the container from Ramallah to Gaza, and practically a day or a day and a half from Hamburg to Gaza’. That is the economic situation also faced by those people who want to help in the economic re-establishment of the country. There is therefore a lot to do in all respects, from the political to the economic. And I hope this example will illustrate the current situation in the area to those honourable Members who have not been there.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Gaza is much more serious, ladies and gentlemen. Very few people have been in Gaza recently; I spent the whole day in Gaza, meeting with political forces and with civil society, and, at a time when we are talking about disengagement, about a withdrawal from Gaza, we must bear in mind that Gaza is effectively an area which, if not completely destroyed, has certainly changed dramatically since the last time I was there six months ago. The situation is one of extreme poverty, very great destruction, whether one visits the northern part, the part adjoining Israel, the southern part, the so-called ‘Philadelphia Corridor’, or the capital city itself, the historic city of Gaza.</p>
<p class="contents">So this is the situation we are in. But I said that the time between now and the summer is going to be very important. Why? Because of the legislative elections, as I said before, but also because the Palestinians themselves have decided to hold elections within the fundamental organisation, the organisation which is at the heart of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation; Fatah. There are also going to be elections in Fatah in the summer, which will undoubtedly mean a change in the Palestinian representative structures and undoubtedly a generational change as well within the Palestinian authorities themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that these brief comments provide us with a view of the situation from the Palestinians’ point of view. If I wanted you to remember an expression, I would like it to be the one I used before: pride in what has been done and hope in relation to what still has to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to move on to comment briefly on what I found in Israel having held talks with all the political leaders, from Prime Minister Sharon, the Foreign Affairs Minister, the Defence Minister, the defence services and also with society itself. As you know, while the elections were taking place in Palestine, there was a change of government in Israel; a change of government which, as you know, was elected by the skin of its teeth; Prime Minister Sharon’s government won by a margin of just two votes. So, although in Palestinian and Israeli society the majority in favour of peace is gradually increasing, in the <span class="italic">Knesset</span>, the Parliament, there is still such a profound division that Prime Minister Sharon failed to secure the votes of fourteen members of the majority party, of his own party, <span class="italic">Likud</span>, and the new government had to be elected as a result of the votes of a separate and minority party, the party of Yosi Beilin, and with the abstention by two members of an Arab party, who abstained in order to help the government to win.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the current situation of potential governmental instability in Israel. But the most important issue also facing us from the Israeli point of view is what we could call the abandonment of Gaza. We Europeans have stated the conditions in which we would support the withdrawal from Gaza, and in those conditions we will support it, and I believe that these conditions will come about more clearly in these circumstances. As you know, for some time our conditions have been that this process, which is known as the disengagement from Gaza, must be part of the final peace agreement we are all dreaming and thinking of and which must end in two States. The withdrawal from Gaza must not be the end of a process, but the beginning of a process which must lead to its final conclusion, which is to put an end to the occupation of the territories.</p>
<p class="contents">From that point of view, it is very important that we know the timetable for that disengagement from Gaza. The timetable practically coincides with the Palestinian election timetable. What still has to be voted for – and we will see whether this is a success at the end of March – is the approval of the budget; we will have to see whether there is a sufficient majority for the budget to be approved in the <span class="italic">Knesset</span> and, if it is approved in the <span class="italic">Knesset</span>, the disengagement process, the withdrawal from Gaza, would take place at the end of August or the beginning of September. So, ladies and gentlemen, if we could superimpose maps illustrating the respective situations in Palestine and in Israel in terms of their respective timetables, we would see that the two timetables are practically the same. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, we are facing an extremely delicate and difficult situation, but one which, as I said earlier, is full of hope and good will on the part of the majority of political players who have to play a definitive role.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we can see that, in order for this hope expressed by the Palestinians to be maintained, in order for this sense of pride to be maintained, it is absolutely essential that things begin to move, and that means action on the part of the Palestinians, and they have already taken action, and President Abu Mazen has taken very important decisions over recent days to try to put an end to the acts of violence which were preventing a resumption of negotiation and dialogue between Palestinians and Israelis. As a result of the measures he has taken, today there has been the first meeting since those which were suspended, between the heads of the offices of Prime Minister Sharon and Minister Erekat, a meeting which, I have just been told, has been positive and which has offered a little hope of being able to resume contacts between Palestinians and Israelis.</p>
<p class="contents">If everything goes well, there will be a new Palestinian Government in two weeks time, Prime Minister Abu Ala has practically completed it, and there is an agreement between President Abu Mazen and Prime Minister Sharon to hold a first high-level meeting once the government is formed. That is also the position of our Israeli friends and they are prepared to maintain the current security situation. Thanks to the efforts of President Abu Mazen, therefore, it is possible that that meeting will take place and that a dialogue will begin between the two parties which will lead to a political perspective somewhat clearer than the one we have had so far.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is it essential that there be a political perspective?</p>
<p class="contents">Without a political perspective it will be very difficult for the citizens of Palestine to maintain their sense of hope and pride in what they have done, and for us to take advantage of it. There must, therefore, as I said previously, be a political perspective, which Israel’s leaders must offer.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I do not believe it is a window of hope that has opened up, nor a door of hope. I would go further: I believe a path of hope has opened up, an avenue of hope, and we must do everything possible to ensure that that path can be taken and that we can reach its end. And we all know what the destination is: the destination is two States, a viable, democratic Palestinian state which can live side-by-side with the State of Israel, so that there is not just peace between Israel and Palestine, but that it should also have an influence on the whole of the region. I can tell you that that is the dream of all the citizens of Palestine; I believe it is the dream of many citizens of Israel and it is certainly the dream of all the citizens of Europe, and in particular all those who have dedicated much of their lives to trying to find a definitive solution to this terrible problem, which does not only have consequences for those who suffer most directly, but also further afield.</p>
<p class="contents">I like to say, and I would like to say once again, that certain countries see the problems of the Middle East as strategic problems. We do not see them as just strategic problems. We Europeans also see them as neighbourhood problems; what happens in the Middle East affects us and not just, as I have said, for strategic reasons, but also for reasons of proximity. The Middle East is in our neighbourhood, they are our neighbours, as well as our friends.</p>
<p class="contents">I must therefore insist once again that we Europeans have a great responsibility. We have been working since the first day, both with the team of the Prime Minister Abu Ala and President Abu Mazen, and with the team of Prime Minister Sharon, in order to see how we can do the two things which I mentioned previously, which are fundamental: to change the situation on the ground and to try to provide a political perspective, which can only be to return as quickly as possible to the roadmap, which is what has been agreed by all of us, the international community, in order to make progress towards that dream.</p>
<p class="contents">What can we do and what must we do? We must do at least three serious things, in cooperation with the other members of the international community wishing to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, to continue to cooperate as intensely as possible in the electoral process; I would insist, and I have already insisted, on the importance of the electoral process between now and the legislative elections and, subsequently, the elections within the Fatah organisation itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, to help from the point of view of security. As you know, we are already giving advice, support and assistance in the planning of Palestinian security forces from a European perspective, in close cooperation with a great country which is making a great effort, Egypt, so that they can mobilise and play their role in the best possible way.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we have the obligation to provide economic assistance, and we have been doing so for many years, but we should perhaps now do so, if not in a more intense manner, then at least in a more determined manner, more focussed on the fundamental priorities of the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, my time is running out; I just wanted to leave you with these initial comments. I could spend hours telling you about the emotions and experiences of these few days of great experiences and political intensity. Time does not allow me to do so, but I would like to leave you with this feeling: the feeling that there is hope, that there is opportunity, that there is a will to work, and to work together, for them and for us, and a sense of responsibility and obligation to find a way to resolve this extremely serious problem.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ferrero-Waldner,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, firstly I share the analysis of our High Representative, Mr Solana. For me it is also a pleasure to address you for the first time in a debate on the Middle East, particularly because for the first time in many years it sounds a more cautiously optimistic note. So it is wonderful to be here and to share with you the Commission’s thoughts, which of course very much complement what Mr Solana said.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, there are very encouraging developments in the region. The President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Asselborn, has just visited Jerusalem and Gaza and he feels that both parties are moving forward, as Mr Solana has just outlined. Polls taken since the Palestinian elections also show that a growing majority of Palestinians and Israelis now support a peace process and a peaceful resolution to the conflict on the basis of the two-state solution. That, per se, is a very important and encouraging development.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidential elections went very well. I am very grateful to and have a deep appreciation for Mr Michel Rocard, who has done a very good job under difficult circumstances, together with his team. I would also like to thank again the Election Observation Mission, along with Members of this Parliament who contributed to its success.</p>
<p class="contents">The political outcome of the election gives us reason for hope. Palestinian voters showed their desire for peace and democracy and the elections have now become a stimulus for a more democratic development of the region at large. At the same time we have taken good note of the election report and we will work with the Palestinians to iron out shortcomings in the election process, particularly when it comes to the independence of the Central Election Commission. We believe this is very important in the light of the forthcoming parliamentary and municipal elections.</p>
<p class="contents">We share with Mr Solana the view that Abu Mazen is a credible partner for peace and a capable interlocutor for Palestinian institution-building, including the reform of the security structures. He has already shown leadership in the last few days with the deployment of police in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, the restructuring of the security services and, as was reported in the media on Monday, agreeing with Palestinian factions on a cessation of attacks on Israel. That all adds up to a very cautiously positive movement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the international community now acts quickly to support him. The Palestinian people are expecting tangible signs of progress: improving their social and economic situation, reconstituting respect for law and order, and progress on institution-building and reform. I can promise you that the European Commission will play its part.</p>
<p class="contents">I owe a lot to my predecessor, Mr Patten, who held up the Palestinian flag at very difficult moments. I also thank those of you in Parliament who supported him. I will continue to do this and especially now, when it is even more important, because it is the right moment to do more. I hope we will also have a chance to step up our cooperation on various projects.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2004 we allocated approximately EUR 250 million, and we will provide a similar amount in 2005. We will look very carefully at where our money is being spent.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have a new instrument, decided upon in December, in the form of the action plans under our Neighbourhood Policy. These contain political and also economic measures that will assist the peace process. They include trade facilitation, the promotion of good governance and respect for human rights, understanding and combating the devastating influence of incitement to hatred, the easing of access to and promotion of respect for international humanitarian law, and encouraging cooperation on very practical issues that we hope will lead to an improvement in living conditions – the environment, water, energy and transport.</p>
<p class="contents">We also look to an improved political dialogue that will allow us to raise issues not only pertaining to the peace process but also to weapons of mass destruction. I shall be going to the region shortly and will take up these ideas with the Palestinians and the Israelis. Obviously, the parties themselves will have to do the main part of the work, in particular confidence-building. I can already see that there is a renewed willingness to do so. Israel can offer confidence-building measures, for instance on security cooperation, the release of prisoners, relaxing restrictions on movement, easing economic pressure, better enforcement of the rules of engagement and means of reducing the number of civilian causalities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the Palestinians must reciprocate or even anticipate actions on security issues. They must consolidate the intra-Palestinian ceasefire, address Israeli concerns that the ceasefire will not strengthen the extremists, collect illegal arms and close the tunnels under the Gaza-Egypt border.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many things to be done but the most important is that the European Union should be united in its wish and will – as Javier Solana said – to help both sides to go down this avenue towards a peace that is worthy of being called peace. For that, we also look to the visit of President Bush and his team to Brussels on 22 February, where the Middle East peace process will be at the top of our agenda. If we can at least take some small steps forward there, then we will have a chance to work together, in parallel with the Americans, on the broader Middle East issue, something we are both committed to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clear that many things are moving in terms of this complex equation between war and peace in Palestine: the satisfactory result of the elections in which the Union and Parliament participated – I would also like to mention the efforts of Mr Rocard and Mr McMillan-Scott and others – the fact that we must congratulate ourselves on the fact that support for terrorism in the region has dropped from 65% to 40% since June – and this figure must continue to fall – the need to consolidate a truce with the extremist organisations and the efforts being made by the new President of the Palestinian National Authority to achieve it, which has created a new climate of dialogue, and the gradual realisation by the Israeli Government that there must be a viable Palestinian state, and at the same time a withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these conditions, Mr President, are promoting the new climate and I believe that the parties must take decisions, they must take risks in order to restore the process and they must resolve this kind of situation in some way by restoring the roadmap.</p>
<p class="contents">There is now an essential premise and that is an end to violence. Violence is not the solution, violence is the problem, and the 4000 dead, the thousands of injured and the social, economic and also moral devastation of some parts of Palestine clearly demonstrate the results of this immense process of violence in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Ferrero-Waldner expressed it very clearly: unfortunately, the efforts of the parties will not be sufficient to consolidate this cessation of violence and the international community must be decisively committed. And in this regard, Mr President, the European Union must take a step in the right direction and must increase its efforts not only through its actions, but also by bringing together wills and forging consensus with the partners in the Quartet. In fact, the arrival of President Bush in Europe offers an excellent opportunity to involve the new administration in this peace process. Only through determination, only by supporting and consolidating the new Palestinian Authority, by supporting that administration, by restoring infrastructures and supporting security processes will we be able to make progress in this direction. Mr President, by keeping a firm hand on the rudder and not giving in to the scourge of terrorism, we will be able to restore the process, firstly, and then consolidate the fair and lasting peace that the region has been crying out for for almost a century. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Europe has believed in this process more than anyone else and has supported it politically and economically. Europe has a visible and substantial presence, thanks to the work of the observation mission led by our fellow Member Mr Rocard, which supported the equally remarkable work done by the Palestinian Central Election Commission, with which Parliament’s delegation, chaired by Mr McMillan-Scott, also collaborated closely.</p>
<p class="contents">The far-sighted decision by the Palestinian leadership to entrust the choice of President Arafat’s successor to a free and transparent election process won the support of an overwhelming majority in Palestinian society. Palestinians want democracy but they also want freedom. That is why they have put their trust in a leadership that can get them out of their current desperate situation. Their new leader, Mr Mahmoud Abbas, has already shown in his election campaign and especially in the measures that he is adopting that he is seriously committed both to the domestic front, through curbing violence and initiating essential reforms for Palestinian society, and to the attempt to restart the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now the Israeli Government’s turn to show the same constructive willingness, first by putting the unilateral actions it has announced, such as the withdrawal from Gaza, back into the context of the roadmap negotiations, and by putting a stop to the settlements and to construction of the illegal wall, as well as any other pointless acts which are designed to intimidate the Palestinian population and have nothing to do with security.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the elections, Europe has also gained greater credibility in its role, and perhaps it can use its influence on the United States, maybe taking the opportunity offered by President Bush’s visit, as the Commissioner mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Additionally, it is important to ensure that our commitment continues, because after the presidential elections there will be municipal and administrative elections. I believe we should support the political operation that the Palestinian leadership intends to carry out, which is to bring the Hamas and Islamic Jihad opposition groups, which have resorted to terrorism, back into the institutional fold. We must support such action in view of the prospect of establishing the two States.</p>
<p class="contents">The progress that has been made and our positive assessment of it must, however, give us cause to reflect on other crises in the Middle East. I am referring directly to Iraq, where the situation is decidedly different. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In Israel, a new government coalition has taken office and presidential elections have been held in Palestine. Those elections came about with the active support and help of the international community and particularly of the European Union, which contributed with an extensive observation mission under the supervision of Mr Rocard. Those elections were held because Israel had the wisdom to let them proceed, albeit not always without difficulty. The circumstances in East Jerusalem and the closing of the border crossing with Egypt spring to mind. However, the elections were made possible, above all, thanks to the maturity of the Palestinian people who have demonstrated their devotion to democracy, their desire for good governance and proper jurisdiction and, most of all, their desire for peace.</p>
<p class="contents">I should particularly like to pay tribute to the Palestinian women who have made a definite contribution to the successful conclusion of those elections. Were they perfect? No, they were not, but, even with their imperfections, they can be examples to the entire region, and the Palestinians are absolutely right to be proud of this. We know what the key players, being the Palestinian Authority and Israel, now need to do, and so do they, in fact. The bloodshed has to stop, and the violence has to end as an indispensable first step towards peace. President Abbas appears to be managing to dissuade the Palestinian armed movements from using violence, which is no small feat. We support him in this, and we encourage him to persevere. In Israel, the government was changed in order to carry out the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. We call on the Israeli Government to do this, to stop building the wall and to stop resorting to irresponsible violence. The most pressing tasks for Israel and Palestine are to stop the violence, restore basic security and restore a sense of normality.</p>
<p class="contents">An exceptional window of opportunity has been opened in the Middle East. I, along with my entire group, would want nothing more than for that window to become an avenue of opportunity. The European Union and the United States should now, based on their complementary roles, within the quartet and according to the roadmap, ensure as a matter of great urgency that Israel and Palestine take the road towards peace. Mr High Representative and Commissioner, you can both play a decisive role in this. Things have rarely looked so promising. What we now need is action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fire is a very small fire of hope. Hope that, despite all the setbacks, a solution can still be found in the Middle East, in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, because, let us be honest, we have, over the years, held many debates in this forum, adopted a host of resolutions full of good intentions, but, in all honesty, I think that there were many people, myself included, who considered this to be a lost cause for which a solution could never be found. It now looks as if this hopelessness has ended, or the end is in sight anyway.</p>
<p class="contents">President Arafat was succeeded by Mr Abbas, a president who is not only prepared to make sound pledges, but is also prepared to take courageous steps. The Sharon Government is made up of parties who all agree on one thing, namely withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. I realise that where the Middle East is concerned, over-optimism is always misplaced, because all it takes is one bomb attack for the momentum to be lost. Nevertheless, I think that the clearing of the Gaza Strip offers a unique opportunity, the best opportunity in years, to break the mood of cynicism and scepticism and finally to take a step forward. That does mean, however, that the role of the European Union must also change. The European Union must switch from fine, general statements to very concrete and specific aid in the clearing operations, in order to ensure that these run smoothly. What does that mean according to the European Parliament and also my group? Those clearing operations can only be carried out in consultation between Israel and the Palestinians in the presence of an international observation mission.</p>
<p class="contents">What can the European Union do exactly, and what is it prepared to do? In a consultation with Foreign Affairs Ministers in November 2004, the High Representative repeated the Council’s decision from March 2004. The European Union supports the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, provided that five conditions are met. It must form part of the roadmap, it must be a step towards a two-state solution. So far, so good, I think, but Israel should not use the clearing of the Gaza Strip to create new settlements on the West Bank or to extend old settlements. The transfer must be done in consultation with the Palestinian Authority and Israel must help reconstruct the Gaza Strip. That is, of course, where the problems lie. Hence my question to the High Representative. Are, according to him, those conditions currently being met or is there a chance that they may be met in the short term? If not, what will the European Union do to ensure that those conditions are met and, if they are not met, what will the European Union do then? Will we walk away? I hope not but, if we are serious, then we must try to meet our own conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Okay, let us be optimistic, because a good dose of optimism is called for where this issue is concerned, and let us assume that the conditions are met. What concrete measures will the EU then take? Once again, we should now move away from fine statements and make way for concrete proposals. Will we, for example, help send an observation mission? This is included in all the plans, but will the EU take part in this? What exactly will we do together with the United States? Will we mediate? Is there a request from Israel, or one from the Palestinians? Will we fund the reconstruction? Not in general, but very specifically – if you visit the Gaza Strip, you know what is damaged and what should be restored – are there plans to that effect? Once again, Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, the clearing of the Gaza Strip offers a golden opportunity to move forward. If we miss this opportunity, if things go wrong in the Gaza Strip, then I fear that we may be picking up the pieces for a very long time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must say that I met many Palestinians who were delighted that he was there and extremely proud that he had stayed overnight in Ramallah.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to focus especially on tangible facts in my speech. The Palestinians have done their part, as Mrs Ferrero-Waldner said yesterday, and have clearly chosen peace, democracy and freedom. They have chosen Abu Mazen’s programme, which comes out clearly and decisively against the slide into military action, whether terrorist attacks against Israeli citizens or an armed struggle of the kind even envisaged by the Geneva Convention and considered to be legitimate, which I cannot agree with. They have thus chosen precisely a plan for reform, peace and democracy. I believe it is important to respond to any requests and to any change or shift in their position.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the proposal for a unilateral withdrawal from Gaza should also be welcomed, provided that it really is a withdrawal and, above all, that it is carried out as part of the roadmap and part of the negotiations. I think that the Quartet needs to take the reins very firmly again to prevent what happened after the Oslo agreement from recurring. Then, the international community stood back and let two disparate, unequal parties build settlements and communities on the one hand and carry out extremist, terrorist attacks on the other. An international presence is therefore important.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it is also useful to see what is actually happening. Apart from the elections and the prospect of withdrawal, another fundamental factor also needs to be taken into account: the concrete measures that the Sharon government has put into practice over the last two weeks. I shall confine myself to mentioning just a few of them.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens of East Jerusalem can no longer go to Ramallah, which means not only that their economic life has been destroyed but, even worse, that a piece of land – East Jerusalem – which we consider occupied, has been annexed. It is not therefore just a question of the annexation of Jerusalem, as a single, indivisible capital, but of the annexation of the citizens of East Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="contents">The properties of Palestinians who live in Bethlehem, Bejallah and Ramallah and the properties of Palestinians in East Jerusalem are being confiscated. Carrying out such an operation now, when there is a peace plan, means emphasising the fact that even private properties belonging to Palestinian citizens who do not live in Jerusalem but in Bejallah are being confiscated. These are not just issues of secondary importance: they are issues that cause a shift in attitude even among those Palestinians who trust in the future and have found hope in the possibility of peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, there is the Gaza question. I was in Gaza during the elections. Rafah has been closed for 87 days. Thousands of innocent Palestinians, who are not even presumed to be terrorists, are blockaded within Gaza’s borders and sleep in the streets as they have run out of money. Even the Egyptian taxi drivers are distressed to see Palestinians reduced to nothing. In addition, there is the Israeli Defence Force’s proposal to destroy 3 000 houses to stop the tunnels.</p>
<p class="contents">All things considered, therefore, it is important that we should press ahead with the roadmap and seize every chance for peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Does this mean that it will also be equally enthusiastic towards the coming elections in Iraq? The Iraqis are surely just as deserving of democracy as the Palestinians.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be interesting to see if President Abbas has the will or the ability to curtail the murderous activities of the various terrorist organisations in his domain. Since the European Parliament had 28 observers present at the elections, perhaps they will report what role, if any, was played by Hamas, Fatah and the other terrorist groups in the election.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has, I believe, spent EUR 17 million of taxpayers’ money on assistance to the Palestinian elections. What proof do we have that this money was properly spent and accounted for? What proof do we have that none of this money found its way into the pockets of terrorist organisations? The European Union has no legitimacy to play a part in the Palestinian – or any other state’s – elections, but if it is going to pour millions of euros into them, then we should at least know where they have gone.</p>
<p class="contents">It is remarkable, is it not, that the late President Arafat – who was purportedly a lifelong and selfless champion of an impoverished people – seems nevertheless to have possessed enough part-time entrepreneurial skills to accumulate a multi-million dollar fortune. If only he had thought to remember the Palestinian people in his will to a sufficient extent, then the recent elections could have been staged by his generosity, rather than as a further burden on the European taxpayer.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union insists on providing funding in the field of Middle Eastern politics, given its legendary levels of corruption we can at least ask that it receive and keep the receipts for its expenditure, contrary to practice to date! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">During our mission we saw that the people of Palestine have a strong desire for freedom and are looking forward to a return to normality and peace. Despite the violence of recent weeks, the presidential elections have indeed ushered in a new scenario in the Middle East and have set an example to the whole Arab world. For that very reason, the European Union must now take a central role and do all it can to support the peace process, first of all by relaunching the roadmap, which is still the starting point for resuming negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">In that respect, this morning’s news that talks between the Palestinian National Authority and Israel are reopening augurs well. The first major event in the new peace process will be the London Conference, to be held in March; security, the consolidation of democracy, and political, institutional and economic reforms in Palestine will be on the agenda. Europe will at last have an opportunity to exercise its authority in the peace process and also, I believe, to put forward an economic programme to foster development.</p>
<p class="contents">We are surprised to hear it said sometimes that action of that kind would be premature and that the European Union would not be prepared to support it. On the contrary, this is precisely the time for the Union to take the political centre stage with concrete action to support the development of the Palestinian economy, by means of an EU-monitored programme characterised as a new Marshall Plan for Palestine, as was proposed by Italy the day after 11 September and recently put forward again by the United Kingdom. I also believe that that is the way for Palestine to escape from the poverty and marginalisation that all too often swell the ranks of fundamentalism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I represent Northern Ireland, a state which itself knows all about terrorism, and I can readily empathise with a small country that, since its inception, has found itself subjected to sustained and vicious terrorist attack. That empathy is increased by the fraternal links, over many years, between the IRA and the PLO. The historical record shows that active cooperation between the PLO and the IRA resulted in funding and training being arranged for the IRA in Middle Eastern countries, and for years we had the spectacle of official PLO delegates attending Sinn Féin conferences. As purveyors of death and destruction, they had much in common.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as there must be no room for terrorism in Europe, so a prerequisite for political progress in the Middle East is an end to all terrorism. I therefore encourage Mr Sharon to be resolute in refusing to deal with active terrorist organisations. Drawing on Northern Ireland’s experience, I can tell him that pandering to terrorism never works: it only encourages its insatiable demands and breeds a political representation that is wedded to the muscle of terrorism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is now a real hope for peace in the Middle East after the generally free and fair election which took place to elect a successor to Yasser Arafat. At Arafat’s funeral in Cairo, where I represented the European Parliament, intense discussion was already beginning about his successor and the opportunity for a new start. I congratulate Mr Solana for his active engagement in the region since that funeral and until today, and I urge him to continue it.</p>
<p class="contents">For the presidential election, the European Parliament sent its largest ever election observation mission. There were 28 Members of the European Parliament, chaired by myself, with Mrs Napoletano as deputy chairman, and we arrived in Jerusalem a few days before the election. I wish to thank all colleagues on that mission – many of whom are here tonight, Parliament’s staff for their outstanding support, and the interpreters. Our delegation met the two principal candidates – Mahmoud Abbas and Mustafa Barghouti – as well as the chairman of the Electoral Commission and Mr Rocard, who will be speaking shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">As chairman I laid a wreath at Arafat’s tomb in the Muqata. I also met smaller political parties contesting the elections and, in a completely private capacity, other Palestinian groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament delegation was consistently met with enthusiasm and confidence in the role that the European Union could play in furthering the democratic process. The Palestinians’ aspiration for EU support was clear, with the European Union flag everywhere. Now we must look to the future and support the Palestinians in their preparations for the legislative elections and their reform of the electoral law.</p>
<p class="contents">However, my main message tonight is that the presidential election was a model for the rest of the Arab world, where no democracy exists. Mahatma Gandhi once said, ‘the spirit of democracy cannot be imposed from without’. Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, however, said yesterday to the Euro-Mediterranean Assembly, ‘we can encourage democracy, and we will’. I wholeheartedly support this view and believe that in this, the tenth anniversary year of the Barcelona Process, it is time for the European Union decisively to raise its game in the wider Middle East. After all, this is our neighbourhood, not the Americans’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rocard (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, High Representative, I should like to thank you for your excellent introductory remarks and for all of the congratulations that you have addressed to me. I was proud to do this work and one of the things that I can say about it is that we were extremely well received by both sides. Europe was most welcome, even from Israel’s point of view, I must say.</p>
<p class="contents">If I run over time, I shall miss my train; I shall therefore be brief and I should be grateful if you could forgive my rudeness because I do not have the time to listen to your responses. All I can do in the rather ridiculous amount of time that we have for debates is to point out the crucial points that should continue to be the focus of your attention.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the forthcoming elections in Palestine will be considerably less straightforward than the previous ones, in which there was effectively only one candidate, no real battle for power and no Hamas candidate. This time it will be different, both for the municipal and for the legislative elections. The elections will be fiercely contested. I hope that the Palestinians can be persuaded to abandon the use of the civil identity register and that the municipal elections are monitored as closely as the subsequent legislative elections; this is important.</p>
<p class="contents">Some have said, I understand, that this is a window of opportunity and a ray of hope. The main element of that ray of hope is based on the undeniable quality and depth of the Palestinian people’s democratic will. My friend Mr McMillan-Scott said this straightaway. He is right – this is a choice to pursue peace, as well as a choice to pursue democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We are less sure about the other side. Mr Sharon’s decision to pull out of Gaza is to be applauded, but I should like to draw the House’s attention to the fact that, from our point of view and that of the roadmap, there is no link in Prime Minister Sharon’s rhetoric between Gaza and the rest, and he offers no guarantee that, after Gaza, he is considering the West Bank and Jerusalem. This is an absolutely key issue.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the eradication of terrorism. There is much that we can do. Mr Sharon is right to set demands, Mahmoud Abbas is right to set about doing this and is doing so with courage. He is sociologically under an occupying foreign force, so it is impossible to eradicate terrorism completely. I feel that Mr Sharon, an experienced general, knows what he is talking about; he knows that by demanding an end to all terrorism before any talks can resume, he is asking the impossible so that he can be sure of not getting it. Perhaps he needs to be told that terrorism will be eradicated from Palestine when, as one people, the Palestinians will be able to hope for a different life. This will involve the economy, opening the borders, trade, work, creativity and a political perspective. These are the conditions, and I feel that it is our duty, as well as that of the international community, to remind him.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out that, until now, nothing has contradicted the tragic analysis made by an eminent Israeli academic in a book that you know well, High Representative, because I lent it to you. According to this academic, Mr Sharon respects the Palestinians, does not want them to die of hunger, but is engaged in demolishing any collective identity and, in his heart, rejects the idea of a State. We should take this analysis further in our speeches and our work, in order to put pressure on him.</p>
<p class="contents">My last message is that I do not believe that either in Israel or in Palestine will a political authority have the legitimacy to convince people of the need to sacrifice certain symbols for peace, be it Jerusalem or the right of return, while the religious authorities themselves fail to preach peace and the sharing of those symbols based on consensus. Without that, we shall achieve nothing. Please tell them that from us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would add that one could also see an expression of patriotism.</p>
<p class="contents">The people who were voting and those in control of the voting process were truly expressing a sovereignty which, in some cases, contained a degree of genuine civil resistance, in the style of Gandhi. Voting was a way of saying, ‘This is ours, this is our territory and our future is here, but we shall live here in peace through the ballot box’.</p>
<p class="contents">Their message contained all of that and there is, therefore, huge cause for hope, but we are well aware that if frustration comes, it is always directly proportional to the hope which preceded it. The responsibility, therefore, of all of us in Europe, and the European Union itself, who have contributed to generating this hope, is now immense, even greater, in fact, than it was before the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Solana, you have described the situation very well – and so has Mrs Ferrero-Waldner – but you have described it very specifically and have pointed out certain guidelines. You mentioned what the European Union could do for Palestine. I will not add anything to what Mr Rocard said with regard to the elections, because I believe he is absolutely right: security and economy. I would like to talk a little more about what the European Union expects from Israel within the framework of that disengagement, that withdrawal from Gaza which, if it takes place in a strictly unilateral fashion, without any coordination or any negotiated and agreed process, may not be good or at least may have certain counter-productive affects.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe that the European Union has the responsibility – as other speakers have said – to prioritise introducing this issue into the restoration of transatlantic dialogue. The Transatlantic Agenda is going to be reviewed in two days time. The European Union must make this issue an absolute priority. In that way, the European Union can make a spectacular contribution to this peace process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is one of the visible expressions of the positive Europeanism of all the European citizens with regard to this work towards peace in the Middle East. The ball is now in Israel's court. We have a Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, who is taking a stand against violence, not just through words but through actions, and who, furthermore, has the legitimacy of having been elected democratically.</p>
<p class="contents">Israel cannot remain passive in this situation. Israel must respond to Mahmoud Abbas with concrete measures. It is not just necessary for the European Union to call for a truce and the disarmament of the Palestinian activists, but it must also urge Israel to put an end to its policy of selective assassinations and immediately halt the construction of the wall in the occupied territories. Meanwhile, the ‘Quartet’ must take measures to remove controls and allow the Palestinians access to employment and trade. After many years of conflict, it is clear that the Palestinian and Israeli societies are suffering great fatigue, weariness and sadness, which may paradoxically offer a glimmer of hope at this point. But Israel must respond to this glimmer of hope. A first step towards reopening the path of negotiation would be a negotiated withdrawal from Gaza, verified by an international mission organised by the European Union within the framework of the ‘Quartet’.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe, furthermore, that one of the problems is that we cannot begin with a step-by-step approach, we cannot say what Mr Bush said: ‘We will have a Palestinian state in 2005’. We are in 2005 according to the roadmap and now Mr Bush says that we will have a Palestinian state in 2009. We must reduce the time between the beginning and the end. The Palestinian people and the Israeli people are mature enough to see the light at the end of the tunnel. According to the opinion polls, the two peoples are in favour of a political pact in order to achieve a definitive status similar to the Geneva Agreement. Furthermore, this definitive status, of a permanent nature, is very similar to the agreement almost reached by the two parties in Taba at the end of 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">That is a fact and I believe that the European Union must take this opportunity to put pressure on Israel to respond to this stance of the new Palestinian leadership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This event constitutes a major political act, which sends political messages both to Israel and to the entire international community. On 9 January, the Palestinian people sent a clear message of dignity, of absolute attachment to democracy, peace and the fight for independence. The elections were held freely and democratically, with increased participation by women and young people, and for that they deserve congratulations. The problems, which related mainly to East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, were caused for two reasons: one reason was the stand of the Israeli authorities and the other reason was the – in our opinion – poor arrangement agreed between the Palestinians, the Israelis and the European Union in the 1996 agreement whereby, out of 120 000 voters, only 6 000 voted, sending their ballot paper via the Israeli post office, while the rest would have had to travel to other areas of the West Bank in the midst, moreover, of conflicting information. Nonetheless, the day after the election opens new prospects for the resumption of the peace process. The winner has declared and clearly expressed his intention to continue with a demilitarised, peaceful resolution of the problem based on international law, the UN resolutions and the roadmap. The new President, with the contacts which he had recently with the armed organisations, must have managed, we believe, to persuade them to proceed with a unilateral ceasefire, an action which we hope will lead to a truce which will break the vicious circle of violence and will be very helpful to the resumption of the peace process. He also appears to be prepared for a series of internal reforms aimed at economic, social and political development, despite the unfortunate circumstances which exist by reason of the occupation. At the same time, however, with the efforts which the Palestinian President has started to make in order to get the peace process restarted, signs of good intentions will also be needed on the part of the Israeli Government. Unfortunately, the construction of the wall, which was so roundly condemned by the international community, including in an opinion by the International Court, is still continuing, as are the settlements. On the basis of the roadmap, 2005 would be the year of the declaration of an independent Palestinian State. Nonetheless, 2005 is here, without any such prospect in sight. We, as the European Union and as the European Parliament in particular, have a very important role to play in efforts to resume talks and find a definitive solution to the problem. Over and above the theoretical level via resolutions and so on, we also need to find a more practical way of lobbying in all directions for material talks which will result during 2005 in significant progress and in a quick definitive solution to the problem, a solution which cannot but include the foundation of an independent Palestinian State in peaceful coexistence with the State of Israel and, of course, the destruction of the wall and an end to the occupation, so that the two nations can build a peaceful future which will contribute to peace and progress for the entire, long-suffering area of the Middle East as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, allow me once again, on behalf of my group, to assure the Palestinian people and the forces of peace in Israel that they will find in us supporters of their efforts for peace and a resolution to the problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If, in 1948, when we gave shelter – a state – to Israel, we had done the same for the Palestinians, many people would have been saved; the wars which killed so many thirty to thirty-five years ago would probably not have taken place. The attack on 11 September might also not have taken place, if we accept the public explanation of the accessory to the event, Bin Laden. The death of Iphigenia brought a favourable wind for Agamemnon. The death of Arafat (sometime terrorist, sometime negotiator, sometime Noble peace prize winner, whatever served the status quo at the time) and also the death of Sharon's monocracy in Israel may perhaps bring the favourable wind of peace. If we do not act effectively and immediately, this golden opportunity will be lost. Terrorism will escalate, both state terrorism, which is cruder, but also the terrorism of independent marksmen. The United States appears to be changing course; it wants to leave, to turn away from the Middle East and go towards Russia, with everything that implies. We, however, live in the area, we shelter 40 million Arabs, we here in this place failed to give Jews the chance to live through the Nazi occupation.

Once again, the European Union is pandering to the interests of the United States, as well as funding ill-advised operations to interfere in another country’s affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way that attempts are being made to impose a European constitution on taxpayers without their having a say, funds are being siphoned off to maintain the shameful, pointless occupation of Iraq. The European Union is sailing blind through the stormy seas of this occupation, while the hulking flagship of the allied invaders is sinking and taking with it those countries in the Union that have not been able to remain independent of the heinous geopolitics of the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The overwhelming majority of Iraqis, who see the occupying forces as the reason for the fall in living standards since the downfall of Saddam Hussein’s regime, will not take part in sham elections which the official propaganda, with media complicity, depicts as a crucial opportunity for a transition to democracy. The intention is to pass off the US attempt to survive their obvious attrition, at least politically, as significant elections that will lay the foundations for the new Iraqi State.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a disgrace to commit human resources to supporting and thus politically validating the elections in Iraq. We will be legitimising a puppet administration and passing it off as a democracy, thus continuing our complicity with the invasion of Iraq, the grounds for which have been shown to be utterly false. The invasion has been followed not just by brutality but also by countless verified episodes of corruption, waste, inflated accounting and fraud, to the detriment of the administration itself.</p>
<p class="contents">All this is more than enough for me to call on Parliament, on behalf of all Europeans, to dissociate itself from any legitimisation of the elections in Iraq, thus sparing us all the dishonour of being politically and morally complicit in that colossal political and media fraud. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The election of Abu Mazen and the manner in which it was accomplished; the formation in Israel of a new coalition government with voter support across party lines; a new American President, embarking on a term in which he sees no need to make himself re-electable: all these factors, I think, make for a scenario that has been almost unknown in the Middle East in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">Abu Mazen’s deployment of his police and his negotiations with radical groups have made it apparent that he is in a position to impose conditions that President Arafat always rejected and of which he was not capable. I see this as a reason why we now really have to make use of this particular situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore ask you, Commissioner, and you in particular, Mr Solana, to ensure that the Quartet should now become more than just an institution in which papers are drafted and dialogue carried on, and, with all the clout at their individual and joint disposal, should intervene in order to tell the Middle East that this is not just any old agenda, but is backed up by the entire commitment of the whole international community; as a demonstration of our desire for a solution and, at the same time, in order to show the parties that we can guarantee their security and development.</p>
<p class="contents">None of the Quartet’s members has the credibility in the eyes of both sides to manage all this on its own. Only if they act together will such a security framework have sufficient credibility to be capable of being accepted, so that, at one and the same time, Israel can be safe behind secure borders, and Palestine an economically viable state.</p>
<p class="contents">In the hope that progress may be achieved, let me make a final comment. On both sides, people want peace and rapprochement. We now have to help put together a coalition of moderates on both sides and prevent the radicals – who are a minority – from again preventing a settlement. This is in our interest, and we should therefore give it priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, for your commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, if I may, to take you back to the Iraqi elections and to express my concern. These elections are scheduled for Sunday and form part of Bush’s political exit strategy, legitimised by UN Resolution No 446. The plan was to hand back self-determination to the Iraqi people, yet since it has been in place, tensions have continued to rise. The occupying forces have been unable to transform themselves into peace-keeping forces and the appalling behaviour at Abu Ghraib prison was indicative of this. Attempts to recreate Iraqi forces, especially a police force, have been punctuated by attacks targeted against those who, unfortunately, are sometimes deemed collaborators with the enemy power. This is a failure. It is those same Iraqi forces, supported in the background by the US forces, which will be looking after the polling stations. Sunni extremists are boycotting these elections and the increase in Shiite fundamentalist movements, whose arrival Iran is viewing most favourably, gives rise to fear of a theocracy in place of a new democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The holding of these elections is completely bizarre. Not one condition has been fulfilled that would give legitimacy to the winner and bring peace; far from it. The feeling is that there will be further violence. It is therefore hard to believe that a constitution will emerge free from Sharia, one that respects women’s rights, unless a firm grip is kept on the writers’ pens.</p>
<p class="contents">The timetable for 2005 is incredible: a constitution on 15 August, a referendum on 15 October, legislative elections on 15 December and a new government on 31 December. What does the Council make of this headlong rush? Do you believe it is feasible? Should we in fact believe it is feasible, Mr Solana? Is there a European strategy on this issue? I would hope so, to preclude the possibility of occasional rhetoric that may be close to mine but with which I do not agree. I feel that we must not keep silent about these elections; such silence would be a sign of ambivalence and that is not something I would want. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Members of this House have repeatedly expressed their hope that not only will the peace process in Palestine be resumed, but that recent events in the country will amount to the start of democracy building, and of building what may be the first democracy in Arab countries. Of course, building this democracy will not be the simplest of tasks. We are all aware of the scale of the country’s problems, for example the widespread corruption. It is common knowledge that democracy must not consist merely of civilian control over law-enforcement agencies, such as the police and the secret service. In order for democracy to be meaningful, the authorities’ actions, and most importantly the budget, must also be transparent. The reason I say this is that the European Union is providing significant amounts of financial aid to the Palestinian Authority, and will of course continue to do so. It is important for these funds to be accounted for, so that we know how they have been spent. It is, however, equally important that the entire budget of the Palestinian Authority, including those items funded from sources other than the European Union, should be entirely visible and clear for everyone. This would ensure that in future it would be impossible to accuse the Palestinian Authority of something it is still frequently accused of, namely funding the actions of terrorist groups that are in no way conducive to peace activities.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I should like to make is that we would all like this process to culminate not only in peace between the Palestinian Authority and Israel, but for this peace to become a genuine peace throughout the whole region, and not the kind of peace that existed in Europe during the years of the Warsaw Pact and the Cold War. We should therefore start to consider certain methods for building trust that we have already tried out in Europe, with extremely satisfactory results. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Work to extend the erection of the wall of shame and confiscate the property of Palestinians expelled from East Jerusalem has resumed, despite the fact that the pretext which the Israeli Government put forward in the past about its Palestinian counterpart's alleged lack of conciliatoriness has crumbled.</p>
<p class="contents">The intransigence of the Israeli Government is being fed by the policy of the United States of America and the European Union. Even in the resolution, the so-called terrorism of the Palestinians is ranked as the first issue. A new slanderous campaign is under way to connect the Palestinians with Iran and Syria as an axis of evil and source of terrorism, in order to justify the intransigence of the Israeli Government and prepare public opinion to accept the new imperialist interventions and wars being planned with the aggressive plan for the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that, even in today's debate, an endeavour has been made, in an unacceptable manner, to connect a European party which belongs to the European Parliament, Sinn Féin, with terrorism.

We must encourage both parties to resume peace negotiations, as we all want the Israelis to live in peace, without terrorist attacks, and the Palestinians to regain their lost dignity.

The Middle East is far from being free of racism, xenophobia and hatred. Palestinian textbooks which are sponsored by the EU are still full of anti-Semitism, explaining Zionism as the source of the word ‘evil’.</p>
<p class="contents">The Palestinian elections represent a light at the end of the tunnel. The work done by the EU was very good. The representation of women was very good. Second place for Mustafa Barghouti is a democratic dream. Nevertheless, cautious optimism must be our stand. We should offer an opportunity to Mahmoud Abbas to conciliate security forces, to come up with legislative and economic reform. We should strengthen the position of the Quartet, instead of confusing it with the Geneva initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also be aware of the very sensitive situation in Israel. We should, today of all days, recognise the right of Israeli people to self-defence, the right of mothers and fathers to secure the lives of their children by that unfortunate security measure, the security wall. It is not yet time to dismantle it, not until Hamas no longer has the upper hand in security in the area.</p>

<p class="contents">The key to stability and economic growth in the region lies in a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The deadlock in recent years has prevented the European Union from making its influence felt, unfortunately confirming the US diplomatic joke of ‘we play you pay’, meaning ‘we have political power and you pick up the bill’.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been through a terrible year: in the United States we saw the election year make George Bush focus entirely on the war in Iraq; in Israel the Sharon government shut the door on negotiations; and in Palestine Yasser Arafat’s personal and political troubles paralysed the National Authority.</p>
<p class="contents">That impasse cost dear in terms of human lives, misery and despair. Many of us wondered whether there was still room for hope and whether any dialogue was possible. Today, as Mr Solana has explained, a window of opportunity has opened which we must make use of. The United States has a President in his second term of office who can devote himself to the Israeli-Palestinian question with some room for manoeuvre. The new Israeli Government, with figures like Shimon Peres, is choosing dialogue. In Palestine we are pleased to have helped in and witnessed the first presidential election, won by Mahmoud Abbas, who now enjoys strong popular and international legitimacy. We support his initial measures, such as the attempt to impose a cease-fire on the radical groups.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time for the Union to make itself heard loud and clear. The Union must act as a force for stability, and no other player, not even the United States, has the assets that we have, in other words the political stability and the resources to support economic growth in the region. It is time to use these assets and to relaunch the roadmap and the Quartet. If we believe, as I do, in the Union’s foreign policy and in Europe as a global player, now is the time to put our ideas into action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As an election observer, I was delighted to see the enthusiasm by civil society, including women, to participate in this experiment, unique in the Arab world. In spite of calls by Hamas for a boycott, even that organisation, afraid of being frozen out of the political process, is now talking of taking part in the parliamentary elections. Abu Mazen now has a strong mandate to negotiate with Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">I was disappointed at the low turnout in East Jerusalem and the fear of Palestinians resident there that they would lose their Israeli IDs if they voted. I was unhappy at the refusal of many polling-station officials to cooperate in releasing turnout figures and the size of the electoral list. There was some confusion between domestic and international observers, which must be sorted out before the parliamentary elections in July.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank the IDF for its cooperation at checkpoints. After the temporary setback caused by the tragic death of six Israelis in Gaza, President Abbas is now making a vigorous attempt to rein in the terrorists by deploying his security forces to the Gaza border. I call upon Prime Minister Sharon to recognise this by restoring diplomatic contacts with the Palestinian Authority and putting the roadmap for peace back on the political agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that a comprehensive peace plan through territorial exchange, which consolidates the security of the Jewish State, is possible. I also believe the security fence has proven its value in reducing suicide-bomber attacks, does not reflect the final borders of the Israeli State and can be moved or dismantled when a peace treaty is finally signed.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent polls in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza support the Geneva Accords as one such peace model. Why not a simultaneous official plebiscite by both sides to reinforce mutual recognition of the two-state solution?</p>

The impact of this continuing conflict has adversely affected neighbouring populations in the Arabian Peninsula, the Persian Gulf, North Africa, and has reached as far as Europe and the USA. The conflict has resulted in injuries and deaths for thousands; poverty and distress for millions.</p>
<p class="contents">The persistent attention and the combined strengths of the whole of the United Nations, including the European Union, has brought little or no relief for the population of both opponents. Quarrels of this intensity, that stretch back to the roots of nations’ histories, have only one key that can open the door to peace. Money will not do it, although it can ease the pain of continued poverty. Power is hopeless in moving the minds of man. Outsiders can only suggest: without force they cannot take the executive decisions required. The fundamental change from violence to peaceful solutions; the move from the use of weapons of war to dialogue as a means of reaching acceptable answers; there is only one thing that will tilt the balance, and that is the will of the people. Once that is secured and is allowed by the men of violence to be expressed, democracy is the only formula for complete success.</p>
<p class="contents">Today the Palestinians have spoken, their voice has been expressed peacefully through the ballot box. The result is that the Union’s twenty-one year search for the two-state solution is now within reach. If this is good for Palestine, why should we deny democracy to the remainder of the Arabian Peninsula and beyond? I have high hopes for the coming election in Iraq, and elections that may happen later on in other states of the world where violence and non-peaceful solutions are used. This spread of democracy is the European Union’s task now. It is one in which we can join hands with our American allies. Where Palestine leads, Iraq can follow and perhaps other states will take the same solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Palestinian people now have a legitimate President and a valid interlocutor to negotiate peace with Israel. President Abbas needs to be given both the time and encouragement to consolidate his position and to implement his electoral programme, that is, firstly to end the armed Intafada and prioritise the political process, and secondly, to proceed to the necessary internal institutional and – in particular – security reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">The news of recent days indicates that there are already some positive effects on the ground. The deployment of Palestinian policemen in northern Gaza and the reported progress in talks with the armed factions have led to four days of calm followed possibly by a ceasefire. Given the precarious nature of such ceasefires, it will be helpful that substantial gestures – such as the lifting of the restrictions of movement, the freezing of settlement activity, the halting of the construction of the separation wall and extra-judicial killings – will go a long way towards creating the favourable context of this window of opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision by the EU to send such a large mission to assist and observe the election, and to nominate as its head an eminent member of this Parliament, was commendable, as it made our presence felt both locally and internationally. Great efforts on the EU’s behalf are now needed within the context of the Quartet, to encourage both sides to capitalise on the developments in the interests of peace. The objective is to resume negotiations, which will regenerate hope. Hope strengthens moderation, frustration allows extremists to thrive. That is the only way the vicious circle can be broken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since 1948, the Israeli-Palestinian war has caused thousands of victims, many of them civilians, and enormous poverty. Two-thirds of Palestinian terrorists were university students or had finished high school, and Israelis are known to have a high level of education.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the election of Abu Mazen, which was a testimony to the great commitment of the Palestinian people to democracy, a further terrorist attack has led to difficulties in the recently resumed talks. Condemned to living next to each other whether they want to or not, and beset with complex problems to solve, the two peoples have now entered a new stage in their relations with each other, a stage that admits some hope. Indeed, contrary to expectations, the elections in Palestine went well and the new leader has stated his intention to resume peace negotiations with Israel, to curb the extremists and to reform the corrupt aspects of Palestinian domestic affairs. That may be too ambitious a programme, but it does show a willingness to change. Israel, for its part, opened talks with the new government, but they have stalled because of an unexpected spiral of violence that has frozen relations.</p>
<p class="contents">By monitoring the electoral process, the European Union has strengthened its position as a favoured negotiator, showing its readiness and ability to talk to both peoples. Things must not stop now. The Union’s role is to act as guarantor of a plan for a permanent solution and in the meantime to provide both peoples with a firm basis of help with a view to change. It is time for Europe to accept its responsibilities towards the Middle East, as our own security is also directly threatened by that interminable conflict. A solution to it can only be found by negotiating a sound, permanent peace agreement such as that envisaged in the roadmap.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community ought to help to create a Palestinian State, but at the same time it must help to solve the problems of borders, settlements, refugees, Jerusalem, water resources and security. As Shimon Peres once said, the hope is that after the time of hatred there will come a time of sharing, because the two peoples will have to divide a small tract of land between them; they will have to grow up together in mutual respect and learn to share. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is what made this election so significant, and the desire for peace was tangible; people have had enough of conflict, and Hamas and its call for a boycott were ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that all those – and there were some of them in this House – who have constantly been telling us that it was Arafat who guaranteed peace and that when he was no longer there, the situation would descend into chaos, misjudged the situation. The people of Palestine were much more astute than some of the European analysts of the situation thought they would be, and that is why there are such great hopes riding on what is happening there now.</p>
<p class="contents">There is something I would ask both Mr Solana and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner to raise in their talks. According to press reports, Mr Sharon told our High Representative that withdrawal from Gaza had been agreed on in talks with the authorities of the Palestinian Autonomous Territories; if that is indeed the case and it proves possible to hand it over in an orderly manner, then we, and the UNHCR, should give some thought to using that as an opportunity to convert the refugee camps into permanent dwellings.</p>
<p class="contents">Our working party on the United Nations was joined this morning by Mr Hansen, from the UNHCR. He described how, after the destruction of the camp in Jenin, the decision was taken to build proper houses, so that the people would at last, after 50 years, no longer be refugees. I see Gaza as offering a second opportunity to get the refugees out of their camps and into permanent settlements, once the handover has been properly accomplished. I therefore ask that this idea be considered in talks with UNRWA and with the authorities concerned, in order that this situation may come to an end and a new era may begin. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sunday’s election in Iraq will be exciting – a perhaps historic opportunity for a nascent democracy. I should like to say thank you to Mr Solana and the Commissioner for their constructive and perceptive contributions. It is good to hear such commitment expressed. The election in Palestine and the new government in Israel offer new hope. Ariel Sharon must, however, help Mahmoud Abbas be successful, for otherwise there is no way forward in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">I was myself on an observation visit to the West Bank in November and saw with my own eyes how terrible and desperate the situation is there, especially for the many Palestinians who at present live below the poverty line and under incredibly difficult conditions because of the Israeli occupation. It is a poverty created not by natural disasters or such like but by the Israeli occupation. Israel’s right to hunt down terrorists must of course be recognised, and the Palestinians must also do everything they can to bring the violence to an end. Israel’s right to hunt down terrorists does not, however, mean that every possible means has to be used. The illegal executions, the house demolitions and the excessive use of power in relation to civilians is unacceptable. The illegally erected security wall also constitutes a special problem because it has been predominantly erected on Palestinian land and makes it impossible for the Palestinians to cultivate the land in these areas. Jerusalem, where Palestinians are separated not from Israelis but from each other, is also a special problem. The major expropriation of land, combined with the settlements policy, makes it difficult to see how a sustainable Palestinian State might be established. It is particularly worrying to see how a double infrastructure is in the process of being developed on the West Bank. The facts on the ground show that the occupation now has more to do with creating secure conditions for the many settlers than with creating security for Israeli citizens living in Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must demand of Israel that it cease developing settlements on the West Bank and stop constructing the security wall. Otherwise, the opportunity for a two-state solution will have been missed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Israelis are living in a very difficult situation, as they have to cope with the constant risk of terrorist attacks, while the Palestinians are living in a thoroughly unacceptable situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone like me who has recently been an observer during the elections for the Palestinian President has had first-hand experience of a reality that seems incredible if viewed according to ordinary rules and criteria. I must confirm, by the way, that the elections went impeccably, despite the local situation.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Palestinian world, people live without any points of reference, without any certainties, in a social situation of total decay in environmental, employment and organisational terms. In the Israeli world, people live in a constant search for a means of defence. Aid and support come in from many places but, so far at least, they have not led to any tangible results. I believe we need to know what resources the Union has committed to the area in recent years, with what aims and under whose responsibility. I also think it appropriate that future investments should be aimed at improving the quality of life in the Palestinian lands.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, it is not enough to make donations, but we also need to check how the money is being spent. In that respect, I await an answer from you to a specific question of mine. I believe that a real commitment for the future, together with the political commitment to facilitate negotiations between the two States, which will also be aided by the new Palestinian Presidency, may perhaps in future produce an outcome which would certainly have been quite unimaginable prior to the current state of affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Now that a Palestinian President has been elected and there has been a cabinet reshuffle in Israel, expectations are high, both here in Europe and among the people in Israel and Palestine. From talks outside the official programme in Ramallah, and from observation of the elections to the west of it, I got the impression that, while people are of course suffering from the occupation, they do not have a good word to say for the way things used to be run by their own people, for Arafat’s inability and unwillingness to do all that was needed to create within the Palestinian Autonomous Authority effective structures for the security forces and health care, among other things, are no secret to anyone.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our task to ensure that the Quartet join together in accompanying whatever happens now, which may be withdrawal from Gaza. I want to see the EU, the USA and the other stakeholders joining together in dealing with both sides. I do not think that this sort of ‘one after the other diplomacy’ gives the parties concerned the right impression, so let them see the whole Quartet present there and hear it speaking with one voice.</p>
<p class="contents">Your task, Mr Solana, is to make a start right now on planning for what happens – by which I mean planning how we will deal with the parties – after withdrawal from Gaza, so that things can really progress from that point on. If not, this conflict really will become a never-ending story. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We truly face a new chance for a substantive peace process; the new situation following the Palestinian presidential elections advocates the appraisal that the preconditions for a chance for peace, stability and security in a long-suffering area are in place. A return to the negotiating table is more than imperative. Reactivation of the roadmap for peace is also imperative. It is precisely the strengthening of the validity of the roadmap that will allow a stable and final peace agreement to be negotiated.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise in particular the need to reinforce the special role of the Quartet. It is a role which should reflect the elements of cohesion, of clarity of objective and of decisiveness. I should also like to point out that Mr Solana's practical proposals concerning security, reforms and financial aid are a move in the right direction. They are an indispensable European contribution towards efforts to establish framework terms for strengthening both political and economic security.</p>
<p class="contents">Our central aim, which the European Council laid down in December, is clear: an independent, democratic and viable Palestinian State, which will coexist peacefully and within a framework of security with Israel and the neighbouring states. However, it is not enough that we alone want it. Above all, the protagonists in the dispute must themselves want it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solana,</span></span>   <span class="italic">High Representative</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Thank you very much, Mr President, and thank you very much to all the very honourable Members who have been kind enough to stay with us until the end of this long sitting on a key issue, a fundamental issue, which perhaps deserves more attention from Parliament given the times we are living through. I would like to say that all the Members who have spoken have spoken with sincerity, with a strength and a hope which I believe represent the spirit not just of the European Parliament, but also of the majority, and hopefully all, of the citizens of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that today, from this point of view, has been a day of emotion, a day to allow our emotions and values to emerge, for us to express ourselves physically and verbally. I would like to say that the time has come from now on for these sittings to begin in a real sense to pursue an objective. We should not just allow our emotions to outweigh our thoughts, but we should begin to show signs of where we want to go and how we want to move forward. I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that following the historic times – and they should be described as historic – we have experienced, the European Union should implement a clear action programme, as we are doing and as we are explaining to Parliament. And the final results of the programme should be the creation of two States and most importantly the Palestinian state, which is the one that does not yet exist.</p>
<p class="contents">And I believe that we cannot go on talking and talking unless we ensure that we are gradually taking the steps necessary to make that a reality within a useful period of time. I would like to say that, from the point of view of our Palestinian friends, what they have now is not a State, but rather a situation prior to a State, which I would like to call a pre-State, and what we have to do is help them in the most effective way possible to make the reforms necessary for them to have a State which is viable and not a State that fails, but one that is consolidated. To that end, there is no question that we must help them to reform and adapt their own structure. Having a pre-State with the limited responsibilities of a pre-State is not the same as taking on all the responsibilities of a State, which do not just include issues relating to the economy. Here I would like to speak in defence of the Commission, of Parliament and of the European Union as a whole. The way in which the European Union spends money and the way in which Mr Fayyad, who is in charge of finance for the Palestinian Authority, spends money, is exemplary.</p>
<p class="contents">And I would like the Members of this Parliament to see this and for the citizens of Europe to know it too. The efforts of Mr Fayyad, who is in charge of finance, together with the efforts that the Commission and all of you and the whole of the European Community have made, are extraordinary and exemplary and I would like to see many other countries, with much more history, who are not pre-States like the Palestinians, having the same capacity to manage their money and doing so in the way they do.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is no question that being a State does not just mean having economic structures, it also means having security structures and today there is no State, but rather a pre-State, and we must therefore help them so that when they do have a State, they have solid security structures. The European Union has the mechanisms to do this and is already doing so. It is helping to build and consolidate the security forces as effectively as possible, so that they can be of service to their citizens, to peace amongst those citizens and therefore to the law and order that all States must have.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in a State there are elections and there will be elections between now and the summer. Please allow me to stop in the summer, from then on we will see what happens. From now until the summer there are very important elections, which we must assist, which we must help to pay for and which we must continue to promote so that they may be proper and positive.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, from the Palestinian point of view, what the President is doing at the moment with a view to achieving a cease-fire, with a view to achieving an agreement on dialogue amongst the Palestinians, is extraordinary. Many of us would not have thought it possible to achieve this in such a short space of time. It has been done and it must be maintained. Nevertheless, ladies and gentlemen, we must be aware that the situation is very fragile. When the elections took place, days later, the first meeting between Sharon and President Abu Mazen was planned, but as a result of violence, all possibility of dialogue broke down: the situation is fragile, and while we have been talking here, there has been another attack, and we are therefore well aware that, whatever happens, we cannot allow the people of violence to hold the key to the future of the process. It would be absurd and it would be unjust. The violence must be stopped, but we cannot allow the people of violence to hold the key to moving the process forward. And I must point out that, as somebody said to me, we must ask Israel for many many things. And there is one very specific thing which they can do and must do: the withdrawal from Gaza, which at one point was intended to be a unilateral decision, can no longer be a unilateral decision. It must be an agreed decision and a decision that represents an initial step on a path that should lead to a withdrawal from the occupied territories. That is what we must call for and that is a part of the fundamental policy we Europeans must implement.</p>
<p class="contents">I honestly believe, after the long week I have spent in Israel as well, as I have said, talking to all of its leaders, that this is not impossible, that it is possible, and we must fulfil our responsibilities as well. I would ask you to use your imaginations, I cannot ask you all to go to Gaza, but the situation in Gaza for those who have seen it and know what I am saying, is dramatic and that disengagement from Gaza cannot be allowed to turn it into a prison. It must have the capacity to trade with the outside, it must have a port and it must have an airport, otherwise the people in Gaza will never be able to leave. And we must therefore help and we must help to ensure that there is a port and an airport and that port and that airport must undoubtedly be subject to international authority and we should be prepared to accept that responsibility if it falls to us.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be able to face that responsibility. I therefore believe that all these issues are fundamental and that, in order to achieve results, we must focus on them during our debates. The time has come to achieve results. We do not have an infinite amount of time before us; if we have too much time we will be frustrated, we will frustrate the Palestinians, we will frustrate the Israelis and this moment of hope which you have all recognised, this moment of pride which also exists amongst Israelis and Palestinians, will pass. There must be a community which begins to think in the same way in both Israel and Palestine, and that community must not be broken and should recover the spirits which existed before, at the time of Oslo and just before and after Oslo.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what must be done, therefore. And there is one thing I would also like to say, to Parliament and to my Israeli friends: you must stop making any decision that goes against any possible final agreements. This is very important, it is very simple to say but very difficult to do. But no decision should be made which cannot be reversed when the time comes to take decisions on the final agreements and some decisions being taken at the moment are going to hinder or even prevent what many believe those agreements should contain: the fundamental parameters of the final status.</p>
<p class="contents">That is something we had to say in a friendly way, and at this time when Israel is commemorating very sad times, very bitter times for which we Europeans should take great responsibility, with the friendship and principles which should be at the hearts of we Europeans, who are so responsible for so many things, we should say it as friends, as I have said, so that they really listen to us, because what we are saying moves in the direction of peace and not in the opposite direction. That is what I wanted to say to you, ladies and gentlemen, and I would like to thank those of you have stayed with us until this hour, on my own behalf, and I hope also on behalf of my good friend the Commissioner Benita Ferrero, whom I would like to thank for being here with us.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a lot of work ahead of us and we need the help of everybody. This is not going to be easy, it is going to be very difficult, but we must win this battle for peace, not just for Israel and Palestine, but, as many people have said, for regional peace. If there is peace in Israel and in Palestine, there will be more possibility of regional peace, and I would have much to say in response to what you have said about Iraq, but I do not believe that this is a day for mixing up the two different debates. Sunday comes in four or five days time, there will be other debates on Iraq, but let us be in no doubt that that evolution will come about.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore come to my final comment: over recent years we have seen Israel and Palestine in what we could describe as a situation of crisis management. From now on we must return to politics, to politics with a capital P, and achieve results, since we will then have clear objectives, and if we have clear objectives and the political will to achieve them, we will achieve them. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry about the time and thank you to all the honourable Members for being with us throughout this very long day. Thank you.</p>

That means of course that we are also committed to making the first concrete steps and I would like to mention a few of them because it has been requested.</p>
<p class="contents">First, we have just agreed for instance to make an additional EUR 20 million available for Gaza. We are also working very closely with the World Bank. Just last week I met with President Wolfensohn. We take the advice of the World Bank very seriously: unless there is an end to violence and to movements of goods and people, any additional money will have little impact. Therefore it is very important to achieve improvements on this side.</p>
<p class="contents">I will also discuss these issues very concretely with the Palestinians and with the Israelis when I go there on 7 and 8 February. I also want to see what we can plan and whether there are good projects that we can implement in order to help this process really get under way, whether it is on reconstruction or institution-building, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also say to Mr Laschet, we are also supporting efforts to improve the living conditions of the Palestinian refugees, to provide better housing and a change of the refugee status. This will require a negotiated solution as is foreseen in the roadmap; this is more difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that it is crucial that we do not lose sight of the political process. Javier Solana has just outlined this. We also have to ask ourselves what will happen the day after the Gaza disengagement. Parties need to engage on a political process that goes beyond Gaza. This is a key issue that we also have to discuss with President Bush and with Condoleeza Rice when they come to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you very much, this has been a very engaging and interesting discussion. You can see we are all committed to this process, but I will also add a note of caution: it is a difficult process and it can erupt at any moment.</p>
