<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patrie (PSE),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is certainly late for us to be tackling the celebrated precautionary principle. I say ‘celebrated’ because it is a very fashionable subject, and you will no doubt agree with me that not a day passes without the press, at the drop of a hat, running a headline on the precautionary principle, either advisedly or ill-advisedly, but misleadingly, more often than not.</p>
<p class="contents">Public interest in the precautionary principle is not surprising and reflects their legitimate concern, for they have become extremely sensitive to such matters as a result of recent food scandals and cases such as the contaminated blood scandal. This interest also reflects the crisis of public confidence in science, which is now recognised as not being infallible. Finally, interest in the precautionary principle reflects the crisis of public confidence in governmental and political decision makers, who are suspected of connivance with certain pressure groups, especially industrial lobbies, or simply of culpable irresponsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">All this demonstrates the major political stakes involved in the issue of the precautionary principle and, in this connection, I welcome the Commission’s initiative, as well as the general quality of its communication on this precautionary principle.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to explain the result I should like our Parliament to arrive at, I should like this evening quickly to underline two key aspects of this debate. The first issue raised by the report we are debating is of a legal nature. Indeed, even if it is only recently that the media have begun publicising it, the precautionary principle has not only just made its appearance on the international legal scene. A good many treaties and international agreements refer to it. The Court of Justice of the European Communities and even the WTO’s dispute settlement bodies consider that the precautionary principle is applicable in environmental or public health issues, occasionally even against the Europeans, as may be seen from the case (still pending) of cheese produced from milk straight from the cow.</p>
<p class="contents">However, these references in international texts are not enough to specify either its nature or its legal value, especially since such texts do not include any definition of the precautionary principle. This gives rise to a degree of legal insecurity unacceptable not only to our fellow citizens but also to industrialists who no longer know what fate has in store for them.</p>
<p class="contents">The first key task of the Commission’s communication and of Parliament’s report is therefore to specify the character and the legal value we wish to accord the precautionary principle, to define the conditions in which the precautionary principle may and must be applied and, finally, to determine the criteria to be fulfilled by the measures taken in application of the precautionary principle.</p>
<p class="contents">The second key task in our work on the precautionary principle is of a more political nature. What the European Union has to do is to is to promote a unified conception of the precautionary principle, not only so that this principle may be a part of all policies implemented by the European Union within the scope of its jurisdiction, but also so that reference may be made to this European approach in respect of our partners who often have a less ambitious approach than ourselves where environmental and health matters are concerned. In this respect, it is important for our Parliament to express a very clear position so that the Commission may be provided with a sound mandate for defending the European Union’s positions within international bodies, particularly the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">We are gratified to note that the bulk of the text of the resolution, at which we have arrived after several debates within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, coincides with the Council resolution, appended to the conclusions of the Nice Summit. The text produced by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is the result of an ongoing search for a compromise or, rather, a balance between the maximalist and minimalist tendencies which were expressed in the course of our discussions, both of which result in excesses. The maximalists attempt to block innovation and progress, while the minimalists advise having recourse to the precautionary principle only in the case of significant environmental and health risks, that is to say above a certain threshold, although it is not really clear how to define this.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with these two approaches, I have endeavoured to arrive at a fair balance so that this political tool might be used within a legal framework. The European Union’s ambition is to guarantee its citizens a high level of protection where their health and the environment are concerned. That is why I invite you to support this reasoned and reasonable concept of the precautionary principle and to reject all the amendments which would depart from it in one direction or another. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was not our sole intention to deliver a purely legal evaluation. On the contrary, our opinion has an undoubtedly political character too. I emphasise this because the application of the precautionary principle demands more than perfectly crafted legislation. It is a matter of ensuring that the high level of protection which the Treaties promise the people of the European Union is actually guaranteed. This can only be achieved if we are really serious about the need for preventive action. Damage limitation and compensation must not be our aim; our paramount goal must be to prevent damage to people's health and property. We can achieve it by rigorously applying the precautionary principle, as my honourable colleague has explained.</p>
<p class="contents">We as legislators should never lose sight of this, and we should encourage the Commission to apply the principle from the outset when drafting legislative proposals. Mrs Patrie's report pledges us to do precisely that. In connection with BSE, a great deal of past and future heartache would have been spared if we had armed ourselves with adequate legislation in good time and if we had verified compliance with such legislation, which, as we know, is a matter for the Member States. When we banned American hormone-treated meat to protect the health of our consumers, our right to take preventive action was challenged. It was even decried as protectionism!</p>
<p class="contents">In another context too, the sceptics never tire of invoking the principles of proportionality and non-discrimination. On closer inspection, it emerges that these scruples are not motivated so much by concern for the rule of law as by concern for money and profits. I personally have no fear of excessive statutory protection. Nor should the people of Europe have any reason to be afraid. On the contrary, when they look at European legislation, they should be able to rest assured that all the Members of their Parliament attach greater importance to public health than to the quest for profits. For this reason, I recommend that we follow the line that the rapporteur has mapped out for us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is a crisis of public confidence in science, which is now recognised as not being infallible, and there is also a crisis of public confidence in political decision-makers, who are suspected of connivance with certain industrial and commercial pressure groups or simply of culpable irresponsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure that this report echoes public demands for a high level of protection for health and the environment. Essentially, use of the precautionary principle can be seen as a risk management strategy in the face of scientific uncertainty or a tool to allow the involvement of the public decision-making authority in managing scientific uncertainty. Scientists evaluate the risk and the political decision-makers manage the risk.</p>
<p class="contents">Clarifying who should do what is an essential prerequisite for restoring the necessary public confidence in both the scientific community and public decision-makers – us politicians. There is a legitimate role also for peer-reviewed minority scientific opinions. After all, let us remind ourselves that BSE was brought to public attention through a minority report.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a legitimate concern felt by public opinion which has become extremely sensitive to such matters as a result of the recent food scandals and particularly the BSE crisis. The public no longer wants to bear the brunt of hazardous technological innovations which several or many years later prove to have entailed unnecessary risk to public health or the environment. They will not accept that there should be any doubt whatsoever but that the materials used to make their children's toys are completely harmless, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">As long ago as 1996 the European Parliament came out in favour of a ban on the use of meat-and-bone meal throughout the European Union in accordance with the precautionary principle – if only. The rest is history.</p>
<p class="contents">The way to restore consumers' confidence in industry generally is to adopt clear and precise rules in the light of the precautionary principle. In all cases measures must be taken, must be regularly reviewed in the light of scientific developments. There should be an absolute requirement for transparency in all cases involving regular provision of information to the public, including when a project or activity has been given the green light.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to see clearer guidelines on the application of the principle. It should be used where there are reasonable grounds for concern. Precaution does not equal prevention, nor should the precautionary principle be invoked as a technical trade barrier. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, it remains a source of confusion. The message, in short, is: if in doubt, do not do it. Doubt has now been cast upon virtually everything, and that would mean that nothing is possible any more. That is why the Commission’s clarifications are welcomed and why I am very impressed with Mrs Patrie’s report. She has done sterling work and I would like to congratulate her on it.</p>
<p class="contents">A clear distinction needs to be drawn between precaution and prudence. Precaution is applicable in situations where science cannot provide a conclusive answer. It is suspected that a certain substance presents a risk, but no proof exists.</p>
<p class="contents">Prudence is called for in situations where the risks are known. In those situations, a safety margin is imposed as a precautionary measure. The precautionary principle is a political response to the risks within society. We must avoid unknown risks. The precautionary principle must also apply to products and substances which are already available and in use, as well as to production methods.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in favour of the precautionary principle, but I would like to mention one area of concern. I sometimes have the feeling that reference is made to the precautionary principle all the time, whether appropriate or not. There is no such thing as absolute scientific certainty about new substances or products, nor can there ever be. The present situation is taken as a point of departure and that leads to conservatism and resistance to anything new. In this way, we are distancing ourselves from the United States and large sections of the rest of the world. That may be the case and so be it, but worse still is that the precautionary principle can produce a whole generation of political cowards, a generation which passes the buck and does not dare to take any decisions out of precaution. It leads to the scientification of a policy without ever reaching consensus, for science is unable to offer that either. The precautionary principle is therefore a valuable and important principle, but we must aim to use it more sparingly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the Committee on Industry, we underlined the importance of having clarity on the modalities for the application of the principle. So I am pleased to see that the final report reflects the need for further elaboration of the concept.</p>
<p class="contents">We also called for measures in the World Trade Organisation, perhaps a regulation, which would ensure that it is possible, in the context of the WTO, to invoke other obligations, such as those we have under multilateral environmental agreements, to extend the scope of the precautionary principle. In that context it would be helpful if the Commission would confirm its position that withdrawing a product on the basis of process or production methods may indeed be a legitimate application of the principle. It is a very positive sign that the Council text says that it considers that the WTO rules basically allow for account to be taken of the precautionary principle, and further that it calls on Member States and the Commission to ensure that, and I quote, "the precautionary principle is fully recognised in all trade fora to pursue that aim and ensure that it is taken into account at the same time, particularly at the World Trade Organisation". The idea of compatibility between a precautionary principle and the World Trade Organisation seems to be gaining ground and that is to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">There are issues to be borne in mind to ensure that it works well. We must ensure for example that the burden of defending precautionary measures, especially for developing countries, does not reduce their capacity to protect health and the environment through precautionary action. Finally if the precautionary principle is to be applied effectively and credibly, it is vital to involve all key stakeholders, including representatives of civil society in the policy choices that surround its application. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also welcome the Commission's proposal which is an important guideline for the EU and the Member States for understanding and applying the precautionary principle. The proposal is of course, from an international point of view, an invaluable tool for decision-making in cases where there is uncertainty regarding risks, products or manufacturing methods.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully share the Commission’s position when it defines the precautionary principle as a general principle with unlimited scope. Just like many MEPs, I'm sure, I was pleasantly surprised at the Council's resolution from the European Council meeting in Nice which states that the precautionary principle should be applied as quickly as possible after harmful effects to health and the environment have been established and if reliable conclusions concerning the level of risk cannot be reached on the basis of a preliminary scientific investigation based on the information available. This is very far-reaching and, of course, very good.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to appeal to everybody here, in anticipation of tomorrow's vote, not to weaken the committee's and the rapporteur's text by adopting the amendments proposed by the EDD and the PPE. Instead, we ought to try to strengthen the text further to show that we are at least as progressive as the Council. Amendment No 9 is very important. This proposes that a reversed burden of proof be applied regarding products with no prior approval, that is to say that producers must prove that the product is safe and not transfer the risks and the cost to consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of course also important to increase the legal weight with the aim of making the precautionary principle an international standard. This is dealt with in Amendment No 5 from the Group of the Greens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As other speakers have said, it is crucial that this principle should be applied properly and that there are legal guarantees for the parties involved, but I would like to take up three ideas that are in Mrs Patrie’s report and in some of the amendments and which seem to me to be perhaps the most important ideas in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, that there is no minimum threshold of risk below which the precautionary principle must not be applied and, consequently, even in cases where there is little risk, it would have to be used. Secondly, that transparency and consumer information are very important and necessary to the whole process of assessment and risk management. And lastly, that public health and the environment must be given priority over all other considerations, particularly financial considerations.</p>
<p class="contents">If things had been done in this way, Mr President, I do not believe that we would now be lamenting the disease suffered by mad cows, or that we would be lamenting certain other examples of food contamination whose future effects are still unknown.</p>
<p class="contents">There is currently a great degree of sensitivity and concern over the use in foods of genetically modified products. Another example is the great sensitivity over the information, whether it has a scientific basis or not, about the possible effects of mobile phones, electromagnetic waves and also masts transmitting electromagnetic waves.</p>

I believe it is very timely that the European Parliament is having a debate on the need to ensure that the precautionary principle is enshrined within all EU regulations and directives. Events concerning new BSE distortions in Europe have once again put the issue of food safety at the top of the European political agenda. The precautionary principle must be invoked at every opportunity when it comes to the enactment of new EU legislative provisions in the area of protecting and improving the food chain in Europe. The 370 million consumers of the European Union are demanding action in the area of food safety. I welcome the recent statements by the European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, Mr Byrne, when he unequivocally stated that the precautionary principle is his guiding point of reference when it comes to the initiation of EU directives and regulations in the area of promoting food safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Everyone, or most of us, accept and use these products. However, the substances and materials in these products, as well as many kinds of foodstuffs, can carry risks. As everyone should know, our whole lives are fraught with risks and uncertainties. Life is about being able to deal with these risks and uncertainties in a sensible manner.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal sets the right tone for clearer guidelines for applying the precautionary principle. Mrs Patrie’s opinion that the EU must clarify its stance on the precautionary principle, has my unqualified support. Unfortunately, I am bound to say that the draft resolution of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which is too lengthy, does not meet this requirement. Its wordy and ambiguous style make it impenetrable as to its actual meaning. This is in contrast to the resolution of the Nice European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In my amendments which I have tabled, I attempt to clarify these matters and delete a number of redundant paragraphs.</p>
<p class="contents">As science is often unable to establish a direct link between products and their possible harmful effects, we demand more clarity in the matter. In order to apply the precautionary principle, it is absolutely essential to provide a scientific basis for the concern about possible harmful effects. Both restriction and acceptance of a certain level of risk are important in order to take measures. In addition, it is important for us to give due consideration to the protection level we have opted for, which can largely be deduced from the legislation we have drafted.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am of the opinion that reversal of the burden of proof is not appropriate. In order to use the precautionary principle correctly, we also need to know what the harmful effects will be of any alternatives, should a prohibitive measure be taken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But there is still a long way to go in perfecting this principle. First of all, it is still typically European: on the other side of the Atlantic this instrument is seen as obscurantist and even mediaeval. Yet the way the European Union itself uses it is both unclear and even irrational. Sometimes it overuses it, cheapening it, and at other times it uses it too little and provokes our indignation. That is why I regard this Commission proposal, enriched by Mrs Patrie’s report, as being so important. By establishing clearly when and how the precautionary principle should be applied, it clarifies its use at a European level, making it more credible, and it mandates the European negotiators in the next round of the World Trade Organisation to inscribe the precautionary principle as basic and universal.</p>
<p class="contents">But allow me to denounce what I see as a flagrant example of the lack of coherence in the use of the precautionary principle in the European Union: I am talking about mobile telephones. It is incomprehensible that the European Union should remain insensitive to the dozens of independent scientific studies that point to the possible risk posed by mobile telephones to human health. We might even ask ourselves whether this inertia does not derive from the fact that the majority of mobile phone manufacturers are European companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Only yesterday in Lisbon, the American professor, George Carlo, who for the last seven years has been entrusted by the Food and Drugs Administration with a study on the effect of the radiation on human health, revealed at first hand that there is the risk that the use of mobile phones might promote the appearance of brain tumours, Alzheimer’s disease and skin lesions. Under these circumstances, I invite the Commission to apply the precautionary principle to mobile phones and to draw particular attention to the dangers of their use by children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is no mean task to define the precautionary principle. I personally think that it is impossible to create a general precautionary principle which applies in all situations. Each situation requires its own precautionary principle. This is hard for us to accept, but foodstuffs and chemicals are not the same thing. They cannot therefore be dealt with in the same way either.</p>
<p class="contents">Our task is to create the framework required to protect both the environment and the health of people and animals. The precautionary principle does not look the same in our respective countries. However, what we need to do now is to create a common precautionary principle at EU level. The principle must be clear. We must be able to uphold it internationally, and it must also be given legal weight.</p>
<p class="contents">Several people in this House have already mentioned the mad cow disease scandal as one of the many scandals we have experienced recently. This scandal reveals something extremely important, namely the importance of having the courage to make decisions even when we do not have all the proof on the table. But there are more examples than mad cow disease alone, examples which are perhaps not as spectacular, but where it is just as important to make decisions. We have the example of phthalates in children's toys and we also have this strange idea of putting toys inside sweets, ice cream and other edible products. In the one case, we say that we do not have sufficient proof and, in the other, that there have not been enough serious accidents for us to have the courage to take action.</p>
<p class="contents">It is just a shame that it is not the scientific community but the internal market that controls what is released onto the market. This is an untenable situation. In reality we cannot have this kind of situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the whole of Mrs Patrie's report but I would also like to highlight what Mrs Schörling said earlier in her speech, and that is that we need a stricter position with regard to the burden of proof, particularly as regards products without prior approval. Producers and manufacturers must be able to present proof that a product is in fact safe. We must avoid a situation in which the consumer acts as some sort of paying guinea pig when it comes to new products on the market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The machine has a great number of warning lights; if one of these lights red, it tells us that there is something wrong and that we must intervene immediately if the machine is not to break down. We must not wait until several or all of the warning lights are lit. This is the precautionary principle in practice. However, this is not how it works in the case of public health. Here we wait until all the warning lights are lit before intervening, and this is also the problem with the European Commission’s communication. In my opinion, the precautionary principle is quite simply about the law and not least the duty to intervene with sufficient and necessary resources on the basis of a suspicion or a probable suspicion that a substance or a process may cause irreparable damage to the environment and health.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who cannot live without the substance or process in question must demonstrate that it can exist without resulting in permanent damage. Amongst other things, the Commission proposes that the benefits and costs associated with action or failure to act in an area are to be investigated. However, this was precisely what was done in connection with the BSE scandal and that was why the catastrophe hit England and now also France, which had been given all the signals that BSE was present and still did not want to apply the precautionary principle. An analysis of the pros and cons is an absurd concept bearing in mind the idea behind the precautionary principle, namely to be able to react to a product <span class="italic">before</span> we fully know all the advantages and disadvantages. The same applies to the Commission’s requirement of a thorough risk analysis beforehand. After all, if we know all the risks, costs, etc., then there is no <span class="italic">need</span> for the precautionary principle. I also think that far too much emphasis is placed on the assessment of a matter by experts, toxicologists and economists. Risk management and enforcement of the precautionary principle are not the responsibility of experts, but a general political responsibility and matter and the Commission’s communication does not give politicians sufficient incentive to live up to this responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also confess to not quite understanding why animal welfare should crop up in this report. What must at all costs be avoided is a situation in which the application of this principle curbs innovation and economic activity, creates undue caution and resistance to change on the part of industry and becomes a means of discouraging competition. This principle ought only to be applied if there is real risk. Only politicians should have recourse to it. It is therefore advisable to come up with a precise definition of the precautionary principle so as to prevent the usual wayward interpretations by the Court of Justice, to handle the principle judiciously and skilfully, to determine clearly the factors which bring it into play and, finally, to integrate it into the talks conducted within the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the criteria used – proportionality, discrimination, coherence, examination of the advantages and disadvantages, and examination of the scientific assessment – the measures taken in accordance with the precautionary principle must be commensurate with the seriousness of the risk, unlike what happened in the case of the European Union’s measures to deal with mad cow disease. Similarly, in line with transparency, let us ensure that producers on a small or industrial scale have the right to express and defend their views by having their opinions and comments included in the assessment reports, in the same way as those of the scientists whose conclusions appear to have been brushed aside.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, local produce ought not to have its authenticity sacrificed in the interests of safety at any price. If uniformly graded products make for greater food safety, diversity leads to uncertain quality and therefore to a degree of risk. By invoking this principle willy-nilly, there is a risk of ending up with products which are all produced in the same way and are so hygienic, odourless and tasteless as to be undifferentiated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This Commission's communication on the precautionary principle was issued in February this year and it proposes guidelines on when and how to use the precautionary principle. The principle and approach is often referred to at national, European and global level when questions related to human health and the environment are discussed. The precautionary principle was also discussed at the Nice Summit, which took note of a resolution adopted by the General Affairs Council. The resolution calls on the Commission to use the guidelines adopted and to incorporate the precautionary principle whenever necessary in drawing up its legislative proposals and in all its actions. The resolution also highlights the need to work actively for a commitment by international partners to reach an understanding on the application of the principle. We now examine how this resolution should be followed up.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission communication is not the final word on the issue. I therefore welcome Parliament's motion for a resolution on this important issue and would like to comment on some of the points it raises. The Commission confirms its intention to make active use of the precautionary principle whenever appropriate. We consider it as a general principle which should be taken into consideration in the fields of environmental protection and human, animal and plant health. Regarding its implications at international level, in particular within the World Trade Organisation, the Commission considers that the precautionary principle is becoming a full-fledged rule of customary international law with all the rights attached to it. This entitles the Community to prescribe the level of protection notably with regard to the environment and human, animal and plant health which it considers appropriate. It will also raise the capacity of developing countries to ensure protection of the environment and human, animal and plant health.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament must have noted that the Commission is in line with most of the issues raised in your motion for a resolution. However, I would like to clarify some points. Concerning the eventual withdrawal of a product on the basis of process or production methods, it is not possible to make any general statement on the legitimacy of such an action prior to a comprehensive risk assessment. The distinction made in the resolution between the precautionary principle and prudence would need to be more precise. The prudential approach is part of risk assessment policy and is an integral part of the scientific opinion delivered by the risk evaluators. On the other hand, application of the precautionary principle is part of risk management. One consequence of this is that initial suspicions or empirical judgments cannot be used alone as regards the application of the precautionary principle. The hazard has to be identified and risk assessment has to be carried out by experts before measures are taken.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to stress that it is for the decision-makers to define the level of protection. It is not possible to provide a general <span class="italic">de minimis </span>threshold. The Commission considers that the motion for a resolution is balanced on this issue and does not support Amendment No 3.</p>
