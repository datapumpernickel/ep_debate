<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Madam President, in 1966 the Community first established a comprehensive system to monitor and control the presence of residues in food of animal origin from the Member States and from third countries. This system involves the setting up of a residue monitoring plan as well as a legal framework to allow for official controls and a practical infrastructure for laboratory testing. This legislation requires Member States and third countries exporting to the EU to submit annually a monitoring plan for residues in products of animal origin.</p>
<p class="contents">Monitoring should be targeted at detecting illegal treatment of animals and at controlling compliance with the maximum residue limits for veterinary medicinal products, the maximum levels for pesticides and the maximum levels set in relevant legislation covering environmental contaminants.</p>
<p class="contents">The residue plans are subject to an extensive evaluation procedure. Only those third countries that have submitted satisfactory residue monitoring plans are allowed to export to the European Union and be included in the appropriate list.</p>
<p class="contents">This list is kept under constant review in order to take into account the results of the evaluation of the annual updates of residue monitoring plans.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this approach must be complemented by measures on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">First, import controls must be carried out by the Member States at the external borders of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Food and Veterinary Office verifies how the residue plans are implemented in the Member States and third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last year, we have been particularly concerned about discoveries of banned veterinary medicinal products – namely chloramphenicol and nitrofurans – in food of animal origin. These substances are banned for use in food-producing animals in the European Union because it has not been possible to set a safe level of residues due to their toxic effects on human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has not hesitated to take measures whenever this problem has arisen. For example, imports from China of all products derived from farmed animals, including aquaculture, have been banned on the basis of the conclusions of an FVO mission, underpinned by discoveries of contaminated food.</p>
<p class="contents">In other cases, it has not been necessary to ban imports, as the third countries concerned have initiated extensive action plans to resolve the problems – in particular the testing of all consignments exported to the European Union and suspension of the offending establishments.</p>
<p class="contents">These measures taken in third countries are complemented by strict, mandatory import controls to provide sufficient guarantees. This is the case for both Thailand and Brazil. The Commission will ensure the maintenance of the necessary level of scrutiny on imported products to ensure a consistent approach to consumer safety. The Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed is the tool to disseminate all relevant information between Member States and the Commission, as well as to third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say that it is not just in relation to third country imports that the Commission has identified problems of residues in food. Indeed, residues monitoring plans carried out by Member States also enabled the identification of contamination cases in food produced in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Some concerns have been raised – and the issue has been raised and the question sent to the Commission by Parliament – about the cancellation of FVO inspection missions to the third countries from which contaminated products have been identified. Perhaps I should explain the background to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed the Commission has postponed a number of planned missions in respect of residues. These include missions to Brazil and Thailand. It is considered that such missions would be a waste of valuable resources at this moment as 100% testing is in place for poultrymeat from Brazil and Thailand and for shrimps from Thailand. Consignments which test positive are destroyed.</p>
<p class="contents">These measures are necessary because there are serious failings in residue controls in the countries concerned. It is not necessary to send a mission team to establish what is already known. In the case of China there is already a comprehensive ban in place on exports to the European Union on a range of products and increased testing is in place for other products. It is premature to carry out a mission now, as the Commission is not convinced that the necessary preparatory measures have been put in place. Instead it is considered best to await concrete evidence of progress in the form of regulatory controls, such as legislation and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in the coming months, FVO missions could be deemed necessary to assess the implementation of actions and the changes introduced by the third countries concerned in the area of residue monitoring. The FVO programme of inspection for 2003 mentions such missions.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the position in regard to the issues that have been raised in the questions. I am happy to outline that for Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have listened very carefully to what you have said and I come now to a topic that I would have liked to have put before you earlier in writing. But I believe that a joint effort may perhaps still elicit an answer from you.</p>
<p class="contents">Nitrofurans is a generic term. One very important product it covers is Nifursol. Nifursol is the last histomonostat still to be permitted in the EU for use as an additive in poultry feed to prevent blackhead disease. I admit I am not a scientist. According to my information, however, experts say that this product was banned for good in Regulation 2377/90. The Scientific Committee for Animal Nutrition (SCAN) was asked by the Commission to make a risk assessment of Nifursol. Investigations that will give a definite answer have yet to be carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">Because I also have the feed additives report, I have now heard the alarm bells ringing, because many who are concerned with this matter fear there will be a treatment crisis in a few months’ time. As a logical consequence of the ban on nitrofurans in Regulation 2377/90, Regulation 1756/2002 was issued on 23 September 2002, banning Nifursol from 31 March 2003. When this ban comes into force on 31 March, there will, for example, be a crisis in the treatments used to combat blackhead disease in turkeys. No alternative remedy is available legally in the EU, either as a feed additive or as a veterinary medicine.</p>
<p class="contents">The consequences of the ban will hit both fatteners and consumers. The consequences are a treatment emergency, a painful end for large stocks of birds, jeopardy for turkey farms, the development of an uncontrollable black market, and an increase in imports of poultry from third countries, where many substances that are banned in the EU are used with few or any controls. Only last week antibiotics of the nitrofuran group that are banned in the EU were found again in cheap imports of meat from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Logically, mixed feed manufacturers will now have to stop using Nifursol by January 2003 at the latest if there is to be no more such feed in the silos by the beginning of March.</p>
<p class="contents">My question to you this evening, although I do not know whether you can answer it, is: what solutions do we now have available? Personally I find it hard to understand how the Commission can on the one hand, in the report in my possession, on the Commission’s draft of which we worked very hard – approve the use of histomonostats,–– while on the other hand, in another regulation, banning the only product in existence on this market. I therefore have a few questions. What are we to say to the fatteners? What are they to do? What forms of treatment are available to them? And secondly, is the Commission aware that European production is continuing to decline, is disappearing from the market in the European Union and that we are being increasingly exposed to third country imports of turkey meat, although we still do not know what quality standards those imports come up to? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that it is particularly important to acknowledge the problem in the first instance. However, I had the feeling that the Commissioner did not wish to acknowledge at all that there is a problem at this moment in the Union as regards the presence of a number of forbidden antibiotics in, for example, chickens and prawns. We all know, Commissioner, that you are especially concerned and are making great efforts to ensure food safety and this House, across all party boundaries, supports you in that. But it is very important – and we still have doubts about this – that the same statutory framework should be applied to products produced in the EU and for products marketed in the EU. I believe this is precisely where the sticking point is. I come from Belgium where we had the dioxin crisis, which is certainly not unknown to you. On that occasion, the Commission acted in a draconian manner against Belgium. You were right, quite right to take strict measures and one of your main accusations related to the fact that the Member State failed to give sufficient information.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we are now in a similar situation. We have no alternative but to acknowledge the problem and therefore we regret the fact that the inspection mission did not go ahead, since we are convinced that you did not have sufficient reason. I believe that it is absolutely unacceptable that trade relations should be revoked to ensure that certain inspections do not take place or that lower or different standards should be applied. I should have therefore preferred a number of more concrete answers to the questions, since I do not have the impression that you dealt with them properly. I also think that you can provide a better answer in order to reassure the consumer that what eventually finds its way onto his plate is safe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The health of consumers is, of course, one of them, but there is also the position of producers here if we are not able to ensure that what may not be used here, may not be used outside the EU either. The question is, who produces these substances and how can they get into the European Union? You have now said there are intensive controls, but – if I understood that correctly – foreign missions are unnecessary because we find bad conditions there anyway. So we do not need to go there.</p>
<p class="contents">I have heard that today’s meeting of the Standing Committee was to have discussed removing Thailand again from the list of countries that must be subject to special inspections. On what basis was that decision to be taken? I have also heard that you have announced inspection missions to those countries for next year. What reason do you now have to assume that those missions will be worthwhile? I think that, if these countries do not meet our requirements, they should be put on the list, and then they cannot supply us until they can guarantee that the products they supply to the European Union meet our standards.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another problem that needs to be clarified. What happens to the shrimps, poultry meat and turkey that is imported into the Union and does not meet our requirements? Is it sent back? What is done with it? As we have been saying about food waste for a long time, a ban is not enough. We saw that with the shrimps from China, which somewhere found their way into animal feed and by that route got into the food chain again. What I would therefore like is for you to put forward a clear plan that we, who have to justify ourselves as parliamentarians – including to the Commission – can stand by and say that the Commission, the European Union, is being strict enough here. We cannot have it perceived to be true that you say the Commission enters into trade relations with some countries and is less strict with them, even though doubts have arisen about that recently. I hope you will be able to clear this up in your reply. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Does the Commissioner still believe that his statement of 28 June was a necessary and sufficient answer to the concerns that have been raised? He has just told us that the FVO missions to Brazil and Thailand, and probably elsewhere, were cancelled because 100% testing is now in place within the Member States. If the Commissioner did not say that, then I misheard him. It is certainly true that in some of those Member States – notably Germany and the Netherlands – considerable concern has been expressed about the degree of nitrofuran residues in poultry and the extent to which even a very sophisticated Member State cannot guarantee by itself the degree of testing.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue is not only what happens within the Member State – as the Commissioner knows, there have been a whole series of rapid alerts during 2002. I would like to know how many rapid alerts throughout the European Union have been proclaimed in this calendar year as a result of this continuing anxiety about carcinogens like nitrofuran when residues are discovered in imports. I would like to know whether or not he feels that poultry imports from countries like Brazil give cause for serious concern. I would like the Commissioner to put on record the opinion of the Commission and its own residues experts on the number of tonnes of poultry from the states in question that have passed into the European Union without proper inspection. My information is that something like 2000 tonnes of Brazilian poultry have entered the EU in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">How close does the Commissioner believe we are to achieving 100% safety testing in the Member States? Why are these missions being postponed? Is the SANCO DG under pressure from other directorates? Are there questions here about endangering trade talks, meaning that one should not throw suspicion on any other states? If that is the case, it is not a sufficient answer to give to those whose primary concern is – as is the Commission's – food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, how soon will these proposed missions take place? The Commissioner said earlier today in the debate on foot and mouth disease that he did not like disguised forms of protectionism – nor do I. However, I do not like disguised forms of concealment either, where there is a risk. If the money is not available and that is why these FVO missions have been postponed – tell us so. There are members of the Committee on Budgets here now. Parliament is very keen to support you, but we need candour in order to do it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We read today in communication <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2002&amp;nu_doc=0422">COM (2002) 422</a>, which was presented yesterday, that a firm has imported shrimps with very high nitrofuran levels – 20 mg – from Vietnam via Ostend into Germany and then on to Austria and Luxembourg as well as selling them in Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">How is that possible? This communication is dated 25 November, but only today, nearly four weeks later, is there an early alert. Why were four weeks allowed to elapse? I would like you to give me, and Luxembourg’s consumers, a clear answer.</p>
<p class="contents">My second question is this. On 2 October you relaxed controls for Vietnam. That is a Commission decision. I will read you what it says: </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, firstly I would like to say how grateful I am to Members of Parliament for raising these important issues. Let me also say that I am sure all of you may well accept this as a valuable contribution to debates in Parliament but sometimes general questions are followed up by extremely detailed questions that can best be responded to in correspondence. However, I will do my best to answer such questions as you have raised. I have taken notes and if I am not able to deal with technical issues of a specific nature, I will respond to the questioner in writing.</p>
<p class="contents">The issues that have been raised centre around the question of why the inspections were suspended and when these inspections will be resumed. As I indicated in my earlier contribution, these inspections were suspended either because there was a ban on the importation of products from that country or because in the two countries in question there was 100% testing in respect of all products coming from those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is expected that the controls that are put in place in Member States effectively carry out the job that they are supposed to do because it is understood that these inspections have to be 100%. Therefore it is important that they reveal any residues in any of the foods that are designated for testing. When the tests show positive, I want to confirm, as I indicated earlier, that these products are destroyed.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of you raised the question whether there were doubts about standards and whether there was any pressure being put on the Commission and on DG SANCO in particular by other DGs in relation to the carrying out of tests or the changing of procedures, either by suspending FVO inspections in third countries or by not doing so. I confirm to the House considerations of that kind never impinge on a decision in relation to food safety. I have made that point here in this Parliament on many occasions and I am happy to repeat it now.</p>
<p class="contents">Inevitably you meet representatives from the developing countries that we are talking about and often others, sometimes Members of Parliament, who make the suggestion that perhaps the European Union is putting in place precautionary barriers in place of tariff barriers. This is an important issue and has to be taken into account, but I have always responded by saying that the protection of public health, the protection of consumers and the maintenance of the standards that consumers expect in relation to the importation of food must come first.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to assure Members of Parliament who raised this question that the decisions that are taken in relation to these kinds of issues – testing for residues – are strictly based on the scientific analysis and judgement of the technical and scientific staff in DG SANCO, who give their advice as to the appropriate way forward in respect of these issues. No other political or trade consideration is ever taken into account. That simply does not happen.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of when the inspections will be resumed, that will happen in the spring, but there is not much point in sending inspectors to third countries – or the ones I have been describing – to carry out tests to determine what we know already, to confirm the continuation of either a ban or 100% testing. The only conclusion that is being suggested by those who raised this question is that, if these tests and inspections continue and if it is found that there are still residues or that 100% testing is an inefficient and inadequate response, we should there and then decide to put in place a ban on the importation of foods from those developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">That is a very serious decision to take. We have to determine whether it is a proportionate response to a risk that may exist to the consumers of the European Union, bearing in mind not just trade considerations but the kinds of consideration I am sure questioners have in mind here today. I know that you have concerns about the welfare of and benefits to developing countries also. This is not an inconsiderable issue. In deciding what is an appropriate response, we have to take into account all of these considerations and make sure that we come to proportionate responses.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most difficult aspects of my job in dealing with food safety is to come up with solutions that are proportionate. Very often, when you are too hard, people will point that out. Sometimes when they believe that you are too weak, the other side will point that out. It is not always possible to keep everybody happy on all occasions. But I am satisfied, bearing in mind the rigour with which inspectors from the Food and Veterinary Office carry out their work and the reports they make, which are made available to the public on the Internet for all of us to read, as well as the work that is undertaken by the control authorities in the Member States to ensure that where 100% testing is required, that is done. That appears to me to be the proportionate response to the risk that may have been identified.</p>
<p class="contents">All the time we keep this under review. In the event that a problem arises, to the extent that it arose in China, it was felt that the only appropriate response in those circumstances was a ban. As a consequence, a ban was placed on the importation of chickens, crustaceans, honey and one or two other products. That was the appropriate response in those circumstances. If we come to the conclusion that is the appropriate response in respect of other countries which seek to trade with the European Union and send food here, as distinct from the continuation from a 100% control programme, that will happen. But we have not reached that view in respect of the two countries I have identified.</p>
<p class="contents">The more detailed and technical questions that have been raised by many of you I have taken note of. I will ensure that each of you receives a response in writing in due course. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
