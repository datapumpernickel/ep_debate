It is also a multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-region nation, and any Indonesian Government has our sympathy and goodwill in its efforts to hold its disparate regions, religions and cultures together. To do so, as our motion suggests, it must face up to the causes of disunity and confront those of evil intent.</p>
<p class="contents">I was recently in East Timor as the EU's chief observer. I saw for myself the aftermath of the depths of depravity to which an out-of-control situation in that part of the world can sink with militia terror, destruction and murder, with the military standing by. I hope that Indonesia will now both set an example by holding out the hand of friendship to the new nation of Timor Loro Sae as it becomes independent on 20 May, but I also hope that it will learn from Timor in dealing with other parts of Indonesia, particularly the Moluccas, Papua, Sulawesi and Aceh.</p>
<p class="contents">Laskar Jihad is a threat to the first three of these. Laskar Jihad's website used to boast of links to Bin Laden terror groups. We know that 5,000 Moluccans have died. Another 12 Christians died recently on the same day that the leader of Laskar Jihad, Thalib, launched his renewed jihad. On 4 May we heard that he had been arrested. That is almost one year to the day since he was previously arrested – and what happened? There was no trial, no sentence. He was quietly released when the world stopped looking. We have, Mr Commissioner, to make sure that the world does not stop looking on this occasion and we want to make sure that action is taken.</p>
<p class="contents">We want the authorities there to investigate links to the military. How did Indonesian army weapons and ammunition – I have the photographs in front of me – come to be in the hands of Laskar Jihad? How is it that in Papua six members of the army's special forces are now accused of involvement in the assassination of a Papuan leader? Who gave those orders? We are proud to be friends of Indonesia, but we can only be friends of a country that genuinely strives for justice, reconciliation, peace, security and the trust of its own people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite a certain amount of progress, despite encouraging signs which there is too little time now to list, there is terrible violence in Indonesia today and the country is caught up in a spiral of insurgence and religious conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Today the European Parliament needs to reach a real consensus on its proposals which cuts across its political divides and groups. In fact, Mr President, Commissioner, violence in northern Sumatra, in the province of Aceh, in Papua and in the Moluccas, as my fellow member has just reminded us, and repeated massacres between religious communities, with calls for crusades on either side, from Muslim and Christian extremists alike, have been going on since 1999. These massacres and exactions are intolerable and Parliament has already denounced them.</p>
<p class="contents">In the new resolution before us today, the European Union reiterates four main points.</p>
<p class="contents">First, we must support the call by several authorities, especially the religious authorities, for the Secretary-General of the United Nations to come to the assistance of the Indonesian government in order to prevent further massacre.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must welcome the arrest of the warlords openly calling for civil and religious war as evidence of the will of the Indonesian authorities to support a peace process in all the regions involved. We must support the efforts of these authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, these initiatives only make sense if the economic situation in the archipelago really can be improved. Consequently, we need to intervene, including at a financial level, in order to help reconstruct a civil society which really respects the human rights, especially the religious rights, of the people of this country. Without political and financial aid on our part, there is a risk of the walls closing round the contradictions of the Indonesian experiment, which would probably put an end to the democratisation process which, all said and done, is still in its infancy.</p>
<p class="contents">And fourthly, in these situations of extreme confusion, we need to get to the bottom of all these exactions. Only an independent inquiry by international human rights experts can do this. We call on the Indonesian government in our resolution to set up just such a committee of inquiry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The terrorist group Laskar Jihad – for it is nothing less than a terrorist group – is digging the grave of anything that might be called religious life. The group is a grave-digger for Islam and has shown that it does not stand for anything other than hatred, violence and the undisguised killing of the Christian population in the Moluccas.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to appeal to the Commission, here in the presence of Mr Nielson, as well as to the Council, not to let the conflict in the Middle East mean that a veil is drawn over the ethnic and religious cleansing of Christians in the Moluccas that is now taking place. Instead, this should be placed in the spotlight. Vigorous action should be taken to ensure that the Indonesian Government gives the Christian population every form of lawful protection.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to emphasise that many Muslims in the Moluccas have been badly affected by this invasion by the terrorist group, Laskar Jihad. Christians and Muslims have previously lived together in peace, and now soldiers arrive spreading hatred, violence and death in the name of Allah and God. Between 5 000 and 10 000 people have been killed, and 25 000 seriously injured. Of the Moluccas’ 10 million inhabitants, 350 000 are refugees. Four hundred churches and 80 mosques have been burned down. I have met the Catholic bishop, Monsignor Mandagi and the leader of the Protestant churches, the Reverend Hendrix. I have looked directly into their eyes and seen their suffering. Mr Nielson, let the EU do everything it can to ensure that Indonesia becomes a region of peace. Find out who is funding these terrorist warlords. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This also applies to the Republic of Indonesia. To this day, its struggle for independence is making itself felt in national politics. Parties continue to employ the tried and tested guerrilla tactics. Physical force is used as a big stick. According to Western standards, this is an insurmountable obstacle for a constitutional state.</p>
<p class="contents">It gets even worse when prominent politicians maintain close ties with extremist groups. The attitude of the Indonesian Vice-President, Mr Hamzah Haz, only adds fuel to the religious fire of the Moluccas. According to Mr Haz himself, he endeavours via the parliamentary route to set up a sharia state in the archipelago. His personal contacts with leaders of the Laskar Jihad, however, are more symptomatic of a double political agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">This provocative attitude places a time bomb under the Malino II agreement. This is why we would ask the Council and the Commission once again to urge the government in Jakarta quite emphatically to promote this difficult peace process to the best of its ability. This requires firm government action against all agitators, irrespective of their religious affiliations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Indonesian army plays a crucial role in this respect. Sadly, there is sufficient evidence that certain sections of this force fan the political and religious contrasts in the country's large problem areas in favour of its own position of power, its own economic interests and the ideology of the rigid unified state. Vigorous European support for the moderate, right-minded wings in the army, which certainly exist, is very much what is required. No mean task for the Council and the Commission, in fact.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as deserving of this support are the spokespersons of Papua's indigenous population. Like their fellow citizens, they are extremely shocked about the findings of the National Inquiry Committee into the assassination of Papua leader, Mr Theys Hiyo Eluay, on 10 November 2001. The Committee refers to it as a criminal case. The Papua leaders and the population think differently. In their view, this is a downright political assassination. In a joint letter of yesterday, they therefore urge the President, Mrs Megawati Sukarnoputri, to mount a truly independent inquiry. In Paragraph 10 of this resolution, the EP unreservedly endorses this justified request. We call on the Council and the Commission to do the same as a matter of urgency. For the sake of internal peace and the archipelago's unity as a state. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are concerned about the continuing violence against defenceless civilian populations in the name of regional and religious disputes. Every life is important and sacred to us, but the situation in Indonesia has already claimed thousands of lives. We deplore the incitement to slaughter Christians by radical Muslim leaders, and we put forward the example of tolerance and democratic spirit shown by East Timor. In a land where more than 95% of the population identifies with the Catholic Church, the current democratically elected prime minister is a Muslim, and this causes no problems.</p>
<p class="contents">We appreciate the initiatives of the present Indonesia regarding the normalisation of relations with East Timor and Portugal. The symbolic gesture of their representatives being present at the opening of the latest cultural event held in Indonesia with the support of the Portuguese Embassy did not go unnoticed. We appeal to the Indonesian Government, however, to pursue measures to protect the populations and to identify and punish those responsible for human rights violations. Impunity must not be the rule, especially when members of the army or police are involved, as has been proved in some cases. In this context it is desirable and advisable that the international community should be involved in independent inquiries to investigate the truth in some of the reported cases.</p>
<p class="contents">We appeal to the Indonesian Government to continue trying to find political solutions to the disputes that exist. We respect their attempts to keep the country united, but we stress the need to find solutions other than the mere use of force to respond to the ethnic, religious and regional differences that unsettle life in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we urge the United Nations Human Rights Commission not to persist in its inexplicable silence towards the events in Indonesia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fanaticism merely disguises itself as religion. In reality, these are ethnic conflicts with a very deep root, namely the Indonesian Government's Transmigrasi programme which attempts to resettle the population of the main islands to the other islands on a systematic basis. The evidence for my theory can be found in the Moluccas, the old Christian Spice Islands, where there are conflicts between Christians and Muslim immigrants. In Borneo, there is a similar conflict between adherents of the animist religions and the incoming Muslims. In Aceh, the same problem occurs between the indigenous Muslim subjects of the old sultanate of Aceh and immigrants from the main islands such as Java and Sumatra. In my view, it is essential to point out to the Government that it must halt this migration and shelve the artificial resettlement programmes, for otherwise, this massive country, which stretches from Australia to the Asian continent, will no longer hold together and will disintegrate.</p>

<p class="contents">Together with the EU diplomatic missions in Jakarta, we have been monitoring the situation in the Moluccas since early1999 and we have participated in two fact-finding missions in late 2000 and early 2001. The Commission has also participated in several EU démarches to the Indonesian authorities to express our concerns about situations of continuing conflict in different parts of the country. In addition, the Commission has provided more than EUR 4.6 million in humanitarian assistance to the people of the Moluccas since May 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">We have joined with the Member States in a declaration welcoming the Malino II Peace Agreement and urging its full implementation. At the same time, we have urged the government of Indonesia to take appropriate measures to support the peace process. Since then, we have followed closely the efforts of the government to deal with new outbreaks of violence, including the arrest on 4 May of Ja’far Umar Thalib on charges of incitement to violence.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Aceh has also preoccupied us for some time now and has also been the subject of EU démarches to the Indonesian authorities. EU Heads of Mission visited the region in October 2001. I am therefore particularly happy to welcome the joint statement issued on 10 May by the Indonesian government and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM), following two days of consultations facilitated by the Henri Dunant Centre in Geneva. The joint statement recognised the special autonomy law as the starting-point for further negotiations in an all-inclusive dialogue and confirmed the intention of both parties to work on an agreement for the cessation of hostilities. It has been our view for some time that the full implementation of the special autonomy legislation will be the key to a durable resolution of the present situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Papua has equally been a matter of continued concern and the subject of EU démarches. The EU condemned the kidnapping and murder of Theys Eluay in November 2001 and called on the government of Indonesia to ensure a full investigation of this dreadful incident and to bring its perpetrators to justice. EU Heads of Mission in Jakarta also visited Papua in February this year. In the case of Papua, too, it is clear that full implementation of the special autonomy legislation will be key to the resolution of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has included in its Country Strategy Paper for Indonesia, which is now in the final stages of preparation, a particular emphasis on institutional capacity building, good governance and the rule of law, as well as conflict prevention. Financial support has already been committed to the UNDP-managed Partnership for Governance Reform, and technical assistance has been provided to the Attorney General’s Office. Provision has been made in the draft National Indicative Programme for 2002-2004 for a specific programme to support the implementation of the government’s policy for decentralisation in Indonesia and to promote good governance at local government level.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, we have also taken steps to support the processes of conflict resolution more directly. Following discussions between Commissioner Patten and the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mr Wirajuda, last November, and in the context of the Commission’s Rapid Reaction Mechanism, an independent mission on conflict prevention in Indonesia visited the Moluccas, Sulawesi and Papua in February 2002. The expert mission met a wide range of central and local government representatives, as well as NGOs operating in these areas. On the basis of the mission’s report, a package of projects is now in preparation for the Moluccas and Papua. The project in the Moluccas will focus particularly on support for the participation of civil society. The projects in Papua will support both the authorities and civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these measures are consistent with the Commission’s support for the EU’s stated position, which firmly supports the territorial integrity of Indonesia, while encouraging the government to make urgent efforts to address and resolve peacefully Indonesia’s internal conflicts, whether separatist or sectarian in character. We will continue to follow this approach and to provide all possible support for constructive action to deal with these very difficult situations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
