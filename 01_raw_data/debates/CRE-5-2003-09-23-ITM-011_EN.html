<p class="contents">We know it was a very difficult debate, but Parliament has demonstrated a great willingness to compromise and find a workable solution. Let me also pay tribute to the Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mrs Randzio-Plath, who, true to her word, has helped drive forward on time the financial services action plan. In particular, we welcome the efforts of the rapporteur in reaching a compromise on two major points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, as you know, pre-trade transparency was one of the principles of the Commission's proposal, in order to ensure market efficiency and investor protection. We are very pleased that the principle is kept in the proposal, but it has been adapted in a pragmatic way. Secondly, we appreciate the work carried out on the suitability test - Article 18. I consider this to be a good basis for working out a solution that is adapted to the specificities of each type of service and it will help to complete our proposal in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular I should like to thank Mr Karas and Mr Radwan, Mr Bourlanges, Mr Katiforis, Mr Goebbels, Mrs Cazalet from the committee secretariat and my assistant, Sarah McCarthy, for all the help that they have given me on this very demanding dossier.</p>
<p class="contents">The goals of the ISD should be competitive, integrated, liquid, transparent and efficient markets with a high level of investor protection. The ISD should not prescribe a particular market structure. It should recognise and be adaptable to the diversity of the different European market structures. It should properly distinguish between retail and professional investors. The type of regulation that is absolutely essential for consumers can be damaging, disruptive and unnecessary if applied to professionals. Rules should always be risk-based, they should be properly costed and they should be proportionate to the harm they seek to avoid.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much support the emphasis in the Commission's proposal on country of origin, with a qualification that in many cases and in many areas the host country is suitable to deal with branches. I also agree with the Commission's overall aspiration to abolish concentration rules and open up the business of executing share trades to competition between exchanges, between MTFs and between the internal execution platforms of investment firms. Exchanges are not public utilities and they should not be granted a monopoly. Allowing firms to compete with exchanges will lead to more choice for investors, more liquidity, narrower spreads, better prices and lower costs. The markets where competition is already allowed in this way are successful, transparent and highly liquid. Competition in this context will deliver a good deal for the consumer, as it has in so many other areas. I agree with the Commission that the best way to protect investors is through a strong combination of competition, conduct of business rules, conflict of interest rules, best execution rules and transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are important areas where the compromise agreed in the ECON committee has greatly improved the Commission's proposal. I strongly urge the House to support the ECON Committee's compromise because these amendments are essential to remedy or, at any rate, reduce some very serious problems caused by the Commission's original text. I strongly support the committee amendments and would only advocate a couple of fairly technical changes.</p>
<p class="contents">This compromise should be accepted as a package. I would appeal to the House not to seek to destabilise this carefully-balanced and hard-won compromise that was achieved after many meetings, with input from different MEPs from different political groups and of different nationalities. Indeed, at the very heart of the matter, the concept of standard market size was a concept contributed to the debate by the PSE group.</p>
<p class="contents">I genuinely believe that the ECON compromise would be good for all Member States. There are many people in my country who would say that the compromise does not go far enough to meet their concerns. I would have liked to delete Article 25, but I have conceded that it is not feasible or appropriate, and I have conceded the need for a pre-trade transparency requirement. I believe this compromise will be good for the national interests of Luxembourg, France, Italy, the UK and indeed all Member States. I believe it will be good for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">I have had to make concessions, I have moved a long way from my initial position and I would very strongly thank everyone in the committee and in the House who have also made concessions. I can support some of the plenary amendments: 145, 148, 151, 156 and 157, and I will be delighted to continue discussing the other plenary amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">We had a very serious debate in committee on the word non-professional: a whole range of interest groups from around Europe said they could accept the compromise if non-professional was deleted; now it has been. It is now a balanced compromise which allows a significant pre-trade transparency requirement to go ahead whilst at the same time addressing some of the practical problems with the original proposal - as Mr Bolkestein says, 'in a pragmatic way'.</p>
<p class="contents">The original Article 25 would have severely damaged liquidity and liquidity is vital for the health of our markets and our economy. This compromise seeks to deal with those practical problems, and reduce any damage that may occur to liquidity, by exempting the small banks and focusing on systematic internalisers, and by reducing counter-party risk. It allows price improvement: without price improvement the compromise is not workable. Only with price improvement will retail customers get the good prices they deserve. The obligation to give the same price to everyone will make internalisation uneconomic. Why should we who are charged with representing the peoples of Europe pass a law to prevent firms from giving good deals to their customers?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is vital that we accept the committee's amendments on execution-only business. The Commission proposal needs alteration, otherwise it would drive execution-only business out of business by making it uneconomic. I believe investors should continue if they wish to be able to take their own decisions about their investments. They should not be forced to buy professional advice they neither need nor want. This is unnecessary regulation and I would appeal to MEPs to reject it in the same way as the Committee did. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The road has been long and, in parts, an arduous one, but we have now found a compromise that reflects the whole House, that reflects opinion, and we should do our best to ensure that, in this week’s vote, the compromise as such is no longer challenged, but that there are only editorial changes to be made. We all accept that in future there will be competition between the different trading platforms, competition between stock markets and banks.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we cannot disregard specific criteria, for example, that in competition the same conditions apply to banks as do to markets. What that means is that, if I take markets as sources of prices – of meaningful market prices – then this cannot be allowed to lead to liquidity being damaged in future and markets no longer being meaningful. As for transparency, we must ensure that the market is transparent for all as a place where prices emerge, and that everyone can understand how prices evolve there. Supply and demand must be maintained. This is what our laborious discussions achieved, and also for pre-trade transparency. We gave some points to the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) and we will listen attentively to what advice the CESR gives us.</p>
<p class="contents">I see it as crucial that there are no winners and no losers in this discussion. Neither the City of London nor any other financial centre in Europe has won. Also we cannot say that the markets or the investment houses should have won, but everyone should be in this market together in the future, in order then to attract customers with the best offer. From a German point of view it is also important for me that the market structure should take national factors into account. I would, therefore, also ask that you give broad support to the two amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats so that small dealers in Germany are still protected. Thank you, Mr President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The principle that a large financial market offers greater liquidity and greater economic weight is well known. It can also offer greater competitiveness and, consequently, better prices to transacting parties. In this way, it encourages investors and investments and an increase in investments has an obvious economic importance on which we all agree. Our group is aiming for the maximum possible employment which can be created by increasing investments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal is based on the unification of the financial markets, on the so-called ‘European passport’; in other words, it offers investment banks the right to develop their activities in all 15 Member States, provided they comply with the rules of approval in just one Member State rather than in 15. But the Commission has complemented its proposal with the thought that, if a financial market really is to be able to operate without frontiers, the transacting parties must feel the same security wherever they place their money in Europe. This thought has given rise to regulatory rules common to everyone, which the Commission is also introducing in connection with the exercise of activities in a fair and transparent manner, the integrity of the market and the rights of investors to proper, honest treatment by banks and financiers.</p>
<p class="contents">Rules always regulate conflicting interests. The interests are fluid at the moment, because technology and the concentration of banking capital in large enterprises are creating new conditions, conditions under which banks are turning into stock exchanges with internal transactions and the stock exchanges are turning from infrastructures into companies. Thus, there is a risk of multiple fragmentation of the market which the directive, in one of its most controversial provisions, is trying to overcome, by forcing investment banks to communicate with the market transparently and before and after their commercial transactions are closed.</p>
<p class="contents">Generally speaking, the Commission proposal has again struck a good balance between the various interests and technological developments. The debate and the amendments by the Committee on Economic Affairs in general reinforce the Commission's work, thanks to the huge contribution by the rapporteur, whom I want to congratulate on her endeavour and her conciliatory approach. I hope that this conciliatory approach will prevail until the end and that the amendments proposed by our group will be supported, so that the report can be approved by a large majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has managed to piece together a sustainable compromise against all the odds. At present, the stock exchanges within the EU have a near monopoly on dealing in securities, especially in certain national markets. Now, we are obtaining competition and freedom of choice and, Mr Katiforis, sound protection of investors.</p>
<p class="contents">I want briefly to comment on the two sensitive articles, namely Articles 18 and 25. Where Article 18 is concerned, we think it important that the suitability test be reserved for services where advice is given and not, for example, Internet-based dealing in securities. These clients have consciously chosen a brokerage service in which they will have no need to pay for professional advice. That would just be more expensive. We shall therefore vote in favour of the committee’s Amendments Nos 53, 54 and 55.</p>
<p class="contents">The most discussed article in the proposal is Article 25, which deals with the internalisation of trade and the publication of price information prior to transactions that take place outside the regulated markets or MTF platform. We view this as rather risky. It would reduce liquidity on the market and increase costs. There has not been sufficient political support for the removal of this article, but we think that the committee’s Amendments Nos 33, 86, 87, 88 and 89 should remove the negative effects that the proposed rules on the publication of prices would have on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to ask why we are debating as important a proposal as this so late in the evening. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Competition between them over processing transactions will intensify as the European financial market becomes more integrated. Everyone knows that the City of London, which is also an aircraft carrier for American investment banks, has a strong lead where internalisation is concerned. Other companies such as <span class="italic">Deutsche Bank</span> or ABN-AMRO are launching out into the trade with ambitious business plans.</p>
<p class="contents">I observe that in carrying out our task as legislators we have singularly lacked a sound economic analysis clarifying the nature of the competition entered into and its implications. For example, do we want the small European markets stretching from the South to the East to be piloted by a handful of global players in London?</p>
<p class="contents">In this House we are accountable to the general interest and not the interests of individual countries. That is why we have supported two main principles: quality of information and fair competition. Businesses that use internalisation harness huge resources, but they do not form the market. They manipulate it but they need it, which is why pre-trade transparency is crucial to the quality of price formation, in particular to prevent volatility, speculation and insider dealing.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal applied this principle of pre-trade transparency that Mrs Villiers initially wished to abolish. Later she accepted it. She has shown great professionalism, it has to be acknowledged. She has given ground, but a large number of traps and mines were adopted in the committee on her initiative that drain this requirement for transparency of much of its meaning and create legal uncertainty. This applies to the definition of businesses practising internalisation, bonds and the size of orders, the exemption for eligible counterparties and the notion of price improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">As it stands, the report that was adopted proposes a system of regulation that is inferior to that enjoyed by the United States. That is why we have requested a number of separate votes so as to remove passages that we feel are harmful. Our aim is not to conclude this at first reading at any price nor simply to seek a compromise between the various interests, but to adopt a resolution that really does serve the common good. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first considered that investment firms – businesses practising internalisation – should be authorised to forge a strictly bilateral relationship with their clients, which had the disadvantage of not enabling these clients to benefit from the best possible price on the market, or even to learn what that best price was, or even quite simply to ensure price formation, which can only emerge from a general confrontation of bids and offers. The second philosophy, the so-called philosophy of regulated markets, considered that consumer protection required competition on a single, transparent market between all bids and offers, so as to enable clients to know the price and to benefit from the best possible price.</p>
<p class="contents">Were these two philosophies compatible? Yes, provided that the policies of investment firms were subject to common rules. In this respect the Commission text was very satisfactory. I am not sure, unlike Mr Bolkestein, that Mrs Villiers's report does markedly improve your initial text. But we can live with this compromise, because it is, as we have just been reminded, relatively satisfactory. It allows us to defend true principles and to act on them.</p>
<p class="contents">This statement is however subject to two reservations. The first concerns the issue of price improvement. It is not a question of knowing whether the client has the best price. Of course he should have the best price! The issue with price improvement is that it makes it possible for investment firms to apply a different price from the one that they publish and thus to prevent the market from contributing to the formation of fair prices.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are also unable to accept transactions relating to portfolios that consist, for the purpose of removing a transaction from the constraints of the directive, of an amalgam of securities of different kinds bearing no relation to each other. Subject to these two essential reservations, where some of us will be voting against the proposal, we consider Mrs Villiers's report to be satisfactory. I would be happy to congratulate the rapporteur if I felt – and this is a reservation – that she had been completely fair throughout the negotiations between the groups. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To allow these two systems to coexist at European level and to organise fair competition as well as protecting the interests of investors at the same time is a difficult task, and that will become particularly clear when we see what high sums are transferred every day and what effects the development of the financial markets will have on European and world economies. That being so, I hope that the compromise, which was reached through very tough negotiations in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, will encourage the Council to come to similar compromises so that this important legislative act on implementing an integrated financial services market can actually be passed in this term. I believe that we have tried to consider the interests of all market participants, including non-professional investors, and that we have implemented the principle of transparency in all key areas, just as the Commission intended.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, in the interests of price transparency and investor protection, it is necessary that contracts limited to internal trading systems, if they cannot be carried out by the internaliser directly, can be directly transferred to the regulated markets, unless the customer explicitly rules this out. A quick transfer offers the best chances for the best possible completion of the contract in the interests of the customers. I thereby believe that we have reached the right decision in this House, as is the case for the disclosure requirements in Article 25. I hope that with this directive competition of all trading systems will have a chance without the protection of investor interests being neglected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur for her valuable work. Without her endurance and extreme patience we would not have achieved this compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to make a few clarifications on this matter. The Commission proposal provides for pre-trade and post-trade transparency. This is just as costly as it is superfluous and would prevent financial institutions from investing in internalisation. This would mean virtually no more competition, and the abnormal concentration rule, which various Member States really have at heart, would – as Mr Bourlanges has just made clear – be brought in through the back door. It is regrettable that pre-trade transparency is provided for despite this. This, Mr Bolkestein, is where I agree with the Commission that this should only apply to private customers and should not be extended to professional customers.</p>
<p class="contents">It must, however, also be possible for internalised financial institutions to offer their customers better prices than those who give notice of them through pre-trade transparency. If the financial institutions concerned achieve this, then so much the better, it is in the interests of the customer.</p>
<p class="contents">Various Members also want pre-trade transparency extended to loan bonds. I am against this, as the two markets are structured in very different ways. Shrewd football fans will not then be prevented from investing loan bonds into their favourite clubs without having to weigh up the risks and potential profits, as was the case in Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for the directive also requires financial institutions to get the go-ahead from customers when the order is to be executed. I think that this is excessive. The compromise as it was adopted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs goes a lot further than what was required to create a single market that functioned well for financial services. I regret to say that policy is the art of achieving. We are currently involved in the first reading and perhaps those who agreed with the rapporteur in her first version will come round and then perhaps we can find a better text than we have at this first reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are all familiar with the directive's objectives: to ensure that the financial sector allocates our economy's financial resources in the best possible way. On this basis, I believe that the text that we have drafted is expected by all traders. All that remains is for me to make a few essential observations.</p>
<p class="contents">To protect non-professional investors, financial companies need to take the trouble to check their level of knowledge and their resources. Execution only is not a continental practice and by suddenly imposing it we would run the risk of destabilising many investors. Secondly, for competition to be genuine, information must be made available to all players. Transparency is therefore essential. Pre-trade transparency should not admit of any exception and I can accept that it does not apply to limit price orders and is restricted to orders of a standard size, but the possibility of price improvement, already mentioned by Mr Jean-Louis Bourlanges, seems to me to be an extremely worrying development.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in the vote on Thursday, I think that we should try to restate the position that we in Parliament adopted on the 'delivery' regulation, which is to say that we should ask the Commission to draft a directive on this point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was a very difficult task, but we were successful. Further, I would like to make it clear that Parliament wants to pass this directive in this term and we hope that this compromise will also help the Council to come to one of its own. The new directive for investment services and regulated markets will strengthen the single European financial market. Why do we even need a directive? Because inadequately harmonised rules, high levels of bureaucracy and antiquated provisions for investor protection have so far been considerable barriers to cross-border securities trading.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the main points of our compromise and the new regulations? Firstly, investor protection. Investors must be well informed and the rules on the conduct of business are one of the most important pillars of investor protection: the differences between advice and non-advice business. In future a suitability test will only be required for advice business. Thirdly, we want the best possible service. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have come up with a wording that is acceptable to both small and large financial institutions. Fourthly, the decisive point: the level playing field between banks dealing internally with securities and markets. In this compromise, it was decided that banks are subject to appropriate supervisory and transparency rules. The aim is that the internalisation systems are allowed but not to the detriment of markets and other market participants.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that this compromise will make for fairer competition between banks and stock markets, from which the consumer will benefit most. I would ask everyone to vote in favour of the compromise the day after tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the short time that has been allocated to me and at this late hour, I can only formulate a few guiding principles that will determine my commitment to reach compromises and my voting behaviour on Thursday.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to outline two objectives. First of all, promoting private investment in the European Union. We must make every effort to increase liquid assets for the benefit of economic activity and to recover from the economic decline once again. Secondly, protecting small private investors. On the one hand, by laying down unambiguous rules that are closely monitored and, on the other hand, by optimising these small investors’ choices in terms of investment products, institutions and methods. It is the latter point that formed the subject of the debates concerning the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the small investor should be able to have access to stock exchanges as well as his own home bank. In-house matching is a fully-fledged alternative to the monopoly of stock exchanges, something which causes me increasing anxiety, certainly if it transcends national borders and stands in the way of national supervision. This requires transparency, but must not adversely affect price forming and liquidity on the financial markets.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the last point – the method of legislation – is concerned, I agree with the approach, based on the Lamfalussy method, of delegating a number of things to supervisors and regulators. I concur with everyone who has stated that it is important to reach compromises and to encourage the Council to do the same. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Maybe that suits us for what may happen in the very near future. I hope, Commissioner, you will take note of that. But if the financial services plan is to work, this directive has to be in place.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no point in acting on the issues of barriers of national protectionism if we look backwards.

<p class="contents">As regards pre-trade transparency obligations for investment firms, Article 25, all the amendments related to pre-trade transparency, that is to say Amendments Nos 33 and 86 to 90, can be accepted at least partially or in principle, but we are not convinced of the necessity to allow for price improvement. We are not convinced that in the way it is presented in the amendments it is necessary or beneficial for the interests of retail investors.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider that the current exemption for commodity derivatives and the dealers of such instruments should apply on a consolidated basis. As already explained, in the conduct of business obligations we accept - and this is in line with the Commission's initial proposal - the limitation of the obligation on investment firms to carry out a full suitability test only for certain services.</p>
<p class="contents">Regretfully, we do not agree with a number of amendments referring to comitology provisions. Some of them are against the principles set out in the report of the Wise Men - the Lamfalussy approach in particular. We consider that implementing measures should only contain detailed technical rules, not principles.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of adopting level 2 measures is always to ensure uniform application of EU legislation in all Member States, so any vague formulations proposed in that respect cannot be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">On the division of responsibilities between competent authorities, in the case of branches we consider that in order to ensure a correct functioning of the single market the principle of the host Member State regulation should only apply as an exception for determining the conduct of business rules and record-keeping. In this context the Commission is in a position to accept a large number of amendments, some of them in their entirety, but also a large number partially or in principle and with adaptations.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the Commission can accept 36 amendments in their entirety. Furthermore, 62 amendments could be at least accepted partially or in principle, with some changes needed in order to ensure the overall coherence of the text.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider that 60 amendments have to be rejected. The Commission's opinion on the individual amendments has been provided in writing<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like to congratulate Parliament for its most valuable efforts. The Commission considers that many of the amendments adopted constitute a good basis on which to continue discussions. Hardly a nanny state position, as I think you will agree. With such a constructive spirit, I am very confident that this Parliament, and the Council, will be able to adopt a proposal before the 2004 European Parliamentary elections.</p>
