I feel that the presence of a high-level representative is necessary in a debate on an issue to which Parliament attaches such great importance. That said, and I would like it to be recorded in the Minutes, at least, I would particularly like to thank all my colleagues in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, especially Mr Deprez and Mr von Boetticher, for their hard work which has enabled us to achieve a common position.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, first of all, to point out that Parliament has repeatedly called upon the Council to reform the Europol Convention to allow for concrete democratic control and powers over Europol, notably in the Nassauer, Karamanou and Deprez reports. With these reports, we are calling once again today for greater European Parliament involvement in the Europol budget procedure and for Europol to be funded through the Community budget. We are calling for European Parliament involvement in the appointment and dismissal of Europol's Director and Deputy Directors, and for two European Parliament elected representatives to take part in the Management Board meetings. We are calling for full respect of Parliament’s rights to be informed and consulted. We are calling for the revision of the Europol Convention to bring it into line with higher standards and methods of democratic control. We are calling for the strengthening of judicial control by the Court of Justice. Lastly, we are calling for the communitarisation of Europol.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission has already expressed itself on the issue of democratic control, proposing to establish a joint committee, consisting of members of both the Member States’ and European Parliament committees responsible for police matters. The issue of democratic control of Europol has also been recently debated in the Convention Working Group ‘Freedom, security and justice’. According to the Minutes of the Working Group, during a hearing, the Europol Director, Mr Storbeck, affirmed that ‘parliamentary control of Europol is currently unclear’; he stated the difficulties in being accountable to too many national parliaments and that stronger and more efficient democratic control would be in Europol's own interest. He mentioned the prospect of control by the European Parliament as a possible solution. The same Convention Working Group has drafted a final report which states: ‘Europol activities will need in the future to be subject to democratic accountability to the European Parliament and to the Council, as well as to judicial control by the ECJ in accordance with the normal Treaty rules’.</p>
<p class="contents">Notwithstanding all these repeated appeals and specific proposals, here we are today discussing a Protocol to the Europol Convention on which the European Parliament is being consulted. Not only does it not solve these issues, it does not even address them. The results of a comparison between the current powers of democratic control over Europol and the proposed reforms contained in the Protocol are extremely disappointing. In the face of all this, we in the committee – and, I hope, tomorrow, the House – noting that repeated requests and proposals for real, improved democratic control and powers on Europol have been ignored,<span class="bold"> </span>can only condemn the fact that the proposed changes are mainly aesthetic and make a mockery of the European Parliament and the European citizens which elected it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has not followed Parliament’s repeated requests for increased powers<span class="bold"> </span>over the Europol budget and in the appointment and dismissal procedures or for European Parliament representatives’ participation in the Management Board. Neither has it followed the Commission proposal for a joint committee, or the Europol Director's view in favour of increased democratic control. Under these conditions, the European Parliament will keep its current role with regard to Europol: discussing without anybody listening and making reports without anybody implementing. Inevitably, one day, the Council will have to realise that increased democratic control and powers with regard to Europol are the only guarantee for its correct functioning and administration in everybody's interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Our rejection of the initiatives and the resolution we have tabled confirm this: as I said, it was a difficult decision; we discussed the matter at least four times in committee, but, in the end, all the political groups agreed on this document. I know it has been said countless times before, but the Council cannot be allowed to continue to ignore this position – which is no longer just Parliament’s position – <span class="italic">ad infinitum</span>. I hope and trust that Commissioner Vitorino will have a helpful suggestion as to an effective course of action, as he has proposed many effective measures in the course of this legislature. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this instance, we agreed on a common approach, one that would involve rejecting the Danish and Greek initiatives and adopting our own recommendation on Europol's future development, but, despite the common draft, our arguments do of course differ to some extent. It is the case that, in the past, we in the European Parliament made matters easy for ourselves by rejecting every proposal for amending the Europol Convention. Our justification for doing so was the lack of democratic and judicial control over Europol, for, belonging as it does to the third pillar, Europol has hitherto not been subject either to parliamentary control by the European Parliament or to judicial control by the European Court of Justice, whilst the national parliaments mainly had no interest in controlling it either.</p>
<p class="contents">There were a number of extensions of Europol's competences that we in the European Parliament were unwilling to agree to without increased powers of control. The Danish proposal, though, on which I am reporting, contains precisely this increase in Parliament's opportunities for control, in that, according to it, Parliament is to be consulted on numerous issues, including the collection, processing and utilisation of personal data, the transmission of data to third states, the establishment of rules on secrecy and the protection of confidentiality in relation to personal status and, finally, any amendment of the Europol Convention as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Even the proposed facility whereby national authorities should in future be able to communicate directly with Europol would be a real step forward. It strikes me, for a start, that it would not make sense to reject all this, and, even though this has been the line we have taken in the past as a matter of principle, I considered welcoming the proposal, on the grounds that it should be seen in the context of the debate in the Convention, where, at this time, Working Group X had proposed the dissolution of the European Union's third pillar – Justice and Internal Affairs – and the transfer of Europol to the first pillar. This would entail both judicial control by the European Court of Justice and parliamentary control by way of the European Parliament's budgetary rights. Seen in this light, then, it initially made sense to anchor a consultation procedure in the Europol Convention. Now, though, the proposals put forward by the Convention presidium have caught up with the Danish initiative, something for which thanks are especially owed to Commissioner Vitorino.</p>
<p class="contents">I will be honest, Commissioner, and concede that I did not at first think it possible that the Convention would indeed bring itself to make Europol subject to a codecision procedure, to be termed in future a legislative procedure, with equal rights for Parliament and for the Council, but what I asked for at the end of each of my previous speeches has now been granted. In this area, the Convention has indeed demonstrated courage. Whilst, when I consider the amendments tabled by members of the Convention, I do find a few asking for the Council to reach unanimous decisions in this area, I can find not one single amendment intended to curtail the role envisaged for the European Parliament. That being so, we can assume a broad consensus, and so the Danish initiative, with the consultation procedure it contains, can be shelved.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, nonetheless, possible to make improvements to the presidium's proposals. For a start, the Council's authority to draw up guidelines should be done away with, as, secondly, should Article 9's restriction on control by the Court of Justice. Thirdly, in general terms, unanimity in the Council in matters concerning Europol, as requested by a number of members of the Convention, is something to be rejected. Fourthly, the legislative procedure must make it possible for Europol to conduct its own investigations, in collaboration with the appropriate officials in the Member States. Such a transfer of competences could, in the first instance, also be subject to unanimity, although Parliament's rights must under no circumstances be curtailed. Fifthly, Europol must also be able to act in defence of the EU's financial interests when asked to do so by Eurojust or of the Public Prosecutor yet to be appointed as part of it. This is where cooperation with this institution must be regulated in even more precise terms; it must not be left to internal agreements, as was the case before. Sixthly, control by Eurojust will be meaningful only when Europol has had real executive powers handed over to it, for, until they have been, the fact that Europol remains subject to the control of national public prosecutors will result in structures being duplicated. The seventh point is that Europol must be given access to the various computer systems – among which I will mention only the Schengen Information System, the Customs Information System, and Eurodac – which are to be united in one single uniform computer system with different entitlements to access it.</p>
<p class="contents">My eighth point follows on from this. Europol has to have standardised data protection along the lines of Directive 46/95, and it needs simple language rules. Last but not least, the requirement that the Member States cooperate with Europol needs to be enforced more strictly. Many Member States are still sending Europol too few data or none at all.</p>
<p class="contents">We now urge the Council not to go on blocking the use of EU Budget resources to fund Europol in its counter-terrorist activities until such time as the Intergovernmental Conference has adopted such a constitutional treaty. The public cannot be persuaded that their security suffers when the Interior Ministers feel that their competences have been trespassed upon. In any case, the Convention leaves room for a generous interpretation.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Council must make preparations for the Europol Convention to be carried over into legislation. It is now for all of us to ensure that the Convention is a success. I believe, indeed, that our success is predestined, for without these advances we will, in the long term, fail in our attempts to combat crime in Europe. So, today too, I will end with words that even Mr Coelho will endorse: by the way, it is my opinion that the Convention must be even more courageous. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission shares Mr Turco’s opinion that it would be difficult for European Union citizens to understand that the classification system of Europol documents should be different from the classification system of European Union documents. As a result of this initiative, Europol would have four levels of classification corresponding to those adopted in the Council decision of 19 March 2001 and the Commission decision of 29 November 2001. Mr Turco refers in his report to Council Regulation No 1049/2001.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to call this House’s attention to the fact that this regulation addresses the question of public access to documents. It is not, however, a regulation that sets the levels of classification of Council or Commission documents. With regard to the rules on public access to documents held by Europol, Members are certainly aware that the Danish initiative provides that Europol’s Management Board should adopt rules on access to Europol documents taking into consideration the principles and limits laid down in Regulation No 1049/2001. In the Commission’s opinion, this means that officially Europol’s Management Board only has to adopt such rules when the Danish initiative is ratified. Nevertheless, given the importance of this issue, I should like to stress that in our view there is nothing to stop Europol from acting straight away to adopt rules on document access that take Regulation No 1049/2001 into consideration, as suggested by the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mr von Boetticher’s report, the objectives of this initiative are to define the competences of Europol better, to make Europol the point of contact in the European Union for issues relating to the counterfeiting of the euro, to improve contacts between Europol and the Member States’ police forces, and lastly to provide a better basis for informing the European Parliament about Europol activities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear to me that these initiatives we are discussing do not solve the basic problems raised regarding the status of Europol. I am of the opinion, however, that they are moving in the right direction. I do, of course, understand Parliament’s position of wanting to show its disagreement with the insufficiency of the solutions by recommending that the initiatives by the four Member States should be rejected. But it must be remembered that the questions raised by these initiatives are at the same time being examined by the Convention on the Future of Europe. Rejection of these initiatives would probably be a bad sign for change in the right direction. I believe Parliament agrees with the Commission that the Europol Convention needs to be replaced with an instrument that is more easily adapted and allows for adequate legal and democratic control at a European level. The Europol Convention should be replaced right now, today, through a Council decision, just as Eurojust was set up on the basis of a Council decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Europol’s budget should be financed from the Community budget, and the information given to the European Parliament should likewise be looked at from a different viewpoint. In fact, in the communication that the Commission presented to Parliament on the democratic control of Europol, we recommended that a joint supervisory body should be set up composed of representatives of the European Parliament and of the national parliaments. Lastly, as regards the field of data protection, the rules that exist in the current Europol Convention must be extended.</p>
<p class="contents">These objectives are only very partially achieved by the Member States’ initiatives. As Mr von Boetticher has just pointed out, however, the Convention on the Future of Europe is right now discussing a draft article on Europol which, as I see it, addresses precisely the concerns I have just mentioned. This should not, however, prevent the adoption of the initiative by Denmark. It is true – and I recognise Mr von Boetticher is right – that the ratification process for this Convention is going to be slow and cumbersome because we know that all conventions under Title 6 of the Treaty have been extremely slow and cumbersome. We only have to recall that the Convention on the Protection of the European Communities’ Financial Interests was ratified by all the European Union Member States only last month, yet it dates back to 1995. This is a good reason for getting rid of the ‘convention’ instrument within the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not forget, however, that the outcome of the Convention on the Future of Europe, that is, the Constitutional Treaty, will also be subject to a process of ratification by the parliaments of all the Member States, all twenty-five Member States, and will therefore be a similarly slow and cumbersome process. The immediate triggering of the ratification process for these amendments to the Europol Convention does not conflict with the Constitutional Treaty, since the rules of the Constitutional Treaty will prevail over the rules that are now the subject of this initiative by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to express my support for Parliament’s position when, in the recommendation to the Council, it refers to Article 22 presented by the Convention Praesidium. I should like to point out that the objective with which the Commission has approached the debate on the Convention is to make Europol an agency of the European Union with a normal statute within a single institutional framework. This means Community financing, a legal basis that can be changed more easily, a European Union law and the use of the normal legislative procedure, that is, the qualified majority and codecision rule. All these elements are welcome; they are in line with the Commission communication of December 2002 on the institutional architecture of the European Union and I believe they fit in with the objectives of more effective police cooperation in the European area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We want to help Europol become an effective instrument in the fight against organised crime and to take on a primary role in cooperation between the Member States’ authorities on investigations into cross-border criminal activities.</p>
<p class="contents">While we support the introduction of operational powers in Europol, which the Treaty of Amsterdam itself provides for, however, we have also repeatedly pointed to the need for the strengthening of its role to be accompanied by measures to ensure both democratic control and jurisdictional control. In this respect we have consistently rejected all the initiatives with which we have been presented that ask us to decide on questions of detail concerning Europol. As the representatives of the European citizens, we have repeatedly asked for the necessary powers so that we can exercise the desirable democratic control over Europol.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteurs, Mr Turco and Mr von Boetticher, are rightly asking us once again to reject these Danish initiatives, to which a Greek one is now added, to remain consistent with the positions that this Parliament has been adopting. This rejection must be used as an opportunity to restate our position. First, that Europol cannot continue to be maintained within the framework of simple intergovernmental cooperation. The Europol Convention should be replaced with a Council decision under Article 34(2)(c) of the Treaty on European Union, to which the Commissioner has just referred, which will allow changes to be introduced through a simplified procedure and the adoption of executive measures by a qualified majority; it would thus become integrated into the European Union system of institutions. Secondly, the role of the Court of Justice must be aligned with the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam, so that there can be effective judicial control. Thirdly, Europol clearly needs to be subject to an adequate level of democratic control, putting an end to the current situation in which the European Parliament has been playing a purely marginal role.</p>
<p class="contents">We very much welcome the result of the Convention’s work and the proposal by the Convention Praesidium, which clearly requests a move towards the communitisation of Europol with the incorporation of Europol into the first pillar, the Europol Convention being replaced with a Council decision. In addition, Europol’s structure, working methods, fields of activity and missions would be defined in a codecision procedure by the European Parliament and the Council. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats therefore supports the motion for a resolution that Mr Turco and Mr von Boetticher have tabled asking the Council and the Member States to support the Convention’s proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The joint supervisory authority responsible for data protection is composed of a Member from each Member State. It is supposed to ensure that Europol respects the Convention's provisions on data protection. It has to review the activities of Europol in order to ensure that the rights of individuals are not violated by the storage, processing and utilisation of data held. It must monitor the permissibility of the transmission of data originating from Europol. It submits regular reports to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention itself, in several Council acts, lays down rules on the use of data and the communication of that data to third states and bodies. But to judge from the evidence given by the UK Member of the joint supervisory body to the House of Lords European Select Committee, we have reason to ask if we can have total confidence in the thoroughness with which the joint supervisory authority is doing its job. I therefore fully support the recommendation in the reports we are debating that this authority should report to both the Council and Parliament and should be available for questioning before the relevant committee, which would be the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The evidence that worried me was given last November. Mr Francis Aldhouse, the Deputy Information Commissioner in the UK, was responding to questions about the Europol-US agreement on exchange of personal data. He discussed the difficulty of evaluating the adequacy of data protection in the United States – because they have no federal law or data protection authority, but rely largely on case-law, judicial supervision and audit. He expressed concern at the very wide provisions for transfer of data and the potential for abuse in the Europol-US agreement. But then, abdicating any responsibility for being vigilant and active, he concluded: 'I think we ought to take the view, particularly as between Western European countries and the United States, that here is a set of countries which take a pride in abiding by the rule of law and will honour their agreements. I share the view of my JSB colleagues that this is acceptable.' – i.e. that we trust the guys. I do not believe it is responsible for him to abdicate responsibility like this, and he is the UK Member on the joint supervisory body.</p>
<p class="contents">The House of Lords was not impressed either and urged the body to adopt a robust approach to the protection of personal data in third country agreements. By requesting accountability to the European Parliament we can help ensure this, although we must also have partnership with national parliaments. A joint committee of European and national parliaments would be an excellent way forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is only right, as the only possible response to the continued attempts at letting Europol carry on working as it did before is to say that the Europol of the future must not function without being influenced and monitored by Parliament, nor will it if this House has anything to do with it. I therefore want to thank both rapporteurs for having again put this message in unambiguous terms.</p>
<p class="contents">I find the goings-on in this sensitive area scarcely credible. A number of reports by Parliament have, over and over again, demanded real Parliamentary control of Europol, but to date nothing has happened. Instead, Europol is to continue to be strengthened and extended. I find this quite simply scandalous.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of what is going on in the background at the European Convention's discussions, the various initiatives by individual governments seem positively Kafkaesque, for they go beyond the proposals before the Convention on the reform of internal affairs and judicial matters. Being a member of the Convention, I therefore support the idea of this House again putting its main demand before the Council and the governments and confronting them with it. I also endorse Mr von Boetticher's demand for there to be no amendments made to the Europol convention before the European constitution is ratified. I think this should be obvious if the Convention and its work are to be taken seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">I endorse the demands in the motion for a resolution, for Europol to be transferred to the first pillar and funded from the EU Budget, thus becoming subject to Parliament's full Budgetary control, and for the constitution to contain a legal basis for clear and utterly stringent data protection, with public access to documents not being able to be improperly restricted.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important thing, though, is something that my fellow-Members have already emphasised, namely that Europol should be entirely subject to Parliament's control. As a member of the Convention, I can only ask you to continue to observe carefully the negotiations in progress in the Convention on this issue, for, in my view – if I may give an example – the basic thrust of the proposals on Europol from the Convention's Praesidium is that it should be, to a large degree, left to its own devices when it comes to laying down precisely what its role is. As I do not regard that as acceptable, I have asked that it should be the legislatures alone – by which I mean specifically the Council and Parliament acting together – that should legislate to define the precise functions of these authorities along with all their ramifications.</p>

Parliament is as united now in rejecting the Council initiatives with regard to Europol as it was divided this afternoon in the debate on the UN Conventions on drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">In both debates, Parliament demonstrated the alternative ways in which it can exert influence in spheres in which it does not have legislative competence: this afternoon as a political and public forum in which debates sometimes become heated, and now as a guardian of the rights of our citizens. It is clear to us all that the present situation is unacceptable, as Europol is under neither democratic nor legal control. We are not joining in the game, therefore; we are not dutifully delivering our opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">I should particularly like to thank the two rapporteurs – Mr von Boetticher and Mr Turco – most sincerely for ensuring an approach and a solution according to which, on the one hand, we are able to openly voice our criticism – which we do by rejecting the Council proposals and, on the other, we are able to express our positive, constructive suggestions in a recommendation, such as our recommendation that Europol be made part of the first pillar. I think that this is a very constructive approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that we tightened up the wording yesterday by means of an amendment explicitly stating that Europol must bring access to documents into line with the European rules on transparency; for public access to information must also apply to Europol. That does not mean, of course, that there is not sometimes good reason to keep something confidential, to not put it in the public domain, but objective criteria must be applied, and those are worded excellently in Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001. That Regulation must be applied. I welcome Commissioner Vitorino’s confirmation, according to which Europol can simply apply that Regulation now, in anticipation of formal rules being drawn up.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to try to win you over to the amendments that my group has re-tabled. If I succeed in this, I think that it is abundantly clear that this debate is radically different from this afternoon’s, because this afternoon everyone was, first and foremost, absolutely convinced of being in the right. I want it to be clear from the Europol database where the data come from. Do they originate from individual investigations, or were they obtained through national police or intelligence services? This is important, because in some countries certain data may and other data may not be used as evidence in criminal cases. If there is no clarity, there is a risk of evidence being termed illegal and thus inadmissible. My amendment to Recommendation No 5 argues in favour of clarity as regards the origin of evidence, due to the importance of this clarity for legal cases. I hope it will have your support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, I have some differences of opinion with regard to some of the speeches and comments. Firstly, we should recognise that Europol did not appear out of thin air. It was established by rules and protocols agreed by the Member State governments, acting on the authority of the people who elected them, to ensure that they could bring forward ideas and proposals on their behalf.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Europol, by its very nature, is reactive rather than interactive or proactive. It depends on information which is given to it by the national police forces, on cooperation with those forces and also on the requests from those forces for it to undertake action.</p>
<p class="contents">However, that said, there is an opportunity for greater accountability of Europol. There is a necessity for their data-protection systems to be put in place and to be clear for all to see in operation and to understand. I also believe that there should be an opportunity in the future for this House, through its own committees and the plenary, to debate the activities of Europol on an annual basis. However, where I would differ from my colleagues is in trying to use strong-arm tactics against the Member State governments by telling them what they can and cannot do.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that much mention has been made recently in Parliament of the ongoing work of the European Convention. Whilst we all await with great uncertainty and excitement the outcome of the Convention, it plays no role whatsoever in forming the basis of our work today. We have to deal with the legislation, the powers and the Treaties before us today, and not with what may be given to us in the future under any future Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must, however, seek to adapt Europol's position to its present tasks, and to give it the best working conditions possible. This, though, is where we have the problem referred to earlier, in that, even though we transfer functions to the EU level, we still have to use the tools provided by intergovernmental cooperation, because that is what the legal base requires, and we need unanimous resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We will, tomorrow, decide to enlarge the European Union to twenty-five Member States by adding another ten, and, when we have done that, we will have to give some thought to whether this arsenal can indeed remain functional when there are twenty-five Member States. My fear is that Europol is no longer able to perform its functions, and no further amendments will be feasible if we wait for twenty-five states to ratify the convention. So it is the debates currently in progress that once again call on us to emphatically demand what the two rapporteurs have demanded in their joint report – the necessity of securing for the future Europol's existence and that of the European Union's security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore press home the demand for those things envisaged by the rapporteurs – communitisation, that is to say, transfer to the first pillar; control, as is necessary, by Parliament; allocation of the budget to the European level, and, most essentially, the transfer, subject to appropriate controls, of operational competences. What other speakers have already mentioned must of course be added to this – namely, more intensive coordination between the computer data systems that we have, in order to conduct investigations into organised crime and criminality in an even more efficient manner. We have no more need of systems that work in parallel or that hinder each other; what we need instead is one system, to be used in the same way by all, combined with a single system of data protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Here is a wealth of options, of which we may well be aware, but of which we must now make use if they are to be implemented with the help of the Convention documents and with full backing and support from all parties in the European Parliament.</p>

Some may object that Europol is thereby being transferred from the third pillar to the first and thus being removed still further from the European nation states' control. That is both true and irrelevant, for the character of the Police Office is not determined by which state body is meant to be controlling it. The new plans for Europol are even more repellent than policemen are in any case required to be. In any case, it is the police who, by upholding public order, enforce all the constraints of employment and citizenship. It would be ridiculous for this Chamber to lament such an utterly vile stunt, as these are constraints of which you all approve!</p>
<p class="contents">Even if you are unwilling to understand rational criticism of bourgeois society, you can – if you want to be bourgeois humanists, refuse to endorse these plans, for Europol's true nature is apparent from its areas of responsibility. Pride of place goes to the efficient organisation of Fortress Europe, in other words deportation for outsiders and the maximum of control within the European area, so free and secure and just as it is. Not only people-smugglers and dealers will be affected by this. It is irrelevant whether they do what they do as a matter of conviction or because capitalism obliges them to.</p>
<p class="contents">More and more citizens will find themselves targeted by the Persecution Authority, for communitisation will enable the Euro-police to be deployed more flexibly, and Europol's competences will be capable of being extended by a simple Council resolution. Its operational powers will be introduced along with communitisation, representing the final step towards the completion of an EU police force with the powers of a secret service. In any case, communitisation makes the police force even more important.</p>
<p class="contents">To be sure, the Europol convention has to be done away with and replaced, but by a protocol abolishing it rather than by creating the legal basis for even more surveillance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would, however, question both the realism of the proposal and its political wisdom. Since the proposal’s ambitions cannot be realised on the basis of the existing treaties, those tabling the proposal have taken their arguments from the expectations of the European Convention, the aim of which is clearly – as has been said several times – to transfer these topics from the intergovernmental pillar 3 to supranational regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">A supranational Europol is nothing less than a federal police force. It is both an objective of, and a means of establishing, a European federal state. The logic behind Europol is a lesson in EU integration. Random parts of the regulation that until now has been the responsibility of the national states are removed. Nations are forced to lift national border controls. Free movement opens up the borders to the best-functioning part of the internal market, namely cross-border crime. Consequently, Europol is created. In short: the federal state is built up by knocking down the national state.</p>
<p class="contents">Without, as mentioned previously, doubting the good intentions behind it, as a Scandinavian I am convinced that the rights of control that we have over our Danish police – and which are far from satisfactory – do however serve democracy and the rule of law far more securely than any supranational system. The existing control arrangements with regard to data protection that it is proposed be continued are a parody of the rule of law. As a Northerner, I say that we can do better ourselves, at least while we have not yet squandered the whole of our heritage in terms of legal culture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
