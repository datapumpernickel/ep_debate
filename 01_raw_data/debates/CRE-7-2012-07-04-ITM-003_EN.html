<p class="contents">May I express my profound respect and congratulations to the European Parliament on the role which it plays in defending and promoting the fundamental principles on which the European Union is founded. Allow me to underline my personal satisfaction with the fact that the Treaty of Lisbon allows the European Parliament to legislate jointly, with the Council, on most matters. There can be no doubt that this positive development enhances and broadens democracy in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This is Cyprus’s first six-month Presidency of the Council since it acceded to the European Union and it coincides with very difficult conditions for our Union. The global economic crisis is affecting numerous Member States, with the euro area still bearing the brunt of the pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">Without doubt, the challenges faced by our Union require an innovative European response. Perhaps the time has come for us to turn for guidance to the starting point of European unification when, in the aftermath of war, nothing was taken for granted. The time has come for us to draw lessons from the courage and foresight of the fathers of the European vision: a vision of peace, democracy, pluralism and social justice. In times of crisis such as this, there is an even more urgent need for us to achieve a more solidarity-based and effective Union, a better Europe. We owe it to the visionaries of European unification and, more importantly, we owe it to our children and grandchildren.</p>
<p class="contents">The attainment of a better Europe is a universal demand of the citizens of the Union. We have an obligation to listen to our citizens and to do all we can to achieve a Union that means more to our citizens: a Europe of social cohesion, prosperity, security and growth. We shall work tirelessly within the Council during the current semester, within the scope of our competences, to push forward every legislative initiative that will help to achieve the objective of a social solidarity-based and effective Union: a Europe with more visible benefits in terms of the prosperity of European citizens. This is our general political objective for the six-month Cypriot Presidency and we truly hope that we shall have the support and assistance of all the institutions, especially the European Parliament, in this endeavour.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the European construct has experienced numerous crises since its foundation. However, it would appear that the on-going social and economic crisis, which stems in large part from the global economic crisis, is, comparatively speaking, the biggest challenge that the European Union has had to face since its foundation. That is because prosperity and social cohesion in the Union have come under serious threat. At the same time, cracks have appeared in the institutional unity of the Union, due in part to the different approaches adopted in terms of the measures that should have been taken, as an immediate priority, in order to stabilise the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I firmly believe that we need to support cohesion and unity between the Member States. Together we can certainly do more.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that the European Union will successfully overcome the difficulties it faces. The European Union has no option but to emerge stronger from the current crisis; a crisis which, unfortunately, has seriously shaken the confidence of European citizens in our institutional edifice. However, we shall be able to defeat the challenges if we collectively demonstrate the necessary trust in the common European institutions, in the institutions of the Union. The Community method has proven over the years to be an effective weapon in defending our common interests and must be protected at all costs. Action to deepen the European unification policy based on solidarity and social cohesion is, in my view, the best way of effectively addressing the current social and economic crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider that, in order to decide on an effective remedy for the damage caused by the crisis, we must, at the same time, make a correct diagnosis of the causes of it. We must jointly make a bold and in-depth analysis of the essence and scope of the social and economic crisis. In my view, we need to have the courage to engage in self-criticism at national and European level, in order to identify possible political inertia or weaknesses in the policies applied in Europe, especially over the last two decades. It is hard to contest the fact that the policies implemented in previous years, which promoted a model of absolute and dogmatic attachment to the freedom of the market with no social or state control, have failed because, quite simply, a free social market economy is one thing and unaccountable markets, without state supervision or similar safety values for the benefit of society as a whole, is another.</p>
<p class="contents">Under no circumstances should we leave our societies at the mercy of the markets and the selfish interests that manipulate them. Events have proven that any measures taken in recent years were ineffective due to the analysis of the crisis, which was based on the standard response that wants us to hold speculators alone and, occasionally, the markets responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">The strict austerity policies being applied in order to address the crisis are not only turning out to be unable to resolve the problems; they are exacerbating them. Austerity policies are simply unravelling the social state and immobilising growth. The economy and sustainable growth must serve society. The wealth produced must be distributed more fairly. The approach cannot be to ‘nationalise the losses and privatise the profits’. We cannot use our policies to put the burden of the current crisis on the shoulders of those who are having trouble making ends meet. The man in the street in the Member States of the Union is the last person responsible for the inherent weaknesses which, as we have seen, are hampering the creation of economic and monetary union.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, we have a moral and political responsibility to distribute the burden of the crisis more fairly and we must certainly protect the economically and socially vulnerable sections of society.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me at this point to express the deep concern that I feel every time our television viewers see images of misfortune, with citizens queuing at soup kitchens in order to get food rations, basically survival rations. It is, at the very least, difficult for all of us to accept such a situation in Europe. We cannot remain unmoved when we see poverty resulting in the social exclusion and impoverishment of large sections of society in Europe. I invite my friend the President of the European Commission, from this official tribune, to work together with us, to find ways of using agricultural intervention products to extend and strengthen the Food Distribution Programme for our deprived fellow citizens. I will truly be the happiest of Europeans if, by the end of the Cypriot Presidency, we have managed to bring about tangible results under this programme or by adopting similar actions of equivalent result, based on legislative initiatives by the Commission, thereby further minimising this important social problem which, of course, this alone will not solve.</p>
<p class="contents">The major issue, therefore, in my opinion, is the need for fairer redistribution of income produced and a consistent and more citizen-oriented social policy which, in conjunction with support for small and medium-sized enterprises, which form the backbone of the European economy, will result in more employment and the social cohesion sorely needed within our Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Without doubt, actions have been promoted, especially over the last year, with the help of all sides, especially the European Commission, to accelerate structural reform and create better conditions of competitiveness and growth in the European economy, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. We expect these actions to increase employment, primarily among young people, in a greener economy. All this is in addition to the priority measures taken to address the debt crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective therefore, is to reconcile the approach to budgetary discipline, on the one hand, because it is important to limit wastage and manage our public finances carefully, and the approach in terms of implementing a strong growth and job creation strategy in Europe, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency of the Council looks forward to collaborating closely with the Members of the European Parliament, so that, in cooperation with the European Commission, we can promote targeted actions to reduce the social pressure that has arisen in most of the Member States of our Union and which, unfortunately, has mostly affected the young generation, our children, the future of our Europe. More social Europe is what we need, especially under the current difficult economic conditions. That is the only way we can help European citizens regain their belief in the vision of European unification. That is the only way we can reduce the gap dividing European citizens from the faceless and often distant decision-making centres in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely within this framework of efforts to achieve a better Europe that the Cypriot Presidency has set four main priorities:</p>
<p class="contents">First priority: Europe, more effective and sustainable.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cypriot Presidency will focus on the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020, in the ultimate aim of finalising negotiations and creating a fair and effective Union budget that will generate growth and employment. The Presidency will seek to achieve progress in negotiations on the legislative framework for common policies in this programming period, such as the common agricultural and fisheries policies, cohesion policy and research and innovation policies. Energy policy, the Connecting Europe Facility and the trans-European networks on transport, telecommunications and energy are high on the agenda and will be vital in boosting the competitiveness and further integration of the European Union. Sustainable development will be an important issue during the Cypriot Presidency, based on the need for an integrated approach to transport, climate change, environmental and energy policies. Particular emphasis will be placed on re-energising the EU integrated maritime policy. A special summit will be held in Limassol, which Commission President José Manuel Barroso will attend, to decide on and approve an announcement.</p>
<p class="contents">Second priority: Europe, with a better performing and growth-based economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic crisis has highlighted the need for more effective Union policies. The Presidency will focus in particular on monitoring the implementation of the EU 2020 strategy. Furthermore, strengthening economic growth and promoting employment opportunities are of major importance to the Cypriot Presidency. Financial services are also an important item in our agenda, as they will help to protect consumers and investors and improve market transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">During the Presidency and on the occasion of the 20<span class="sup">th</span> anniversary of the single market, we shall also give impetus to the deepening of the internal market, in the aim of stimulating the European economy and making social progress and supporting the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises and consumers. Without doubt, the single market provides a stable basis for European integration. We need to improve the single market, especially in times of economic crisis, by focussing on the need to strengthen European competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Third priority: Europe, more relevant to its citizens, with solidarity and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most important priorities of the Cypriot Presidency is to increase the involvement of the social partners, local authorities and non-governmental organisations in implementing the EU 2020 strategy, especially in respect of targets for employment and combating poverty and social exclusion. We intend to utilise best practices at both national and European level in order to try and map the involvement of civil society in the European Semester process.</p>
<p class="contents">Social cohesion is an important aspect of the EU 2020 strategy and an essential objective of efforts to find an effective way out of the crisis, especially for sections of society at risk of poverty and social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of the Cypriot Presidency priority to improve social cohesion, we shall focus on carrying on work to combat child poverty and promote children’s well-being.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cypriot Presidency intends to use the European Year of Active Ageing to highlight the message that active ageing is not confined to employment; it includes participation by elderly persons in social, economic, cultural and political life.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as equality is concerned, the Cypriot Presidency will promote work to compile indicators on violence against women and will focus on victim support services. The Presidency will also encourage debate on the problem of the pay gap between the two sexes, by facilitating an exchange of best practices between the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the Presidency’s main objectives will be to create a common European asylum system by the end of 2012, by building up cooperation between Member States in protecting the rights of those in need of international protection.</p>
<p class="contents">In the education and culture sector, negotiations on the next generation ‘Erasmus for all’ programme will be high on the agenda, as will the promotion of literacy.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth priority: Europe in the world, closer to its neighbours. The Cypriot Presidency will work closely with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the European External Action Service. Within that framework and in light of the important political changes taking place on the south shores of the Mediterranean, we consider that particular attention should be paid to the southern dimension of the European Neighbourhood Policy, by enhancing relations between the Union and Mediterranean countries.</p>
<p class="contents">For me personally, it goes without saying that the Arab nations neighbouring us to the south, who have rebelled and are demanding democracy and the rule of law, must choose their own regimes, via a free and participatory procedure. It is a strategic mistake, in my opinion, for Europe to try and impose its democratic model on those nations. However, what Europe can and should do is to support the vision of the young people who express the Arab vision, in order to create a pluralistic society of which one fundamental element is respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Cypriot Presidency will promote the necessary processes relating to the enlargement procedure, which is indeed one of the most successful Union policies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to close my presentation with a very brief reference to ancient Greek philosophy, which is admittedly a very important pillar of our common European cultural heritage: in Plato’s Republic, Socrates, that important philosopher of ancient times, is asked: ‘What is the meaning of life?’, to which Socrates immediately answers: ‘To be a good Athenian’.</p>
<p class="contents">Plato then asks, ‘And what, Socrates, is a good Athenian?’</p>
<p class="contents">The answer was simple, but full of timeless meaning and purpose: ‘A good Athenian is a person who leaves Athens a better place than he found it’. Very simple, very proper and very beautiful.</p>
<p class="contents">The Athens of Socrates and Plato is, of course, our common achievement today, the European Union. We leaders of Europe have a duty to work tirelessly to make our Europe a better place for all European citizens, especially future generations. With innovations and innovative policies that centre on man and are predicated on reasonable demands, we can achieve sustainable economic growth and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">As you have heard from the priorities I just listed, the Cypriot Presidency has prepared what is admittedly an ambitious programme. However, we are aware that these are very difficult times and of the challenges we face at European level. As you well know, my country faces an additional challenge, due to the problem of the anachronistic partition caused by the continuing Turkish occupation of the northern part of the island. However, I should like to categorically assure you that we shall spare no effort and shall not allow any problems that the occupying force may try to create to derail us in our exercise of an entirely European Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, the Cypriot Presidency will do its very best, within its powers, to bring about a better Europe for the benefit of its citizens. In the six months to come, with the help and support of all of you, of the institutions, of civil society and, of course, of the Members of the European Parliament, we shall be able to make an important contribution towards attaining our common objective.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Manuel Barroso, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">− </span>Mr President, let me start by expressing to President Christofias and the Cyprus Government my and the Commission’s full support for this Council Presidency. We will work with you in the spirit of full loyalty and we wish you every possible success. This will be in the interest of your country, and in the interest of the EU as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Holding the Presidency of the Council is always a challenge, for bigger and smaller countries, for older and less old Member States. And it is only natural that this challenge is redoubled when it is for the first time, and taking place in the current economic context.</p>
<p class="contents">This being said, I have a lot of confidence in the readiness of Cyprus to take on this great responsibility. Not only was I reassured by President Christofias’s presentation today, by his statements regarding his commitment to the European project and the Community method, I can also tell you that the Cyprus authorities started preparations almost three years ago. In the intervening period the Cyprus authorities and the Commission at political and technical levels have enjoyed a close, fruitful cooperation. Tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow, the College of Commissioners will meet the Presidency team in Nicosia, where I will have the opportunity to express my appreciation for their very competent work of preparation.</p>
<p class="contents">Immediately after this moment of inauguration, we need to continue our work. I very much appreciate that the Cyprus Presidency correctly grasps the right challenges to tackle and the priorities to work on. The Commission shares the objectives of the Presidency aimed at a stronger, more competitive Europe, based on sustainable growth, solidarity and social inclusion, a Europe which is a major international partner on the global stage as well as in its neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="contents">These objectives call for actions, actions which are enshrined in the logic of the three-part approach which the Commission has championed for a long time and which we have to work on for the European Union as a whole – sound public finances, deep structural reforms and targeted investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Focusing on these areas and maximising their impact will go a long way towards a successful Cyprus Presidency of the Council. For a successful Presidency it will be very important to focus on those key legislative proposals where tangible results can be achieved by the end of 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, we have the multiannual financial framework, one of our primary instruments for value-adding investments at European level and for growth and jobs in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us do our utmost to reach agreement on the MFF by the end of this year. I know it is extremely challenging but it is possible. This would send a clear signal that, when it comes to growth, we are committed to action, not limited to rhetoric. Reaching a deal by the end of the year – not any deal, I mean a good or even a very good deal – would do a great service to the European Union as a whole and it would be a success for the Cyprus Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">In the coming days the Commission will present updated financial figures for our MFF proposal which will include the impact of the accession of Croatia in 2013 and will take account of the latest national and regional statistical data. Whilst these changes will be extremely marginal in overall amounts, they need to be done for the sake of accuracy and transparency and equal treatment. On this basis the Presidency will then be able to prepare serious discussions on figures as from the autumn too.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only reiterate what I said earlier. The figures which we proposed last year remain fully valid. They are balanced, appropriate and realistic. They clearly deploy a sense of realism under current circumstances whilst showing the right level of ambition. I therefore urge both Parliament and Member States to recognise that what we have proposed already provides a very good basis for compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework are a package. In parallel to the overall framework, negotiations must be brought to an end on the sectoral proposals on the main European common policies. These policies lie at the heart of our efforts to support growth and employment. For this reason we need in parallel to make substantial progress on the next generation of Structural Funds, the reform of the CAP, the common fisheries policy, Horizon 2020 for results and innovation, the Connecting Europe Facility and the relevant trans-European networks. Nor must we neglect our external financial instruments as an important element in our external policy.</p>
<p class="contents">With the overall MFF and almost 70 sectoral programmes we have a formidable list of work to accomplish. It will require a great effort on the part of the Council Presidency, an effort which we in the Commission will support to the full.</p>
<p class="contents">The multiannual financial framework is just one of our levers for growth and jobs. There are other critically important areas where we must speed up our efforts. I therefore welcome the fact that President Christofias shares my understanding that we must work closer together among all the institutions, including of course the European Parliament, in the coming months. This is the only way to achieve results, to results that are stable and binding and are not hostages to fortune after decisions are announced.</p>
<p class="contents">Continuing our work for growth also means pushing ahead in the coming months on the fast-track legislative proposals of the single market, what we have called Single Market Act 1. In addition, the Commission intends putting forward proposals under what we call the new Single Market Act 2, and we hope the Cyprus Presidency will start work on these without delay. Once again thank you for your very strong commitment regarding the need to deepen the single market, President Christofias.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said yesterday in front of this House, intensive work will continue towards ensuring stability of the euro area and establishing a genuine economic and monetary union. The Commission will thus swiftly put forward new proposals concerning the first steps to establish what we have been terming a ‘banking union’, namely to create a single financial supervisory mechanism in the euro area, built around the ECB, based on Article 127 of the Treaty. At the same time, we will strive to preserve the overall architecture of the EU 27, soon 28, in particular the architecture of the single market, so as to guarantee the integrity of our Union and naturally the full Treaty rights of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time there is much to be done to build on the proposals the Commission has already made on deposit guarantee schemes, bank recovery and resolution, stricter rules on credit rating agencies and on capital requirements, on markets in financial instruments and on market abuse. Thus the banking union is very much enriched. We can do it very soon if we fully stand behind it and work hard for it.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be a further effort needed to adopt the two-pack initiatives and to make headway on a financial transaction tax through enhanced cooperation. Although formally both files are separate, both are essential. We can only call for greater solidarity if in parallel we are prepared to accept greater responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I have only mentioned some of the most important areas on which we need to focus in the coming six months. Naturally, I know, the programme of the Presidency is much wider, but I think we should focus on what we can deliver in a relatively short period. I should also mention the Schengen and patent packages. I hope that on both we will eventually come to find better solutions than those which are on the table of the Council today.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe for a Council Presidency to have success it needs determination and focus. Six months pass extremely quickly. Yesterday at a meeting with President Christofias and President Schulz, I mentioned that this will be the 17th Council Presidency I have been following closely, and I can tell you the successful presidencies were the ones which were able to focus. Let us use this period in the most productive and effective way. The Commission will help you achieve as much as possible in this endeavour and I am sure the European Parliament will do so also.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Joseph Daul, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE Group.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, President Christofias, ladies and gentlemen, the Republic of Cyprus is taking over the Council presidency at a decisive moment for Europe. I said here, only yesterday in fact, that the European Council has held 30 meetings on the economic crisis and it is not over yet. Thirty meetings and only last week did we see the start of an action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am calling this morning on the new Presidency to show courage and determination. I hope that this Presidency will convince its 26 partners to opt for an integrated Europe, a political Europe and, at last, a united and therefore sovereign Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic crisis is both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge relates to the competitiveness of our economy and to unemployment, which is breaking records with an average rate of 11%. The opportunity is to do what the countries in the euro area should have done at the outset, in other words implement a common economic policy, a policy of balanced budgets and, above all, a long-term investment policy.</p>
<p class="contents">President Christofias, although you and I are from radically opposed political parties, my group supports the priorities of your Presidency. In particular, I heard you use an expression that is very important to me: the Community method. In that respect, I know that I can count on you.</p>
<p class="contents">Like you, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) wants the European Union to be more effective, more relevant and more efficient and to experience renewed growth. On that basis, we need to act. We need to take advantage of the 20th anniversary of the single market in the autumn to complete, at last, the work that began under Jacques Delors and implement the Single Market Act as quickly as possible. We need to apply the Services Directive in full. We need to create a genuine digital single market. We also need to reduce the burden on our small and medium-sized enterprises. All of these measures will create growth and will thus create jobs. These are the measures that I am asking you, Mr President, to take along with this Parliament and in close cooperation with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another key aspect of your Presidency: the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework. My group truly hopes that progress is made in this regard during the next six months, in the knowledge that the European budget is an investment budget, a growth budget and an employment budget. We need investment in all 27 Member States in infrastructure, investment in all 27 Member States in energy networks and in education, research and innovation, cohesion policies and food security; you spoke about food aid for the most deprived, I believe, and you also have my support in that regard. That is a credible and tangible response to the crisis, too.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cypriot Presidency will find in the European Parliament an active and committed participant when it comes to the financial perspective, as long as the proposed budget is large enough and tailored to our needs. We will be keeping an eye on that, but we will help you to reach the end of the year with a Christmas package for this budget for the multiannual financial framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, Mr President, President Christofias, ladies and gentlemen – do not laugh, Mr Barroso, the package will be good, you will see – I would like to talk about another issue before you here this morning and that is the worrying political situation that has prevailed for a number of days in one of our Member States, Romania. Yesterday the Vice-President of the European Commission, Viviane Reding, expressed grave concern. I quote: ‘I am seriously concerned about recent attacks on the independence of the Constitutional Court of Romania. For me, a well-functioning, independent judicial system is a precondition for mutual trust in the European area of justice’.</p>
<p class="contents">My group shares the Commission’s concerns and last week I, myself, expressed my concerns about the current state of democracy in Romania. This morning, I ask the Commission very sincerely to continue to monitor this issue as it has monitored others, in spite of the summer break.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for us to make progress over the next six months on various issues that are on the table and, President Christofias, we are counting on you. There are a lot of good things that you can do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would be happy if you were half as critical of Hungary as you are of Romania. However, as far as breaches of European law are concerned, we support European law and European values, regardless of the country in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to welcome you very warmly, together with your Minister for Europe who will definitely do a very good job, because he shows the right level of commitment. We cannot promise you that this will be an easy presidency. We can promise you our help in resolving the problems, but nevertheless this will not be an easy presidency. The economic crisis and the banking crisis will still be with us.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very grateful to Mr Barroso for making it clear that Parliament will be fully involved in the establishment of the new banking supervisory mechanism, which is something that we have been calling for over a long period. Of course, we need to have specific rules for the euro area. However, we must not forget, and Cyprus is one example of this, that even if a country is not in the euro area, and this is clear in Greece and Romania, massive damage can still be caused. The incidents at Barclays Bank show that there are still many bankers who are speculating with other people’s money and who believe that they can manipulate the market without it being noticed. This must stop. We need an efficient banking supervisory mechanism in Europe, together with greater transparency in all banks, and these things must be put in place over the next few months.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, Mr President, I would, of course, like to mention the financial transaction tax. We have recently adopted Ms Podimata’s report here in Parliament with a large majority. I know that people in your country are sceptical about this, but it is essential for us to introduce a financial transaction tax. Of course, it will not solve all our problems. However, Mr President, you have spoken about the fact that economic and social burdens must be distributed more fairly. The financial transaction tax will make a small but not insignificant contribution to the fairer distribution of the economic burdens and will help to ensure that the financial sector plays its part in overcoming the crisis. I believe that this is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to the budget. Mr Daul said that there would be a Christmas present. I hope he is right. I hope that it is a present and that we will not be celebrating Christmas with a poor compromise. There are supporters of better spending and supporters of cohesion. If the supporters of better spending think that what is needed is less spending and drastic budget cuts, then they will not have us on their side. This is what Mr Cameron believes and this is being put into practice with great success in the United Kingdom. It clearly has the approval of the population.</p>
<p class="contents">If the supporters of cohesion think that they simply need to spend more money and the job will be done, then they will not have us on their side. We in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, and I believe that is the majority in this House, want a budget which is effective, does the job, contributes to growth – that is essential – and, of course, promotes productivity and competitiveness. However, you cannot make cuts and, at the same time, say that we must do more for growth, while reducing funding, except for the funding that is actually needed. If Mr Cameron needs a major institution in his constituency or in the neighbouring constituency, he will, of course, want funding for it. However, when it comes to stimulating growth in the cohesion regions, where we really have work to do and where help is needed, regardless of whether they are in Poland, as the President mentioned in his speech, or in Lithuania or in other countries, then suddenly we want to make big cuts. That is where we have to say ‘No’, because this is inappropriate. We cannot say that we need more investment, more growth, more employment and then focus on reducing spending.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased that France is moving away from this simplistic method of making cuts. I am very pleased that Ms Merkel in Germany has recognised, following talks with the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), that the budget needs to be of a certain size in order to stimulate growth and development. Against this background, I am also hoping for a Christmas present, like Mr Daul, not for us, not for Parliament, the Council or the Commission, but for the people of Europe, who urgently need one.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cyprus Presidency brings us close to a region which is undergoing a major crisis and that is the Middle East. We will never come as close to it as we do in Cyprus. I know that the Cyprus Presidency has very good relationships with the countries of the Middle East and will make good use of them.</p>
<p class="contents">My last comment concerns Turkey. As a friend of Turkey, I very much regret Turkey’s behaviour towards the Cyprus Presidency. This is the presidency of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">When Turkey boycotts the Cyprus Presidency, then it is boycotting the European Union. We hold on to the vision of a shared Cyprus where Turkish and Greek Cypriots can live together in peace, because all of them are citizens of Europe. This vision will help us to move forwards.</p>

<p class="contents">Lead by example on economic growth: use the EU’s influence to help reunify Cyprus’s people – economists say it would add EUR 12 000 to the prosperity of every family on your island. Lead by example in Europe’s fight against crime – intervene against the intricate intrigue of corrupt Cypriot lawyers and property developers who rob holiday-home buyers of their retirement savings. Lead by example in other areas too, not by letting a fossil fuel find fool you into forgetting your island’s natural wealth of sun and wind. Not by being mortgaged to Moscow, nor by evading engagement with Ankara.</p>
<p class="contents">You will take forward the budget talks and the EU’s Road Map 2050: marry them together by investing in renewable energy EU-wide and cutting our dependence on Russian gas. You will oversee EU talks on bank supervision and sovereign debt: use the ECB and the EIB to nurse our weaker nations back to solvency.</p>
<p class="contents">You spoke of a better Europe for our children and our grandchildren. You must talk to Turkey, not overlook the plight of our fellow citizens behind the barbed wire. Along with my constituents in Gibraltar they face the fate of being forgotten people, failed by the designated guardians of the EU Treaties who are too timid to take on the tough talkers.</p>
<p class="contents">Forty years ago another Mediterranean islander, the songwriter/poet, Georges Moustaki, wrote of <span class="italic">‘les îles barbelés, les murs qui emprisonnent…en Méditerranée’</span> (the barbed-wire islands, the imprisoning walls… in the Mediterranean). We will not carp if you cannot bring peace or freedom to Syria and the countries of your sea’s southern shore, much as you should try, but you can rid your island of its barbed wire and its prison walls and restore what that poet called <span class="italic">‘un bel été, qui ne craint pas l’automne’</span> (a fair summer that has no fear of autumn).</p>

On the one hand, I visited the archaeological museum and was struck by the beauty of the island’s cultural heritage. On the other hand, I returned to reality and crossed the border in the old quarter of Nicosia at several of the crossing points and was really shocked by this confrontation and the form it takes in Cyprus today.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not as presumptuous as Mr Watson and I will not try to tell you what you should do in the next six months. However, I would like to repeat the wish expressed by many fellow Members in the meetings in Nicosia. The presidency will mean that the eyes of Europe are on Cyprus. We must all work together to help overcome this undignified confrontation which is actually a thing of the past. This is in the interest of all the people of Cyprus, both Greek and Turkish Cypriots.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I do, of course, know that the presidency is starting out in a very difficult position. The debate or dispute about the outcome of the summit is still going on and I do not remember a summit during this crisis whose results have had such a short half-life on the market as the most recent one. Interest rates are rising and the burden of interest payments for the crisis countries is higher than it was before the summit. We need to look closely at this.</p>
<p class="contents">You are taking over the presidency at a time when the representatives of the Council obviously forget as soon as they return to their own countries that the European Union can only function as a community of responsibility. Many Heads of State or Government and many people who are more like party politicians than Europeans when they are at home are evidently not really aware of this responsibility. I know that you are faced with the major challenge of bringing this back together.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the disagreements within the Council must be resolved by the time the troika presents its latest report on Greece, which is also an existential moment for Cyprus, for your country, in this crisis. I am very concerned about the influence of this new report and the decisions which will have to be made on the basis of what was decided on thin ice, so to speak, at the last summit. The European Parliament resolution that we will vote on today gives a good indication of what urgently needs to be done during the course of the summer.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one last point, Mr Christofias, because I understand that for you, both as a politician and as a person, fairness is a major concern. I believe that in Cyprus, although I am very familiar with the structural problems relating to the large banking and finance sector, work needs to be done in the areas of fair taxation, tax havens, tax evasion and tax avoidance. You will only be able to make good progress in your presidency if you deal with these areas, despite your own problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We greatly appreciated the constructive meetings that we had with him and his government. It is clear that we are not going to have much in common politically, but nevertheless we did appreciate his courtesy and his hospitality. We also agree with the implication in the Presidency’s priorities that the EU is not seen as relevant by many of its citizens, and that it needs to become more effective and more efficient. The position of my group is clear: we do not want to see the EU fail, but if it continues to pursue the agenda of the past then it most surely will.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say a word to President Barroso. I was particularly surprised by his outburst yesterday here in this Chamber. To suggest that somehow we take great delight in the problems facing the euro is, frankly, absurd. Do you honestly believe that we are pleased to see so many people suffer as a result of your political project? I have merely many times set out the options for the eurozone as I see them: either an effective fiscal union or a reduction in the size of the eurozone. At the moment you are trying to move towards a political union without the fiscal union that is really required, and I think that it is entirely reasonable that we should raise the alarm about what this will mean for national democracy in many Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether or not the euro survives, what is important for me is that those countries that had the good sense to stay out of it are not hampered by the decision of 17 to go ahead with more integration, if indeed that is what they choose to do. But of course, the one tool that must always remain the equal property of the 27 countries is the single market. It is the one thing that we all support, and I was therefore delighted see that the Cyprus Presidency has said that one of its ambitions is the deepening of that internal market. You will have our full support in that aim.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency will also conclude negotiations on the Capital Requirements Directive. Yesterday, as part of his criticisms, President Barroso pointed out – correctly – the UK’s significant bank bailout commitments made under our previous, Socialist, government. I agree with him that we should ensure that banks are sufficiently capitalised to present this from ever happening again. So why, then, is the Commission still trying to water down the commitments the EU made in Basel to implement the Capital Requirements Directive? Mr Barroso, my group, and indeed the UK Government, is in favour of more stringent bank regulation than your Commission. We want to make sure that taxpayers never again have to bail out the banks.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning very briefly to the multiannual financial framework, it still continues to baffle me how the Commission can enforce austerity on Member States and simultaneously demand more money from them for the EU budget. It seems that everyone has to cut spending, apart from the European Commission. The idea that throwing money at economic problems and hoping it will make them go away is surely a doctrine that was discredited in the 1970s. If the Presidency can truly deliver a budget that genuinely focuses on quality and added value, and on better spending rather than on more spending, you will indeed have our full support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are very pleased that for the first time in the history of the European Union a member of our political family is leading the EU. You are taking over the presidency at a time when the European Union is faced with huge challenges. We need to determine whether the European Union will actually have a future or whether it will turn out to be footnote in history, which I would regard as a historic defeat.</p>
<p class="contents">After the meetings which we had with you, with the representatives of your government and with the leaders of the groups and parties in your country, I know that you have made very thorough preparations for the presidency and that you are aware of the scope of the task. However, you have made it clear today that you specifically want to focus the attention of those in power on the living conditions of the people. I can tell you after everything I have heard in recent years that this is the first time that a President-in-Office of the European Union has said that he will do precisely that. I have not heard this sort of tone in official speeches before. I have not heard anyone say that this is all about the people, about the ones who are not responsible for the crisis, but have the heaviest burdens to bear.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be difficult to put this into practice. However, I believe that you will have achieved a great deal, and I am certain that you will do this, if you can use your presidency to give encouragement to the people, to support their rights and to help to ensure that the Council and the European institutions are aware of what you are doing.</p>
<p class="contents">We are constantly talking about the euro and its stability, about how important the euro is for the functioning of the European Union and for the euro area. However, it is an instrument. It is based on political conditions that have been clearly defined. It can never be the objective of the European Union to accept that people in the EU will go hungry, that health care systems will collapse or that local authorities will stop working in order for the euro to continue functioning. Something has gone wrong here. That is not what we see as the objective of the European Union. I very much support your call for social cohesion and solidarity between the individual Member States, but also between all the very different groups of people. The European Union cannot allow itself to be used as an instrument or a speaker for a particular small section of the population or present itself in that way.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one final point to emphasise, of course, that all of the priorities you have mentioned are very important to us and that we will support the points which take us in the direction you have just defined. Please help to ensure that people are no longer afraid. Fear is the worst guide for democracies. I think that many of the decisions made in recent weeks and months, in particular during the elections in Greece and the referendum in Ireland, were characterised by fear. If those in power in the European Union are contributing to the fact that people are afraid to make free decisions, this does not bode well for the future of the European Union. I wish you every success in what you have to do.</p>

The Cyprus Presidency has started in the midst of huge political changes in the European Union. Following the decisions adopted by the Council in June, the economic, banking and political unification of Europe will need to be promoted during the Cyprus Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">What you may not know, ladies and gentlemen, is that, although it is a small country, Cyprus is a race of rational, disciplined and courageous people. Having seen its neighbour Israel achieve energy independence by finding natural gas, Cyprus has entered into a bold and rational operational alliance with Israel, without disrupting its relations with the Arab world, with a view to making the island energy independent. This is a shining example for all of us, to see how the energy sector can be changed and used as a vehicle for peace and stability. As I stressed earlier, we should exploit the good relations which the Republic of Cyprus entertains with numerous countries in the third world, especially the Arab world.</p>

It was a delight to meet you when I came to Nicosia in 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">Can I pay tribute to your efforts to solve the Cyprus problem; a problem which is way overdue. The ongoing insult given to you by the Turkish Government of not recognising you as the President of Cyprus is something which should be highlighted in this Chamber. I would call on you and the EU to remove the candidate status of Turkey, because they have shown themselves not able to communicate with the European Community.</p>
<p class="contents">You talk about this as being a bastion of democracy. However, you were educated in Russia and you would have seen how the Duma was no more a bastion of democracy than this place is in relation to the Politburo, which is probably likened to the Commission led by Mr Barroso, who uses this place as a veil of democracy for its actions.</p>
<p class="contents">You are right to highlight that the problem of your Presidency is the plight of workers. In Athens you will find graffiti that says: let us refuse to live as slaves. Your background and your ideology as a Communist will make this very difficult for you. How are you going to protect the workers or stand up for the workers with the austerity that Angela Merkel and the rest of the European Union is pushing forward?</p>
<p class="contents">Surely you would agree with me that EU 2020 lacks 20/20 vision? I have no doubt it will be as successful as the Lisbon Strategy, which was meant to make the EU the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010.</p>

Mr President of the Republic of Cyprus, you have laid down the priorities for your Presidency: the multiannual financial framework, the common asylum system, agricultural policy, the single maritime policy, energy and so on. The planned summit between Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Member States of the Union and the Arab League bears witness to the massive interest in the ‘Arab Spring’ countries. Your Presidency will also certainly deal with the question of enlargement, including Turkey, which I am sure you will handle fairly and impartially.</p>
<p class="contents">We regret Turkey’s attitude to the Presidency. It does not respect the institutions. The Presidency is a Union institution and for six months it is not the country with which Turkey may have any bilateral differences. Traditionally each Presidency leaves aside its national problems and devotes itself to Union problems and you have stated that you will do precisely that, even if Turkey, with its threats against the exclusive economic zone, wants to divert attention from the Presidency objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Cyprus will need to prove, through its Presidency, that it is a serious and reliable partner. At the same time, however, its success will respond to statements made by Mr Erdogan and Mr Bayis that we barely add up to a State, that we are half a State, that we are barely even a race and that we are taking over the Presidency of a pitiful Europe. Their words, not mine.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the start of the Presidency coincides with the deadline for the recapitalisation of banks throughout Europe. This will take us into a support mechanism. However, the Cypriot economy was destroyed in 1974 by the Turkish invasion and the hard-working Cypriot people created a new economic miracle. They will do so again in coming years.</p>

May I say that the stand taken by Mr Christofias on the programme that Cyprus intends to implement during its six-month Presidency is a progressive stand which highlights the important problems facing the Union, especially the serious economic crisis, to which it is taking a progressive and democratic approach.</p>
<p class="contents">This means, in short, that it does not accept that a policy of strict austerity is the only way out of the economic crisis; it also talks of combatting unemployment, in order to use growth to create a new fabric within the Union, which does indeed bode well for economic recovery and an end to the recession.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it demonstrates respect for the Union principles of equality, democracy, solidarity and social cohesion, the very principles that have brought the President of the Republic of Cyprus here today as the President-in-Office of the entire European Union. Thus we are all fighting to establish a family of our own. We are all fighting for more Europe. That is the thrust of the policy expounded by the President of the Republic of Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">The President quite rightly did not mention the island’s specific problem, the Cyprus problem. However, it is a fact that dozens, if not hundreds, of visits by MEPs to the Republic of Cyprus see the reality today, see the divided capital, Nicosia, the only divided capital in the world. They see the strong presence of the Turkish occupying forces. The 45 000 strong Turkish occupying army there to ‘protect’ in inverted commas, a Turkish-Cypriot community of 100 000 people.</p>
<p class="contents">We more than anyone are fighting for the Turkish-Cypriot community, because we believe that it is through that community that we can resolve the Cyprus problem. By contrast, Turkey is not fighting for the Republic of Cyprus; it does not recognise, as we speak, the Presidency of the European Union itself. The only thing that concerns it to gradually colonise the island and change the demographic of the island. There are currently 700 000 colonists in the occupied areas. It would be a paradox and it is a paradox to have members of parliament and/or chairs of political groups, such as Mr Watson, approaching the Cyprus problem as if the Cypriots had caused it.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall close with an academic question: will Turkey’s path to accession remain unobstructed during the Cypriot Presidency?</p>

<p class="contents">Cyprus now has a huge responsibility, and the entire development of this lies in its hands. I have an enormous amount of faith in the ability of the Cyprus Presidency to succeed in this, but it will require us to step up our cooperation immediately. I am rapporteur for the Dublin II Regulation, and we are very close to an agreement, but I would ask that we continue our intensive cooperation negotiations now so that we can actually implement what we have promised our citizens.</p>

After almost four decades of negotiations, we are a hair’s breadth away from being able to offer Europe’s innovators and inventors a lower-cost EU patent that can be defended in a single court. There are just a few issues that remain to be resolved, and I believe that this will require imagination, resolve and flexibility from all parties.</p>
<p class="contents">If, during its Presidency, Cyprus now succeeds in putting in place cornerstones that are important for Europe, we will in future think of Cyprus as a small, but important, country that was very important for Europe during a critical and important period. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

President Christofias, I will address you as one of the 27, the 27 members of the European Council. When I listened to you and to Mr van Rompuy yesterday, and then when I looked at the day-to-day actions of the Council, I had the impression that we have a case of split personality here at best, and at worst, a case of duplicity.</p>
<p class="contents">For instance, when the Council says: ‘we want a budget union’, it then fights tooth and nail against a serious budget with own resources for its own Commission. When the Council says: ‘we want a fiscal union’, I then see the Council every day fighting tooth and nail against every form of tax harmonisation. The dogma of tax competition is still very much there, and at the same time the Council still pays lip service to the fight against tax havens.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week I witnessed the Council stubbornly refusing any serious restrictions on venture capital funds being domiciled or investing in tax havens – and that was last week. Probably the fact that a number of Member States are tax havens or harbour tax havens must have something to do with that. The situation is similar when the Council stresses the need for more democracy and democratic accountability. Look at Mr von Rompuy’s paper of last week, saying that we need to bridge the democratic gap in Europe. Yes, good – and you are all full of praise for Parliament. But when I see your actions, every single action tries to circumvent the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">When you set up a rescue fund, it is intergovernmental – Parliament has nothing to do with that. When we work on economic governance, you produce a fiscal compact that circumvents the European Parliament. When you want to set up a banking union, it is again done in a way that circumvents the powers of the European Parliament. So my question to you is: which face of the Council are we going to see in the next six months – Dr Jekyll or Mr Hyde? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We recently had the opportunity to visit Cyprus, and to meet with you and your Finance Minister, Foreign Minister and Interior Minister. We gained a very good impression from this, from their professional preparedness and their enthusiasm for the issue, and I would like to thank you additionally once again for the visit and for all of the care we received.</p>
<p class="contents">We certainly do not always agree. You spoke of political union, but we are very sceptical about political union, and we do not believe it is the answer. We believe it is a mistake, and I do not agree either with Mr Barroso or with the majority in this Parliament, who unfortunately still believe that it is the answer and that it would bring some good.</p>
<p class="contents">You also spoke about the principle of solidarity. Here we must take care that this principle is not perverted into a reshaping of the EU into a transfer Union, a redistributive Union, which would only make the one dependent on the other, thereby also exacerbating the tension between nations. I think this must also become apparent in preparing the multiannual financial framework, which is another task that you face.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, although you are, of course, well to the left politically, you are also a realist and a pragmatist, which was clear, for example, from your views on tax competition or on the problems of the financial sector. You can count on our support here - we do not need an ideological solution and we do not need any tax on international financial transactions. There is no need to eliminate tax competition in the EU - we need to preserve it so that the European economy remains functional. I would therefore like to wish you much success, and I hope that your Presidency will be crowned with success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, only if such a state is unanimously supported by the other 26 Member States and by every Member of the House can we prove that the Union sees itself as a league of neighbours of equality- and solidarity-based states and nations.

<p class="contents">In terms of legislation, the most important projects are the MFF and horizontal European policies. You have not inherited a wealthy legacy from the Danish Presidency. There is no idea about the total size of the budget. The European Council has discussed growth and jobs, but has not said anything definite about the budget, even though this is the main factor affecting exactly what we want: economic growth and jobs. On the other hand, the Danish Presidency was concerned about the important aspects of the horizontal policies which come under the codecision procedure. The Cypriot Presidency has a duty to return to the basic treaty and initiate the discussions with Parliament if we are to have any hope of a budget this year.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the Cypriot Presidency’s task to mediate in the dispute between Parliament and the Council over the Schengen regulation. The existing situation must not be tolerated. Member States which obviously have weak points in their external borders are refusing to follow a coordinated approach on evaluating Schengen, while also blocking access to the Schengen area for other Member States which have invested in and have an extremely high level of security at their external borders. You have the difficult task of resolving both disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not understand why Mr Swoboda is mentioning Hungary when Romania is being discussed. He is the leader of a democratic group in Parliament and should be very well aware of the significance of democratic values and how they need to be defended. In Romania and in Hungary, and in Austria.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, there is no political struggle going on in Romania. What has happened in recent weeks and will continue to happen is an attack on democracy. Non-compliance with the judgments of the Constitutional Court and the High Court of Cassation and Justice, changing the heads of institutions while flouting the regulations or in order to influence the justice system, and the attack on judges are actions which blatantly run counter to democracy. Please analyse the situation very clearly and take action in defence of European Union values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Financial stability is helpful and important, but by itself it is not an adequate answer for millions of European citizens who live in precarious conditions and might well see their situation worsen.</p>
<p class="contents">Growth, meanwhile, can only be achieved through robust, targeted investment in sectors that can generate work and jobs while also stimulating development. As such, while it will be important to give the Union a multiannual financial framework, it will also be especially important to find additional resources for it.</p>
<p class="contents">Forget your concerns over the Tobin tax or Eurobonds, Mr Christofias; in order to achieve the things you have suggested are your priorities for the semester, we need resources that are currently not there. We have all got to work together to find them. If we really want to make the changes you suggested to energy and transport networks, then the funding currently available will help get the process started but they are not enough to achieve it in the timescale the EU has set. Alongside growth, therefore, we also need to develop ideas on resources to boost the EU’s ordinary budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say one more thing: do not worry or think about what can objectively be achieved in six months. Of course, any final judgment will be based on what you have managed to get done, but it is also important – and is an act of generosity and political foresight – to get the ball rolling on processes that can be finished later on, thereby helping those that come after you. We need to really press on with institutional and political integration. I implore you to tackle this issue with the courage and daring that can sometimes come more easily to a small country than to a big one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our European community is in a state of flux. Our economic cooperation has been called into question, and nationalism and protectionism are growing strong. President Christofias, you have a lot of important matters to deal with by Christmas, in particular in the area of finance. The EU’s citizens must regain their trust in the banks and the financial sector in general, but we need a balanced view, Mr President. Your one-sided condemnation of the market economy is not something I share. Instead, you ought to direct your bulls of excommunication at irresponsible politicians around Europe – there may perhaps even be some here.</p>
<p class="contents">The key danger in the Europe that is currently in the process of being formed is that we will have an A team and a B team: those who have the common currency and those who do not have the euro. Europe was fragmented for decades by an iron curtain.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, let us not now create a divided Europe again. We know what this can lead to, as Mr Barroso reminded us yesterday. History has hopefully taught us something. President Christofias, in closing I would like to say that I think it is unfortunate that half of Cyprus is not represented here today. The EU wants to see a united Cyprus, and in this regard, Mr President, you have a great deal of responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At this time of crisis, it is important that the expectations of that crucial area for Europe’s future be heard. The crisis has hit the European side of the Mediterranean hard and all of us, in Cyprus, in Greece, in Italy, in Spain and in southern France, are linked by a community of destiny. We are also linked by a duty: to meet the expectations of all of the citizens of the countries surrounding the European Union who in spring 2011 expressed their hope for a better life and their desire for genuine democracy and fruitful relations with Europe through ties that, for as long as we can remember, have bound together all of the people of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday the European Parliament adopted by a majority of more than 90% a report that I presented, recommending the establishment of macro-regional strategies in the Mediterranean. This new form of European territorial cooperation has been proven in the Baltic region to improve the effectiveness of the EU’s various development policies. It is therefore important to provide a structure for it in the Mediterranean, too, from the start of the new 2014-2020 programming, so that it can be effective and operational.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time to send the suffering Mediterranean region a positive sign and to take responsibility for its future with pro-active initiatives. Along with more than 50 other MEPs who voted for the report yesterday, I hope that Cyprus takes advantage of its six-month Presidency to consolidate the first initiatives to establish the future macro-regional strategies in the Mediterranean. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The six months during which the Cyprus Government, in addition to its national duties, will coordinate the operation of several European institutions will therefore certainly be difficult for the Cypriot administration. The ambitious programme of the Cyprus Presidency, which President Christofias presented to us today, indicates that Cyprus has prepared for its new obligations towards the European Union in a responsible manner, and that it is determined to play its part in the consolidation of economic and social life in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the unique location of the country in a dynamically changing region of the Middle East and the Mediterranean could also prove to be a bonus for forthcoming European policy. I firmly believe that – with a good knowledge of the local situation and the appropriate sensitivity in communications with the surrounding countries – Cyprus, as the representative of the European Union, will contribute significantly to strengthening the position of Cyprus and of the whole EU in this area.</p>

<p class="contents">This deserves its turn at being emphasised here. Cyprus is the only Member State of the European Union whose territory is partially militarily occupied by a candidate State, namely Turkey. Turkey refuses even to recognise the Republic of Cyprus and to honour the obligations it is required to fulfil within the framework of the customs union with the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Ships and aircraft from Cyprus are still turned away at Turkish ports and airports, in spite of the provisions of the Ankara Protocol. This is a major scandal, not only on Turkey’s part, but also on the part of the European Union itself, which has always led its citizens to believe that it would shelve the negotiations on Turkey’s accession if it became apparent that Turkey was manifestly failing to live up to its obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">Really, what more has to happen before action is taken? The Turkish Prime Minister has already let it be known that he will not recognise the Cypriot Presidency of the EU, and that he will himself put the accession negotiations on ice. If the EU does not now take the initiative itself to put a stop to Turkey’s impudence, all that will do is prove that the EU, in its present form, no longer has any credibility at all, nor does it earn any respect among its citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

New Member States seem to be the ones from behind the Berlin Wall. You are part of the same group, but you are never treated as being new, and this offers an opportunity to create a kind of bridge between old members and the rest of Central and Eastern Europe.

Those who are friends of cohesion are at the same time friends of better spending. There is no contradiction here; this is just an artificial division that is best avoided. In fact we should all be friends of better spending.

Your Presidency, during this critical half of 2012, is crucial, mainly due to the important decisions which the Union needs to adopt in order to get out of the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to raise four points. Firstly, the economic crisis itself. You have repeatedly stressed the need for us to prove to the citizens of Europe that we can and want to get out of the crisis and to restore the hopes of thousands of young people who see a bleak future for themselves inside the Union. Growth and action to combat unemployment and create jobs are the points we all need to focus on and I am certain that you will do so with an acute sense of responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, relations with our neighbours. Your geostrategic position and close relations with the Arab world give you an important role, Mr President. With the unstable situation in Europe’s southern neighbourhood, the bloodshed in Syria and the tensions in the Middle East, you will need to act as an honest broker, a channel for communication and a better understanding of the needs of those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the new budgetary framework. No one in Europe today should disregard the need to bring negotiations on the new budgetary framework, that will determine the future of the European Union, to a successful conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, Schengen. You face a complication created in Schengen by the Danish Presidency and we all need to work to safeguard one of the greatest achievements and <span class="italic">acquis</span> in our history. Your role of mediator on the question of ‘where we are going’ will be crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, before wishing you every success, I too wish to take my turn in underlining the unacceptable stand taken by a candidate country, namely Turkey, towards the Cypriot Presidency in its statements and circulars about freezing relations between Turkey and this Presidency. Turkey needs to accept the reality of Europe and understand that, whether it likes it or not, it cannot bypass the Cypriot Presidency if it honestly wants to join the European family. The ball is in its court.</p>

You will need it. It will be no easy task. There is a group of countries that wants a smaller budget, there is a group of countries that wants more money, and each country has a right of veto, so there will indeed be a need for diplomatic abilities on the part of whoever is sitting at the head of the table.</p>
<p class="contents">The framework for the EU’s agricultural policy and the framework for aid for poor regions are to be established. Together these make up 80 % of the budget. The Commission has presented a reasonable proposal, which both restrains expenditure and enables us to focus in a more proactive way on joint research, investment in transport and energy networks and in education. In short, it is a budget that supports the common strategy for economic growth, improved competitiveness and reduced dependency on fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="contents">It is without doubt traditional for negotiations on the EU’s financial framework to end in a dog fight or an oriental bazaar with everyone fighting against everyone else, as everyone wants to come out the winner. But why does it have to be like that? Now, however, we need to stand together. Parliament, with its new powers, needs to endeavour to ensure that we have a dignified and open process and a good result for everyone, and I would like to thank the Cyprus Presidency for indicating that it will involve Parliament in accordance with the rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that wherever this has been neglected we have seen failures or disasters. This must be the common point of departure for the work of the Presidency of Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is important to state that, where we have had a market economy, we have seen an increase in prosperity all over the world and in Europe. You can certainly say one thing about the crisis economies in Europe: increased spending and deficits have not helped. If that had been the solution, we would have no problems. That is one thing. The other is that they are certainly not suffering from too much market economy – it is bureaucracy, regulations, monopolies and licences that are hindering growth. I think it is one of our most important tasks and duties to ensure that we can now achieve a fully-organised internal market opening up to entrepreneurship, investments and new jobs. That is the political course that can make Europe stronger again, and that must be the task for your Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that we need to push forward the reform of the internal market, which we have not achieved as we should have done. The European Union is the world’s biggest economy but still not the world’s biggest market. We need to proceed with the clarity and stability of banks, and with enlargement. That is the main task for this Presidency. I look forward to seeing the results.</p>

We are very much looking forward to the Cyprus Presidency. As leader of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament in the Committee on Budgets, I am, like Ms Jensen, primarily interested in the Presidency’s plans for the negotiations on the EU’s forthcoming long-term budget, the multiannual financial framework.</p>
<p class="contents">It is becoming increasingly evident that certain strong net contributors have formed a pact in order to reduce the EU budget in the future. Their ideas on economic policy appear to be based on austerity as the only way out of the crisis. They believe that wealthier Member States should not support poorer countries with problems via the EU budget, as it is believed that they are mismanaging their economies.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, there are also a number of Member States with a perspective that is closer to my own. They realise that the EU budget cannot be compared with national budgets that are dominated by public consumption, such as social transfers and the salaries of public sector workers, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU budget is a budget for solidarity and investments, a necessary strategic part of a common European road to <span class="italic">[...]</span> a strategically crucial role for linking Europe together and completing the single market in areas such as research, innovation and infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">My question to you, Mr President, is therefore: what is your strategy for getting these Member States, with such different perspectives, to agree on a proactive approach to the EU for the future and to thereby create a basis for an agreement with the European Parliament? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You took a big step, Mr Christofias, in asking the European Union not to export its model of democracy. I totally agree with you.

<p class="contents">Mr Christofias, these are the reasons why I think you are facing six months of serious and strange contradictions; as a Communist you will want to help workers, and to do so you will find yourself having to support banks, which have no doubt also had a negative impact in some phases of our crisis.

The same colleagues from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) supported then the measures taken by Berlusconi, Borissov and Orbán. I say that it is also your duty and you also have the tools you need to check and monitor that democracy is being respected in Europe.

We can expect tough debates, because we are still far from an agreement. We need only think of the budgetary plans for cohesion policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, let me be perfectly clear. A significant reduction of Cohesion Fund support is unacceptable. It is unacceptable because cohesion policy is one of the most important pillars of European cooperation. And the criteria based on which it was created are now more valid than ever before. We must not allow developmental disparities to undermine European cooperation. We must not support a solution where short-term considerations of accountancy overrule long-term solidarity. We must not support it because today, when the EU is going through one of the most serious crises of its history, it is vital to maintain solidarity between Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the current plans related to Cohesion Fund resources still contain serious imbalances, and it is therefore unacceptable that it is countries such as Hungary – which will probably not reach 75% of the EU development level even by the end of the next cycle – whose support is being cut significantly. At the same time there are other considerations that speak against the withdrawal of Cohesion Fund support. As mentioned countless times in this House, crisis management requires tools that do not cause an increase in debt but contribute to job creation. Cohesion policy meets both of these criteria. Managing to protect it would therefore represent the clear success of the Cyprus Presidency. I therefore ask the Prime Minister, but also the Commission and my fellow Members, to stand up for cohesion policy and stand up for the principle of solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You will need to be fully committed, Mr Christofias, when it comes to stimulating growth and creating jobs in the European Union. We are very interested in the specific solutions that you propose for combating youth unemployment You will have the support of Parliament if you take on this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations on the multiannual financial framework naturally have a high priority. You have rightly recognised, and I congratulate you on this, that the financing of the Trans-European Networks will bring significant added value to Europe. I would like to call on you to make a strong commitment to push through in the Council the approach to financing called for by the Commission. Your country will benefit from this, Mr Christofias. For example, the port of Limassol is part of the core transport network, as is Larnaka airport and the road project linking Limassol and Nicosia, which could receive European funding.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about Cyprus, we are, of course, also referring to an unresolved problem which has already been mentioned several times today. Mr Christofias, what sort of scenario should the European Union expect if there is no solution for Cyprus, which after 38 years of unsuccessful negotiations seems more likely than ever? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You come from a small country. I, too, come from a small country, and it is always a major challenge to provide leadership between the big beasts of the European Union, Chancellor Merkel, and Presidents Hollande and Schulz.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much agree with President Barroso that you should focus on the most important issues. Your period in office is very short and an extraordinary large number of things need to be done. I also note the absence of the word subsidiarity in Parliament today. There are many things that should be done in the Member States themselves, while the European Union should restrict itself to the main issues. Obviously, there is the management of the crisis, and we have discussed that. There is the deepening of the internal market, and we have discussed that. There is the multiannual financial framework, and we have discussed that. However, as you said in your introductory remarks, the cuts also affect Europe’s ordinary citizens, and that means this House has a major responsibility to act carefully in respect of major increases in the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">My fellow Members from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe said it already, but you hope to bring a positive conclusion to the asylum policy over the next six months.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I also ask for consideration for Parliament’s position. We have, of course, had a couple of serious clashes with the Council in relation to Schengen and the European patent, and I hope that you, as President-in-Office of the Council, will respect and even extend the position of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, much has already been said this morning about Turkey. The situation is complex, including in connection with the relationship between Cyprus and Turkey.

We can assure you that the European Socialists will back all your efforts to achieve these goals. I also thank you for your support for membership of the Schengen area for Bulgaria and Romania, something which is very important to us.</p>
<p class="contents">I see a certain symbolism in the Cyprus Presidency. At the centre of EU policy will be a country which in geographical terms is possibly the furthest away, at the periphery of the European Union. A second issue is that one of the smallest Member States will lead the Union of 500 million. I think this shows the unique nature of our Union, and it should be used in the next six months to show our citizens what we achieved with one of the last enlargements of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I think there is another issue. Your proximity to the southern Mediterranean will once again underline the need for support for the countries in that region – support for the development of their democracies, their economies and their social development, which is key to the success of our approach towards them.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one more issue. A divided country should unite the EU Member States behind the multiannual budget, which has to pave the way to the future: no small ambition. Finally, Mr Christofias, let us do our best to achieve a successful enlargement in the next multiannual framework, and I hope constructive negotiations will be held on the instrument for pre-accession. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Cyprus Presidency presented its fourth priority, entitled <span class="italic">Europe in the world, closer to its neighbours</span>. It will thus focus on the countries of the southern partnership and strive to strengthen relations with partners in the Mediterranean area. This focus logically follows the geographic location of Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to call on the Cyprus Presidency also to build on the results of the Danish Presidency in the EU enlargement process and to ensure continuity in this area. It is important that the countries of the Western Balkans make smooth progress in the further stages of the accession process.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, Cyprus should also focus on issues related to the reform processes, in particular the fight against corruption and organised crime. The Western Balkan countries still have many shortcomings in these areas, and their elimination would also help to ensure a better Europe, which is another of the priorities of the Cyprus Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to mention, because we do not always realise it, that the reform processes in the Western Balkans have a direct impact on the security of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth noting that the opening of accession negotiations with Montenegro, the granting of candidate status to Serbia, Commissioner Füle’s negotiations in Brussels with the political leaders of Bosnia-Herzegovina and, not least, the rapid progress made by Iceland in the accession negotiations are all good foundations on which to continue building and moving forward in the enlargement process. It will therefore certainly be worthwhile for the Cyprus Presidency to invest in this process, because its suspension could have negative, irreversible consequences.</p>

However, it withstood subjugation and acquired independence in 1960. In 2004, it became a member of the biggest European family on its own merits and, in 2008, it joined the euro area. Today, Cyprus has the Presidency of the Council. Although small in size and divided by the Turkish invaders, Cyprus is ready and prepared for anything that may happen on the European stage. It is ready to address numerous adversities, the economic crisis, the debt crisis and the crisis in values. We have no doubt that Cyprus will succeed in doing so, because it has fighting-fit human resources, because it works hard and because it has a vision of a Europe of nations and values, a Europe of growth, employment and solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Cyprus is more than ready to promote the European agenda unpretentiously, decisively and honestly. We also expect more solidarity from the European Union in Cyprus. We expect it to recognise the geostrategic role of Cyprus in the Eastern Mediterranean. We expect it to exert greater pressure on occupying Turkey to end the occupation and its appropriation of property and illegal colonisation. If Turkey does not do so, then its accession prospects should end. We Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots are entitled to live in a unified homeland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Cyprus may be divided, but it is not half a state, as Mr Bayis would have us believe; even though it is divided, the barbed wire on the island was put up by the colonising force, Great Britain, which, unfortunately, maintains a presence on our island in the form of the anachronistic British military bases. Most of the hardships which Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots are currently suffering are the responsibility of the Turkish occupying army, which has followed up its colonisation by keeping the island divided.</p>
<p class="contents">May I express my gratitude to Mr Schulz for raising the matter of the provocative Turkish stand and of the insults and abuse directed at the Republic of Cyprus from Ankara in a decisive, consistent and fair manner, for reminding Turkey of its responsibilities, not only in terms of its attitude towards the Cypriot Presidency, but also towards Cyprus as a whole, towards the Republic of Cyprus, over the years.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I too would remind the European Parliament of its responsibilities; we too must adopt a decision to immediately suspend accession talks with Turkey if it fails to comply.</p>

<p class="contents">At the start of this historic Presidency it is good to remember President Barroso’s words: we can only succeed together; not blaming each other but concnetrating on our common tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the first tasks of the Cyprus Presidency should be rebuilding the trust between the European Parliament and the Council. Just recently Parliament has been excluded from the decision-making on Schengen. Last week the Council sought to unilaterally change vital aspects of the European patents system. How can we credibly speak about the need for ‘more Europe’ if one of the institutions seeks to rock the institutional balance?</p>
<p class="contents">Your second task is to complete the European single market. It will become 20 years old soon; old enough not to need any more custodians and limitations by nation-state godfathers and godmothers.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Cyprus Presidency not just to continue with the deepening of the single market but to come forward with a concrete programme for completing the single market with a binding calendar to remove all the remaining obstacles.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also not only promote the digital single market but use it as a key to unlock Europe’s growth and employment potential.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly I would remind us all that it is an abnormal situation to have troops of a candidate country on the territory of a Presidency country. Our common task and common responsibility must be to end this situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Smaller countries are often more honest brokers in this European business than large ones and are also more favourably disposed towards Parliament. In this regard, I would like to add that the first talks with Mr Mavroyiannis and his staff in relation to the multiannual financial framework were very promising. I expressly welcome the document issued by the Cyprus Presidency on Monday, which refers precisely to this close cooperation with Parliament in the development of a financial framework – also with strict respect for Parliament’s privileges as granted in the Treaty of Lisbon. We very much welcome this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to add that the report by the special committee still constitutes the basis for us in this debate. We need appropriate funding in conjunction with better use of the funding and efficiency as set out in the Europe 2020 strategy. We need own resources that are worthy of the name so that we can at last meet the requirements of the Treaty of Lisbon in this regard. We insist on the unity of the budget, and we are prepared to enter into truly intensive negotiations before we obtain a proposal for a multiannual financial framework, as we want a result that we can agree on; we do not want something put on the table that we might have to say ‘no’ to at the end of the year. For that reason, I am counting on close cooperation based on trust. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am rapporteur for the revision of the Maternity Leave Directive, which the European Parliament adopted in October 2010. To date, despite the flexibility demonstrated by Parliament, the Council has not responded to our proposals or expressed interest in even opening an informal dialogue so as to reach a balanced solution that benefits European families.</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis has been serving as an excuse for those who consider maternity an issue of lesser importance and do not want to reach decisions. There is money for the banks, but there is no money for people. However, the demographic crisis is as serious as the financial crisis. Europe has an old population, which jeopardises social security systems and also economic growth itself. We hope the Cypriot Presidency will be able to break the deadlock on this issue and lead the Council to respond to Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Council now agrees and has released EUR 55 billion from the Structural Funds that can be reallocated and has included these funds in what is called the ‘growth package’. However, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, there are no Structural Funds and there is not going to be a growth fund without sufficient payment appropriations, and currently there are not enough payment appropriations in the EU budget in order to move forward with this reallocation of resources from the Structural Funds. This is because, in November 2011, we failed in the budgetary conciliation process between the Council and Parliament in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">For the 2013 budget, things are even worse, given that the Commission is asking for a 6.8% increase and you are offering 2.9%.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we think that small is beautiful, but we would like to know how you hope, under your Presidency, to reconcile two subjects that are so disparate as the request from the Commission and Parliament and the resistance of the Member States to increasing payment appropriations.</p>

<p class="contents">Your primate was even prevented from celebrating Christmas in the occupied area, because he is Christian, and more than 500 religious buildings have been destroyed and left to ruin. I hope the semester of the Cypriot Presidency will lead the European Union to take some strong stances against the invaders and finally act in the interests of its citizens and not of a few economic powers with commercial ties to Turkey. Mr Christofias, I wholeheartedly hope that you can succeed in doing something for your land and your people, who deserve once again to be masters in their own house. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is needed to achieve this is appropriate funding for policies that will stimulate economic growth and competitiveness, particularly cohesion policy and policies to encourage research and innovation. As a representative of a coastal region, it is very encouraging to hear of the Presidency’s ambitious plans to develop an integrated maritime policy.

Every EU citizen is hoping for a better Europe. However, citizens are concerned about the severe financial crisis, whose worse stages, according to the President of the Council, should be behind us. Unfortunately the reality seems to dispute this and I am afraid that, as in the case of previous presidencies, most of the priorities put forward by Cyprus will be overshadowed by the need to save countries that are going bankrupt. We want to believe the assurances of the spokesman for the Cyprus Presidency that the problems of Cypriot banks will not influence the presidency. This turbulence could, however, make it more difficult to reach agreement on the EU’s multiannual budget for 2014-2020.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the Cypriot authorities were right to weave their national priority of development of a maritime policy and safety at sea into the agenda. We understand this clearly, since there are now 27 countries floating on the EU raft; these countries are united by a common destiny and, if the raft should overturn, everyone will get wet and some will drown. For this reason, we all have an interest in the stability of the Cypriot Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">From this debate it was quite clear that the top priorities will be multiannual financial framework (MFF) negotiations, work on anti-crisis measures, including measures for boosting growth and jobs, deepening of the economic and monetary union, advancing the work on a banking union and, of course, harvesting the potential of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to make a couple of remarks on the top priorities. With regard to the discussion on the multiannual financial framework, I think that, after listening to this debate, we have to remind everybody that this is not a budget for Brussels or Strasbourg, but one which brings clear European added value to European citizens, regions and European communities.</p>
<p class="contents">The smart spending principle is clearly reflected in the fact that more than 94% of the MFF and of each annual EU budget goes back to the Member States, regions and EU citizens with clear added value from the European Union. This is not always achievable in the national budgeting processes. So we can see that it is the best investment tool the EU has in order to boost smart growth and sustainable jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards smart spending, we cannot pass budgets which do not allow the European Union and the Commission to meet their legal obligation and to pay for successfully completed cohesion projects, especially during the current harsh economic crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the importance of the EU 27 – very soon the EU 28 – approach, we cannot advance proposals which would favour decisions or policies at the expense of cohesion, which is so important for all new – and many old – Member States going through economic difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the current crisis has clearly shown that we need more Europe, we need deeper economic and monetary union and we need to charter the way towards political union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission wants to proceed first with the banking union because it is the most pressing, it is achievable in a short period of time and we do not require a treaty change. It is also crucial for restoring confidence in the euro and the EU economy. We need this despite the fact that the EU has done the most in comparison with other G20 members as regards capital requirements for the banks – which have been discussed so much today – and the new banking regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the single market, we have a lot to do. Removing the barriers will bring thousands of jobs and billions of euros to our GDP. We need to act fast and with determination.</p>
<p class="contents">We have high hopes that the Cyprus Presidency will achieve agreement by the end of this year on proposals concerning public procurement, professional qualifications and the other growth-enhancing measures that were identified in the annual growth survey for this year.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight that in your overall approach, as regards the MFF negotiations, the single market legislative work and the deepening of the EMU, it will be the Community method and respect for the communitarian principle which will guide the way for your Presidency. This is really appreciated from our side. After listening to honourable Members Mr Mitchell and Mr Callanan, this is how we can clearly demonstrate that we want to succeed and succeed together.</p>
<p class="contents">Many speakers have already shown their appreciation of your thorough preparation for the Presidency and your declared determination to succeed. The Commission will do its utmost to help you to achieve your goals because this would be the best news for European citizens. Therefore I would like to wish you lots of luck and success with your Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Please be assured that, for us, this is very important and encouraging, because we represent a small country which aims to serve the Union impartially, without any national interest, without wanting to promote its interests, for the simple reason that it is a small country and a new member of the Union and, as various speakers said, the Cypriots are decent and humane and want to honour both their country and the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Serious problems exist. I noted, of course, some complaints. That is no coincidence. The complaints stem from the serious problems we face, primarily the economic and social problems, as a Union and as individual countries.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we address them? We need to take a unified approach. The Union institutions need to cooperate very closely. What I said in my introduction were not figures of speech. Without agreement and daily contact between the institutions, we shall achieve nothing whatsoever. We shall continue to hold debates and apportion blame; some will blame the Council, some will blame the Commission, some will say that the European Parliament is not being straight and, as I am sure realise, we shall have zero results.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is a Union of compromises, whether we like it or not, because we represent different countries, sometimes with different interests. We, as an honest and objective mediator, will try to intervene in order to reconcile positions, views and policies. We shall try something new: to ‘marry’ budgetary discipline with growth and social cohesion. I would like to believe that this is something new. Let us try, because the methods we have tried so far have taken us deeper into recession. That does the Union no honour.</p>
<p class="contents">The people expect a lot from the European Union. When we unanimously decided that our country should join the European Union, the Cypriot people celebrated and breathed a sigh of relief at the thought of joining this large family. They saw a better future ahead. At present, no one, neither the man in the street nor nations as a whole, sees a better future ahead and this should concern us.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not advocate communist policies. I make a point of that, because various things have been said, such as ‘the communist president’ and so forth. I am who I am and I am very proud of what I am. I lead a party that has served the Cypriot nation and democracy for 90 years, a party that took part <span class="italic">en masse</span> in the war against fascism and numbered many victims, that defended democracy following the coup d’état and used peaceful means to obtain independence from its colonial rulers. My party is at the vanguard here. That is why, regardless of what happened in the Soviet Union or in any other country, I can talk about the Progressive Party for the Working People (AKEL), I can talk about Cyprus and about myself as fighters for democracy. I think that the five years during which we have governed the country are proof positive of that.</p>
<p class="contents">Have Mr Kasoulides or Mr Mavronikolas or Ms Theocharous ever felt that the democratic rights of the Cypriot people were being cut or abused during my presidency? Did my friends feel, during the seven years that Christofias presided over the House of Representatives, that their rights were being cut and did they see any abuse of their rights on the benches? On the contrary, democracy is alive and well in Cyprus and we are all proud of that.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, please do not worry that the communist will harm Europe. The communist will strive for a better Europe, with more social justice. This is my manifesto and I shall fight for it within the framework of the institutions of the European Union. I shall not be leading a revolution, do not fear.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Cyprus and the Cyprus problem are concerned, may I say to Mr Watson, with whom we have discussed the Cyprus problem for years, because I am a member of the Turkish-Cypriot contact group, that he should not be coming to me with calls to talk to Turkey. You should be calling on Turkey, Mr Watson, and telling them to ‘talk to Christofias’, because they refuse to talk to Christofias. Here too, Turkey is to blame for reasons of principle.</p>
<p class="contents">I have said to Mr Erdogan: ‘Prime Minister, please agree to talks, because I have a vision that I want to explain to you that concerns both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots and which, at the end of the day, is also in Turkey’s interests’. I do not entertain any feelings of hostility towards the Turkish people. On the contrary, I am ready to fight side by side with the Turkish man in the street fighting for his democratic rights even now, in a Turkey of change and modernisation, because there are serious problems of abuse of the human rights of Turks, Kurds and various other communities in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey is an occupying force and I wish to emphasise that. As a body and for reasons of principle, the European Union should, in my opinion, condemn any action by Turkey which undermines the role of the Republic of Cyprus as a state, not simply as a Member State of the Union, but also as a member of all the international organisations, starting with the United Nations. We cannot allow Turkey to act in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">I am fully prepared. My five years in the president’s office have been years of continuous, unremitting, tireless effort to instigate dialogue and resolve the Cyprus problem. At the end of the day, when I decided to fight my friend Giannakis for the president’s office, I made a clear statement that the first or even the sole reason I was seeking election as president of the Republic of Cyprus was to work hard, on the basis of my good relations with numerous Turkish Cypriots and Turkish-Cypriot political parties, to work hard and tirelessly to unify my homeland.</p>
<p class="contents">I am absolutely in favour of peaceful coexistence and brotherly cooperation between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. Cyprus belongs to the Cypriots, be they Greek Cypriots or Turkish Cypriots or Maronites or Armenians or Roman Catholics. You see, we are a multicultural country and because I am also a little internationalist – as communists tend to be – I want us all to work together for the good of our country, as the bosses of our homeland. The British have no place in Cyprus, the Turks have no place in Cyprus and our brothers the Greeks, in the bad sense, have no place in Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to be left free and you can be sure that then we shall have privileged relations both with Turkey and with Britain and, of course, with Greece. Privileged and very close and very good relations.</p>
<p class="contents">That is my promise to the Cypriot people, which I confirm before the European Parliament, this wonderful chamber of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I have given my very best. There has been no response from Turkey, because Turkey has expansionist policies towards Cyprus and expansionist plans. I am sorry to have to say so, but those are the facts.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall persist until the end of my term of office. I know that, once my term of office ends, I shall not seek re-election as president of the Republic; however, until my term of office ends, up to the very last moment, I shall continue to fight tirelessly to restore my homeland and, of course, for a Union which is a Union for its citizens, for the nations of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a hot potato in our hands: the multiannual financial framework. We shall do our very best to find compromise solutions, but we shall insist on growth and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Freedom of the markets is one thing; unaccountability of the markets is another. I am opposed to the unaccountability of the markets and I say so frankly. The governments elected by the people to govern them need to intervene. We cannot be governed by the markets. The governments democratically elected by the people must govern.</p>
<p class="contents">I give my word that all the matters raised have been noted. Of course, I do not want to comment on everything; very important suggestions and proposals have been made and will be taken into serious consideration; in cooperation with President Schulz, with the European Parliament and with President Barroso, we shall try to find solutions which will best serve a collective approach to the Union’s problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you so much for listening and thank you so much, once again, for your opinions and comments, which will be taken into serious consideration.</p>

A Member State facing bankruptcy, the largest tax haven, which steals from other Member States by inviting to its shores businesses who pay virtually no tax after arriving in this island state. I simply cannot understand how it is possible that 47 countries have concluded agreements prohibiting double taxation with Cyprus. I would be interested to know how many European firms have moved to Cyprus in order to avoid paying anything to state treasuries. This paragon of iniquity is now trying to get money from the other Member States in order to plug the holes in the ‘Turkish style’ Cypriot banks. I would not give them one euro until Cyprus stops acting like an immoral tax haven. Few people know, perhaps, that tax havens do not exist only in the Antilles.

Poverty is becoming a more pressing issue in the EU and most countries, extreme poverty and deprivation are concentrated in marginalized communities, such as the Roma, and children represent a large share of these populations, who are particularly vulnerable to deprivation. Targeted and complex policy measures are needed to safeguard the institution of family in Europe, to address the socio-demographic changes affecting family structures, to combat child poverty, and to change the employment patterns. Eliminating child poverty however, is inseparable from the efforts to improve the situation of the families and we need immediate action to stop families falling behind, and rebuild our social and territorial cohesion, because it would be an unforgivable sin to loose further generations. It must be ensured that consolidation measures will not have further negative impacts on people at risk of social exclusion. Marginalized communities demand a special focus, since they constitute a huge reserve of idle workforce and are disproportionately overrepresented among those living in poverty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is doubly difficult – both for the EU and also for Cyprus. Nicosia recently requested financial assistance to save the banking system in Cyprus. It is yet another euro area country in economic difficulties. Despite the fact that a mechanism was created at the last European Council summit to stabilise the currency union, the threat of bankruptcy in yet more countries is still very real. This is particularly significant, as Cypriot politicians now have the role of mediators in negotiations concerning future multiannual financial frameworks. Even though Nicosia has joined the so-called friends of cohesion group, there may be some concern whether, due to the aid given, it will not be more susceptible to the arguments of net contributor countries. For this reason, I would like to call on Cypriot politicians to play a truly neutral mediation role despite their own internal problems. The future of the European Union will depend on the nature of the 2014-2020 budget. If we allow national interests to dominate our thinking in the European Union, then we will not survive this crisis. It is only by acting together and by investing common funds wisely that we will be able to maintain our present position in the global economy. This responsibility now rests in the hands of politicians from a small Mediterranean island and for this reason we should all wish them luck. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Cyprus Presidency promises to be a difficult and challenging one. It will encounter challenges, not least in connection with the recession and financial crisis that are shaking Europe. Cyprus has demonstrated ambition in setting itself the goal during its Presidency of returning the EU economy to a path of growth and making the work of the European Union more effective for the benefit of its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the Cyprus Presidency will probably hit a sandbank right at the start of its journey. As a country that requires economic support, Cyprus is in an awkward situation when the debate turns to the subjects of the direction Europe that should take and support for the countries in crisis. It must be legally disqualified, though at the same time, it must represent the interests of its own country.</p>
<p class="contents">During the Cyprus Presidency, the EU countries must learn to strike a balance between public sector belt-tightening and the requirements for growth. The European Union is at a historic crossroads, where it will either find cooperation and promote it, or break up and fail. At the same time, we must not forget the general public, who must have the ultimate say in what direction Europe takes. They must be kept informed, openly and honestly.</p>

It fits perfectly into the EU agenda and creates a foundation for the European Year of Citizens 2013. The European Union’s continued development depends on its acceptance by its citizens. The European Union is a union of Europe’s citizens, a fact that, unfortunately, is sometimes forgotten. In this context the implementation of that part of the Europe 2020 strategy that relates to social issues and dealing with social challenges will be of key importance for achieving socially-inclusive development. In this context, the preparation and implementation of measures relating to youth employment as well as measures that have a direct impact on the everyday life of citizens is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">Over half of all EU citizens are women. Equality of the sexes is one of the basic principles of the European Union. Unfortunately, progress in achieving gender equality has been exceptionally slow. There are still significant differences between the incomes and employment opportunities of men and women. On the labour market, women are second-class citizens. Women are more affected by poverty. I hope that the Cypriot Presidency will focus on these problems. One of the priorities of the Polish, Danish and Cypriot presidencies is violence against women. I hope that the Cyprus Presidency will make up for the lack of attention this has received so far and will help to draw up an EU-wide strategy for combating violence against women, as well as supporting the European Parliament in its efforts to make 2015 the European Year of Combating Violence Against Women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs rejected the Commission proposal to finance the cross-border partnerships through the European Social Fund (ESF) from 2014 onwards. If the financing of these partnerships were only to be possible within the framework of the ESF, each participating Member State would have to include this in its operational programme for the ESF. In view of the many priority areas for subsidies that is unlikely to happen. Cross-border partnerships for mobility-related advice must also be financed via the EURES axis. This call is supported across the groups and across the Member States, and I am hoping for the support of the Council. It is a question of facilitating mobility and of providing the associated advice. With a broad consensus and the support of all of the groups, we have introduced a fourth axis for a Youth Initiative. This is about financing specific projects for combating youth unemployment. The Youth Initiative will only be integrated into the programme if additional financing is secured via the multiannual financial framework. The Commission and the Council are always saying that something has to be done to combat youth unemployment, but there is a lack of projects. If combating youth unemployment really is a priority for the Council then this is the opportunity to prove it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This means, as Cyprus President Demetris Chistofias explained, moving to a European Union that will be more important for its citizens and for the world. We have to be aware that this will be a difficult period for this small country, in view of the challenges it faces.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important priorities for this presidency include the multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020, the cohesion policy, the common agricultural policy, economic management in this time of crisis, a common European asylum system, the single market and the EU enlargement package. There will no doubt be numerous disputes during the current presidency between, for example, net contributors and recipients or concerning the cohesion direction of EU expenditure. Finalising an agreement on the EU budget for the next seven years would certainly be a success for the Cypriot Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">While on this subject, we cannot forget about the difficult relations between Cyprus and Turkey, which is applying for European Union membership. Relations between these two countries have been very difficult since Turkey took over the northern part of Cyprus by force and oversaw the declaration of independence of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. I wish Cyprus all success and would like to repeat the words of Donald Tusk, the Prime Minister of Poland, who has said that Cyprus can count on assistance from Poland and from the Polish experts who coordinated the Polish Presidency in the second half of 2011. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
