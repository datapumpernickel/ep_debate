<p class="contents">In order to keep a balance between these requirements, Directive No 46 of 1995 lays down a series of rules to be transposed by the Member States – which have indeed been transposed into national legislation – and provides for the establishment of an independent authority to ensure that these rules are observed in accordance with the principle of the voluntary disclosure of information: the data subject must therefore have the option to choose whether to consent to data processing and to have control over who processes the data and for what purpose. In addition to recourse to the guarantor authority, the right is also laid down for the data subject to have recourse to the law in the event of breach of the rights guaranteed to him by law. </p>
<p class="contents">In order to transfer data to third countries, it must be established whether the countries guarantee an adequate level of protection. Where this protection is not guaranteed, data can still be transferred under the appropriate contractual conditions: standard contractual clauses are currently being developed by the Council of Europe and other bodies in order to facilitate the drawing up of contracts with countries which do not guarantee legal protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission will ascertain that the third country provides adequate data protection and oblige the Member States to adopt standardised procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, problems do not arise where the laws of the third country guarantee data protection. Switzerland and Hungary do currently guarantee data protection, and therefore the European Parliament has no reason to intervene since it has nothing to propose.</p>
<p class="contents">The case of the United States of America, where there is no general data protection legislation in the private sector, is different. Therefore, an attempt was made during the complex negotiations between the Commission and the United States Department of Commerce to find a solution which would allow the transfer of data to those private companies which voluntarily submit to a self-regulation system known as the ‘safe harbour’ system.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently, on 6 June, the European Commission sent us the instruments it had drawn up on the basis of the conclusions reached and which it considers constitute adequate protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee of representatives of the Member States expressed a positive opinion, but the committee of Member States’ guarantor authorities criticised the instruments. Some of the concerns expressed by the committee of guarantors may be considered to have been dealt with by the subsequent clarifications supplied by the Commission regarding, for example, the scope of the system.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, certain questions remain unresolved, in particular the fundamental matter of enforcement: the guarantee that the companies which use safe harbours will fulfil their undertakings. In fact, since there will be neither law nor contract, individuals do not have rights which can be invoked in Court. Means of controlling the safe harbour system do exist, with the possibility of the imposition of penalties, but these only come into play in the event of unfair or fraudulent practices. It is at the discretion of the Federal Trade Commission whether it takes them into consideration. The company responsible for processing the data also has the option of recourse to a private dispute resolution body of its choice, but this right is not available to the person whose rights may have been violated.</p>
<p class="contents">The safe harbour system can only be considered to afford an adequate level of protection under article 25 of the directive if genuine protection is guaranteed for European citizens whose rights have been violated, that is if there is the possibility of getting the unlawfully processed data erased and of obtaining compensation for damages by means of recourse to a judge or arbitrator or any independent third party who has been assigned the task of guaranteeing that reparation is made for any harm suffered.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution also calls for the transfer of data to be authorised only when the system is fully operative and for operation of the system to be adequately monitored. By this we are not asking the United States to change its system, even though there have been many calls in the United States from authoritative sources for legislation to be adopted governing the matter. Our only concern is for the European citizens to be adequately protected, as the European consumer associations request and as American consumers would also wish to be.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the essence of the resolution submitted for your examination. I call upon you to adopt it in order to ensure that an international model is not introduced which provides fewer guarantees in this sensitive issue and which other States might insist is enforced, but, above all, in order to give the European Parliament the opportunity to demonstrate that it is an assiduous defender of citizens’ rights, rights secured by Community law.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Clearly, what you are proposing is not a “yes, but”, as you have been arguing, but rather a “no, unless” and Parliament should be aware of this. It is a “no, unless”, as you have pointed out correctly, in the event that the system is not operative before the judgement on adequacy is confirmed, if these amendments regarding compensation for moral damage or damage to property are implemented and if we do not establish a right to cancellation or a personal right to judicial claim.</p>
<p class="contents">In this light, I would argue, and I hope that the majority of Parliament will vote likewise by means of the amendments presented by my group and others, for a “yes”, but on the strict condition that we see realism, respect for the law, respect for institutional balance, but above all, Mr President, respect for the citizens and their interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The opposing position is unrealistic. It is unrealistic since the negotiation has been satisfactory, given the context, the adversary, or opposing party, and the legal context, which I will return to.</p>
<p class="contents">I am talking about a serious interinstitutional problem, since this Parliament is not undergoing a codecision procedure, it is not tabling amendments. We do not have that option. What we have is a power granted to the Commission and certain Member States who have unanimously backed this position.</p>
<p class="contents">What is our intention? It is to safeguard our responsibility, as established in the very ambiguous Amendment No 6. Because, Mrs Paciotti, it is our directive, we voted for it. We did not establish a criterion of equivalence, but rather a criterion of adequacy, and we established that the Commission was responsible for assessing that criterion of adequacy and a committee of the Member States was established which has unanimously adopted this position.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Paciotti, if we want to change, let us change the directive, but let us not try, through this kind of subterfuge, which is totally against the law, to achieve a situation which will not benefit the citizens, because if these were the only criticisms made, I would support you. At least, I would support you if the directive were reformed. But you would have my support, anyway.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it does not benefit the citizens. You say that information can currently be provided by means of a contract. It is not realistic, Mrs Paciotti, you know it is not realistic. At the moment, the information is circulating without any guarantee.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us turn now to the Safe Harbour. To say that the Safe Harbour must be operative before we pass judgement on its adequacy will lead to its collapse. This is because no company is going to accept its implications in terms of investment and change, unless it knows that it will be guaranteed the possibility of having access to the free circulation of information.</p>
<p class="contents">I must point out that the United States have at least 25 years of experience in this type of system, which supports the idea that this can work and that it is going to work. And it <span class="italic">is</span> going to work.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to appeals and damages, you, who are a great legal expert, know that an institution can only be analysed in context. Analyse it, therefore, within the context of the United States’ legal and judicial system and the conclusion will be completely different to the one you have reached. The majority, not all, but the majority, of these rights involve legal redress, in the last instance, after having been subject to a complaint to the competent governmental body.</p>
<p class="contents">And neither does this rule out legal proceedings. This is because American legislation, in relation to economic damages, does not consider moral damages and we cannot demand that they change their legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, cancellation. This goes against the principles established by the OECD in 1980.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end, Mr President. I hope that tomorrow this House will support this position which, as I have said, is ultimately in the interest of the citizens of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reality is that data is flowing across the Atlantic and we, and our citizens, have no protection at present. So the question for us must be: do we give them the protection that is on offer or do we say it is not enough? If we do that, then what will happen?</p>
<p class="contents">Concerns have rightly been raised about the access for individuals to redress and compensation. But this raises the fundamental debate about the clash of legal cultures which has been so central to these negotiations. Clearly, as an elected Parliament, we have a duty to protect our citizens, but I fear that the conditionality in paragraph 7 of Mrs Paciotti's report endangers the whole agreement, for it could hardly be more fundamental to the debate about adequacy or equivalence. We are in a global context here and <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce will continually throw at us clashes of legal systems and style. Yet we cannot attempt to change the way the Americans deal with their own national legislation and legal system. They have their way and we have ours. They will come to their own conclusions about how they will change their system. Yes, they are considering it; yes, they have had several annual reports about the protection of personal data. I wish we had that within our European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge colleagues in the vote tomorrow to give protection to our citizens now. Conditionality will mean no protection now. But if we express our very strong reservations and to ask for clear review, this will give our citizens protection now and offer us progress in this very difficult area.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has taken account both of the requisite protection for individuals against any misuse of their own personal data and of the need to reach an agreement with the United States as quickly as possible so as not to put a brake upon the development of trade.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when it seems certain that an information society will be developed on the back of the new technologies, we think it vital immediately to implement the means needed to protect the consumer and the citizen from the abuses inherent in the marketing and innovative techniques that are so greedy for accurate information.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of an agreement with the United States, the rapporteur emphasised the extent to which this country lacked any legally binding standard on personal data protection. So American firms may use all the data they wish without the Federal State finding fault with this.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that it is particularly dangerous that the Commission should be willing to ratify an agreement that offers so few guarantees for the citizen. The ‘safe harbour’ system proposed by the American authorities offers no protection at all. It is a voluntary standard which American firms would themselves apply internally and then only with regard to Europeans. This text, moreover, does not give citizens the right to go to court if their rights are flouted.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be a great shame, particularly now that, after years of discussion, the Council appears to be willing to set up a proper European body to monitor the use of personal data, if we were to ease off the pressure in terms of our demands on the subject with regard to third countries in general and the United States in particular. It is a condition <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> for any real protection of citizens’ individual liberties.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to remind the Commission that personal data protection is an integral part...</p>

The ‘safe harbour’ agreement would mean that we would have to transfer data to American businesses, companies and corporations without the possibility of recourse to an independent authority in the event of improper or illegal use of the data, and that we would therefore not even be protected by those minimal guarantees which exist in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">During the hearing held by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, we took on board the concerns of the representatives of American consumers regarding the inadequacy of the American protection system and we also noted the need, expressed by President Clinton, for the United States to introduce an organic law on the protection of personal data. If we adopt this report, we will not only be expressing our political will to succeed in concluding an agreement containing protection clauses which respect European legislation, but we will also be encouraging a large proportion of Congress and of United States’ public opinion to develop personal data protection laws.</p>
<p class="contents">If such laws are not produced and the changes called for in the Paciotti report are not made, we may as well call the agreement with the United States the ‘dangerous harbour’ agreement.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Data protection, which is essential to privacy, poses huge challenges in an age of electronic communication. If we are frank, we will admit that no government has yet found a way to offer adequate protection to its citizens. In the European Union the route of regulation through legislation has proven far from perfect. In the US, the route of self-regulation has also brought up serious problems, as the report from the Federal Trade Commission to Congress last month shows us.</p>
<p class="contents">Liberal Democrats have taken the view that the proposals in this draft agreement beg many questions, but that on balance, and since this is the deal on offer, it is better to have regulation to allow this valuable trade to grow than to allow anarchy to reign. There has been much debate in my group about the impact and the legal effect of this report. I take the view that this report says yes, but – quite rightly – requires firms participating in the safe harbour to agree to pay compensation in the case of individuals suffering damage from abuse of data held on them. In my view this is necessary for consumer confidence, which is a fickle thing, but others, probably the majority in my group, will support Amendment Nos 1 and 2 which they believe clear up all legal uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, we cannot know how the United States will react to our concerns. I am guided by the considerable economic interest of the USA in having this agreement, but I recognise that others are guided by a deep concern about the current lack of protection and a burning desire to see even the limited protection offered by this agreement. Either way, it remains our hope that legislative developments on the other side of the Atlantic will render the safe harbour obsolete and we salute the Commission in the work they have done in achieving what they clearly believe is the best achievable result.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given the time available and the considerable amount of work we still need to get through this evening, I would like to confine myself to a few key points.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It is not clear to me from this draft resolution whether Parliament intends to make a decision on whether or not the Commission has exceeded its authority. Hence I would ask Parliament to make itself clearer in its resolution. Naturally the Commission believes that it has used its authority correctly with regard to its proposal for a decision on the safe harbour, and I hope that Parliament sees it the same way. Parliament would put the Commission in an extremely difficult position if it were to adopt an unclear or negative resolution. I might add that supporting Amendment No 1 would obviate such an undesirable outcome. </p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 8 of the resolution now on the table states that the free movement of data cannot be authorised until all the components of the safe harbour system are operational. I take this example to mean that those of the United States’ documents that are at the draft stage at present, will have to be officially published before the decision is approved, and the Commission would agree with this. However, the Commission does not agree with the suggestion that we should only be able to proceed to a determination of adequacy once the safe harbour system has been in force for some time. There is one good reason as to why this will not work. American firms will not be prepared to make the investment necessary to fulfil the requirements of the safe harbour system while they are uncertain as to whether it is deemed to offer adequate protection. I do not think the chicken-and-egg analogy has much relevance here. Our decision is unilateral. I would like to emphasise this, also to Mrs Paciotti, who, incidentally, I would like to thank warmly for all the work she has put into this affair. So the chicken-and-egg analogy is irrelevant. The decision is unilateral and if the safe harbour system fails to accommodate the requirements stipulated by the United States then we might as well suspend or withdraw our decision unilaterally as well. I am not expecting us to have to go that far, because the very fact that we could do so will ensure assiduous implementation on the part of the United States.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 7 of the draft resolution states that certain changes will have to be made before Parliament is prepared to agree that the safe harbour system affords adequate protection. Irrespective of the question as to whether applying these conditions falls within Parliament’s current remit, I would first like to point out that not one of these points is new to the Commission. On the contrary, these are improvements that we have always aspired to in our talks with the United States. But the American government has consistently refused to accept them. This refusal as it stands is insufficient reason for dropping them. But the key question is whether these changes are a <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> to arriving at a determination of adequacy. The Commission’s position, which is shared by all the Member States, is that although they are all desirable, none of the changes are necessary. And I would urge the honourable Members not to forget that we are to determine whether the safe harbour affords adequate protection and not whether it satisfies all the requirements of the directive. The first change that would have to be made concerns recognition of an independent right of appeal to an independent public body in the event of violation of the safe harbour principles. This is also a point that Mrs Paciotti made with some force. However, the safe harbour system already provides for independent resolution of disputes, and this is undertaken in numerous cases by private dispute resolution bodies. There are a whole host of reasons as to why we should encourage, rather than oppose, this alternative method of dispute resolution, which is often more user-friendly than judicial procedures. The safe harbour also provides for enforcement to be carried out by government bodies. It is not just self-regulation but self-regulation underpinned by legislation. And the two enforcement authorities recognised in the decision are the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Transportation in the United States. Naturally, a private individual may have their reasons for wanting to take a matter to court in the United States. But an alternative method of dispute resolution need not be an obstacle to those seeking legal redress. To demand more would risk moving towards a system equivalent to that in the directive, when all we can ask is adequate protection. </p>
<p class="contents">The officials responsible for data protection in the European Union have themselves said, in an opinion that is quoted extensively in your draft resolution, that, in principle, self-regulatory systems afford adequate protection.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The point of the second change is make it obligatory for participating firms to compensate for the damage suffered by those involved in the event of violation of the principles. Participating firms will have to pay compensation in a whole host of circumstances, for example on account of their obligations pursuant to legislation in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The safe harbour does not offer the same all-encompassing guarantee as the directive but as I said, we are not entitled to make the same demands as those in the directive. And that is no great loss to my mind. We must get this issue in proportion. Even in the European Union there have only been a small number of cases that have led to the payment of compensation.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The third change Parliament wants to see concerns the right to have data cancelled when it has been obtained or processed illegally. </p>
<p class="contents">In the safe harbour, the cancellation of data is a sanction that all dispute resolution bodies must have at their disposal, but it is for them to decide under what circumstances the sanction should be applied. The United States argues that cancellation is not a requirement according to OECD guidelines. Although these guidelines are open to more than one interpretation, it is difficult to completely rule out that of the United States. The working party of officials in charge of data protection does not deem the cancellation of data to be essential to proper data protection. Therefore, the Commission does not see any need to retain these changes for us to be able to deem the level of protection afforded by the safe harbours adequate. To make approval of the determination of adequacy conditional on these changes is more likely to end up sinking the safe harbour than achieving hoped-for improvements. I would like to leave you in absolutely no doubt about this. The United States has no desire to revisit the discussions again and the Commission also takes the view that the talks are over.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Both the individuals involved, whose data is transferred, and the economic actors need the safe harbour. The business communities on both sides of the Atlantic are in no doubt about that. The safe harbour will make it easier for data to be transferred and will ensure greater legal certainty. But at the same time, the safe harbour will dramatically improve protection for those involved. Data is now flooding across to the United States and a substantial amount is transferred with no protection whatsoever, as Mrs Palacio has just emphasised.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The safe harbour will not solve all our problems in one fell swoop and it will increase the data protection standards in the United State over a wider area than any other solution. Also, by simplifying data transmission procedures it will make evasion a less attractive prospect.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, I would again like to call on Parliament to adopt a clear resolution that gets the safe harbour system underway. Parliament will find it is in good company if it does. The working party of officials in charge of data processing issued an opinion on 16 May that you are bound to have seen. Everyone would have liked to see the safe harbour system improved further, but the officials did not reject the idea of a Council decision as matters stand, because in this way, it will be possible to put the system to the test in practice. Naturally they emphasised the need for close supervision and vigilance should the decision be implemented. The Member States, as has been mentioned this evening, gave unanimous support to the Commission’s draft decision when their opinion was sought at the end of May. Some of them had the same concerns as those that have come to the fore this evening in Parliament’s draft resolution. But they were all agreed that it was time to give the system a chance.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">If Parliament were ultimately to support the Commission’s proposal, then it would not end up out in the cold. By giving expression to its concerns and encouraging the Commission to be vigilant, it would be adding its voice to that of the officials in charge of data protection However, if Parliament were to throw up obstacles, then this would not lead to any improvement in the safe harbour system but would only prolong the existing situation, which would do those involved and the business community no service. The safe harbour system is not perfect but the alternatives are no better.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to leave it there. Allow me to say again how grateful I am to the rapporteur, Mrs Paciotti, also the committees that have been most involved in this and their Chairmen Mrs Palacio and Mr Watson, for their constructive work in this matter. I approach Parliament’s vote on this issue with confidence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
