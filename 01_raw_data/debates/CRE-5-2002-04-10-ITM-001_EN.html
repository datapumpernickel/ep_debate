<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">de Miguel,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since the Russian military operations in the Russian Federal Republic of Chechnya resumed in September 1999, the situation there has been treated as a priority by the European Union. Both the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council, back in December 1999, and the actions of the presidencies which have followed it, are testimony to this. Contrary to what some people predicted, this position has not altered following the attacks of 11 September.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish Presidency has been acting and will continue to act throughout this six-month period in a way that is fully coherent with this issue of concern to the Union. The Presidency’s work plan for the development of a common strategy for Russia included a paragraph which indicated our will to “continue to express the Union’s desire for an early peaceful solution in Chechnya within the framework of the principle territorial integrity, the Rule of Law and respect for human rights, to promote an improvement of the conditions for the safer and more effective distribution of humanitarian aid”.</p>
<p class="contents">In the months since January, these intentions have been turned into various concrete actions. The Presidency has included the Chechen issue on the agenda of all political talks between the European Union and Russia at various levels, with both political representatives, such as the European Union-Russia Ministerial troika, the European Union-Russia political directors’ troika and the PSC-Russia troika, and in meetings of experts, the so-called COEST troika.</p>
<p class="contents">On the occasion of the recent ministerial-level troika with the Russian Foreign Minister, Mr Ivanov, on 2 April, the issue was once again raised by the Presidency. Furthermore, at the beginning of March, the troika of Union Heads of Mission in Moscow made a representation to the Russian Federation’s Deputy Foreign Minister, Mr Gusarov, to express the Union’s concern at the human rights situation in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">We must add to all these actions, which have served to communicate the Union’s position on the development of the Caucasus Republic to the Russian authorities, the request for, and subsequent support from Russia for, the trip which the troika of Heads of Mission intends to make to the region during April, which will allow us to obtain information on the development of events. For this same purpose of compiling information, the troika of Heads of Mission maintains frequent contacts with representatives of NGOs and competent authorities such as Mr Kalamanov, the Kremlin’s special representative for human rights in Chechnya, or Mr Yastrzhembsky, the presidential spokesman.</p>
<p class="contents">While explaining these specific measures, which are not restricted in this case to those being developed by the Spanish Presidency in particular, I must point out that the Union’s concern has been translated into a significant financial commitment. The European Union is currently the greatest donor of humanitarian aid to the region. The sums allocated to it amount to EUR 65 million for the period between the resumption of military operations in 1999 and the current time. Of these sums, EUR 40 million has been earmarked for 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the current situation in Chechnya, I would like to stress certain aspects. In the field of human rights, all the reports from the OSCE support group, from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and from the various NGOs continue to give cause for concern. Lord Judd stated in the report communicated to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, that the progress observed in this field over the last year had been scant. The report of the support group of the OSCE for the early months of this year with regard to military operations carried out during this period spoke of civilian disappearances, lootings, the indiscriminate use of force and other violations of the human rights of civilians, all of this in contravention of what had been previously agreed. The representative of the public prosecutor’s office was not present during all operations.</p>
<p class="contents">We must acknowledge the steps taken by the Russian authorities to improve the situation. President Putin – we must recognise – has expressed his commitment that the people guilty of human rights violations, including the military, will be tried and punished. These statements have also been repeated by other official representatives.</p>
<p class="contents">The Office of the Kremlin’s Special Representative for Human Rights in Chechnya has carried out its work, condemning alleged violations of human rights. The Russian authorities are cooperating with the organisations active in this area. With regard to the intergovernmental organisations, in addition to cooperation with the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights, the mandate of the OSCE support group in Chechnya has been renewed until 31 December 2002; three representatives of the Council of Europe are continuing to participate in the same office and the work of the mixed working group consisting of members of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the Duma are continuing their work.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the NGOs, last January the creation of the Council for the protection of human rights in Chechnya was agreed, which would be made up of representatives of these non-governmental organisations, the public prosecutor’s office, the security forces and local authorities, and which would meet on a monthly basis. Furthermore, within this repertoire of positive measures, the Chechen police are present at control posts on the Republic’s transport routes. However, in view of the analysis of the current situation, these measures are insufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the humanitarian situation, there is still the ongoing tragedy of the hundreds of thousands of displaced persons, who are mainly dissuaded from returning to Chechnya by the continuing situation of insecurity and there are also certain difficulties to be faced by the humanitarian organisations in carrying out their work. We also have to recognise that the Russian authorities have adopted different measures in the region: as well as the creation of the aforementioned working groups with the NGOs, which will provide a forum in which to deal with these issues, the Russian authorities have applied various measures to normalise life. These measures are not restricted to socio-economic development plans, the reopening of educational establishments or the reestablishment of the public pensions system, but they also extend to the drawing up of a draft constitution which will have to be put to a referendum. This will lead to the holding of new elections in which the population of the region will be able to elect their representatives.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the persistence of the problems I have just described, the European Union has exploited – and will continue to exploit – all channels of dialogue in order to communicate its position to the Russian authorities, and that position is based on the following points: firstly, the European Union recognises the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation as well as its right and responsibility to protect its population from terrorist attacks, which the Union condemns unreservedly. This recognition is accompanied by a double consideration: firstly, the Union expresses its firm conviction that that responsibility to protect the population must be fulfilled within the framework of the Rule of Law and strict compliance with respect for human rights and international humanitarian law, which are enshrined in numerous treaties to which the Russian Federation is party.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union requests that the Russian authorities try and punish the people responsible for human rights violations, thereby eliminating any risk of impunity, which unfortunately some people have enjoyed in the past. Those authorities are furthermore urged to provide federal officials with appropriate training in the field of human rights, which would prevent these events from reoccurring in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to acknowledge the contribution made in this area by the Council of Europe and the Office of the United Nations’ High Commission for Human Rights, and take this opportunity to express the European Union’s support for the work of these organisations and the OSCE in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union also wants the Russian authorities to continue to cooperate with the international bodies and NGOs in order to eliminate the obstacles that are still hindering their work. Specifically, these organisations must be allowed access to detention centres and they must be provided with the means for radio communication. An improvement in the human rights situation will undoubtedly encourage the return of displaced persons. The removal of the restrictions which currently make access to the area for the media difficult will also contribute to increasing trust, both within the civil population and within the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">The second major point of the Union’s position is that terrorist acts carried out by Chechen armed factions are without doubt part of the problem but they are by no means the whole problem. A lasting solution to this problem therefore depends on the normalisation of civilian life by means of the restoration of democratic mechanisms and structures in the Chechen Republic. That result must be achieved through dialogue with the various sectors of Chechen society. In this regard, the European Union is urging the Russian authorities to renew the contacts initiated last November.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the European Union believes that its position on this issue is level-headed, since, on the one hand, it has no hesitation in acknowledging the progress made and, on the other, it must continue to indicate those areas in which there are still serious shortcomings. The Union is thereby acting fully in accordance with the values that underpin both its very existence and its relations with third countries, including the strategic relationship between the European Union and Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">The core of these values shared by the Union and Russia is the respect for the Rule of Law and the safeguard of human rights and fundamental freedoms. This attitude of equanimity and coherence will also guide the European Union’s actions with regard to the treatment of Chechnya at the 58th sitting of the Humans Rights Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union has informed the Russian authorities of its full willingness to negotiate a Presidency declaration that incorporates both progress and shortcomings in similar terms to those which I have expressed in this House. Also, we have told those authorities that if this willingness on the part of the Union is not reflected by Russia, the European Union will not hesitate in adopting a resolution, as was necessary during the 2001 session.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it only remains for me to insist on the firmness and coherence of the Union’s position, which will continue to treat the Chechen situation as a priority in terms of its relations with Russia, and it will continue to direct all its attention and efforts towards it as events require, and I would also like to say that this issue will form a significant part of the dialogue that will take place on 28 May at the summit between Russia and the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, the Commission shares Parliament's concern about the deterioration of the situation on the ground in Chechnya, as shown by a number of recent solid reports of serious violations of human rights over the past few months.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of these reports, including from the Council of Europe, the European Union has continued to express its concerns on the matter to the Russian authorities through the appropriate diplomatic channels. As you are aware, the EU-Russia political dialogue offers an intensive calendar of high-level meetings, including last week’s Ministerial Troika with Foreign Minister Ivanov in Madrid.</p>
<p class="contents">The position of the European Union on this issue is quite simple, and quite firm. The EU supports Russia wholeheartedly in its legitimate fight against terrorism, in Chechnya and elsewhere. There should be no doubt about this. Our calls for a political solution which, without prejudice to the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation, satisfies the majority of the Chechen people, do not in any way undermine such support.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, there should be no doubt about the EU commitment to uphold human rights in the fight against terrorism world-wide, including in Chechnya. In this regard, I am confident that the European Parliament fully shares the view that the fight against international terrorism cannot serve as justification or excuse for the violation of the most basic individual human rights, be it in the West Bank, in Afghanistan or in Chechnya. This should not change – and has indeed not changed – due to the horrible terrorist attacks of 11 September last year.</p>
<p class="contents">Against the background of our joint efforts with Russia to establish closer political and economic relations, the European Union has repeatedly made clear to Russia that it expects her to act in full accordance with the values that Russia undertook to respect when it entered the Council of Europe and the OSCE. These basic principles of full respect of fundamental human rights and the rule of law, including international law, constitute an integral part of the strategic partnership that we are trying to build together.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are aware, the Human Rights Commission is currently meeting in session in Geneva, and Chechnya remains an important item on the agenda. The European Commission is fully participating in the internal deliberations of the EU in this forum. While the European Union is prepared to engage in good-faith negotiations with Russia, in order to acknowledge all positive efforts undertaken by Russia during last year, there are still too many very serious issues that have yet to be addressed in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">On the positive side, we have acknowledged some positive Russian steps towards a political solution that could guarantee long-term peace and stability in Chechnya. We welcome these steps and are prepared to support them in any way necessary. In the same vein, we must also acknowledge that there has been progress on a number of issues during the last year, including on physical reconstruction, setting the conditions for economic development, supporting the reestablishment of the Chechen judiciary to restore the rule of law, and so on. Clearly, a lot more has to be done in all of these fields, but there has been progress and credit should be given where credit is due.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, we have noted that the number of reported violations of human rights that have been followed up by prosecutors has increased. However, we must still regret the excessively low number of follow-up convictions that these reports have resulted in. It is clear that, by dispelling any notion of impunity, the punishment of those guilty of human rights violations is crucial to avoid further violations in the future. More must be done here.</p>
<p class="contents">Another area where progress is warranted is in the provision of and access to humanitarian assistance. As you are aware, the European Union, through the European Commission Humanitarian Office ECHO, is by far the largest donor of humanitarian aid to the Northern Caucasus. Since October 1999, we have provided some EUR 65 million in aid to the victims of the Chechnya conflict and last year alone more than EUR 40 million. Our funding is crucial for the presence of international humanitarian NGOs in the area, as well as being crucial also for the work and presence of UN organisations, notably the UNHCR. In our view it is essential that representatives of the international humanitarian community are present in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">We remain concerned about the persistent difficult operating conditions for humanitarian organisations in the Northern Caucasus, notably the opaque and time-consuming system of access and work permits for Chechnya, and also the denial to humanitarian NGOs of the right to use VHF radio communication which is very important for their safety.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been constructively raising the issue of operating conditions with Russian authorities at various levels for more than two years, with only very minor improvements so far. We have tried all possible channels; this is a discordant element in the ongoing discussion with the Russian authorities, but we will not stop pressing these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Security conditions in the Northern Caucasus remain difficult; indeed, one must expect a certain level of operational problems. But we expect more cooperation to be forthcoming from the relevant Russian authorities. In this regard, we will continue to advocate concrete improvements, so as to facilitate the conduct of humanitarian operations according to the basic established normal international standards of safety, efficiency and independent monitoring and evaluation.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel, we will keep insisting that any repatriation of Chechen displaced persons, from within neighbouring Ingushetia and Daghestan, and refugees from Georgia, must take place on a voluntary and unconditional basis only. This is becoming a more and more serious issue. A massive return movement seems rather unlikely at present, given the persisting instability and violence in Chechnya and the very limited progress in the implementation of the Russian Government's long-announced rehabilitation and reconstruction programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday we had a very solemn debate here in Parliament about the situation in the Middle East, and I think that the debate on Chechnya deserves the same degree of solemnity. There is an open wound in Europe: in Chechnya, in the Russian Federation.</p>
<p class="contents">As members of the European People's Party, as European Democrats, we say that security in Europe, on our continent, in the twenty-first century will depend on our having a democratic ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... European Union, which is capable of taking action and committed to upholding human rights, and on our having a democratic Russia, which is capable of taking action and committed to upholding human rights, and on both – the European Union and Russia – working together as partners. We want to have a strategic partnership of this kind because it is important for the future of our continent.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not remain silent, however, when human rights are violated, and of all people, we in the European Parliament must not remain silent. Some observers are saying that more people are dying in Chechnya than in the Middle East. Our group believes that a Chechen life is of equal value to the life of a citizen of the United States or a citizen of the European Union ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">… and that the life of a Muslim in Chechnya is of equal value to the life of a Christian, a Jew, a Palestinian, a Hindu, a Buddhist or a person of no belief.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Human rights – and it is particularly because we are Europeans that this matters to us – are indivisible the world over.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The President of the Russian Federation is currently visiting a Member State of the European Union. Last night I heard his statement on Chechnya on German television. The Russian Ambassador to the European Union, Mr Likhachev, and the President of the Committee for Foreign Affairs in the Duma, Dimitri Rogozin, called to see me last week in Brussels to inform me about the situation. I am pleased that our debate on Chechnya has also provided an opportunity for them to contact our group.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly we have to fight terrorism, but we must not do so in such a way that this has a disproportionate impact on the human rights and lives of the people in Chechnya, of civilians who want to live in peace.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If a study from the US State Department dated 4 March, statements from <span class="italic">Médecins Sans Frontières</span> – an organisation which we esteem greatly because of its commitment – and the organisation Human Rights Watch, which is based in New York, all say that the Russian soldiers have hardly any respect for human life, then this has to set the alarm bells ringing.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Duma representative for Chechnya, Aslambek Aslakhanov, says – and this shows that Russia is also on the road to democracy, and we do of course recognise this – that 80% of the aid which Russia provides for Chechnya is not even reaching the people, then this has to set the alarm bells ringing.</p>
<p class="contents">If Mary Robinson, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, says that the economic, social and cultural situation in Chechnya is very grave, despite some progress – which we have of course also noted – then this has to set the alarm bells ringing. These are descriptions of the situation by organisations and high-profile leaders who know more about what is happening than we do. But it is our duty, as Members of the European Parliament, to debate these massive violations of human rights which are taking place in Russia and therefore in Europe, in Chechnya, for as long as they continue to be a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore call for a ceasefire and a political solution. Those Russian soldiers who have no respect for civilian lives, who have scant regard for human dignity and human life, should not only be criticised for their actions in political statements in Moscow; we call for them also to be brought before the courts and for judgment to be passed on them, because if not the violations of human rights will just go on and on.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We also call on Russia to open up Chechnya to observers – to an even greater extent than it has done so far – and also to work with organisations in the European Union. The President-in-Office of the Council and also the Commissioner referred to this and generally speaking we are of the same mind. In addition, we in the European Parliament should ask our delegation and the corresponding delegation in the Duma – and Parliament should as it were give the go-ahead for this – to establish a well-ordered procedure for attending to Chechnya properly on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Soon – as we of course already decided on 16 March – we should send a European Parliament delegation to Chechnya and that region. For my part I would very much welcome it if you, Commissioner, were personally to travel there to speak to those affected on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we need to cooperate closely with Lord Judd of the Council of Europe, who is of course very involved in working on this problem, and overall we need a political solution. Allow me, in conclusion, to say the following: I have visited all of the republics of the former Soviet Union, including Tatarstan. Tatarstan, the capital of which is Kazan, has a high degree of autonomy, indeed the greatest degree of autonomy in the Russian Federation. Why is it not possible for Chechnya to have something comparable?</p>
<p class="contents">The representatives of Chechnya, who were here two months ago, appeared to have lost all hope; they were depressed and their concern and despair were palpable. It is our duty as the European Parliament to give hope to those who want to live in peace in Chechnya – within the Russian Federation, but with autonomous status of some kind – and to act as an advocate for human rights on this continent and throughout the world, including in Chechnya.</p>

This would indicate that we place no value on the information received from Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia has claimed that terrorists are also operating in Chechnya, but this is not widely accepted. It obviously cannot be true that everyone in Chechnya is a terrorist, which is what has also been said in Russia. However, when the United States of America began their campaign against terrorism we immediately gave them our support.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of some television publicity we believe there is anti-American terrorist activity even in a gorge between Russia and Georgia.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen: I have ten observations to make. This brutal war cannot be solved with weapons; even Russia now admits that. The war is part of numerous conflicts in the region; even these terrorists seem to come from the same sources. The conflicts could be eased through international mediation and I am working on the assumption that the delegation’s Executive Committee and our counterparts in the Duma will together try to look for political solutions. This is a political issue. The army’s violent clean-up operations in towns and villages must be ended immediately. The Russian army has not withdrawn because it trades illegally in oil and arms in the region. The Chechens must have their own police authority to expel the terrorists and mercenaries. A legal system must be created there, to bring the guilty to justice. The Chechens’ economy must be made transparent to avoid corruption. Human rights must be monitored; they cannot be violated claiming terrorism as an excuse. Relief organisations must be allowed into the region unhindered, and, finally, the Union must embark on the reconstruction of the region together with Russia and the Chechens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Malmström (ELDR).</span></span>   <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party welcomes the fact that this debate is taking place, as we already did before our friend Mr Dupuis went on hunger strike. It is important to devote special time to Chechnya and to discussing the situation there. I have the feeling that the atrocities and the military offensive are taking place under cover of the events of 11 September and the situation in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">Just like China, which we shall be discussing later, Russia is using the fight against terrorism as a kind of alibi for oppressing its own political opponents and minorities. The war between Chechnya and Russia is a long, stubborn and apparently irresolvable conflict which has gone on for many years. Obviously, atrocities are being committed on both sides. These must of course be investigated, and the people responsible held to account.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that a number of positive signs can be detected. Lord Judd, for example, has pointed to certain modest improvements. Here too, just like in the Middle East, there is a battle as to what news is to be released to the outside world. We are awash with testimonies from human rights organisations concerning the situation of, in particular, civilians in Chechnya. Death squads, summary executions, torture, rape and disappearances. Terrible, systematic atrocities are quite clearly being committed against the civilian population of Chechnya. The Russian authorities must get to grips with this state of affairs, investigate the events and punish those responsible. Nearly 200 000 people have taken flight within Chechnya, and a quarter of a million have fled the country. Their situation is, of course, incredibly precarious.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has adopted quite a number of resolutions on this conflict but, now, action is required. It was good to hear from the President-in-Office of the Council that the troika is to be sent to Chechnya. It would also be good if the Commissioner could travel to the area in order to discuss the situation and address the issue with the Russian President.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be very clear in demanding of Russia that it put an end without delay to the atrocities and massacres directed against civilians. The ELDR Group demands that an independent committee of investigation be sent to Chechnya to ascertain what is really happening. We also want to see President Putin and the Chechen President, Mr Maskhadov, invited to Parliament to discuss the situation, so enabling us to demonstrate our support for peace talks. The tentative negotiations begun in November 2001 resulted in only one meeting, and there was no major progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with the OSCE and the Council of Europe, the EU can play a role in facilitating talks so that we can bring about a political solution. There is, of course, no military solution. My political group also wants the EU to take action by submitting an initiative concerning Chechnya at the UN Commission on Human Rights’s session in Geneva.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr de Miguel spoke of the EU’s support for the UNHCR, and that is important. The truth, however, is that the EU’s contribution to the UNHCR’s budget has declined by a third in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, we discussed the Middle East situation in this House, where there is a strong commitment to resolving the conflict. Our commitment ought not, however, to lead to our closing our eyes to other conflicts and giving the Russians <span class="italic">carte blanche</span> to commit these atrocities. The situation is drastic, and the conflict is in danger of spreading to the whole region, with devastating consequences for Russian democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The ELDR Group supports the resolution before us, even though we think it is rather faint-hearted. We must send a strong message to the Russian Government and President: We know what you are doing, and we find it unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Staes (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Mr de Miguel, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the events of 11 September last year are still clearly dominating world politics. And we all know that world politics are particularly cynical, which is certainly also true for Chechnya. Since 11 September, I have the impression that Chechnya has indeed fallen into the cracks of world history and has been banished from current affairs, and today’s debate is therefore of particular importance. Since my appointment as Chairman of the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee, I have conducted many talks with Russians, Chechens, aid workers and human rights activists. Certainly, the situation is complex, and talking about this issue in black and white terms will indeed not bring any solace but, despite this, I have to make a few observations.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems in Chechnya cannot be solved by military means. What we need is a political solution, an immediate cease-fire and political consultation. In this vein, I support the appeal made by human rights organisations to invite Mr Mascadov to Parliament in Strasbourg in September of this year and to start consultations with the Russian representatives of the Council of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Poettering pointed out a moment ago, a number of Russian colleagues paid us a visit last week and told us that Chechnya is returning to normality. This was also confirmed by the Russian ambassador. I am not credulous, as you may have gathered. The many reports of human rights organisations and the testimonies of refugees themselves are flooding into our offices via the ordinary mail and via <span class="italic">e</span>-mail. Mr Poettering was right to mention a few organisations, including Human Rights Watch, <span class="italic">Médecins sans Frontières</span> and Amnesty International<span class="italic">. </span>He mentioned the testimony of Mary Robertson and of a Chechen Member of Parliament. It is obvious that daily life in Chechnya today is not that simple. And we must therefore invite our Russian colleagues to enter into consultation and to promote goodwill. We can hardly label these organisations, these people who are mentioned in our compromise resolution, as agents of international terrorism, as representatives of Bin Laden. This would be all too simplistic.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore delighted that our delegation will be spending half a day next Monday with our Russian colleagues in Chechnya to talk over the difficulties. I am also pleased that, in the compromise resolution which will be voted on in a moment, our delegation will be given the task of setting up a working party, which will very specifically follow the situation in Chechnya and will mount an independent inquiry into what is actually happening in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore thrilled that we are repeating our request of sending an ad hoc delegation to Chechnya. We decided on this in March 2000, but this has not yet been acted upon. I would therefore ask the Parliament Bureau to ensure that this is at long last done.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would turn to Mr Nielsen on behalf of my Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. Parliament has asked you twice to visit Chechnya. Can I make a suggestion to you, Mr Nielsen? We will go together. I am prepared to take some time out, and we will assess the situation in Chechnya together. And we will try to take action at long last.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I can assure you that the delegation next Monday will do everything in its power to move the situation on by one little step and to enter into consultation with our Russian colleagues of the Duma and of the Council of Federations. I thank you, Mr President, for the extra time you have given me. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like Palestine, Chechnya is a country occupied by a strong and sizeable superior force. As in Palestine, people in Chechnya see their ordinary, fundamental rights being violated and, in the case of Chechnya, we also see a country completely reduced to ruins and in which 20% of the population has been killed. It is quite clear that both Israel and Russia are exploiting a situation in which the United States has declared war on terrorism and, under cover of this, are waging a war against a whole people; a war, moreover, that resembles ethnic cleansing. I think we should remember that there was no terrorism in Chechnya when, in 1991, the country made use of the law of 16 December 1966 – which said that countries within the Federation too were entitled to independence – to acquire independence from Russia. At that time there was no terrorism but, from 1994, Russia has done everything it can to prevent such independence. It is another example of the way in which the oppression of a people and the desperation felt by a population can lead people to do things they would never otherwise have done. Terrorism does not come about of itself. Terrorists do not fall from the sky. Certain population groups obviously do not have special genes which make them behave differently to the rest of us. It is of course the conditions people live under that make them behave as they do. It is important that we take a decision to invite Mr Maskhadov and Mr Putin to Strasbourg in September. In that way, we can bring about a debate, obtain a report and make an impression on both parties. I think we must demand open access for the humanitarian organisations and news media so that the information war is not a factor operating to the Chechens’ disadvantage. In the end, it is also necessary, however, for people who have been subject to atrocities to be given a clear sense that those who violate human rights will in the last analysis be punished. Unless they have that sense, I do not believe we shall get very far either with the fight for democracy and human rights or with the fight against terrorism. Basically, we must demand that the Russian occupation of Chechnya cease – preferably now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dupuis (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this text, which was chiefly drafted by Mr Oostlander, is an appalling document. It is totally immoral and cannot be considered to be politically credible. To continue to demand that the Russian authorities and military forces, which have waged war for two and a half years and have systematically breached the fundamental rights of the Chechen people for two years, bring an end to their deliberate acts of violence, is absolutely appalling.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, it is absolutely appalling to continue to demand that humanitarian aid be allowed to get through to Chechnya, when we know that the Russian authorities are doing everything to prevent humanitarian aid from reaching its destination. We are not talking about a massive breach of human rights taking place in Chechnya today. We are talking about outright genocide. It is the first genocide to take place in Europe since the genocide of the Jewish people.</p>
<p class="contents">When 20% of the population, namely 200 000 people out of a population of one million inhabitants – is massacred, when tens of thousands of men are tortured and when their reproductive organs are systematically destroyed, we are no longer talking about human rights violations. We are talking about genocide.</p>
<p class="contents">Forty per cent of the Chechen people are refugees and have nothing to live on. These people are surviving in dreadful conditions in Ingushetia, and only 20-30 % of the Commission’s humanitarian aid gets through to them; the rest is lost ‘in the system’. As Mr Poettering said, the aid supplied by Russia does not arrive at its destination either. Taking all this into account, you can only arrive at one conclusion. This is genocide and Europe is sitting back, watching this genocide take place.</p>
<p class="contents">Comparisons with Palestine can be made, but only up to a point, as we are talking about terrorism in Palestine. I would like some evidence that the Chechens are committing terrorism. We have proof that there are Palestine suicide bombers but, as for the attacks in Moscow of two or three years ago, there has been no evidence unearthed to prove that these were committed by Chechens. On the contrary, there is increasing evidence to show that the FSB – the Russian secret service – may have been responsible for the attacks. Is it possible that thousands of Chechens have been fighting with the Taliban? Hundreds and hundreds of foreign reporters have searched for Chechens in Afghanistan. The international forces which were and still are in Afghanistan looked day after day for Chechen fighters. But, so far, no one has found a single Chechen fighter in Afghanistan. This rumour was put about by the FSB and the Russian counter-intelligence service. So, it is wrong to call the Chechens terrorists when they are defending themselves, just as the Bosnians defended themselves, when they are defending themselves like the Croats defended themselves, when they have no Russian civilian targets because there are no Russian civilians in Chechnya. There are Russian soldiers and there are Chechen fighters who are fighting the Russians. It is, in fact, the Russians who are carrying out acts of violence and torture on a daily basis, resorting to blackmail, imprisoning Chechens in filtration camps, who are involved in bargaining and trafficking of corpses and prisoners. They are asking people who do not have the equivalent of one euro to spend several dollars in order save their families. This is the situation in Chechnya. It is genocide.</p>
<p class="contents">Two and a half years have passed and Commissioner Nielson still has not managed to visit this country where genocide is taking place. Mr Poettering, Mr Watson, Mr Cohn-Bendit and Mrs Frassoni met Mr Oumar Khanbiev, the Health Minister, who is sitting in the public gallery. Mr Baròn Crespo and Mr Wurtz are meeting him today. Mr Nielson, Mr Khanbiev is not suffering from the plague, you can also meet him. He is sitting there, all you have to do is walk up to the public gallery and you can see him. He knows everything about the needs of the Chechen population in Chechnya, Ingushetia, Georgia and Azerbaijan, you can discuss this with him.</p>

Needless to say, I am also impressed with the enthusiasm and commitment with which Mr Dupuis is talking about this issue. Nevertheless, I take the view that it is very important, particularly in a situation as complicated as this one, where it is important to help find a solution, to keep a cool head, even though we have a warm heart.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that, after the first war, the politicians in Chechnya actually received all our sympathy. The outlook was, in fact, very rosy and, indeed, as the Chairman of my group, Mr Poettering, said, Tatarstan was a shining example. Chechnya could have developed into a Tatarstan, and perhaps even a Tatarstan with more independence than Tatarstan itself. This was also provided for in Russian policy. What did we ultimately see? That, in the time between the two wars over Chechnya, nothing was achieved in the way of forming a state. A failed state emerged, which is a disaster. We have seen this everywhere where the situation is similar. We have seen this in former Afghanistan and in Somalia, where this is still a live issue. We have also identified this in other parts of the world. A failed state is a disaster for all citizens and for the international community, for what can happen in such a failed state always has international repercussions.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore watched – and this was also observed by our Western journalists – Chechnya degenerate into a kidnapping state, a robber state, a smuggler state revolving around the oil which runs through it. This is a disaster which we are facing. Then a war breaks out. One of a kind which we would never ever want to see, neither from the Chechen point of view nor from the Russian point of view. So a war ensues in which it is even difficult to distinguish citizens from the military and which therefore claims many civilian victims. The battle surrounding Chechnya has elements of a freedom struggle, but these are terribly overshadowed by radicalisation and imbued with criminal activity. We are now also informed of Russian troops and Chechen rebels together earning a handsome figure from oil which is transported through the region illegally. These are very ironic facts which we are facing and it is not easy to say: this is black and this is white. It is not like that in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to admit that I am pleased that, at the time, I was able to hold extensive talks with colleagues of the Duma, namely the chairman of the committee responsible for Chechnya, the chairman of the Human Rights Committee and the spokesperson of the army, General Manilov. They were all very honest with me about the concern which all of this has caused them. And they never disguised anything, which shows me that Moscow, too, takes this matter very seriously but fails to find the answer. All the more reason why we should intervene on the strength of our partnership with Russia. Human rights are in our line of business. They will never be able to disappear from our agenda, and certainly not if they involve a close partner, as Russia currently is. We should make it our concern. This is why our resolution is full of questions. It is indeed easy and exciting only to address Russia with accusations, but we also have a great many questions. We also have a number of proposals, and these are all aimed at reconstruction, humanitarian aid, better reception of refugees from those regions, options to return home and the development of the social conditions under which it is possible to return home. This is also self-evident, even to the politicians in Moscow with responsibility for the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">During talks with them, it is impossible to ignore the feeling that they too are very much struggling with this issue. And if the situation could be different, they would be in favour of it. They are also very much convinced that war criminals from their own ranks should be brought to justice. The difficulty and the uncomfortable fact that we are left with is that this is not done frequently enough, because commanders on the ground tend to protect their own soldiers from jurisdiction. This is a reprehensible attitude, but we recognise it in different wars, including colonial wars, such as the one which the Netherlands fought in Indonesia after the Second World War. It was very often the case that, only 20 or 30 years after the event, was it possible in the Netherlands to mention war crimes which our own boys had committed in Indonesia. I am pleased that, at least in Russia, openness is being achieved more promptly in this matter, which also creates the opportunity for action. Once again, we read recently that President Putin collects people around him and asks them to moot ideas for a viable policy to inject, where possible, peace and security into Chechnya once again. Maybe in conjunction with Ingushetia, there are all kinds of plans afoot in Russia to examine to what extent it would be possible to create a reasonably functioning state, for that is something which concerns us all.</p>
<p class="contents">There are indeed 200 000 refugees, and it would be of crucial importance – and we have insisted on this in the past – for Commissioner Nielsen, who is, after all, responsible for refugee issues and humanitarian issues, to have a personal input in this. It is, of course, the case that it would be quite difficult to ask for entry into Chechnya right now. We, and I personally, have on a couple of occasions asked the ambassador and other Russian representatives here to allow us entry to Chechnya. Every time, this question is avoided, and this is why I will give my full backing to the proposals, including those made in the Council of Europe, to set up delegations, possibly in combination with members of the Duma who have a sense of responsibility, to go there and to establish for ourselves what is going on. For only if we really know what the situation is like over there and if the international press, as stated in the resolution, and the Russian press, are allowed entry, will it be possible to make well-informed proposals which make any sense. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Dupuis has spoken of atrocities which I find horrifying, because these atrocities are happening to real people; to grandmothers, grandfathers, mothers, daughters, fathers and sons for no reason other than that they are different. I do not hold to the cosiness of the view that Russia is doing all that it should, or that it is deeply concerned. After all we were told that, post-September 11, the world had changed, that fundamental human rights would be scrutinised with more vigour than before. However, in the case of Chechnya, this is clearly not the case. The rights of the Chechens, of whom 200 000 are living in direct danger and fear, are being ignored by the Russians. Moreover, I believe, the situation is getting worse rather than better. It seems that September 11 has been a catalyst for a cosy relationship between Russia and the US, in which the US turns its eye the other way.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome this resolution but we must drive it forward. Why have our actions lacked punch up until now? I will tell you why; because there has been a lack of co-ordinated and consistent international approach for fear of offending Mr Putin and allies. Atrocities grow, they do not diminish. Conflict goes on for years. It is an ongoing war that has been almost unnoticed. Yet we see the denial of human rights, the denial of the right of humanitarian NGOs to operate effectively on the ground. We need more co-operation with the Russian authorities and the independent media to report the truth to the outside world. But let us never forget that the fundamental right is to live in peace without fear of persecution. We need a political resolution, but Russia must be held to account.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finish with this: When war begins, politicians have failed. When wars continue, humanity loses its purpose. This war must end. The peace process is not an option; it is the only way forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For eight years the Russian military has been waging war on the civilian population in Chechnya. This is the reality and we must not close our eyes to it. That is why I should like to ask you the following question Mr President-in-Office of the Council: in the trilogue did you present and explain the list of measures, which you have just presented to us, to the Russian Foreign Minister, Mr Ivanov, in the same terms in which you have just presented them to us here? Did you also tell Mr Ivanov about the threats you mentioned of adopting measures against Russia? Was this really the focal point of the agenda or was it only mentioned in passing. The fact remains that it has not yet had any effect. It is my impression that this was not put to the Russian side in the same serious tone that you have just adopted here.</p>
<p class="contents">This makes us guilty of these crimes too. We know that in Chechnya people are being abducted, killed and abused every day.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we know that Chechens are known as 'blacks' in Russia, a derogatory Russian term denoting that they are second-class citizens. Remaining silent and looking away when civilians are being hurt and abused on a daily basis damages our credibility in the eyes of the world whenever and wherever we defend human rights. That is why it is important for us not to believe President Putin's protestations, which bear no relation to reality and which he repeated yesterday in Weimar, that the people need to be protected from bandits and that State rule needs to be re-introduced. This is completely unrelated to what is really happening on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to ensure that there is international monitoring to report on violations of human rights by the army. In any case I would support all calls to invite President Putin and Mr Machadov here to Strasbourg in September so that the dialogue can finally begin and the guns can fall silent, and so that we can end the spiral of violence in this region.</p>

This is also true of the situation in Chechnya. A change of thinking is required. Conflicts and terrorism cannot be resolved by military means. I was pleased to see in yesterday's debate on the Middle East that this is also the unanimous opinion of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of Chechnya, as in all other crisis areas, the only things that will lead to a solution to the problems are negotiations, a willingness to compromise, confidence-building, the development of civil society and the rule of law, and reconstruction. The dialogue with Russia about these problems definitely needs to be stepped up. We should press for the Russian Government to continue and intensify the contacts it began in November with Mr Maskhadov and other Chechens who are ready to talk. The judicious proposals of a Council of Europe working group, in which members of the Duma are also represented, have got these initiatives for a comprehensive Russian-Chechen dialogue off the ground. We should support this.</p>
<p class="contents">The human rights situation in Chechnya remains critical. I welcome the fact that Parliament has drawn attention to these points in its compromise motion. In my view, we should criticise the sluggish progress being made on prosecuting perpetrators of human rights offences and sentencing those who are found guilty of such crimes, despite the fact that President Putin claimed otherwise yesterday. It is positive, however, that the Russian Government has taken the first steps towards rebuilding the country and restoring normality to everyday life. I would refer in particular to the efforts that they have made to build up the civil administration, the judicial system and the local police force. I do not think that it is fair for us to call into question or reject everything that the Russian side says a priori. We need to trust both sides. Because the only basis for being able to talk to each other at all is mutual trust.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should support this development by providing more funds. To get an idea of what is needed we should finally implement our own decision of the year 2000 and send an ad hoc delegation to Chechnya.</p>

Two days ago Mr Aznar told Mr Sharon that the Palestinian conflict could only be solved by political means under the premises of the mutual recognition of the States of Palestine and Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Aznar should firmly protest to Mr Ivanov about the violation in Chechnya of the basic principles of international law, including the right to self-determination of the Chechen people. Unfortunately, he will not dare to do so because he knows that the Russian response would be to remind him, as Mr Putin did, of the ongoing conflict in the Basque country. Yesterday Mr Solana, backed by the President-in-Office, proposed a very reasonable solution to the Palestinian conflict; this would be an excellent solution for Chechnya, why not for the Basque country too? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Posselt (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, while Chancellor Schröder and President Putin sit down together today in Weimar and do business as though there were nothing wrong, a secret genocide is taking place in Chechnya. I use the word genocide advisedly because this is precisely what has been happening in Chechnya in recent years: a fifth of the population has been driven out of the country, tens of thousands have been systematically murdered, and there is no end to the killing! These are not isolated violations of human rights or one-off attacks. They are systematic. It began with one of the bloodiest, if not the very bloodiest election campaign in the history of mankind, the election campaign which President Putin was fighting when he unleashed this war in Chechnya. At that time his purpose was not to fight terrorism. It was to sweep away a democratic, though – as it is quite clear in this region – extremely unsatisfactory, regime which had been elected under the supervision of the OSCE, and to appoint his own governors. I find it rather grotesque that we should now be asking these same governors to investigate their own misdemeanours.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be our task to make this issue an international concern and finally to expose it to the glare of world publicity. That is why I am grateful to Hans-Gert Poettering and all those who overcame considerable resistance to enable this Parliament today to devote peak debating time to these really dreadful violations of international law and human rights and to this genocide, and finally to make it clear that it is not acceptable for a high-level EU delegation to travel to the Middle East and try to reach Mr Arafat while at the same time saying that they cannot travel to Chechnya because it is not possible or because permission would not be granted. We cannot let a partner country like Russia get away with systematically isolating an area like this where such brutal violations of human rights are taking place, with closing it to journalists, to observers and to humanitarian organisations. We must not stand for this any longer. That is why I also agree that the Commissioner must go there, the troika must go there and the parliamentary delegation must go there. We are all prepared to support this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say quite clearly that we must also take the opportunity in September to discuss the situation in Chechnya with the Council of Europe and the elected head of the Chechen Government – of whom the motion unfortunately makes no mention – and to work towards a political solution. We have to remember one thing: courageous journalists, such as Thomas Avenarius of the <span class="italic">Süddeutsche Zeitung</span>, or his colleague from the <span class="italic">Frankfurter Rundschau</span>, have risked their lives to fight their way into the country. Around 4 March alone, they personally documented five systematic acts of terrorism involving numerous murders in five places in Chechnya. It is Russian human rights activists, such as those from the organisation <span class="italic">Memorial</span>, who have risked their lives to go there and document the existence of death squads, set up by Russia's military secret service in Chechnya. These are facts which we finally need to take seriously! We have cases of villages allegedly being cleansed 33 times – and another place 27 times – with around a seventh of the population being killed each time. Civilians, including pregnant women, were pulled out of minibuses and shot. This is not a war on terrorism. Suspected terrorists were shot in their slippers. I really must make it clear that the public is being systematically fed disinformation if the impression is being given that this is simply a rather overblown war on terrorism, quite apart from the fact that this is not how to fight terrorism, but at best how to produce terrorists, and here I must echo what Olivier Dupuis said, that so far there is not a shred of evidence to show that large-scale Chechen terrorism even exists.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the assassinations in Russia are concerned, even the highly respected <span class="italic">Neue Züricher Zeitung</span> has stated quite clearly that there is not even a scrap of circumstantial evidence to show that it was Chechens who were responsible, and the <span class="italic">Neue Züricher Zeitung</span> thinks that we are dealing here with rather dubious circumstances and quite different people pulling strings. This also needs to be stated openly in this Parliament: we have a long tradition of issuing many clear statements on Chechnya. We have put ourselves at the forefront of those who finally wish to ensure that light is shed on this policy of systematically suppressing a people for the sake of oil and other raw materials.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a colonial war at the beginning of the twenty-first century and nothing else! We have every right to oppose this colonial war. We have a special partnership with Russia. We are both members of the OSCE. We are both members of the Council of Europe. We have the means to take action, but we must finally use them. We must stop sleepwalking and acting as though these were isolated incidents. The few officers who have already been brought before the courts or charged, such as an officer who raped and murdered a young woman in the year 2000, a colonel, have not yet been sentenced. This is all propaganda. No one is investigating these crimes. We must not stand for this any longer! We must spell this out to Russia, because it is an important partner which we take seriously.</p>

Clearly, the Russians have a tendency to lump together what is happening on the various chessboards of the world – in Afghanistan, the Middle East, Chechnya and Georgia – as if it were all part of the same phenomenon, which it is not. The Russians often appear to be the most avid readers of those geopolitical experts who predict conflict between the Islamic and Christian civilisations, some ideological gymnastics being necessary here in respect of the positions they held not so long ago.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, we too make mistakes every now and again. For instance, when the European institutions label the Chechen guerrillas ‘bandits’ and ‘terrorists’, it is impossible to imagine being able to hold a dialogue with bandits and terrorists. Therefore, I would look for a single term to define this section of the fighters, who have strong support from the Chechen people.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the European position overall is much more complex, we need expert observers on the ground to counteract attempts to oversimplify the situation locally. I therefore wholeheartedly welcome Lord Judd’s mission; I wholeheartedly welcome the proposal to set up troikas, or quintuples I should say, with the Russian opposition party and the Working Group on Chechnya, to monitor the situation and investigate the violations of human rights; it would appear appropriate, in addition, to set up an ad hoc delegation for the Northern Caucasus to discuss all the current issues with the Russians and Chechen representatives. All this is very positive: it means that we will, at least, be present.</p>
<p class="contents">In essence, the resolution we are discussing today calls, for the most part, upon the Russians to help the victims, to accept the setting-up of monitoring committees and groups and to assist and cooperate with those who work for humanitarian organisations and need permits, visas and protection in order to be able to do their jobs. In hoping for the return of 200 000 refugees, Parliament is, of course, doing no more than just expressing a nice idea.</p>
<p class="contents">It all depends, then, on goodwill, on the willingness of the Putin Government to accept what are essentially implicit criticisms of the current situation in Chechnya – for otherwise it would not be necessary to send so many delegations. We will be able to measure the extent to which Russia intends to establish good working relations with the European Union from its willingness to accept these invitations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are receiving cursory reports from the second war waged by Russian federal forces in Chechnya, based on the terrified accounts given by refugees and reports by the last journalists who were on the ground, that systematic violence and heightened and vengeful acts of barbarism are being committed. Once again, we will not be able to say that we could not help. Russia is no longer an autarchic state, conducting its affairs behind closed doors and determining which Russians have a right to live or die. Russia is linked to the European Union and, consequently, to other parts of the world, through moral and political undertakings, on which its credibility and reputation on the European and international stage depend. One of these undertakings is the European Union’s common strategy on Russia and the cooperation and partnership agreement compelling Russia to respect human rights. Russia is supported in its difficult transition towards achieving Western economic standards by means of programmes, partnerships and funding, in which the Union plays a key role. The enlargement of the Union will mean that Russia will soon find itself in a new geo-political situation which will force it to completely renegotiate its status and relations with its new European neighbours. This time, we must condemn this state of lawlessness and send observers and representatives from the foreign media to find out what is really happening in this tragic, barbaric situation, or impose genuine retaliatory measures if attempts to do this are blocked. We must demand that medical and humanitarian assistance be sent, as a matter of extreme urgency and, above all, we must stop using statements to hide our lack of action and stop soothing our conscience by claiming that we are preserving fragile democracy in Russia. We must avoid any simplistic equation between the fight against terrorism and deliberate genocide. As long as we remain indifferent, the barbaric situation in Chechnya can only deteriorate further. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to say that all the views expressed here are largely shared by the Presidency and the Council, who view the Chechen situation with concern. I fully agree with the view that what happened on 11 September must not encourage anyone, especially Russia, to systematically violate human rights in the name of the fight against terrorism. It is true that there are violations of human rights, very serious ones, but the Council believes that there are positive developments. I therefore believe that we have to continue with our efforts: Parliament must make its voice heard and approve this Resolution – which I personally believe to be excellent – and the Council must continue to take every opportunity to communicate our position to the Russian authorities – the positions of the Council, the European Union, and the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to reassure Mrs Schroedter, who has asked whether in our meetings with the top leaders of the Russian Federation, from Putin and the Foreign Minister to the Deputy Ministers and other high representatives, the Council really says what it is saying now. I can tell you that the Council says the same things to the Russian authorities that it is saying here today. I would not dare to come to Parliament and say something that we are not capable of saying to the authorities of the Russian Federation. I can assure you completely that, during this Presidency and the Presidencies to come, we will continue to say the same things we have always said to the Russian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that we all have to continue with this effort. It is reassuring that the European Parliament support us in it and we believe that the fight to re-establish normality in Chechnya, to establish fully-democratic conditions, respect for human rights, the return of refugees and a return to normal life are objectives that we can and must aspire to. I can guarantee, Mr President, that the Council will spare no effort, together with the Commission and with the support of the European Parliament, to achieve this objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are present in Chechnya; and the level of humanitarian aid funded by the Commission of EUR 40million in 2001 is clear evidence of the priority that we give to this crisis and to the suffering in Chechnya. Our field experts and ECHO staff are evidence of our presence there. We are also the only agent from the outside that has established an independent distribution system for food and assistance inside Chechnya. The Danish Refugee Council is the only alternative to the Russian EMERCOM Ministry, which insists on doing this itself. For instance, World Food Programme assistance is provided through the Russian organisation. We are insisting on continuing to have an independent channel of distribution in order to ensure that we perform better than has been claimed in this debate. I cannot accept the figure of only 3% actually reaching the right people. If this were true, the 200 000 refugees in Ingushetia would no longer be alive.</p>
<p class="contents">We are able to make a difference, but we are not in any way trying to portray this as an easy or flawless operation. It is extremely difficult and that is one of the reasons why we have to continue putting pressure on the Russian authorities, both on the safety aspects of access to VHF radios and the work permits and general conditions for the international humanitarian organisations working in the area.</p>
<p class="contents">The first mission I went on after taking office was the humanitarian mission to East Timor in the autumn of 1999, the second one was to the region we are talking about today. I am grateful for the advice that it may be useful for me to go there once again, and we will consider that.</p>
<p class="contents">The effort of the Commission, the funding and the resolute support to our implementing partners is the only real effort to secure an international humanitarian presence in this theatre. We are determined to continue this work and there is no weakening whatsoever of that determination. It may also be useful to say, in view of what has been said in this debate, that I find it both necessary and clearly meaningful to maintain the established division between, on the one hand, the broader political dialogue – a dialogue also accentuating the human rights aspects – and the clearly defined humanitarian aid effort. That division of labour as to who does what and how it is carried out is both necessary and meaningful. If we mix all this up into one single cocktail, we will get carried away for good, sympathetic, political reasons, but we would actually endanger the access of international humanitarian organisations into this troubled arena.</p>
<p class="contents">Humanitarian aid has its own rationale and it is important to recognise that if we allow ourselves to politicise the whole thing, we are doing humanitarian aid no favours. This is important to keep in mind, and I beg Parliament to understand that it in no way indicates any weakening of the purpose and strength of our political dialogue with Russia on the political aspects of all this. But we have to put on a credible performance as a serious funder of humanitarian aid. I have noted the many good pieces of advice given in the debate, and that will provide important input for our further deliberations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
