<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gallagher </span> <span class="bold">(UPE), </span><span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, in tabling this report on regionalisation which is an own‐initiative report from the Committee on Fisheries, let me immediately pay tribute to our former colleague Allan Macartney whose strong sense of European identity pervades this entire document. His outstanding contribution to the Committee on Fisheries strengthened and safeguarded the European fishing industry whose interests he stoutly defended during his lifetime. His presence, needless to say, is sorely missed in this House. But he will not be forgotten. His commitment to the European ideal lives on in this report to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many calls for and conflicting interpretations of regionalisation and its relevance to the common fisheries policy. This state of affairs arises from the belief among many fishermen that there is a lack of cohesion in the regional application of the common fisheries policy and Community institutions. It has been my consistent opinion that unless greater efforts are made to involve fishermen's organisations in the decision‐making process the best efforts of Community legislators will fail.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, this report draws attention to the potential for an already emergent regionalisation policy within a European context. In doing so it must be recognised that although renationalisation of fishing areas adjacent to EU countries is not an option, there is still an overriding obligation on Community institutions to safeguard the future of fisheries‐dependent communities. Long‐term survival of such communities will depend not just on a legal recognition of their legitimate historical rights safeguarded by the principle of relative stability and the six‐ to twelve‐mile limits but also on a commitment by Parliament to ensure that future European policy reflects the need to facilitate their participation as stakeholders.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of this report is therefore not to discuss whether this regionalisation should be implemented but rather to explore how it can be widened, developed and institutionalised. No one should take the view that this report is to introduce regionalisation immediately. It is an opportunity to debate the issues and to explore how it can all be developed.</p>
<p class="contents">The current common fisheries policy already includes large elements of regional variation and localised cooperation which could be explored more effectively in respect of stock conservation. Examples include the introduction of square mesh legislation. This is now part of my own country's legislation as a direct consequence of initatives by fishermen acting as responsible stakeholders. Other regional examples exist within the Community, such as the French local, regional and national committee systems, illustrating that developed regional management units, involving the industry and the decision‐making process, can lead to a more rational, workable and realistic management system than presently exists.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a wonder that, whilst large sums of European taxpayers' money are spent on largely irrelevant, theoretical, scientific and management studies, no effort is made by either Community scientists or legislators to study fully functional democratic management systems that already exist in the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">In tandem with this report I would hope that Parliament would support my call for studies on existing regional management systems as a matter of priority, with a view to implementing them on a wider scale within Community regions. I refer to the amendments tabled by my colleagues, many of which I can support, and I personally endorse the amendments to extend the limits to 24 miles.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, while I would wish to draw your attention to the socio‐economic implications if we fail to develop a cohesive regionalisation policy in Community fisheries in the very near future, I firmly believe that this report offers a ray of hope for a new departure within the common fisheries policy which will be acceptable to most, if not all, fishermen. I ask the House for its support by voting in favour of this report.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Baldarelli </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, this report is the fruit of a good deal of work by the Committee on Fisheries and follows on from a number of its previous proposals to the House: the reform of the common fisheries policy, the regulations, the own‐initiative report on international agreements and the discussion to be held within the next few months on the structural regulations, the FIFG and the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this will be better organised and implemented if the principle of subsidiarity is paramount, if bureaucratic structures and superstructures are eliminated, and if fishermen can be involved in managing the CFP; after all, this is the very essence of regionalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">When referring to regionalisation, we are thinking of an aspect of the common fisheries policy which exists already. We are not of course thinking of a breach of Community solidarity; on the contrary, the involvement of local policies and active subsidiarity allowing for a local presence will make the reform of the CFP more successful. In this way, it will also be possible to take up useful innovations and to achieve a balance between fisheries and the environment, which is important for the preservation of Community resources, as well as providing worthwhile opportunities for fishing activities aimed at maintaining a balanced environment, such as small‐scale fisheries and the creation of new jobs – which the fisheries sector is of course still in a position to offer, in a Europe where unemployment is so widespread. There is work not only for fishermen but also for other guardians of the sea, for example in aquaculture and handicrafts linked to the marine environment. In the Socialist Group's opinion, it makes sense to call for territorial waters to be extended to 24 miles; this request takes account of the ability to manage marine activities and resources in the coastal zone, and could maximise the involvement of associations.</p>
<p class="contents">The common fisheries policy must take account of the various players operating in the sector. Here we insist, for example, that other players should be brought into the Advisory Committee, without however weakening the participation of certain important parties: the members of the Advisory Committee should comprise not only shipowners and – quite rightly – NGOs and consumers, but also a strong trade union contingent. This is our blueprint for the future, and in this way we shall make a contribution to the future of fisheries.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Provan </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Mr President, it is nice to see the Commissioner here with us tonight as this is a debate the European Parliament can be proud of. The report we are discussing follows logically on from the Fraga report which we discussed in November. The common fisheries policy was devised in 1973 and enacted in 1983, and it was believed at that time that we were setting up a policy for the long‐term future. With hindsight we can recognise that a number of mistakes were made and the common fisheries policy is highly over‐bureaucratised.</p>
<p class="contents">It has failed to protect fish stocks. It has failed to sustain viable fishing communities around the coast. Many of the rules are arbitrary and unfair and abuse is rife. The Gallagher report is therefore a great opportunity for this Parliament. As the rapporteur said, it follows on from the basis set out by Mr Macartney. I agree with his sentiments that Mr Macartney's loss was a tragedy. The alternatives are quite clearly set out in the Gallagher report.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own view we need to reinforce the localisation of the common fisheries policy. We need to make the local communities around the coasts of Europe feel part of the common fisheries policy, a policy which they currently reject. Therefore we have a huge opportunity to get the fishermen involved. We must recognise the fact that the local communities have to be assisted. They must be given the opportunity to look after, to harvest and also to husband the local fish resources. It is essential therefore to extend the 12‐mile limit to 24 miles, to make that economic zone an area within which they can earn a living.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the local fishermen one needs to look after. The 24‐mile area is the one in which they work. If we deny them the opportunity of harvesting their own local resource they are not going to feel fully involved in the common fisheries policy. If they are involved they will police it and will make sure that the long‐term management is in place for future generations. Anybody who really believes in conservation of fish stocks has to be involved in encouraging regionalisation and ensuring that the local fishermen are part of the common fisheries policy and operate it under Community rules.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">McKenna </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – Mr President, regionalisation can mean different things to different people. As the report correctly says, to some it means renationalisation. It can also mean devolution of some aspects of decision‐making to sub‐national areas or managing on the basis of large bodies of water such as the North Sea or parts of the Mediterranean. There are many different meanings.</p>
<p class="contents">While some sort of devolution may in some cases be acceptable or desirable, it must be remembered that fish swim around so management of fisheries must be achieved at an appropriate level. The same level of management authority is not necessarily appropriate for all stocks in a region. For instance, the difficulties in managing highly migratory species such as tuna are completely different from those for harvesting seaweed or some species of shellfish.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem with the Gallagher report is that it does not address these points and simply argues the case for regionalisation. It never defines what is meant by the term or gives any guidelines about what should be regionalised or how. It simply states that there is a need for comprehensive regionalisation of the common fisheries policy. Without a clearer definition of what is meant by this, the Green Group cannot support the report.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Ewing </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span> – Mr President, I rise with mixed emotions today. Allan Macartney was my dear colleague and I am glad that his work is here before us. I am grateful to Mr Gallagher for carrying it on so ably and to the Committee on Fisheries. I am happy that Allan was succeeded by his own close friend and election agent, Ian Hudghton, who will be speaking later.</p>
<p class="contents">I am passionate about this subject as my constituency has many fishing‐dependent communities, including 90 inhabited islands, some of them going almost up to the Arctic Circle. Some of these communities are very fragile and totally dependent on the fishing industry. I have shared with them their despairs and their hopes, their tragedies and their disenchantment with this policy. I have been to sea many times both in calm weather and in gales. One thing I notice is that fishermen have great rapport with fishermen from other parts of the Community and, in fact, of the world. Perhaps if fishermen got together and made policy we would not have so many problems. There would certainly be more fairness and less bureaucracy than hitherto.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to be able to offer a future to all our fishermen. They have to believe they have a future. Many of them do not have that belief at the present time. Mr Gallagher has offered a ray of hope. Amendment No 4 by Mr Provan is very dangerous, as was an answer he gave in a press conference today. Although the regulation comes to an end, the policy does not. We have agreed that the principle of relative stability continues. Any reference to expiry of the common fisheries policy without the addendum is very dangerous.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms McKenna talked about fish being different because they do not stay put like animals in a farmer's field. This is recognised. The CFP was a derogation in itself from the Treaty of Rome. The aims were great. There was to be fairness, maintenance of dependent areas, a traditional way of life, stabilised markets, reasonable prices, relations organised within the Community and with third countries. It was wonderful. Unfortunately, the reality has fallen short. We have neither been able to protect the fishermen, nor the stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I think regionalisation is necessary and I have given examples in Amendment No 24. We are already on the road to regionalisation. There are many examples. I will not read them out but you should all look at Amendment No 24 where you will see positive examples. Discard problems, for example, vary from country to country. If you think of the square mesh which could solve the problem of conservation in many areas, you will see that we are already on the road to a regionalisation policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would question Mr Novo's amendments. He talks about decentralisation as if it is the same thing. I would suggest that regionalisation could affect a whole region involving several states. Ms McKenna mentioned that. It could be the whole North Sea or the whole Mediterranean. Decentralisation suggests a relationship with one Member State only. So, although I admire Mr Novo's work and commitment, I have to say that I will not be supporting his amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I support Mr Teverson's amendments and, obviously, I support my own. I am grateful to Commissioner Bonino who has shown enormous calibre as a very hard‐working, clever Commissioner for Fisheries, and to the Commission, which has arranged numerous places where there will be forums for everyone to get involved. But I go further. I go with Pat the Cope in wanting direct involvement of the fishermen and I support the regional management committees.</p>

These may be in the form of regulatory measures specific to particular sea areas, or conservation measures particular to certain fishing regions, ICES areas or sub‐areas. There are also restrictions affecting particular species and specific fishing grounds, involving various restrictions with regard to access to the waters or the halting of fishing during certain periods, varied regional regulatory measures decided by the Member States under the principle of subsidiarity, and urgent measures on conservation of resources taken on the initiative of the Commission.</p>

If by ‘regionalisation" we mean ‘decentralisation", that is with global decisions being centralised at national level by each Member State, particularly in planning and fleet management, and the delocalised application of those decisions, we are of course in favour of a certain degree of regionalisation of the CFP. If, on the other hand, by ‘regionalisation" we mean a transfer of decisions from national level to the administrative regions, we are opposed to it.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of subsidiarity must be correctly applied. Although the Commission"s task is to define general objectives, it should in no way lay down the decisions through which those objectives should be achieved. It is at national level that coherence should be defined for land management, coastal management and maintaining a balance between the various types of fishing – inshore fishing, high‐sea fishing, deep‐sea fishing – and, moreover, the regions have no desire to take the place of the national authorities on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Boats from home ports in different administrative regions may in fact fish in the same areas. In this case, if different or even contradictory decisions were taken by different regional authorities, that could have damaging effects by causing the relocation of fishing boats or reducing the level of monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore essential, given that the territorial administrative region and the regional fishing area often do not coincide, to establish a clear system that is coordinated by the national authorities. The regional authorities, meanwhile, are in a better position to implement, in a decentralised manner, both structural measures and measures linked to the marketing of fishery products.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, our group will vote in favour of the amendments which aim to encourage the development of a decentralised policy rather than an actual regionalisation of the CFP. We will reject all of the amendments and articles of the resolution which seek to transfer decisions which should remain at national level to the administrative regions, and we also reject the amendments which seek to alter the six and twelve mile zones. We know the position of certain Member States on the Boxes, but we do not think that this resolution should aim to alter the regulatory bases of the CFP. It can only deal with the functioning and organisation of the CFP.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group will closely follow the development of the vote and will vote in favour of the resolution if national prerogatives with regard to decisions on the implementation of the CFP are preserved. Under no circumstances do we want the development of the application of the CFP to lead to the role of regional administrations being strengthened to the detriment of the role of national administrations. However, we believe that the elements of regionalisation in the current CFP, which I pointed out at the beginning of my speech, should be applied further, in order to respond in the best way, and in line with real needs, to the different characteristics, both in terms of fishery resources and in structural terms, of the various areas of production which constitute the fishing zones.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Gallagher on his work and to take my turn in recalling the memory of our former colleague Mr Macartney, who initiated this report on the regionalisation of the CFP.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Paisley </span> <span class="bold">(NI).</span> – Mr President, I would like to associate myself with the remarks of other Members of the House about the colleague of the lady from Scotland who has just spoken. She knows how I feel about this matter personally. I am glad that Mr Macartney's influence in the committee lives on tonight and that we can help to achieve his goals.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind this House that early in the 1990s the Commission initiated a report on Northern Ireland fisheries. It found that in the three large harbours which carry on the fishing endeavour – and I refer to Kilkeel, Ardglass and Portavogie – all the fishing is carried on within a family system. The percentage of people outside the families who work in the industry is very small indeed. So the life of these communities rests in a proper appraisal of their needs and their voice needs to be heard.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I like this report. It believes that fishermen's support for fisheries regulations will improve by involving the local fishery organisations in the decision‐making process. What is wrong with that? That is what we need. We need the contribution of these people whose livelihoods are at stake. The fishermen will not find a regime legitimate unless they are able to make a contribution and their voice is heard. This whole programme can be made more acceptable if this happens.</p>
<p class="contents">Northern Ireland is an Objective 1 area but this will possibly come to an end. What will happen to the system today that is geared into decommissioning fishing boats when we no longer receive Objective 1 funds? Will we see to it that these little communities – and they are tiny compared with the big fishing industries of the rest of the Community but vital to us all – are safeguarded? Those are the matters which really concern the fishermen of Northern Ireland.</p>

It is not only regional or coast‐based; it is that too, but not only that. I am in broad agreement with the rapporteur, in that we must be sure not to lapse into romanticism, because fishing has changed and that is what we should be addressing. We cannot turn back the clock and dwell on the good old days. I would therefore also like to comment on the 24 nautical miles question. Mrs McKenna mentioned that fish swim around; they may spawn in one area and be caught in another. If we start to be restrictive towards one another, we do not have a common fisheries policy, because what is the use of fish spawning in our area if we are not allowed to catch them ourselves? Some cooperation and exchange of quotas are therefore necessary. I am also a little sceptical about what Mr Souchet said regarding the national level. We could talk instead about regional cooperation between several countries. We have really good experience of that in the Baltic. As regards over‐bureaucratisation, which was mentioned earlier, we must aim for self‐management and taking influence on our own situation. When people have responsibility, they can help in bringing their own situation under control, and that works against bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We have reasonable cooperation in most places. In this connection I must not forget to thank Allan, with whom I worked in the North Sea Commission, precisely on these matters. Even though we have good rules, national exemptions may mean that a 100‐tonne trawler with a rating of 1000 hp can suddenly turn up, roll out a net the size of a football pitch and simply clean out a sea. When there are two such trawlers in the Baltic, it hardly matters whether or not we have self‐management and regionalisation. Two trawlers based in the North Sea can make life difficult for 50 small fishermen. Regionalisation therefore means self‐management, responsibility and active participation. That demands something from us in the European Parliament, but at national level too.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">McCartin</span> <span class="bold"> (PPE).</span> – Mr President, I want to thank Mr Gallagher for taking over this report from Mr Macartney and for doing an excellent job in maintaining the concern and knowledge which Mr Macartney brought to the subject and his particular feeling for the industry and the people engaged in it. Mr Gallagher has the same qualifications as he comes from the same sort of region and has the same sort of experience of the fishing industry.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to recognise that there is a repair job to be done so far as the common fisheries policy is concerned. When European farmers demonstrate in the streets about the common agricultural policy, it is not because they are against the policy but because they fear that they may be deprived of it. But fishermen, generally speaking, do not appreciate what we and the Commissioner have been trying to do on their behalf. We have to recognise that there is a sort of mutual misunderstanding in fishing ports throughout the European Union. Everybody believes that everybody else has a better deal.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it is important to break new ground, to offer fishermen the hope of greater participation than they had in the past. If we cannot achieve that we will not bring it home to them that the fight is about their livelihood. The fight is about preserving the resources they have and protecting the regions they live in. That is not always clear to them. I spent Sunday evening in Donegal. I met a lot of fishermen and generally speaking they were very unhappy people. If it was not the weather, it was quotas or bad prices. There are so many problems that they feel it is out of their hands.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal by Mr Gallagher is to reinvolve them. By no means do we want to tell fishermen that we are offering them anything like a renationalisation or that we are removing the common fisheries policy. What we want to do is get the regions and the communities involved in the design of the policy and updating on a regular basis. I welcome this report and I look forward to the discussion that will follow and the eventual policy we can redesign around those proposals.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hudghton </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span> – Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Gallagher and other speakers for their generous tributes to my predecessor, the late Dr Allan Macartney. He initially drafted this report to contribute to the current Europe‐wide assessment of the achievements and failures of the CFP. In September last year Mr Gallagher kindly agreed to take over responsibility for this report and I should like to put on record my appreciation of his efforts in steering it through the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The original draft was based on the premise that the common fisheries policy is, and from its inception has been, partially regionalised. The draft looked at how more local involvement in resource management and conservation measures might best be achieved and called for the existing regionalisation to be consolidated and expanded through the creation of regional management units. Like Allan Macartney, I firmly believe that bringing the decision‐making process closer to those who are most affected by the CFP and are responsible for its implementation would lead to more respect for the provisions of the CFP and for a more successful policy <span class="italic">per se</span> . I would therefore like to call for greater involvement of fishermen and the fishing industry as a whole as an essential prerequisite to the success of the CFP.</p>
<p class="contents">Complementary to involving the fishing industry in the decision‐making process is the need to heed the concerns of the fishing industry as a whole under the banner of regionalisation. The causal link between the fish caught in a given region and the industry it supports within that region can be easily undermined. This was brought home to me last week when I met with fish processors based in my constituency. They expressed concern that fish caught in that region are not always landed there. Therefore, essential jobs in the processing industries in what are clearly fisheries‐dependent areas are put at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, I should like to stress the importance of Article 12 of the resolution. The time has come to consolidate what <span class="italic">de facto</span> exists and to expand the principle of regionalisation of the CFP to all Community waters. This step is necessary if we are genuinely to involve fishermen in the decisions which affect them and offers the only clear and practical means of recognising the unique variables that exist in the fisheries sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in no doubt that regionalisation would further the primary goal of conserving fish stocks through sustainable fishing so vital for the fisheries‐dependent communities of Europe. At the committee stage Mrs Ewing and I successfully tabled a number of amendments to ensure that the fundamental principles of the CFP such as relative stability are not undermined. My group has now tabled amendments which complement the consistent regionalisation of the CFP and ultimately will help to secure a successful future for the policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Regionalisation already exists, albeit in an ad hoc and inconsistent manner. These amendments address that anomaly and stress the importance of involving the fishing industry within the Advisory Committee on Fisheries. I would urge the House to support these amendments and the report as a whole.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">McMahon</span> <span class="bold"> (PSE).</span> – Mr President, I welcome Mr Gallagher's report. It highlights two possible approaches in the reform of the CFP after 2002: an intra‐state approach, devolving responsibility to regions within Member States; and an inter‐state approach where Community waters are divided into regions with a devolved management structure.</p>
<p class="contents">About a year ago the Commission sent out a questionnaire to all Member States and organisations throughout Europe, to people in the industry, consumers, processors and others. The Commission held hearings in various locations throughout Europe. A summary of the findings revealed that most expressed the great desire for decentralisation and regionalisation. So this is what the fishing industry throughout the European Union wants.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my belief that the principle of decentralisation and regionalisation, coupled with relative stability, must form the cornerstone of any future reform of the CFP. The concept of relative stability was enshrined in the 1983 agreement and strengthened by the extension of the coastal bans to 12 miles. Indeed, I support Mr Provan's amendment to extend the coastal bans further. It is important that communities such as North‐East Scotland, the Western Isles, Donegal, Cornwall, Galicia and Brittany are protected from the over‐exploitation of fish stocks. It is important, therefore, that the European Union sets down various principles with regard to exploitation and conservation. There must be a stronger commitment within that policy of devolving fisheries policy. Regionalisation of the CFP will encourage the active involvement of fishermen in decision‐making as well as the participation of producers' organisations at local level.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I support Mr Gallagher's call for regionalisation of the European fisheries policy which is necessary if we are to remedy the current deficiencies of the CFP. Any reform, however, must retain the principle of relative stability which will best serve the interests of fishermen and the marine environment alike.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fraga Estévez </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, in the context of the necessary evolution of the common fisheries policy, changes should never be rejected outright simply out of fear of the unknown. I believe it is true to say therefore that changes leading to the sector becoming more actively involved in decision‐making and to better implementation of the principle of subsidiarity are fully supported by Parliament. However, such features are not yet defining characteristics of the common fisheries policy though we would like them to be.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing all this in mind, the imposition of a system of regionalisation as proposed in the report – through the creation of regional management units whose composition and responsibilities are not specified – does appear to be a leap in the dark. It is bound to hinder the process of bringing the common fisheries policy closer to those most directly affected by it, given the lack of a consensus and of the consideration needed before taking such a significant step.</p>
<p class="contents">Before even beginning to consider the form regionalisation could take, we should establish channels of communication with the sector and set in motion a decentralisation process reaching down to regional level. Many Member States do not even have the appropriate instruments for doing so, as many national governments have not devolved the administration of fisheries to the regions. Indeed, according to the replies to the questionnaires sent out by the Commission concerning the review of the common fisheries policy, the sector itself does not support the need for regionalisation, the only exception being the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the request to extend territorial waters to 24 miles is also supported only by a minority. Any decision of this nature would involve significant changes in the status of the fleets and ought to be considered in the wider context of the review of the common fisheries policy. Indeed, even the details of this are unclear, as the figures of 24, 35 and 50 miles are all quoted when the review of the common fisheries policy is discussed. I am therefore opposed to Amendments Nos 6 and 20.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the experts who looked at regionalisation on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries have stated that regionalisation would involve substantial changes to the principle of relative stability. Yet many Members who support such regionalisation are opposed to the modification of this principle, and I would be grateful if they could explain this to me. In addition, it would be necessary to redefine the balance between coastal and industrial fleets. This would call for a system of compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure I have said enough to make it clear that in its present form the proposal for regionalisation is far from being a practical solution. Much more work and thought are called for if the idea is not to be stillborn. It only remains for me to thank Mr Gallagher for his work and to thank all Members present today.</p>

I offer him special congratulations on this report, despite disagreeing with it myself. Although he was not originally the rapporteur, Mr Gallagher was called upon to take charge of this report. In this context, it is appropriate to pay tribute again to the memory of our colleague Allan Macartney.</p>
<p class="contents">It is becoming abundantly clear in this debate that the term ‘regionalisation" does not have a clear meaning. What does regionalisation involve? I think we should reach a consensus on what we understand by regionalisation of the common fisheries policy before discussing it. The terms ‘regions" and ‘regionalisation" have widely differing meanings in the 15 Member States, and carrying these differences through into an area like fisheries and the common fisheries policy means that, in my opinion, the report lacks clarity. I would even go so far as to say that it is contradictory and that it sheds very little light on fisheries and on the future common fisheries policy, where light is sorely needed.</p>
<p class="contents">A process of decentralisation which involves greater participation and transparency has to be welcomed. It must, however, be carried out within the global framework of a common policy which respects the principles of equality and nondiscrimination and which is compatible with the fundamental principles of freedom of movement within the single market enshrined in the Treaty. The needs of fishing‐dependent communities should not be confused with covert renationalisation through regionalisation. Such a move would represent an attack on the global nature of a common policy. Participation in Community decision‐making certainly ought to be improved. However, this should not be at the cost of fragmenting the CFP with regional decisions, thus increasing bureaucracy and weakening the guarantees of impartiality in the decision‐making process.</p>
<p class="contents">Any review of the common fisheries policy must allow this sector to finally become part of the Community"s economy and should naturally take into account the need to continue defending coastal fishing and fishing‐dependent communities. The <span class="italic">status quo</span> needs to be maintained and there should be no extension of the coastal areas, contrary to what a number of amendments suggest.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, we do not feel that the report before us today is appropriate.</p>

I would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to our former colleague, the late Allan Macartney, who was a great Member of Parliament and a great friend.</p>
<p class="contents">Experience has shown that the fisheries sector is plagued by conflicts between fishing communities about access to fisheries resources, and above all conflicts between fishing communities in neighbouring countries. In order to keep such conflicts to a minimum, the common fisheries policy has always reserved a fixed area of the EU Member States' territorial sea for fishing by local communities. This limit was set at six miles in 1972, and was subsequently increased to 12 miles in 1983, under the present common fisheries policy regulation. However, that regulation expires on 31 December 2002, so that if nothing is done, the principles of the single market will apply, in other words there will be unrestricted access to fisheries resources in all EU waters. This would of course have a very negative impact on fisheries, especially small‐scale fishing, which has a very important economic and social function in many Member States, not least in my own, Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, it is essential to ensure that the principle of relative stability is adhered to and that the fishing areas reserved exclusively for national or local communities are not just maintained, but also extended. For the same reason, I have joined James Provan and other colleagues in tabling seven amendments to the Gallagher report to ensure that this principle of relative stability is safeguarded as of now and to start to have a more active influence on the negotiations on post−2002 common fisheries policy, with a view to extending the 12‐mile area for national and local fishermen to 24 miles.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would also like to say that as far as we are concerned, decentralisation is not a route to renationalisation: decentralisation simply means greater decentralisation and flexibility, or, in other words, greater accountability and efficiency.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bonino, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (IT)</span> Mr President, I wish to begin, on behalf of the Commission and in my personal capacity, by echoing the words of sorrow and grief over the loss of your colleague, Allan Macartney, not without recalling that – when I was much younger and a Member of this House – Mr Macartney and I belonged to the same group. I would therefore echo your words both on behalf of the Commission and personally.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say, ladies and gentlemen, that whenever we discuss fisheries – indeed, we have become a ‘friends of fisheries' group, always more or less the same people – it is my impression that some of you think, or at least your words imply, that the fisheries sector once experienced a glorious and splendid heyday. I am something of a novice, having dealt with this sector for only four years, but none of the books or publications I have read on the fishing industry in former times refer to that golden age: the sector has always had an extremely tough existence, particularly at certain moments, constantly struggling to preserve the balance between extraction and resources. From this point of view, I believe that the Commission has proved very attentive and very open to suggestions from various quarters – Parliament, the Advisory Committee and also the sector itself – in an attempt to improve the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I have studied the Gallagher report carefully from this perspective, and I wish in all honesty to make two points: firstly, as you know, wide‐ranging consultations are under way for the reform of the common fisheries policy in 2002. We took pains to launch these consultations well in advance, so as to allow ample time for the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Not all the questionnaires have been returned, but judging by the overwhelming majority of those which have reached the Commission and are now being evaluated, only part of the sector in both the UK and Ireland favours this type of proposal. Indeed, Mrs McKenna is right on one point: we should first be clearer about what we mean, or what you mean, by regionalisation, and how exactly it differs from decentralisation – which entails greater transparency and greater involvement – and, above all, how the fundamental principle of relative stability, which many of you have stressed today, can be reconciled with regionalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this report is an important and useful contribution to the debate. Tomorrow morning, I shall be putting my proposed reforms to the Advisory Committee on Fisheries, but I would assure you that the present common policy already contains some very strong regional elements: for example, the regional MGPs and the whole section relating to regional cooperation and meetings. In short, a whole range of initiatives can be expanded on.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point which I would draw to the House"s attention – and this is why I say that further consideration is required – is a problem concerning the Treaty. While this report does not establish clearly what the Commission's role would be, there would undoubtedly be some difficulty at the final stage, that of the Council of Ministers, the 15 EU ministers. In my opinion, that stage cannot be seen merely as a rubber‐stamping of decisions taken in the regions or by regional organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we shall continue to discuss this issue with one another, because I am sometimes aware of two overlapping elements: decentralisation – the proper application of subsidiarity, with greater involvement of local communities – which is very necessary, and regionalisation, which I think deserves much more investigation, since certain problems cannot be solved at regional level. I should therefore not like us to select the wrong approach and to devise radical reforms without having studied them in great detail.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we shall be able to carry forward these ideas together, in order to make the necessary reforms to the common fisheries policy after having examined them in a little more depth.</p>
