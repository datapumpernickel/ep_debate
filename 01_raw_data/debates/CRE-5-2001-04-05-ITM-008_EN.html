I can greet the Commission but I cannot greet the Council whose absence I deplore when this resolution on human rights in China is primarily addressed to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to tell the Council, or whoever is reporting to the absent Council, what a failure, not to say disaster, the EU’s China policy has been. We all know there are growing social and political contradictions in that country. The risk of explosion is imminent and we can all imagine the disaster that will represent in a country the size of China, not only in regional terms, but also in world terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Our duty as elected representatives and citizens is to make the Chinese leaders, legal, yes, but certainly not legitimate, understand that only democracy and the rule of law can guarantee stability not just in China itself but also in the whole of the Asian continent.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is our duty to remind the Council, and the Commission where it is appropriate – that the right way to bring the Chinese Government round to the basic principles of democracy and the state of law, is this resolution tabled by the United States due to be voted on in the next few days by the Human Rights Commission in Geneva. It is our duty to remind the Council that the European Union cannot continue to take a hypocritical stance and that it must support this resolution, sponsor it and work actively in the Human Rights Commission for its adoption.</p>
<p class="contents">Without intending to be either anti-Chinese or pro-Chinese, I repeat that China is a fundamental country in a regional and continental context where Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia and many other countries are experiencing enormous problems, and where Vietnam and Laos too are still ruled by a one-party regime. China can play a fundamental role providing it finally adopts a democratic system based on the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what we must make clear to the Chinese leaders. We have two goals: democracy for the Chinese, the Tibetans, the Uigurs and the Mongols, and the stability of the entire continent of Asia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I feel that if the countries of the European Union stick by their decision not to sign the resolution on human rights in China, that would only be confirmation of that inability. There is absolutely no reason, other than hypocrisy and defeatism, why we should not sign this resolution, for in not doing so we are not achieving anything at all that could justify taking this standpoint on a subject upon which there is such wide consensus from our public.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, our resolution – which is not the first and, I believe and fear, will not be the last – seeks to make the Council change its mind, thereby ensuring that, at least at the level of condemnation from the civilised world, this time, China gets what it deserves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a matter which should be resolved with great urgency by the Chinese authorities before its consequences spiral out of control. The US Administration has expressed its regret, which we share, particularly over the loss of a Chinese fighter pilot, but now is the moment to bring this matter to an end by releasing the American aircrew and enabling recovery of the American aircraft. Otherwise this matter will become a running sore, poisoning international relations at a very sensitive time.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chinese Government seems anxious to play a fuller part in the international community, particularly in terms of economic development and eventual membership of the WTO. But it has not yet realised the need to adjust attitudes in other areas or recognise that political confrontation needs to be replaced by a more conciliatory approach. This applies not just in the field of international relations, but in terms of domestic policy as well.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be an enormous leap forward when we no longer have to table resolutions on human rights abuses in China but we see very little progress being made and the catalogue of abuses continues to expand. The Falun Gong movement is violently suppressed and some 80 of its members are reported to have died in custody in China in the past 18 months. The sustained violence and intimidation against Tibetan Buddhists is little short of a programme of ethnic cleansing. A great country like China is surely sufficiently robust and forward-looking that it can give real freedom to all the peoples living under its authority. It must show that it recognises the individual humanity of its citizens and will exercise the duty of good government by providing protection for all under the rule of law. We urge the Council and the Member States to take strong note of the likely resolution of this Parliament and to support the resolution of the United States at the UN Commission in Geneva deploring the state of human rights in China. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even setting aside this event, reports from China are, nevertheless, pouring in thick and fast. They almost always concern acts of cruelty against its own citizens. Commentators the world over are agreed that the human rights situation in China is becoming worse and worse. We are talking here about the situation in Tibet and Sinkiang and about the widespread increase in the torture and persecution of dissidents, active trade unionists and representatives of democracy. We are talking about the frequent use of the death penalty and the opposition mounted against freedom of expression on the Internet. We are talking, in particular, about the arrest, torture and persecution of Falun Gong practitioners. The Chinese régime’s objective of breaking this movement will not succeed. The persecutions must therefore be halted immediately and a dialogue entered into.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament agrees about the situation in China. I know that the Commission shares this view, and Commissioner Patten has defended human rights in China several times in this Chamber. The world’s most populous country is systematically violating its citizens’ rights. Europe cannot remain silent and watch this happen. The signals coming from the Council are, however, conflicting and hypocritical and help weaken the international struggle to get the Chinese régime to change its policy. This lack of unity benefits none other than the Chinese régime, and at the expense of the Chinese people. The Council <span class="italic">must</span> therefore get its act together and show that all the talk about unity is not just idle chatter but can also be expressed in action. It must also support the resolution against China in Geneva in a couple of weeks’ time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We had also asked for this earlier in the European Parliament. But we did not get that far. We are not too keen ourselves on co-sponsoring with the United States, and would have preferred to have our own European position. We will be voting in favour of the resolution because, ultimately, we are naturally all agreed on the human rights situation in China. That is why we are delighted about the fact that the European Member States have decided in the Council to vote jointly for a resolution after all, if it is submitted. Apparently, it is not up to us to submit this resolution, but if the United States submits one, then we can support it. That is an advance on last year, when the Member States were still divided. Although he cannot speak on behalf of the Council, maybe Mr Lamy can give us this information here.</p>
<p class="contents">The exciting thing for both Europe and China is, of course, that we have an incredibly strong financial market. We need a sound human rights policy to match. Foreign policy and the economy must be consistent and, in a completely different way, this also applies to China. China is extremely generous when it comes to giving free rein to economic processes. At the same time, the country is incredibly oppressive and dictatorial in its political policy. This will, of course, generate impossible tensions, fundamental also in terms of human rights. They sign international conventions, which they struggle to implement and then contravene. It would be extremely positive if we could encourage all those powers in China which inject more consistency into the fabric. Any partnership which we as Europe can enter into with China in this respect is very welcome. At the same time, we must continue to speak in clear terms on human rights and condemn as and when appropriate. That is why this resolution is so pertinent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, the Commission is examining the problem in depth and we share many of the concerns which have just been voiced. Broadly speaking, our position can be summarised as follows.</p>
<p class="contents">The living conditions of the bulk of the Chinese population have improved over the last twenty years as economic reform and liberalisation have given citizens a certain degree of economic and social freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately – and I do stress unfortunately – the same cannot be said of civil and political rights, and the human rights situation still falls considerably short of the commitments that China has entered into internationally.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, back in 1996 we set up a bilateral dialogue with China, which provides a suitable forum for frank exchanges of views which I can bear witness to, having attended the last summit meeting between China and the European Union during the French Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of positive signs have emerged, such as the ratification of the UN Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights on 28 February and the signing, last November, of the outline agreement with the UN High Commission for Human Rights which, we hope, will now be implemented. We are clearly concerned, however, to see more tangible results on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">Our main preoccupations are the same as yours, the continued persecution of political dissidents, the restrictions imposed on religious freedom, the application of the death penalty, the ratification of the UN covenants and their implementation, especially as regards political and civil rights, the treatment of ethnic minorities, arbitrary detention and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the United Nations is concerned, during the General Affairs Council meeting on 19 March, we decided to back the resolution on China tabled by the United States within the Human Rights Commission in Geneva, should that resolution be put to the vote.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agreed that the European Members of the Human Rights Commission would vote against any non-action motion that is tabled and would lobby to ensure the other members did the same. We feel that the very notion of non-action is totally opposed to the spirit of dialogue that we have tried to establish. We restated our position in Geneva on 29 March that we take the issue of the violation of human rights seriously wherever it occurs in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the question of co-sponsoring the resolution, we feel that the dialogue on human rights between the European Union and China is a privileged channel of communication working to improve the situation in the many spheres of concern to us. This is in fact the position which was endorsed by the Council, because we feel that it may have a positive impact.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards this year’s decision, namely that we will support a motion for a resolution which we do not co-sponsor, this does not mean to say that we rule out the possibility of returning to this mechanism at a later date. Dialogue is clearly an acceptable option only if it leads to progress on the ground. This is the position which was adopted in January on the EU-China dialogue and in the conclusions of the General Affairs Council meeting on 19 March. We will therefore support this resolution if it is put to the vote. We will not co-sponsor it since we think that direct dialogue still has potential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
