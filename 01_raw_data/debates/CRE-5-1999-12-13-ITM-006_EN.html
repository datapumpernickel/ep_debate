<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Busk (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span><span class="bold">.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, the aim of the current Commission proposal is to bring Community legislation into line with the recommendations adopted by NEAFC in 1998. In this way, earlier measures will be incorporated into a comprehensive and reinforced new control scheme designed to ensure respect for the conservation and management policy agreed under the Convention. The proposal has two main objectives: firstly, a scheme of control and enforcement is to be established for the Contracting Parties; and, secondly, a programme promoting compliance by non-Contracting Party vessels with NEAFC’s regulations is to be carried out. The recommendations are reminiscent of the rules which are applied within the organisation governing fisheries in the north-west Atlantic, NAFO. Through consultation and cooperation, NAFO contributes to the optimum utilisation, rational management and conservation of the fisheries resources within this Convention Area. The Commission has tabled a proposal for converting NEAFC’s recommendations into Community legislation which, in a simplified and coherent way, incorporates all the acquired experience from NAFO and is in keeping with Parliament’s previous position. </p>
<p class="contents">The proposal has two aspects to it which ought to be emphasised. First of all, the implementation of Community policy. The present proposal contains only the general guidelines for the Community’s initiatives in this area. It was left to the Commission to adopt the technical aspects after having submitted these to a Management Committee. Nevertheless, the Commission may be assured that Parliament will closely monitor decisions taken under this procedure, and it will in particular ensure that the same methods for the reporting of catches and fishing effort are applied by all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the financial burden. When it comes to distributing this, the Commission believes that it is up to the Member States to provide adequate resources to meet their obligations of control within NEAFC. I would again draw a parallel with NAFO, where inspection and control are funded from the Community budget. I should like to see increased Community involvement in inspection and control in order to ensure that the rules are applied even-handedly. Openness and fairness are vital elements in obtaining fishermen’s support, and it is only through obtaining their support that any reinforcement of inspection and control arrangements will really be effective. </p>
<p class="contents">Increased Community involvement in the future will naturally have budgetary implications and demand a reallocation of resources. This ought not however to deflect the Commission from taking the lead in pressing for change or to deter the European Parliament from calling upon the Commission to do so. Provided that the appropriate increased financial resources are made available, there is no reason why the Community cannot play a much more active role. </p>
<p class="contents">The recommendations came into force on 1 July 1999. They were therefore already binding on the Community before the Commission tabled its proposal on 12 July 1999. The European Parliament has not therefore had the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate, and I should like, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, to criticise the Commission for this. This is an outrageous way of going on, to use one of the words employed during the debate in the Committee on Fisheries. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to emphasise the importance of informing the fishing industry of the purpose of the proposal and of making it clear that the rules are to the industry’s advantage. Despite the aforementioned reservations and criticism about the timing of the Commission’s proposal, this important legislation should be approved by Parliament without delay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Busk is a very sensible member of the Fisheries Committee and I think that Parliament can have confidence in his report.</p>
<p class="contents">While I have no hesitation in supporting this important legislation and recommending that it should be improved by Parliament without delay, I nevertheless have two brief comments I would like to make.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all the Fisheries Committee was presented with a <span class="italic">fait accompli</span> by the Commission in respect of this proposal. These regulations actually came into force on 1 July this year, although the Commission tabled the proposals before this Parliament on 12 July. We were therefore left in a position where we had no alternative but to support the proposals. I find this behaviour extraordinary. I recall Commissioner Fischler stating during his hearing before the Fisheries Committee on 30 August that he wished to cooperate closely with Parliament and the standing committees of Parliament in a working partnership. I hope that such a working partnership will indeed manifest itself in future and that we will not again be treated in such a cavalier fashion by the Commission. We are the democratically elected representatives of the people of the European Community and we are not here simply to act as a rubber stamp for regulations that have already been implemented by the Commission in advance of consultation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, although I do not intend to recommend that we vote against Mr Busk's report, I feel it is worth sounding a note of caution that the rapporteur has called for more Community financial involvement in inspection and control of fisheries. Such involvement implies additional budget resources and, as my colleagues on the Committee on Budgets never cease to point out, the cake is limited in size so that every time we cut off another slice it means less for some other equally important sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Only last week, in the context of the report by Carmen Fraga Estévez on the common organisation of the market in fisheries and aquaculture products, this House voted to allocate subsidies to the aquaculture industry for the first time, once again eating into the limited fisheries budget. We must be financially realistic and prudent and I trust that the House will note my concern at this latest threatened raid on the fisheries budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All the States, including Russia and Norway therefore, have committed themselves in this Commission not only to multilateral cooperation but also to obeying a common code. This is based, amongst other things, on technical data recommended by ICES, the scientific organisation, and now Russia and Norway want to break away and, on the basis of a bilateral agreement, fish possibly three to four times the quantity recommended by the scientists. This is incredible! Whenever anything connected with the misuse of resources has gone wrong in the EU in the past, we have always looked admiringly at the Norwegians and their fisheries management, but now we see that the Norwegians are no different from anybody else.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why this report by Mr Busk is so important. It is about a significant legal instrument which seeks to establish a coherent and permanent system of control measures involving all contracting parties in the areas mentioned. The experience of the fisheries commissions in the north-east and north-west Atlantic must be transferred into EU Community law. The EU can be the forerunner here. Is it? Can it sharpen its image as a driving force? If so it would be well on the way to marketing itself and its policy better than in the past. This is precisely what Commissioner Fischler has in mind; he is calling in general for an improved marketing strategy in the fisheries sector. Control measures at EU level and at Member State level need to be balanced out. This buck-passing game has to stop! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For that reason there is not very much left to say. My colleague Mr Stevenson has been complaining bitterly about the fact that we are dealing with something that is already in effect. Nevertheless, he was not here in the last Parliament and when he has been here as long as I have he will learn to have a little bit more patience. It was a particularly bad season for the Commission and a particularly difficult time to proceed through all the normal channels since we had elections, Commission difficulties, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, I am impressed by the quality of the legislation and by the fact that this is the way to solve problems internationally, that everybody sits down and makes agreements. But, of course, if the Commission, representing all of us in ensuring that this agreement is put into good effect, does not have any resources to do it with, then we are back to the original situation as far as the Member States are concerned. Nobody has absolute confidence that anybody else is carrying out the supervision and enforcing the law as they should and we will end up in the same situation with this agreement. If we do not agree, having adopted common policies, to give ourselves the resources to ensure that these policies are put into effect, then we are really stretching ourselves too far and we are only bringing the Community and its laws and regulations into disrepute. That is the major reservation that I have about what we are proposing here tonight. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the area of control, the NEAFC scheme provides a model, based on the terms of the agreement on straddling stocks and highly migratory fish, or New York Agreement. It is a model which concords broadly with the viewpoints defended by the Community in the context of this agreement. The measures on the conservation of fish stocks and the monitoring of fishing activities must be dealt with in agreements signed in the framework of regional fishing organisations, and these organisations must serve as a platform for international cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community has contributed actively to the preparation of the NEAFC scheme of control. The measures laid down are totally compatible with our point of view and our priorities regarding the improvement of the monitoring of high seas fishing activities.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, it is of the utmost importance that the conditions of the NEAFC scheme of control should be integrated into Community legislation. The Community must strive to ensure the success of this scheme of control, which will then serve as a model for other regional organisations, and the support which Parliament has given this proposal shows that, in this field as in others, as you know, Mr President, we share the same point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">The matter of financing and the distribution of financial burdens must be the subject of a debate in the wider context of the regional fishing organisations. In order to bring about a debate of this kind, Mr Fischler sent you a communication on Community participation in regional fishing organisations, and this was also sent to the Council. And Mr Fischler wishes to take part in the debate to be held on these points at the appropriate time, at some time next year. On the basis of the conclusions which will be drawn from this wide-ranging debate, the Commission will then present fresh proposals, on which Parliament will be invited to give its opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Stevenson made a very pertinent comment, Mr President, and I have to say that the Commission acknowledges the criticism which has been levelled against it. The fact is, however, that his remarks were directed not at the Prodi Commission but at their predecessors, and I must point out, on behalf of Commissioner Fischler, that we shall be doing all we can to ensure that such criticism is not justified in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
