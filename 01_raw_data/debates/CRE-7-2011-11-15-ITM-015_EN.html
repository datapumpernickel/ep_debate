The Council acknowledges, too, that it is precisely because of the crisis and its many aspects that it is more important than ever to keep to the commitment we have made to meet the target of giving 0.7% of gross national income in official development assistance, or ODA, by 2015. The European Council reaffirmed this in June 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it cannot be denied that donor countries have also been hard-hit by the global situation – the crisis – and that this is forcing often drastic budgetary restrictions in the economies of developed countries too, including the economies of the Member States. We are feeling the effects of the crisis, and we are talking about it in a number of European forums. We have to realise that without making major efforts, we will perhaps not manage to achieve the collective targets for development assistance and development cooperation. In this situation, it is all the more important that our citizens understand why development policy and the budgetary resources associated with this are so important. In this regard, we welcome the Commission communication on increasing the impact of EU development policy: an agenda for change. It has been published at the right time. The Council would like to hold a debate as quickly as possible on appropriate fiscal and monetary policy – policy which would mean that money given as aid is spent effectively, brings the best possible results, has greater impact and is used in a way which encourages further funding for development.</p>
<p class="contents">Mention should be made, here, of the conference soon to be held in Busan on this very subject – effectiveness in development cooperation – something which is so important, particularly to donors such as the EU. In May 2012, we expect the Council will adopt conclusions on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the difficulties and challenges of last year and this year, in 2010, collective EU ODA amounted to EUR 53.8 billion, and this is more than ever before. I cannot agree with those who present the situation from one side only – the negative side. We have made significant progress towards achieving our ODA targets. I would like to stress once again that this is the largest amount of ODA we have ever been able to give.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union remains by far the world’s largest donor of ODA. Over the period from 2004 to 2010, the EU and its Member States provided over half of all ODA given to developing countries. We should be proud of this. Despite the global financial and economic crisis over the past years, most Member States have been able to increase their ODA spending. More Member States are coming close to joining the group of donors which give 0.7% of gross national income in ODA.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind that each Member State decides its own level of ODA spending, in the first annual report to the European Council on EU development aid targets, the Council invited the Member States to take realistic, verifiable actions for meeting individual ODA commitments by 2015 and to share information on these actions and their planned ODA spending for the next budgetary year, as well as on their intentions for the remaining period until 2015. ODA will continue to play an essential role, including as a complement to, and catalyst of, other sources of financing for development. However it is not restricted only to additional funding and support for development. This is why implementation of all parts of the Monterrey Consensus is so important – all of the parts, not just those which concern financial commitments. The Council will continue to take a comprehensive approach to the question of development. ODA alone will not be enough. We must mobilise development financing from all possible sources and guarantee the effectiveness of our aid, including by democratic scrutiny of the use of aid, in order to fight poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Andris Piebalgs, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, honourable Members, honourable Minister Stanowski, I would like to thank Ms Striffler and the Development Committee for this timely question.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission relies on the confirmation by all the EU Heads of State or Government at the June 2011 European Council that they plan and are committed to achieve the 0.7% aid targets by 2015. The ambitious EU commitment to the 0.7% ODA target is a strong indicator of our resolve in helping the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As this collective target is based on the individual commitments by Member States, the EU Union collective Official Development Aid level depends on the individual budgetary decisions by all EU Member States. I really believe that they will stand by their words despite the complicated economic climate in the EU. The European Commission will continue strongly to call on all Member States to respect their commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">I admit that the EU has fallen short of its collective intermediate indicative target for 2010. At the same time, I would like to emphasise that, compared to 2009, European Union official development aid increased by more than EUR 4.5 billion, reaching EUR 53 billion in 2010. In the global context, the EU is leading the world on development aid increases. Since 2004, we have provided 65% of global aid increases and today, the European Union accounts for more than half of global development aid. Official Development Aid remains important for reaching the Millennium Development Goals’ targets and all development partners can also be called upon to contribute their fair share.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also true that the European Union budget could and should be a part of the increase of Official Development Aid. In the multiannual financial framework proposal, the European Commission has put forward increasing resources allocated to development aid. The proposed increase reflects the commitment to reach the 0.7% target, under the assumption that the share of EU-channelled ODA remains stable.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, Official Development Aid increases alone will not be sufficient to meet all the financing needs of the developing world, to address the numerous global challenges. To bridge the financing gap and provide the necessary resources, they should be ready to put all their efforts into mobilising all financial resources, including private resources, because only in this way can we dramatically increase the scale of support.</p>
<p class="contents">This also includes looking at mechanisms, such as guarantees and blending loans and grants. I believe the G20 process, under the French Presidency, has started a very important discussion on a financial transaction tax and that these resources should also be used for development needs. There are other sources indicated in the Gates report, which we should look at and discuss at the appropriate time.</p>
<p class="contents">But I would also like to emphasise other aspects that are of particular importance at this time when each euro spent in the European Union is looked upon twice or three times – that the money spent provides exactly the results that we should expect – so that means aid efficiency is crucial. We will look at the global relations in this respect, between the developed world and the developing world, to ensure that aid money is spent efficiently, transparently and with the profitability that is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">I was also asked a question about a peer review. Definitely, the European Commission fully supports Parliament’s full involvement in the OECD/DAC Peer Review and a peer review team will be coming again and will be working with Parliament to find the right answers for EU development cooperation. We are very much looking at the result of this peer review. In previous times, it gave a lot of very valuable contributions on how to involve it and I believe it is the right instrument internationally to reflect on it.</p>
<p class="contents">And the last point I would like to emphasise is that, even under the Lisbon Treaty, a rather complicated treaty, we had excellent cooperation with the Polish Presidency on development issues and I would like to thank Minister Stanowski for his engagement in keeping development issues rightly on the Council agenda. His presence today is very much a confirmation of his personal engagement and that the Commission, Council and Parliament need to work together in this area to help the poorest people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with the opinion of the Council and the Commission that one of the keys to sustainable development is the mobilisation of domestic resources in partner countries. In our resolution, we call on European Union donors to prioritise capacity building in this area. This especially concerns building stronger tax systems and better tax governance. We also call for increased efforts to promote tax-related transparency and country-by-country reporting and to combat tax evasion and illicit capital flight. In relation to this, we ask the European Commission to include the fight against the misuse of tax havens and against tax evasion and illicit capital flight in its development policy as a matter of priority.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the resolution is not restricted just to analysis of the current situation. In it, we call on the European Union and the Member States to do what the Commissioner has spoken about: to seek other sources of international development finance, besides official development assistance, which could be given to development. This includes proposing innovative levies to fund global public action, including giving development aid, although not all Members of the House are of the opinion that this innovative levy should be a financial transaction tax. It also includes significantly reducing the cost of remittances, which, as we know, are an important source of income for developing countries, stepping up the blending of EU grants and European Investment Bank loans, although the position of the Committee on Development is very clear that this mechanism must not cause a reduction in aid spending, and supporting micro-finance schemes, which improve access to financial services in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would also like to say that it is very important for us to bear in mind the principle that other policies must, in accordance with the Lisbon Treaty, be consistent with development goals. Once again, we appeal for implementation of this principle, for the introduction of structural measures to eradicate poverty, and for European policy to be made more consistent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We also need to agree with the emerging economies, China and India, that they should take care of their own poor themselves. Obviously, our business community can play a greater role in the development of the economy in the south, but we must be careful that we do not return to tied aid, where development money flows back into our own pockets through orders placed with our businesses. However, what is essential for the European Union is to recognise that the effectiveness of development aid stands or falls on coherence of policy. For instance, the Council’s fine priorities will mean nothing as long as our businesses pay little or no tax in developing countries. If they had a healthy fiscal revenue, they would hardly need our financial support. I am therefore very pleased with the proposals by Michel Barnier of the Commission concerning the Transparency Directive, which are certainly coherent. We could certainly strengthen the detail of his proposals, but if we had insight into what European mining and forestry companies pay in poor countries, we could make those companies much more accountable.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, what will the Commission do to ensure that Member States deliver on their pledges to spend 0.7 per cent of their gross national income on development cooperation in 2015? A call alone does not, unfortunately, appear to be enough. Obviously, this pledge is under severe pressure because of the economic crisis, but the least the Commission can do is to start the debate <span class="italic">now</span>, in a powerful way, about what needs to happen after 2015. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let us say this straightaway: without the European Union’s contribution to development policy, achieving the Millennium Development Goals would remain a pipedream. Let us nevertheless add that the European Union shares this responsibility with other players.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States is an important donor in absolute terms, but with 0.2% of its GDP devoted to official development aid, it is far behind the European Union in relative terms, without forgetting the emerging countries, which generate substantial resources, an increasing part of which will have to be allocated for the purpose of development and combating poverty within their own borders.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, what is comforting is to see that various EU Member States – the list is not exhaustive – are setting an example in this regard. With only a few days until the Fourth High-Level Forum on aid effectiveness in Busan, I think it would be wise to insist not only on the volume of the European Union’s official development aid, but also on its ‘leverage effect’.</p>
<p class="contents">As the largest provider of funds, we have a position that enables the European Union to assert itself more at global level. Without being perceived as giving lectures, the European Union can and must remind those at Busan that combating poverty is an obligation for all the Member States; as developing countries and, more specifically, emerging countries gradually generate their own resources, they must also devote them to eradicating poverty within their borders. It is, first and foremost, up to them to act and we cannot take their responsibilities in this area upon ourselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Greens believe in a change of policy, addressing tax havens and tax evasion, with binding measures, implementing Article 208 of the Lisbon Treaty on policy coherence, by matching words with actions, with coherent policies between trade, agriculture and fishing, addressing farmland acquisition by foreign investors with the risk of undermining food security, such as in Africa, and putting in place fair trade rules to break the vicious circle whereby developing countries are locked into dire poverty despite agricultural and mineral resources. The trade pattern where developing countries export raw materials and buy manufactured products from industrialised countries has to change.

At the same time, however, financing for development is considered to be insufficiently effective, especially in light of the fact that millions of European citizens are living below the poverty line, even though numerous areas of the European Union have exited the economic crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we are forced to raise the basic issue of more intensive management and efficacy controls of European taxpayers’ money, especially now, at a time of severe economic crisis and serious effort to rescue the euro and the euro area. I have always ardently supported the need for bold support for underdeveloped and developing countries, because it benefits the people of Europe in the medium term. However, this is not possible without adequate and strict controls, so that the European taxpayers’ money is not lost in the black hole of corruption and unaccountability.</p>
<p class="contents">I will go even further, beyond financing for development: it is not right that Greek citizens, for example, should be subjected to humiliating terms and degradation in order to save a Member State of the euro area while, at the same time, millions are being lost left, right and centre due to the lack of controls. Not a single cent of European taxpayers’ money should be handed over without controls and accountability.</p>
<p class="contents">To go even further still, pre-accession aid should also be subject to controls. I was recently in Turkey, which boasts that it is spending millions to become the leading country in the area, in Gaza, in Libya and in the Horn of Africa, while, at the same time, complaining that it is receiving crumbs from the European Union.</p>

It is a case of saying: ‘I am doing badly but you can do worse than me; you suffer more’. Quite frankly, that is unacceptable to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, you are right, we are the biggest donor in the world, thus the importance of the EU and the devastation inflicted when we pull back on our commitments and fail to match our promises. In good times we must deliver, and equally in bad times. Aid effectiveness is based on long-term planning and thereby the predictability of funding. It is vital that we keep our word and our commitments to those most in need.</p>
<p class="contents">Aid is investment, and it is necessary and vital for the wellbeing of all: developed and developing countries. We talk of crisis; think of the crisis when your child is dying from malnutrition, disease, deprivation. Think of that. Think of children dying from diseases which are preventable. Those are the crises we should be addressing and not necessarily a crisis which has been created through the pursuit of greed by banking and financial institutions. We ask the poor to make the sacrifices and give up that which they do not have, whilst at the same time we search for trillions of euro to satisfy rating agencies and bond markets which will never be satisfied.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, we have the ECR not wanting binding commitments to targets. Why not? Why is the EPP seeking to remove the commitments on the land grab issue? These are issues that should unite the entire House, not divide us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Few care about results when it comes to projects funded from the public purse. No one feels personal responsibility, only political responsibility, and political responsibility is often just an empty phrase.</p>
<p class="contents">This is 2011. I am certain that the Millennium Goals will not be achieved. The European Union will also be blamed for this. It is absurd, but few European politicians will stand up at home in a time of crisis to defend an increase in development aid when unemployment is rising, pensions and health services are under threat and their own citizens are dependent on food aid. Development aid is defensible only when it is targeted and transparent, when the donor and the beneficiary are real people, families, small communities or at most a state. Where the personal dimension of aid disappears, we see waste, corruption, market distortion and summit conferences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In actual fact, today’s oral question is intended to highlight again the responsibilities which we have to the poorest countries in the world, to the millions of people who live in poverty and die every day. Indeed, the European Union remains the main donor, but I am concerned about the rate at which international donations are decreasing, especially those coming from the private sector. Another concerning aspect is the indifference or inability of Member States to allocate 0.7% of gross national income to social development aid by 2015.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a huge shortfall in funding. This is why I believe that Member States need to step up their efforts to generate additional income for assistance. In this regard, I support the proposal to adopt binding budgetary timetables, like the one for increasing the effectiveness in using this money. We all hope that Member States will return to economic growth and job creation, which will not only help improve the lives of people on our continent, but also provide hope for the poorest countries in the world and for the most afflicted children on the planet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The fact that the European Union is the world’s biggest donor – contributing half of what the world is contributing – is something we should be very proud of, and which is indeed admirable. Certainly, it is something that we should put before other countries so that they can try to emulate what we are doing. Particularly when you consider that part of our 2020 strategy is to lift millions of people within Europe out of the poverty trap, the fact that, at the same time, we continue to help the poorest of the poor in the world is something we can be very proud of.</p>
<p class="contents">I know in my own country that we are very pleased with our contributions, both in terms of personnel who go to the Third World – long-term missionaries and other people for the short-term – and of giving to charitable causes, and with our commitment, like other countries, to meeting the 0.7% of GDP.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just two questions. Firstly, I would ask the Commission whether it considers that there are too many NGOs. If we had an amalgamation of NGOs, would we not save a lot in administration and have a better focus? Secondly, at what stage do we say that an emerging country can take care of itself and does not need help from us so we may give it to poorer countries? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should emphasise the importance of coordination between donors and joint programming.</p>

The issue of low development levels and poverty in the countries of the so-called developing world are therefore pushed into the background. It is still true, however, that the differences between the rich north and the poor south are wide, and the crisis only exacerbates the absolute level of this inequality or catastrophe.</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis, however, could actually be an impulse for introducing more courageous and ambitious policies for promoting and fulfilling development goals. At a time when EU Member State budgets are running dry, there should be more pressure for alternative sources of development funding. Let us be frank – we are losing huge amounts of money through tax havens. The legislation to limit tax havens should bring in higher revenues, which could also be invested in the development of poorer countries. The same applies to the tax on financial transactions. In my opinion, it is a great pity that, due to the objections of the right, the resolution lost the references to a legally binding mechanism which would force multinational corporations to publish data automatically on the taxes they pay in their countries of operation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In terms of financial volumes, 0.7% of GNI is really a very small amount of money. And for new Member States, it is only 0.33%.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, development aid is clearly a form of investment: investment in our security. To take just one example, the EU’s Operation Atalanta to combat piracy has cost, I am afraid, more than all the development aid that we have provided.</p>
<p class="contents">The root causes of piracy are not to be found at sea, but on land. This is just one example. If people are dying from poverty, with no access to food, they will go out to rob others. So it is very clear where there is investment in people.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also learn courage from our African friends. 200 soldiers, mostly from Burundi but also from Uganda, have died this year fighting and protecting the Somali civilian population. 200 of them died, 800 are injured. What they say is that when there were difficult times in Burundi, they got help. It is about solidarity. And if there is solidarity inside the European Union, we should also have solidarity with the poorest nations in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">To answer Mr Kelly’s question on NGOs, we are rich because of our civil society. I know that there are a lot of issues such as whether NGOs should be more streamlined, but I think NGOs are an asset to our society. Even if their activities are not always fully efficient, they are doing what they do from the heart and I do not think we should try to limit them.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the EU basically provides support through states where we can. Where we cannot, NGOs are the most effective mechanism to provide support for people on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">On differentiation, the Agenda for Change is very clear. There will only be support to the countries most in need. By developing the fight against poverty, we can increase our support to them.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point is on John Bufton’s comment: it is wrong. We are accountable for each euro. Yes, the Court of Auditors and Parliament’s Budgetary Control Committee look at how we spend – and how we document – each and every euro. There is what we call an ‘error rate’, but for these operations, we put all the preconditions in place to monitor each euro spent and ensure that it is spent according to the needs, and to the benefit, of the poorest people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union has brought other donors to this table where we share what we have. We should be proud that other countries – emerging economies – are joining the team of those who are supporting countries in need, and supporting people in need.</p>
<p class="contents">This is especially true today. Two weeks before Busan, we should concentrate on effectiveness – on effectiveness in the investment sense. Yes, this is investment. Countries like Poland understand that foreign support can be investment, enabling countries to become stable and independent. This is how we in the Council see our official development assistance. We would like to support those who can achieve stability later on.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, it is extremely important to share, and discuss, values and rules with the new donors. Busan, and our joint position for Busan, will be the space where we can discuss the rules with new donors. One of the most important rules, especially for us in the European Union and in the Council, is the issue of transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that we are spending public money, first of all, we should be transparent on our side. On the other hand, we expect this transparency also on the recipient side. We discussed this in the Council yesterday. When we think about budget support, we discuss the responsibilities on their side, and what kind of conditionality we should apply when placing so much trust in a country to support the budget directly at sectoral level.</p>
<p class="contents">We also understand that if we do not invest in development, we will be forced to provide humanitarian assistance. We see this situation in the Horn of Africa. We see that the lack of resilience in local communities leads to famine – a situation which should not be happening at this time. Unfortunately, it is happening, precisely because there is not enough development, and we cannot provide effective support to these communities and these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in response to Mr Berman’s comment, yes, we should support entrepreneurship. This is exactly where the key to development lies: in finding a way to empower local partners and local communities, with our support, to set off on the path to development.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I would like to say again that we should be proud of what we have done, and we should share with others the values and the standards we try to uphold.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, when it comes to innovative financial instruments, we need them both for ourselves, to support our economies, but also to support those who are in need, especially when we are talking about our neighbourhood in Africa. This is really also about our security. Without development in these regions, we will also be in trouble. This is why we should try to build solidarity with the new donors to provide reasonable assistance to these countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
