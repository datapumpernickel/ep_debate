<p>Relations between the European Union and Morocco are based on the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement, signed on 26 February 1999, which came into force on 1 March 2000, and on the Barcelona Process which establishes the framework for relations between the EU and the countries of the southern Mediterranean. This agreement, the same type as those proposed to other Mediterranean partners under the Barcelona Process, should make it possible to strengthen the already privileged links that exist between the European Union and Morocco by establishing relations based on reciprocity, codevelopment and dialogue.</p>
<p>This agreement forms part of an overall cooperation strategy intended to establish, in a spirit of partnership, an area of political stability and economic prosperity throughout the entire Euro-Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>Respect for democratic principles and human rights forms an important part of the agreement. The bodies created under the agreement, the Association Council of ministers and the Association Committee of civil servants, meet once a year, providing a forum for dialogue on all the aspects covered by the agreement, including the political aspects.</p>
<p>The agreement provides for the development of trade with a view to implementing a Euro-Mediterranean free exchange area by 2010. To this end, it contributes to cooperation in economical and financial, human, social and cultural fields. The implementation of this agreement is broadly supported by the European Union under a financial cooperation arrangement. This has been in place since 1996, particularly through the MEDA regulation. Between 1996 and 1999, MEDA allocated EUR 581 million to Morocco. Between 1996 and 1998 the MEDA-Democracy programme allocated financial support of around EUR 2.4 million to projects in the field of democracy and human rights. In addition, since 1996, the EIB has granted Morocco EUR 392 million in loans to contribute mainly to funding major infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>In the area of agriculture, the agreement includes a periodic review clause providing for negotiations, as of this year, on the conditions for the gradual liberalisation of agricultural trade. These negotiations will cover a number of sensitive products, as shown recently by the dispute arising after the quota for Moroccan tomato exports allowed into the Community market duty free was exceeded.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission will be looking into appropriate proposals to open negotiations with Morocco as soon as possible in order to pursue mutually advantageous cooperation in the fisheries sector. These new arrangements will have to be obtained in the spirit of partnership.</p>
<p>On 11 October 1999, the Council adopted an Action Plan for Morocco, as the country of origin of many asylum seekers and immigrants, with a view to investigating solutions to the deep-seated causes of emigration from this country as part of an overall approach. Two investigative teams have already visited Morocco in order to establish an ongoing dialogue with the relevant authorities regarding emigration. The Council meeting on 29 May 2000 welcomed the progress achieved in implementing this Action Plan.</p>
<p>The Council considers that the various instruments set in place in this way, the establishment of regular political dialogue under the Association Agreement, and the prospects for future cooperation justify looking forward with confidence to deepening relations between the European Union and this extremely important partner.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0580"></a>

<p>Liberia continues to suffer from the effects of the seven years of civil war (1989-96). GDP per capita remains at around US$ 200, or roughly one third of the pre-war level. Government capacity is very poor, and there is still hardly any electricity.</p>
<p>The United States have significantly reduced their aid programme to Liberia compared to pre-war levels. As of today, the Community is probably the most important donor in the country. The Commission re-opened an office in the capital Monrovia in 1999. Since the end of the civil conflict in Liberia in 1996, the Community has gradually phased out its humanitarian emergency assistance programmes and switched towards multi-sector rehabilitation programmes. A first programme of EUR 25 m has been implemented from 1994 to 1998. A second programme of EUR 27 m is presently under implementation. It concentrates on providing vital services to the population such as water and drug supplies, resettlement of returnees, rehabilitation of basic rural infrastructures. These programmes are widely seen as having played an important role in stabilising Liberia after the civil war.</p>
<p>The Commission is fully committed to continue providing essential services to the Liberian population.

<p>The Commission is, however, continuing to look into this matter, particularly in the light of the additional information provided by the Spanish authorities.

<p>In the EU Member States there are numerous NGOs working for the development of the areas bordering the EU. These associations carry out really valuable grass-roots work in towns, villages and the countryside.</p>
<p>Fund-raising for these associations is carried out on a voluntary basis, often through neighbourly mutual-aid events. The support of society has been quite essential to these associations which work hard year in, year out. In some Member States national development aid to neighbouring regions has been of help, but this represents only a small amount. Some form of action would be in the general interest of the whole EU.</p>
<p>In the areas neighbouring the EU what is needed is in many cases to give a boost to fundamental activities, such as creating an entrepreneurial culture, familiarisation with harvesting and storage procedures for agricultural products, etc. In these areas working on one’s own initiative has to be relearned.</p>
<p>The opportunities offered by existing EU programmes such as TACIS and INTERREG too often relate to projects which are too ambitious and are beyond the means and capabilities of people in these border areas.</p>
<p>Has the Commission any plans to help NGOs and associations in their own-initiative activities in a more effective way in the EU’s neighbouring areas? What concrete form would this take?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is aware of the role of non-governmental organisations in the development of areas bordering the European Union, particularly on the Finland-Russia border. It will continue to encourage their participation in European Union programmes in two forms:</p>
<p>- Interreg does not stipulate any maximum or minimum scale for the selection of a project, or any restrictions on the participation of a partner. Any non-governmental organisation may therefore take part in an Interreg programme.</p>
<p>- Even though TACIS does support a number of large-scale projects, it must be emphasised that – just like the Interreg programme – it does have the opportunity to support smaller projects.</p>
<p>In this connection, the Commission would like to mention the existence, for example, of the LIEN (Link Inter-European NGOs) programme which calls for the participation of non-governmental organisations in small-scale projects (maximum EUR 200 000) intended to boost the social aspects of civil society in the countries concerned.</p>
<p>Moreover, under the TACIS CBC (Cross Border Cooperation) programme, the Commission has always encouraged NGOs to participate in the Small Project Facility in order to improve the economic and social situation of border regions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0584"></a>

In this context, the Commission has been informed of the Norwegian oil rig accident which did not result in any loss of life or pollution.</p>

<p>In an answer to a previous question<a href="#defann_10_1" name="refann_10_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>1 the Commission welcomed the discussions which took place during the hearing on radio, held on 24 May 2000, which confirmed the support from the public that radio enjoys. The meeting also helped to indicate, on the basis of the opinion of the experts who participated in the hearing, that in their view there is a possible market failure which may manifest itself in the period 2010-2015. It is precisely this timescale which makes the approach of "technological neutrality" adopted by the Commission, most appropriate, given the rate at which technologies develop. It has, however, to be borne in mind that local radio lacks a trans-national -European- dimension, which as a result renders the notion of circulation of radio content void of any meaning; nonetheless the Commission is very vigilant on the respect from national authorities of the principle of non-discrimination and freedom of establishment in delivering radio licences to Community operators. Moreover, on the basis of recent studies, radio is one of the most dynamic and flourishing sectors in the audiovisual.</p>
<p>The Commission is interested in a rapid take up of digital services in Europe, including radio, as demonstrated by the recently launched eEurope initiative. The Commission, however, cannot interfere with the preferences of consumers and considers that digital radio can best be administered by existing legislation. The speed of introduction of new radio services only depends on the added value of those services. It should, therefore, be left to the market, broadcasters, consumers and industry to decide which services are to be chosen. Maximising the benefits of digital radio will require a balance in the interest of consumers, broadcasters and the manufacturing industry.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Seventy-seven project proposals were submitted in response to the Call for Proposals for the Obnova 2000 Integrated Return Programme for Bosnia and Herzegovina. These were submitted by thirty-three NGOs from Member States, one NGO from Bosnia and Herzegovina and the United Nations Development Programme. The proposals received were evaluated strictly in accordance with the criteria and methodology specified in the documentation provided to the organisations which had expressed an interest to participate in the programme. The Commission had, in particular, integrated into the selection process recommendations made by the Court of Auditors.</p>
<p>As a result of the evaluation, it was recommended that projects proposed by the following organisations be selected for implementation under the programme:</p>
<p>International Rescue Committee Spain, Active in BiH for 5 years</p>
<p>Dorcas-Dutch, Active in BiH for 6 years</p>
<p>Arbeiter Samariter Bund-German, Active in BiH for 4 years</p>
<p>Danish Refugee Council-Danish, Active in BiH for 7 years</p>
<p>Mercy Corps Europe/Scottish European Aid-British, Active in BiH for 5 years</p>
<p>Hilfswerk-Austrian, Active in BiH for 4 years</p>
<p>World Vision- German, Active in BiH 3 years</p>
<p>Nuova Frontiera-Italian, Active in BiH for 3 years</p>
<p>UNDP-International, Active in BiH for 3 years</p>
<p>Many of these organisations have been active in the Western Balkans region for considerably longer periods than they have been active in BiH. Thirteen contracts have now been signed and the remainder should be signed in the coming days. This will allow substantial implementation of this year’s programme to take place in the current construction season and will further encourage the positive developments in return which have occurred this year.</p>
<p>Since 1996 nearly EUR 527 million has been committed under the Obnova programme and more than EUR 287 million under the Phare programme for Bosnia and Herzegovina. Numerous contracts have been awarded under both programmes. Information on the Obnova and Phare programmes in Bosnia and Herzegovina is available on the following internet site:</p>
<p>http://www.seerecon.org/Bosnia/Bosnia-DonorPrograms/Bosnia-Donors-EC/Bosnia-Donors-EC.htm</p>
<p>The contracts awarded under each programme, the selected contractor, the value of the contract and its status (finished or ongoing) are listed. This site will be updated following signature of all the Integrated Return Programme contracts.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently engaged in collating extensive information on all contracts awarded following tendering in Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1 January 1999. It is intended to publish the following matters in relation to each tender: the number of companies expressing an interest in the tender, the identity of the short listed companies, the number of tenders received, the final score of the winning tenderer, the date of award of the contract and the contract value.

<p>The Commission does not have full information, and it has not for the moment been possible to completely verify the information at its disposal. Greece will shortly be asked to submit its observations.</p>
<p>Subject to the above reservations, this tax has all the appearance of a charge having equivalent effect to a customs duty on imports, in contravention of Articles 23 and 25 (ex Articles 9 and 12) of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>The chargeable event appears to constitute the entry into Greek waters of a pleasure boat more than 7 metres in length, which does not reside permanently in Greece. This tax appears, therefore, to represent a pecuniary charge imposed unilaterally on Community goods (in this instance, pleasure boats) by virtue of crossing a frontier. If that is the case, it meets the definition of a charge having equivalent effect to a customs duty on imports.</p>
<p>It also does not appear to be covered by one of the three exceptions which permit a charge not to be characterised as a charge having equivalent effect (namely charges forming part of a general system of internal dues; consideration for a service actually determined and individually rendered to the person liable for payment of the charge, of an amount proportionate to the said service; charges imposed by reason of checks carried out in order to fulfil obligations under Community law).</p>
<p>As there are doubts concerning the compatibility of the taxes on entry examined with Community law, the Commission will be contacting Greece in order to clarify the situation.

<p>The Commission is aware of the rumours concerning the alleged ban by the Chinese authorities of a Sprite commercial, made by the Coca-Cola Company, featuring the Taiwanese pop star Sherry Chang Huei-mei. The Commission is also aware of the alleged warning to PRC and Hong Kong companies about trading with certain Taiwanese firms. However, it is not clear whether the alleged ban and the alleged warning were carried out by the order, or with the knowledge, of the central Chinese Government.</p>
<p>It is difficult in instances of this kind to obtain clear evidence of exactly what has taken place. Recent information, however, seems to indicate that new commercials featuring Sherry Chang Huei-mei will encounter no problems. Furthermore, the Chinese authorities have issued statements to the effect that they refrained from interfering in Hong Kong's internal affairs. The Hong Kong Government has also issued a statement stating that investors and businessmen operating in Hong Kong are free to chose their business partners.</p>
<p>However, the Commission shares the concerns expressed by the Honourable Member. From the moment China enters the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the terms of accession become legally binding, the Commission will be paying close attention to the implementation and enforcement of those commitments by the Chinese authorities. Other WTO members will do likewise.</p>
<p>In addition, the operation of a new, multilateral mechanism to review annually China's adherence to WTO obligations is currently under discussion as part of the protocol of accession. The Commission itself will also focus efforts on assisting China, through targeted aid programmes, in adapting to the demands of full participation in the world trading system.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0533"></a>

The agreement was warmly welcomed by the public, but was contested, however, by certain employers’ organisations, which asked for the matter to be considered by the Commission.</p>

<p>After several ad hoc meetings with the Spanish authorities, the Commission sent a letter on 12 April 2000 to the Spanish Government in order to inform it of its views on Decree No 213/1998 of 17 December, by means of which the Madrid Autonomous Community intended to implement the framework agreement in order to support the stability and quality of employment, and offered it an opportunity to present its comments on these views. This decree appears to infringe Community directives coordinating procedures for the award of public procurement contracts, insofar as it obliges the public authorities concerned to introduce the creation or preservation of sustainable jobs by the tendering firms as a criterion for the award of such contracts. The fact is, however, that in the context of completing the internal market, the directives stipulate, firstly, that observance of the principles of non-discrimination and equal treatment, among others, must be guaranteed and, secondly, that public procurement contracts must be justified on the basis of the lowest acceptable offer. Under such circumstances, a contract may not be awarded on the basis of a firm’s structure but only on the basis of the details of the tender submitted.</p>
<p>In view of the priority given to employment in Community policy, the Member States have undertaken to implement measures to promote employment or to pay special attention to disadvantaged persons or groups of people (the disabled, ethnic minorities, etc) within the labour market. Both sides of industry have been encouraged to participate actively – with the support of the national authorities – in implementing the guidelines for employment adopted by the Council for the year 2000, within the framework established by and in accordance with Community law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0534"></a>

<p>The only situations likely to justify authorising measures to compensate fishermen for temporary cessation of fishing activities, for reasons relating to the state of resources, are those provided for in Article 12(6) and Article 16 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 (1), laying down the detailed rules and arrangements regarding Community structural assistance in the fisheries sector. According to the first of these provisions, the “Member States may introduce nationally financed accompanying social measures for fishermen in order to facilitate temporary cessation of fishing activities in the framework of plans for the protection of aquatic resources”. The second provision stipulates that Member States may grant compensation in the circumstances that are subsequently defined in Article 16 of Council Regulation (EC) 2792/1999.</p>
<p>The national authorities must notify the Commission, pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 (2) (rules of procedure for the notification of state aid), of any draft legislation seeking to institute measures such as those described.

<p>Trade promotion and cooperation is one of the core elements in Union policy towards the Western Balkans, embodied both with the EU Stabilisation and Association process and the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe. To this end and following a request made by the Lisbon European Council of 23/24 March, the Commission has proposed (on 7 June 2000) an extension of the existing Community autonomous trade preferences for these countries in the form of a single new Council Regulation.</p>
<p>It is proposed to abolish the remaining tariff ceilings for certain industrial products from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia and to improve substantially the market access for agricultural products from these countries. Furthermore, the extension of these preferences to Kosovo (as defined by UNSC Resolution) and the granting of tariff quotas for Montenegrin aluminium products are envisaged.</p>
<p>These exceptional trade measures providing for almost completely duty-free treatment of imports from these countries have only a small impact on the Community market but can make a big difference in efforts to stimulate economic activity and trade in the region. They are proposed in response to the specific situation in the Western Balkans and will not constitute a precedent for Community trade policy with other countries.</p>
<p>In addition to trade issues, the Commission is carrying out other actions which can strengthen the export capacity of the Western Balkans, within the Stability Pact. It is actively contributing to the « Investment Compact », a comprehensive strategy including revision of banking legislation and privatisation of public enterprises and utilities; Capital Markets; Foreign Direct Investment conditions; Commercial Law; Accounting. The Commission supports other initiatives involving the direct participation of the private sector, such as the Business Advisory Council. The Commission is providing specific assistance to strengthen the custom administration, especially in countries such as Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
<p>Infrastructure is also important to improve export capacity in the region. Since the Regional Funding Conference on 29 – 30 March) considerable progress has been made by the Commission/World Bank and European Investment Bank to complete the financing plans of the 35 Quick Start projects in infrastructure. The Overall picture is satisfactory. The Commission has pledged EUR 330 million to support 17 infrastructures projects. Out of 35 projects, financing agreements have been signed in 9 cases and donors have expressed sufficient interest to cover the total costs in 16 cases.

<p>This matter was indeed discussed in the Council’s preparatory meetings before the deadline of 31 December 1998. The conclusion was that the opportune moment had not yet arrived for the Community to opt for a procedure other than the one which is currently applicable, i.e. the arbitration procedure. In other words, at this stage, the Council did not opt for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea as an alternative to arbitration.</p>
<p>The opinion of the Commission and the Member States is that the International Tribunal has not yet issued enough significant rulings to afford a clear insight into the legal attitude of this new international court and that, consequently, it is not certain that referring cases to the Tribunal would provide the Community with a dispute settlement procedure that would be an improvement on arbitration.</p>

<p>This applies particularly to Romania, whose legal framework and administrative capacity with respect to the environment are still weak. In this respect, the Commission is currently proposing to increase the Phare assistance to Romania devoted to environment. To that end, it included an EUR 8 million project to further harmonise Romania’s legal framework with the ‘Acquis Communautaire’, and to strengthen its administrative capacity at both central and local level in the Phare 2000 National Programme. Moreover, several projects for reducing the trans-boundary pollution were also included in the Phare 2000 cross-border cooperation programmes with Hungary and with Bulgaria. All of these programmes will soon be formally adopted.</p>
<p>In parallel to the assistance necessary to improve both the legal framework and administrative capacity in this sector, there is also a huge need for investment in Romania. Under Agenda 2000, pre-accession aid to assist candidate countries in bearing the costs of accession has been substantially increased. In particular, the new Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-accession (ISPA) will provide around EUR 800 million over seven years to environmental infrastructure investments in Romania. In this framework, the process of project identification and preparation is ongoing, priority being given to the improvement of wastewater treatment and waste management.</p>
<p>Finally, on the specific issue of safeguarding ecological hotspots, the Commission is of the opinion that they should first be precisely identified and risks assessed. To that end, the international task force set up by the Commission following the Baia Mare cyanide spill into the River Tisza will shortly (this summer) issue a report “The Inventory of the Potentially Polluting Sources in the Somes-Tisa Hydrographic Basin”, listing 'high risk sites' in the mining and extractive industries covering Romania, Hungary, Ukraine and Slovakia. The need for possible specific initiatives under existing instruments for assistance will be assessed on the basis of this report at the request of the countries concerned.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0546"></a>

<p>The assessments and analyses at the recent New York 'Women 2000' meeting, the 'Beijing plus five' review held from 5 to 9 June 2000, show that policies based on microcredit for women who lack resources are producing excellent results. The modest financial support that they receive helps to empower many women economically, enabling them to take up an occupation, surmount crises, or set up their own businesses. The EU, however, offers no such ways out to those unable to contribute even a little capital. Would the Commission be willing to explore the opportunities at regional or local level for microcredit and experimental projects along similar lines? Would it be possible to work together to that end with national, regional, or local bodies, and with the European Investment Bank?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is very much aware that access to capital is a primary barrier encountered by women entrepreneurs. At the Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly on Women 2000: Gender Equality, Development and Peace for the twenty-first Century, the Community supported the promotion of women's entrepreneurship. As a follow-up of the Outcome Document agreed at the Special Session, the European Commission will continue to encourage the development of micro-finance instruments.</p>
<p>In the proposal for a Council Decision on a Multiannual Programme for Enterprise and Entrepreneurship (2001 – 2005), the Commission, in response to the conclusions of the Lisbon European Council, has proposed that future guarantee policy will focus on venture capital, micro-credits and small and medium sized enterprises (SME) loans. These actions will be managed by the European Investment Fund (EIF) and implemented through the different schemes existing in each Member State.</p>
<p>The Community Action Programme on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men (1996-2000) has cofunded transnational projects involving women, non governmental organisations (NGOs) and banks aimed at exchanging information and experience on good practice on the issue of difficulties which women encounter in accessing finance.</p>
<p>The Structural Funds, especially the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund, from 1994-99, have supported women starting their own company by providing financial assistance, training and support services. The "New Opportunities for Women" (NOW) strand of the EMPLOYMENT Community Initiative which funded innovative transnational projects testing new approaches largely has contributed to strengthening women's entrepreneurship and to develop women-friendly finance. The new Structural Funds regulations (2000-2006) will continue to provide financial support for women who would like to become entrepreneurs. Nevertheless, it is for the Member States and Regional Authorities responsible for the implementation of the Structural Funds Programmes to ensure that this takes place.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0551"></a>

<p>On 1 May 1999, Professor Anton Pelinka commented on the Italian television channel RAI on previous statements made by the Freedom Party's Jörg Haider in connection with national socialism. On 11 May 2000, a court in Vienna (Landesgericht für Strafsachen) found Professor Pelinka guilty of slandering Jörg Haider during the broadcast and ordered him to pay a fine of ATS 60 000. Mr Haider was represented by his lawyer, Dieter Böhmdorfer, who is now Austria's Justice Minister.</p>
<p>Are Professor Pelinka's remarks not completely within the bounds of acceptability in a democracy? The question is whether the Austrian court is guilty of serious encroachment on freedom of expression in general and academic freedom in particular, given that Austria is a member of the Council of Europe and of the EU, the founding Treaty of which lays down, in Article 6(2), that the Union shall, as general principles, respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</p>

<p>Regulation 443/92 provides the legal basis for Budget lines B7-300 and B7-311 to which the honourable Member refers. The priority activities for this spending, as established in the regulation, cover, in the case of B7-300, assistance to Asian developing countries, to be targeted primarily on the poorest section of the population and the poorest countries, in particular for the development of the rural sector and improving food security. In the case of B7-311 (economic cooperation with Latin America), the main areas of activity financed aim to establish relations between European and Latin American enterprises, training and institution building, and to promote investment as a source of jobs and income for developing countries. The Commission is following these policy orientations in its implementation of these budget lines.</p>
<p>In addition to cooperation under the Asia/Latin America Regulation, the Commission also seeks to promote civil society initiatives relating to democratisation and human rights through Chapter B7-7 of the budget and the human rights Regulation 975/99. However, the Commission has not received requests from non-governmental organisations (NGOs), trade unions or other local initiatives for support for monitoring the impact of European investments, either from this or from the budget lines mentioned above.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that the promotion of social justice and the protection of labour and human rights are best achieved through support for good governance and the rule of law. This is a central objective of the Community's cooperation in Asian and Latin American developing countries. Community action should seek to improve the legal environment for all workers, and not only those employed by Community enterprises, who form a minority of the working population.</p>
<p>The Commission also believes that the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines on Multinational Enterprises (MNE) are a very useful instrument to promote responsible corporate behaviour, given that they are endorsed by countries representing the source of most foreign direct investment, which recommend their application wherever in the world an MNE operates. On 27 June 2000, OECD Members (and Argentina, Brazil and Chile) endorsed at Ministerial level a revision of the Guidelines, including provisions for their promotion and implementation by adhering governments. Both the Commission and the Member States were particularly active in this revision. The new Guidelines include recommendations to MNEs on human rights, consumer protection and the principle of precaution, and update the recommendations on employment relations to reflect recent International Labour Organisation (ILO) developments on core labour standards, abolition of child labour and forced labour. Adhering governments will actively promote the Guidelines among their MNEs and will adapt or set up ex novo National Contact Points to deal with all matter related to the Guidelines that could be raised by any interested party. The Commission will now reflect on what it could or should do to promote observance of the Guidelines by European MNEs in addition to what Member States will do.</p>
<p>No service of the Commission has been allocated responsibility for the setting of standards for Community enterprises operating in developing countries, as this is not an area in which the Commission has plans for action. However, responsibility for the OECD guidelines lies with the Unit of Directorate General (DG) Trade dealing with Investment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0559"></a>

<p>In the rural development programmes, as provided for under Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 of 17 May 1999, the Member States can propose the cofinancing of measures to combat erosion and desertification, for the afforestation of agricultural or other land, and other schemes intended to protect the environment and limit the effects of desertification. In the case of the afforestation of agricultural land, the aid serves to provide compensation for – in addition to the costs of planting and maintenance for a period of five years – the loss of revenue due to afforestation up to a maximum period of twenty years. In the case of agro-environmental measures, aid is intended to provide compensation for the additional costs resulting from the commitments given and the loss of revenue suffered.

<p>Restructuring aid is the most distortive type of aid the Commission may authorise. Therefore the Commission has set out very strict criteria for approving such aid in its "Community Guidelines on rescue and restructuring aid to firms in difficulties".</p>
<p>As regards SKL-Motoren- und Systemtechnik GmbH (SKL-M), the Commission did not cause the long duration of the investigation procedure. The key reason has been that the potential investor in the second restructuring of SKL-M was not prepared to make a real commitment to take over the company. Without such a commitment the restructuring concept was not credible and aid granted to SKL-M could not be approved. Another main problem influencing the length of the procedure of SKL-M lies in the privatisation and failed first restructuring of the company as part of the LINTRA group. The delay of providing information on the first restructuring also held up the procedure on SKL-M.</p>
<p>As concerns Kranbau Köthen GmbH, the information submitted at the time of the notification in December 1997 was very incomplete. There were also sufficiently clear indications of the incompatibility of the aid measures with the Guidelines to raise doubts as to the acceptability of the aid. A formal investigation was opened in February 1998. Germany started to reply in August 1998. Only by the end of 1998, the Commission had sufficient information to reach a reasoned decision in this case.</p>
<p>However, Germany submitted thereafter a stream of information amending and correcting previous information. In November 1999 the Commission received again information, which substantially revised earlier information and which could have already been supplied in December 1997. This meant that at a late stage in the investigation the Commission was obliged to begin its analysis again on basic aspects of the case.</p>
<p>It is clear that such problems in obtaining information must have serious consequences for rapid and effective decision-making by the Commission. As in the case of SKL-M the Commission has demonstrated its readiness to await the information from the Member State.</p>
<p>The Commission must balance the benefits of restructuring aid to the recipient against the harm done to other firms. The Community Guidelines set out factors to be taken into account when assessing such aid. They include economic, social and regional aspects.</p>
<p>In the case of restructuring aid in eastern Germany, important concessions have been made in the application of this framework to cope with the transition process there as a response to an unprecedented politico-economic challenge. Special aid regimes were in place until the end of 1995 and other concessions continued thereafter. The last formal concession concerning an exception to the so-called ‘one time, last time’ principle.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0576"></a>

<p>On the pretext of tackling the enormous range of illnesses and on the grounds that the cloning of embryos for research purposes is not the same as the cloning of humans, the British Government has launched a process to amend the current legal framework in order to permit the cloning of human embryos to be used as ‘spare parts warehouses’ for tissues and living organs, prompting serious concerns. </p>
<p>In view of the fact that many extremely important medical, ethical and social questions remain unanswered, that there are no safeguards to prevent ‘therapeutic’ cloning escaping from checks of any kind and resulting in the production of children ‘to order’, that the hazy boundaries between scientific motives and the profit mania of the pharmaceutical multinationals and monopolies have not been fixed and that there has been no decision on who is to have social and political responsibility for questions which concern human existence itself, namely life and death, can the Commission state the exact content of the planned legal framework for the cloning of embryos and say what measures it intends to take to prevent developments which might be a sort of Trojan horse for the renewal of attempts to clone humans, with unforeseen and possibly dramatic consequences for humankind?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Recent advances in the isolation and culture of human stem cells have opened up new prospects of hope for medical treatment possibilities but have also started (or resurrected) a debate on the ethical issues related to this type of research and to its potential future applications.</p>
<p>The ethical aspects concerned are related, among other things, to:</p>
<p>1) the source of these cells, which may be obtained from foetal tissue or human embryos;</p>
<p>2) the potential use of cloning techniques, with a view to obtaining, for transplant purposes, cell lines that are perfectly immuno-compatible with a potential transplant recipient;</p>
<p>While these are all complex ethical issues, they are nonetheless not completely new ones. The potential impact of this research in the field of public health, however, is far in excess of the impact of embryological research undertaken until now, which was mainly concerned with the area of reproduction and the study of embryo development. We can now combine the possibilities afforded by progress in genetics and in cell biology. </p>
<p>We must therefore intensify the debate on the balance between the potential benefits for health and public welfare, on the one hand, and the ethical costs of this type of research, on the other.</p>
<p>The European Group on Ethics in Sciences and New Technologies has therefore taken up the issue and plans to issue an opinion by the end of the year.</p>
<p>In its previous opinions, the European Group on Ethics (EGE) has already defined a number of fundamental ethical principles.</p>
<p>For example, in May 1997, it issued an opinion, at the Commission’s request, on the ethical aspects of cloning technology.</p>
<p>“A clear distinction must be drawn between reproductive cloning aimed at the birth of identical individuals ... and non-reproductive cloning, limited to the ‘in vitro’ phase.”</p>
<p>Reproductive cloning has been unequivocally and unanimously condemned not only at Community level but also, more generally, at international level. The EGE opinion recommends that this type of cloning be prohibited. At Community level, research into reproductive cloning is explicitly excluded from the Research Programmes funded by the EU, and Directive 98/44/CE (Article 6) on patenting of the living organism excludes procedures for the cloning of human beings. </p>
<p>The use of cloning technology to enable the creation of specific cell lines may have considerable implications for medical treatment. When such research involves the use of stem cells obtained from human embryos or when it leads to the development of embryos, complex ethical questions are raised relating to embryological research.</p>
<p>In its opinion of 23 November 1998 on ethical aspects of research involving the use of human embryo, the EGE specified the following:</p>
<p>- “The human embryo, whatever the moral or legal status conferred upon it in the different European cultures and ethical approaches, deserves legal protection”. “It is crucial to place human embryo research, in the countries where it is permitted, under strict public control”.</p>
<p>- “At Community level”, “taking into account the moral and philosophical differences” between the Member states, “it would be inappropriate to impose one exclusive moral code”. However, “the respect of pluralism does not justify a laissez-faire attitude”. Community funding for human embryo research should “only be granted under very strict conditions”.</p>
<p>- “Maximum transparency” must apply “whether the research in question is carried out by either the public or private sector. Indeed, such transparency ... provides the best guarantee against major risks of arbitrary experimentation”.</p>
<p>- “European citizens have a right to be clearly informed about the conflicting values that research is currently facing, as well as to be put in a position to evaluate the responsibilities implied for society as a whole”.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0578"></a>

Therefore, these reports are also available to non-governmental organisations (NGOs).</p>
<p>Under PHARE, a new project called “Access” will be launched this year, the aim being to give financial support to NGOs in Poland dealing with environment, economic and social issues related to enlargement.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in a recent Communication, the Commission outlined a new communication strategy on enlargement, the principal goal being to communicate to the public in the Member States and the applicant countries the reasons for enlargement, its likely impact and the challenges it poses. The aim is to facilitate preparations for enlargement in the Member States and the candidate countries by improving public understanding of the process. This strategy will involve political institutions, civil society, business and industry and foresees shared responsibilities between the Commission, which has a duty to provide information in an objective and transparent way, and opinion leaders, who are engaged in delivering messages suited to their own political context. Moreover, Commission representations in the member states and Commission delegations in the candidate countries will develop their communications activities in conjunction with relevant governmental and non-governmental bodies.</p>
<p>The Member of the Commission responsible for environment policy has taken the initiative of organising a regular dialogue with environmental NGOs from candidate countries. The most recent meeting took place in Hungary on 19 June 2000, where discussions focused on environment and the accession process and preparation of the 6th Environmental Action Programme.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0581"></a>

<p>3. From this viewpoint, it is true that the Commission has initiated an assessment of the results and prospects of the Community programmes for decentralised cooperation with Latin America. It is not possible, at this stage, to form any conclusions, as the Commission has not yet had an opportunity to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>4. The Commission will look into this matter, particularly in the context of the debate on the communication it intends to convey to the Council and to Parliament on the follow-up to the Rio Summit. The problem of the future of these programmes lies at the heart of a much wider debate.</p>
<p>5.

<p>It is true that the level of effective cooperation between government bodies and representatives of labour and management varies from one Member State to the other. The weakness of such cooperation or effective dialogue in some countries is particularly regrettable in the field of employment and with regard to the necessary modernisation of the European social model.</p>
<p>In both fields, strong social partner involvement can improve the quality and legitimacy of the decisions to be taken and help to their successful implementation.</p>
<p>On the level of the Community, social partners are fully involved in the legislative process in the social policy field. They are formally consulted on every legal initiative in this field and can themselves conclude agreements which, through the procedure laid down in art. 138/139 of the EC Treaty, can become Community law. They are also consulted on other policies with strong social implications.</p>
<p>Furthermore in the context of the macro-economic dialogue and their participation in Community bodies such as the standing Committee for Employment, social partners are directly associated to economic and social policy making.</p>
<p>Social partner involvement in employment matters on a national level is one of the issues annually examined when monitoring the measures taken to implement the employment guidelines and some progress seems obvious since the launch of the Luxembourg process.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Commission, in its Communication on the Social Policy Agenda, has announced that it will invite the social partners to launch, at European level, the development of common objectives to serve as a reference for social partners' actions at national level on the basis of the employment guidelines.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue to work for further progress and is ready to assist social partner action through the relevant budget lines.</p>

<p>The Commission has presented its proposal for a regulation establishing technical measures to correct the situation of certain populations of highly migratory species.</p>
<p>Amongst other things the regulation incorporates the 1998 and 1999 ICCAT (International Council for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna) recommendations on restricting fishing capacity or activities in respect of white tuna by limiting the number of vessels which will in future be allowed to fish to the average recorded during the 1993-1995 period. In view of the fact that European white tuna fishing in the North Atlantic involves vessels from various Member States using a variety of fishing techniques (troll lining, live bait, pelagic trawl and drift netting) and with a wide range of individual fishing capacity, and given that the ICCAT regards it as essential that fishing effort should be converted and weighted according to the technique used, would the Commission answer the following questions?</p>
<p>Has it checked and validated the information supplied by the Member States as regards the number of vessels authorised in the 1993-1995 period with a view to establishing the average number thereof as a reference? How does it envisage compliance with the ICCAT recommendation at Member State or joint Community level? For the purpose of protecting the species, does it consider merely quantifying and restricting the number of vessels to be adequate, with no account taken of the technique used by each vessel in pursuit of its white tuna fishing activities?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In order to implement the ICCAT (International commission for the conservation of Atlantic tunas) recommendation concerning the limitation in the number of vessels participating in the fishery for Northern Albacore, the Commission has requested Member States to submit all relevant data and supporting evidence to establish the reference level of the average number of vessels during the period 1993-95. Member States have sent the information and, on this basis, the Commission is establishing the total number of vessels that constitute the limit for the Community.</p>
<p>This limit is applicable to the whole of the Community, since the relevant ICCAT recommendation applies to ICCAT parties, and the Community as such is a contracting party to ICCAT. Therefore, the Community has a responsibility to respect the total limit of Community vessels participating in the fishery, but is free to decide on a possible allocation of these vessels among Member States. However, the Commission has taken the view that a possible allocation would only be necessary in case that the total number of vessels that Member States wish to authorise to participate in the fishery would be higher than the average number of these vessels in 1993-95.</p>
<p>As regards the adequacy of this measure for the management of Northern Albacore, the Commission considers that this measure corresponds to the recommendation, by ICCAT scientists, to freeze the total effort in the fishery. In this regard, this measure can be considered adequate. Whether or not different or additional measures are necessary, will be mainly a function of future evaluations of the state of the stock.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0586"></a>

<p>1. When importing prawns into the Community, European importers have the opportunity to claim the tariff preference provided for under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP).</p>
<p>Given that claiming the preference is optional, importers must ensure that the prawns meet the origin criteria required by the customs regulations, in other words, that the prawns have been bred and raised in the beneficiary country, in this case Honduras.</p>
<p>If these criteria are met, the importers then present the certificate of origin issued by the authorities of the country in question to the customs authorities.</p>
<p>The Court of Justice continues to consider that questioning the validity of such certificates is a normal commercial risk borne by the importer.</p>
<p>2. In the event of fraud or incorrect details in terms of the regulations on the origin of goods, the customs administrations of the European Community are justified in demanding the customs duties from the Common Customs Tariff.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware, however, of the need to be able to guarantee the interests of importers acting in good faith, and is looking into the possibility, in future, of systematically publishing in the Official Journal of the European Communities any information warning the importers of the risks they may be running, particularly in the case of justifiable doubt.</p>

<p>The ‘Colombia Plan’ has aroused much concern amongst Colombian organisations in the USA, Europe and Colombia itself because it includes a major military component, because it may shift the conflict and drug growing (or cause them to spread) to other areas, including ones outside Colombia, and because it represents an increase in US intervention in Colombia.</p>
<p>Is the EU intending to conduct a policy of its own as regards the peace process and the drugs problem? If so, what form will that policy take?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Community is keen to support the Colombian Government's efforts to advance the peace process.</p>
<p>A lasting peace in Colombia cannot be achieved unless there is an engagement of all parties to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms. Peace can only emerge from a negotiated solution to the conflict.</p>
<p>The Commission has concerns on certain aspects of Plan Colombia. It has raised the insufficiencies of the Plan with the Colombian authorities. Notably, the insufficient focus on economic, social and political reform as well as its large military component.</p>
<p>But while the benefits of some aspects of Plan Colombia are open to debate, international inaction would be the worst option.</p>
<p>A meeting of the Support Group for the Colombian Peace Process will take place on 6-7 July in Madrid. The Commission will continue to offer its help to the Colombian authorities to improve the Plan in the run-up to this meeting. Its support to Plan Colombia would naturally depend on the results of this meeting.</p>
<p>As regards the drug issue, the Community's policy continues to be based on the principle of ‘shared responsibility’ between producers and consumers. Colombia benefits from the Generalised System of Preferences (SPG). Since 1990 it benefits from the "SPG Drugs", which enables up to 80% of the Andean and Central American exports to the EU to access markets free of charge. Furthermore, a Precursor Chemical Agreement was signed in 1995 between the Community and the Andean countries, and is currently in force.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
