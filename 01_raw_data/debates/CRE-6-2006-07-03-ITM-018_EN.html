<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Caroline Lucas (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that I warmly welcome the Commission’s communication on reducing the climate impact of aviation and that my report strongly supports the Commission’s position that a comprehensive package of measures is needed to address the full impact of aviation on the climate. I should also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups for their good work and collaboration.</p>
<p class="contents">The starting point for my report is that while aviation has brought a great many benefits to society, its current growth rate is completely unsustainable. Between 1990 and 2003, the EU’s international aviation emissions increased by 73%, corresponding to an annual growth of over 4%. At this rate the increased emissions from aviation will neutralise more than a quarter of the reductions required by the EU’s Kyoto target by 2012. Moreover, crucially, aviation’s total impact on the climate is estimated to be two to four times the CO2 impact, even without considering the potential effects of cirrus cloud enhancement.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the industry’s efforts to reduce its emissions are welcome. However, as Eurocontrol predicts, EU air traffic movements are set to more than double by 2020 compared to 2003. It is clear that rates of technological improvements – which historically run at about 1-2% per year – will be insufficient to offset this enormous growth.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear then that action is urgently needed. International aviation is not subject to Kyoto or other commitments. Article 2(2) of the Kyoto Protocol urges states to pursue reduction of greenhouse gases from this source through the International Civil Aviation Organization, but there are currently no plans for a global solution here. That makes it vital that the EU shows leadership and exploits the advantages of laying down an example with early regional action. Council Conclusions of December 2005 reaffirm this, calling for ‘specific action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation if no such action is agreed within the ICAO by 2002’.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the communication’s recognition that we need this comprehensive package of measures, including regulatory, economic, technological and operational instruments. In particular, its plan to pursue the introduction of kerosene taxes is very important, given the existing imbalance between the treatment of aviation and other modes of transport. This should begin right away with a tax on all domestic and intra-EU flights – with the possibility of exemption for all carriers on routes where non-EU carriers operate. The ongoing renegotiations of air service agreements must continue so that third-country carriers can gradually be taxed on an equal basis with EU carriers.</p>
<p class="contents">Ending the VAT exemption would further level the playing field, and bring fiscal as well as environmental benefits. Colleagues will see that I have brought back an amendment to seek to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">Improvements in air traffic management could reduce average fuel burn by between 8% and 18%, with resultant decreases in all engine emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these measures are necessary, but the main focus of the Commission’s proposals and therefore of my report is on emissions trading. I agree that it has the potential to play a role, but only provided any scheme is properly designed. First, it is clear that other policy instruments must be introduced alongside an emissions trading system to address the full climatic impact. Instruments directly linked to the impact in question, such as a NOx charge, would be most likely to induce the most efficient behaviour, although multipliers on CO2 emissions are an interim alternative. This is crucial, because if there is not a parallel emissions charge or multiplier formula to cover aviation’s non-CO2 impacts, the effect of buying the right to emit a tonne of CO2 from another sector with much lower non-CO2 impacts would actually be a net disbenefit to the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, and crucially, a separate closed system for aviation is crucial at the very least as a pilot scheme because, apart from the administrative difficulties of including aviation in the EU’s general ETS, many sectors already in that scheme are concerned about the possible effect of aviation’s inclusion on carbon prices, noting that as a sheltered sector, aviation will be able tolerate higher prices than many others. There is a very real risk that excessive pressure on vulnerable, energy-intensive industries could lead to a loosening of the overall cap.</p>
<p class="contents">It would also be impractical for aviation to join the general ETS before 2012. I do not think we can afford to wait another six years before we act, so good use could be made of the period 2008-2012 by running at least a pilot scheme. Any arrangement by which aviation was ultimately incorporated into a wider ETS would also need a cap on the number of emission rights the aviation sector could buy from the market to ensure that aviation itself begins to make some of these cuts.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, if colleagues are in any doubt about the importance of a separate scheme, they should consider the words of a chief economist of British Airways, who admitted last week that if airlines joined the existing emissions trading system their emissions would simply continue to grow at an alarming rate: they would simply buy up the right to emit as ever, their own emissions would not go down, and we would still see aviation having a massive accountability for the climate crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I urge colleagues to vote for this report, which will send a very clear signal to the Commission and to the Council that Parliament is looking for ambitious but realistic proposals in this field.</p>

I should also like to thank the European Parliament Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for unanimously adopting the relevant report and the European Parliament Committee on Transport and Tourism and its opinion draftsman, Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert, for agreeing to include aviation in the European Union greenhouse gas trading system.</p>
<p class="contents">The aviation sector contributes approximately 3% to the production of carbon dioxide in the European Union, but this rate is increasing rapidly. As Mrs Lucas said earlier, in a few years' time, by 2012, it will have increased by 150% in comparison with 1990, which is approximately just under 5% per annum.</p>
<p class="contents">This rate of increase in carbon dioxide is, of course, helping to exacerbate the greenhouse effect and it should be noted that it is not only carbon dioxide which aircraft emit; there are other side effects, such as emissions which help to create other greenhouse gases and, as such, the contribution of aviation to the greenhouse effect is much greater than the 3% reported for carbon dioxide.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Lucas also said, the Kyoto Protocol does not extend to limiting emissions of carbon dioxide by aircraft, although there is, of course, a reference in Article 2, paragraph 2. This is precisely why the European Commission will continue its present efforts and step up its efforts in future in order to include aviation and maritime transport in any system agreed for post- 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this period is still several years away and, that being so, the gas trading system now needs, following the European Parliament and Council codecision procedure, to include gases so that we can limit and aviation can help to limit the greenhouse effect and so that this sector does not end up at an advantage compared with the other sectors which help to limit the greenhouse effect. In other words, we do not want the other sectors to fare worse than aviation.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is particularly encouraging both that the relevant reports have been submitted by the parliamentary committees and also that the Council of Ministers for the Environment of the European Union and the Heads of State or Government of the European Union also agreed at the European Council last December to include aviation in the trading system and called on the European Commission to table the relevant legislation under the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make three comments on the points made by the Committee on the Environment and the points raised earlier by Mrs Lucas:</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, would it be better to have a closed or open system for aviation? The European Parliament committee report wants a closed system, a separate system for aviation, either as a permanent system or in a pilot stage up to 2012. The Commission has taken a different approach: it considers that the broader the scope of the trading system, the less it will cost to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and, as a result, aviation will have lower costs without reducing the benefit to the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, I should like to follow on from Mrs Lucas's thoughts on a tax on kerosene, the fuel used for aircraft. It is a fact, as you said earlier, that there are bilateral agreements which basically exempt aviation from payment of tax. Of course, the European Commission has been passing Community legislation since 2003 allowing the Member States to tax fuel on their domestic flights and, following agreement with another country, to allow tax on flights between the two countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is continuing and will continue its efforts towards third countries, in accordance with what you too said earlier, in order to abolish this tax exemption for kerosene, which clearly does not have positive environmental results.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I should like to make a comment about the geographical scope of the trading system: the Commission has proposed including all flights from airports in the European Union and the parliamentary committee has proposed including all flights to or from airports in the European Union and flights which cross the airspace of the European Union. We consider that the Commission's approach is simpler and more effective and could make it easier to extend the system to other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Without doubt, however, as Parliament and as the airlines themselves and non-governmental organisations have proposed including all flights to and from airports in the European Union, the Commission will examine this approach during the course of the detailed study of the impact this will have before submitting its proposal during the codecision procedure which we hope to have before the end of the current year.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say that, without doubt, in addition to including aviation in the trading system, there are other measures, such as those you mention: improvement of air traffic, investment in research, so that more environmentally-friendly technologies can be developed, improved and used, the possible use of biofuels in airlines – although this last option is still at the research stage – and a series of other measures which can be applied in parallel in order to mitigate the impact of aviation on climate change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I very much endorse the remarks he addressed to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. Indeed, in a communication by the Commission, different options are being examined and a more consistent application of energy levies is also briefly looked at. At the same time, the Commission recognises that this latter cannot be seen as a cornerstone of a strategy for fighting climate change effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">In the end, the Commission concluded in its communication that market-based instruments are by far the most effective. It settled on the trade in emission rights, and that is a conclusion I fully endorse. It is environmentally effective and economically efficient. In recent months, as is still the case today, a great deal of hard work has gone into further fleshing out this initiative, including its scope, and I have tried, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, to draft a realistic opinion. The goal is, after all, to develop at the earliest opportunity a model that is as workable as possible and that can be extended worldwide.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite all the appreciation I have for Mrs Lucas herself, my amazement was nevertheless considerable when I read the final version of her report which is totally devoid of any realism or workable solutions. The resolution has been decorated with the proverbial Christmas baubles. One such Christmas bauble is, for example, the C02 multiplier, while the CE study shows that including non-C02 effects is very difficult to measure. Also, it harps on endlessly about kerosene tax as being the panacea for all environmental problems and much more. With all due respect, while a tax of this kind is good for the coffers, its environmental effectiveness has not been proven in any way.</p>
<p class="contents">Do not get me wrong, I too would prefer to see all transport modalities treated the same way, but I would urge you to take all aspects into consideration, including, for example, the way in which the infrastructure is financed. Moreover, this discussion takes the attention away from what this is really about, namely a swift integration of aviation in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU-ETS), and as Commissioner Dimas was right to point out a moment ago, a directive that allows Member States to apply fuel tax to domestic flights is already in force, something which only the Netherlands has taken up so far. I would therefore ask you to shift your attention to this.</p>
<p class="contents">I have taken the liberty of applying for a list of separate votes and votes in sections, in the hope of removing all Christmas baubles from the resolution. Should this prove impossible during the vote, then I will ask for my name to be removed from this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The adverse effects of air transport on the climate are considerable, and are rapidly becoming more acute. For this reason, the Commission must lose no time in presenting us with legislative proposals on how to remedy this problem. We cannot use the argument that air transport makes up only a small percentage of total global emissions. We keep hearing this in debates on climate: that the individual emitter is only ever responsible for a proportion of the emissions. If each individual emitter talks his way out of it by arguing that he is only responsible for a small proportion, however, we shall never see an active fight against climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the EU already imposes very heavy taxes, charges and environmental requirements on other modes of transport such as buses, railways and even cars. Operators of bus or railway enterprises, for example, cannot see why we are imposing heavy charges on them – relatively environmentally friendly modes of transport – yet have thus far imposed such small charges on the relatively environmentally unfriendly aeroplane. This distorts competition not only between the various modes of transport, but also – and this is a point I should like to make in view of the holiday period in Europe – between holiday regions.</p>
<p class="contents">There are European holiday regions to which Europeans normally travel by bus, train or car, and there are others that are primarily reached by aeroplane. In the region from which I come, representatives of hotels, other establishments providing food and drink, and other tourism enterprises openly complain that, to give an example, the taxes that a Dutchman would have to pay if he flew from Amsterdam to Turkey are very much lower than those he would pay if he took the bus to a mountainous area in Germany or France. That is a distortion of competition that we need to remedy.</p>
<p class="contents">We should, however, be careful in our choice of instruments for this purpose, so that we do not create new distortions of competition. For example, it is important that we take care that the instruments chosen give rise to the minimum possible distortion of competition between the European airlines and their non-European competitors. In our view, the original draft prepared by Mrs Lucas had a number of weaknesses in this regard. For this reason, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has drafted some amendments and has also endorsed a number of amendments along the same lines from the Committee on Transport and Tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">Focusing our discussion exclusively or primarily on the kerosene tax is unlikely to solve the problem. We should concentrate on other instruments: namely a fundamentally redesigned emissions trading scheme that remedies the weaknesses of the present scheme, plus a mixture of other instruments. What is important is that emissions trading should cover not only flights within Europe, but also intercontinental traffic, or at least that which takes off and lands in Europe. It goes without saying that we want to see a worldwide system as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The weaknesses in the present Emissions Trading Scheme need to be overcome: that means less bureaucracy, a uniform allocation method throughout Europe and greater recognition of past performance. This is one of the reasons for my plea, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, for a separate scheme – as this will mean that the shortcomings can be remedied more quickly than if the deficient scheme were adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wants to see an impact assessment, and I assume that the Commission will soon be presenting one. In addition, in the context of all the emphasis on emissions trading, we should like to see equal priority being given to further pursuing other measures, such as air-traffic management.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also reflect on the fact that one way of remedying distortions of competition is to reduce taxes on environmentally friendly modes of transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament support her on many points – with the exception of the one about creating a separate emissions trading scheme for air transport.</p>
<p class="contents">From 1990 to 2002, the CO2 emissions from international air traffic that were generated by the 25 EU Member States rose by 60%. In addition, the altitude at which air traffic produces emissions means that their impact on the climate is far greater than their quantity would suggest.</p>
<p class="contents">Heavy fuel taxation is common practice in Europe, yet almost nowhere in it is aviation fuel taxed. This has a considerable impact on the competitiveness of the other modes of transport. Long-distance rail transport is stagnating. Parliament should give its resounding support to the Commission’s intention of further pursuing the introduction of kerosene taxes, and implementing these as quickly as possible. The EU must take the lead on this and set a good example by taking timely action at regional level.</p>
<p class="contents">This report does not discuss only the kerosene tax, however, but also the massive distortion of competition caused by tax exemptions on air transport. Rail transport is subject to taxes and to the Emissions Trading Scheme, which entails considerable cost increases for this environmentally friendly mode of transport. Emissions trading is not a replacement for the measures needed to reduce climate change impact, but it has the potential to be, provided it is properly organised.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already emphasised, we support the Commission’s proposal to integrate air transport into the existing Emissions Trading Scheme, but we also support paragraph 24, which calls for a pilot phase of a separate scheme covering the period 2008–2012. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is thanks to the breaking of national monopolies that there are now such unparalleled opportunities, mainly for the middle class, to enjoy holidays abroad. My own assistant just popped over to Stockholm this weekend for an engagement party – not even a wedding, just an engagement party. We all enjoy this, but I think we have to remember that the poorest in society, let alone the poorest across the world, are denied these opportunities. Whatever the price of the air fare, they cannot afford the holidays at the other end; but for those of us in a privileged position it is fantastic.</p>
<p class="contents">The trouble is the predicted growth is so great as to wipe out the gains being made in reducing carbon dioxide in other sectors. A big airline operator in the UK told me they expect a 60% increase in the use of their planes over the next six years alone. That is a fantastic and terrible rate of growth. What the lobbying letters from the aviation industry are really saying, putting forward every excuse in the world, is this: ‘just don’t touch us, we are somehow special. Our growth and our profits must be protected. Do not take measures against us. The future of the world can go to hell, frankly, just so long as we are protected’.</p>
<p class="contents">They want to be included in the Commission’s emission trading scheme, and you may ask why. It is because they know it is not going to be consequential on their profits. The socialists are now saying yes, we are backing the capitalists in this. I think they should look at this again. The point is that the aviation industry says a closed scheme would be a tax. Yes, in effect it would be a tax, but it would be a flexible tax rewarding those who take measures to try to introduce the best technology and to make maximum use of their planes.</p>
<p class="contents">Technological development is what we really need to promote. Our message to the airline industry should be this: expand as you like, but find ways of doing it without increasing CO2 emissions. We do not want to stop air travel, we simply want to ensure that its growth is not at the expense of our children and our future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Emissions from air traffic are growing faster than any other source of carbon dioxide emissions, and the other emissions and impact of aviation more than double its effect on global warming. Since 1990, greenhouse emissions from air traffic within the European Union have increased by 85%, which is 4% a year. This threatens to wipe out a quarter of the reductions in emissions achieved in other sectors for the prohibition period. This cannot be allowed to continue.</p>
<p class="contents">Emissions from air traffic are by far the greatest per kilometre travelled. For example, the impact is fifteen times greater than that of trains. Every aspect of air travel, however, is subsidised, including fuel, which is not subject to taxation. On the other hand, rail traffic is taxed in a number of ways, and it is also affected by the trade in carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">The ‘polluter pays’ principle must be extended to flight, in such a way, obviously, that it does not lead to distortion of competition, although current tax breaks for aviation and other preferential treatment are a distortion of competition in themselves. The next global climate agreement should cover air traffic, but there are good reasons now for extending emissions trading to all flights arriving in and departing from the European Union, preferably based on a separate emissions trading system, to make the incentive for reducing emissions effective.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, every one of us flies, and we do so quite a lot. Every one of us can do something too. We can compensate for the emissions from our own air travel voluntarily. There are organisations which calculate flight emissions per passenger and through them you can finance an equivalent amount of investment to reduce emissions in the developing countries. I myself started compensating for the emissions from my own flights last year, and now I have paid compensation for all the flights I have taken since I was elected to the European Parliament. I call on all my fellow Members to do likewise – we can afford to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I support the gist of the Commission’s proposal in which it wishes to put a check on the fast growing share of aviation in climate change. Mrs Lucas’s report complements the proposal well, and we share her view that including the aviation sector in emissions trading should not be the only instrument, but should form part of a package of measures, such as introducing kerosene tax, VAT on plane tickets and congestion tax for airports. Like the rapporteur, I take the view that the emission rights to be issued should be auctioned in order to avoid large enterprises feathering their own nests with free rights, without the environment benefiting in any way.</p>
<p class="contents">Although my group sees the Commission proposal as a step in the right direction, we should not overestimate the importance of emissions trading, whose environmental benefits have not been proven beyond any doubt. Moreover, CO2 is not the only problem aviation faces. The emission of nitrogen oxide (NOx) is also enormously important, not only in terms of the climate, but also air quality. That is why we are in favour of including NOx in emissions trading, which is what is already happening in the Netherlands, certainly if a separate system is being set up for aviation anyway.</p>
<p class="contents">A system that addresses CO2 alone will not yield the maximum effect. It would be preferable to tackle NOx at the same time. We agree with the rapporteur that research into cleaner engines is needed, but this should not yet again mean that specific measures against said emissions will be shelved. If NOx is not included in emissions trading – and it now looks unlikely that it will be – airports must be encouraged to impose local emission levies as part of the package of measures set out by the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">My party supports the Commission’s intention to end the tax benefits which the aviation sector enjoys internationally. This has led to unfair competition between different modes of transport for longer than anyone can remember. We therefore support the rapporteur’s proposal which indicates that the EU should take the initiative to introduce a kerosene tax on all domestic flights. This could prove an effective brake on the tremendous growth in the number of cheap flights against which rail is hardly equipped to compete.</p>
<p class="contents">Budget airlines already account for a quarter of European air traffic, which has, above all, resulted in the growth of regional airports. It is important for the Member States to give us an insight into subsidies that are channelled to those airports with the intention of attracting airline companies. We must move away from the idea that the increase in air traffic within the EU is a driving force of regional growth. For many of these medium-long distances, rail connections are a much more environmentally-friendly alternative, provided that there is a level playing field.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the introduction of emissions trading, rail has been paying a much higher price for electricity, but airline companies still do not pay a cent of excise despite their constant moaning and groaning about high fuel prices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It takes longer for winter to set in, and when it does, it is increasingly milder, and summer starts earlier and is increasingly warmer. Is this an inevitable process? I hope not. We should, though, pull out all the stops to ensure that this trend is bucked. That is why I agree with the Commission’s communication. If we want to fight climate change effectively, all sectors must do their bit, certainly the aviation sector, which is responsible for high-altitude emissions and which has, as such, an extraordinary impact.</p>
<p class="contents">I can go along with the plan to set up an emissions trading system for aviation too, provided this meets a number of conditions. First of all, since it must encompass as many companies and routes as possible in order to fight unfair competition, it should apply to all flights out of, and into, all the EU's airports. Secondly, efforts which companies have already made to limit their emissions should be taken into consideration. I would also prefer for allowances to be handed out on the basis of an auction. Thirdly, it should become possible to include substances other than C02 if this can be backed by scientific proof.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, the VAT exemption for kerosene and plane tickets should be abandoned, provided this is done in an all-inclusive plan in which the VAT exemptions for other modes of transport are also reviewed. In the framework of the discussion on Eurovignette, the Commission has promised to carry out a study into the internalisation of external costs for all modes of transport. I should like to call for this study to be completed promptly, so that the results can be made available as soon as possible and we can adopt legislation that takes these results into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the number and extent of environmental problems caused by air travel have also shown a proportional increase.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, aeroplanes account for only 3% of the European Union's total greenhouse emissions, but the rapid annual increase of almost 5% means that it is now time to act. Europe has assumed a pioneering role by deciding to take action in this area, in conformance with the Kyoto principles.</p>
<p class="contents">However, pioneering actions always involve risks. Therefore, we must make sure that the measures taken do not place European airlines at a competitive disadvantage. At the same time, we must find a solution that effectively encourages the sector to reduce atmospheric pollution. I personally believe in market instruments, which is why I support the introduction of an adequately developed emission trading system in this area too.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we make maximum use of the reserves still left in the current imperfect system. I am thinking, primarily, of improvements in air transport organisation. This is important both in respect of atmospheric pollution and noise pollution caused by aeroplanes. We need to reconsider the logic of making detours to avoid military facilities, and we must make every effort to avoid flights over inhabited areas, because the increase in air traffic is affecting the lives of more and more European citizens, and is leading to increasingly frequent protests from the population.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle and the objective are clear. Our mobility should not have harmful effects on our health or on the condition of our environment. I hope that we will be able to achieve this, and I congratulate the rapporteur for a report showing plenty of initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has drafted an excellent report that encapsulates the problems in aviation and the dilemmas associated with them.</p>
<p class="contents">What do those problems in aviation amount to? First of all, aviation contributes hugely to climate change: per passenger and per kilometre, the C02 emission in aviation is considerably higher than in transport by train or even by car. Certainly for short distances, the burden on the environment is high and it is precisely when short distances are involved that there are alternatives, of which, at present, too little use is being made.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem is that too few people are aware of the major environmental burden that aviation presents. That is why it would be good if tickets and cars were to display the CO2 emission per km. I would welcome initiatives to that effect, Commissioner. To us in this House, it would be useful to know exactly what the CO2 emission is when we travel to Brussels or Strasbourg by car, train or plane.</p>
<p class="contents">The third problem is that the environmental tax is in no way reflected in the costs. Flying is unnaturally cheap. It is mystifying why the aviation sector should still be exempt from VAT. This puts the more environmentally-friendly transport methods, such as trains or buses, at a disadvantage. This phenomenon can, and indeed should, be stopped without delay. It is, in any case, of the utmost importance that aviation be brought, at the earliest opportunity, within a system of tradable emissions rights. This would give C02 a price tag and promote innovation, particularly more efficient engines and more economical and better use of fuel. In my view, it is obvious to use the existing emissions trading system as a basis, as long as we avoid the mistakes that were made in that system. Instead of free allocation, I would prefer to see auctioning. It also goes without saying that kerosene should be taxed.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth problem is that it is not easy to tackle the aviation sector. Aviation is a source of both employment and enjoyment for consumers and tourists alike. That is why it is important to operate at European level and at the same time to invest in comfortable high-speed connections between the European cities. This would be an ambitious policy, and one to which the public would be sure to give its backing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Worldwide and also in the EU, aviation is a growth sector, providing employment for more than four million Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">Although aviation accounts for only approximately 3% of global CO2 emissions, this proportion is growing constantly. The objective of our policy must be to reduce the climate-change impact without also reducing growth in this key sector. The growth and competitiveness of our airlines must not conflict with the reduction of greenhouse gases. The choice of instruments is vital to achieving this objective. The introduction of a kerosene tax and the levying of departure or airline-ticket taxes would only result in dampening demand. Making flying more expensive would reduce greenhouse gases, but only at the expense of growth, which is not absolutely necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The incorporation of aviation into the Emissions Trading Scheme, as proposed by the Commission, is a better alternative from an environmental and economic point of view. Emissions trading that is limited to the EU must offer guarantees that European airlines are not put at a disadvantage in comparison to other airlines. In addition, emissions trading must not become an end in itself, but must primarily create incentives for investment in improved technologies. The promotion of technology holds the key to harmonising the objectives of growth and reduction of CO2 emissions. The European aviation and space-travel industry, in particular, has made a decisive contribution to the development of engines with greater fuel efficiency, and thus of cleaner aircraft.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the promotion of technology, two further aspects need to be taken into account that have been neglected in the debate on reducing emissions. Firstly, the creation of a single European airspace and air traffic control area – the ‘Single European Sky’ project – and secondly the extension of airports. Even without regulatory enthusiasm, we can achieve a considerable reduction in greenhouse gases by reducing flying distances and avoiding stacking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Action in terms of quotas is preferable to free and complicated allocation. It is important for us to make a clear decision about separate trading systems for aviation. That is only logical because the climate change impact of aviation is two to four times greater than the impact of carbon dioxide alone. Aviation would therefore be placed at an undue advantage if it were to form part of the general system, and the fight against climate change would become less cost-effective.</p>
<p class="contents">Aviation is expanding rapidly. It is a kind of tax haven of the skies, with exemption from VAT and fuel tax being the most serious aspect of this. All this is of most benefit to the richest people in society, who are the most frequent fliers. Paradoxically enough, it would, then, be those on low incomes who would benefit most from increased emissions charges, for these would reduce the amount of state income needed from other areas, such as rail travel, in which those on low incomes account for a larger share of the market. I am very pleased about the support for separate systems shown by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and I expect the Socialist Group in the European Parliament also to stand up for the less well off. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Qualification requirements for crews, the infrastructure of the individual forms of transport, the fuel or energy required to keep things running, unified operating rules for a given form of transport, environmental impact and how to assess it – there are indeed many aspects to consider, all the way from research and development to the investigation of accidents. This is why the report under discussion is attracting so much interest from the experts in the field.</p>
<p class="contents">A basic requirement when introducing any measure is to ensure fair competition. It is therefore necessary to require that the introduction of carbon dioxide emission permits for aviation fulfils paragraph 32 of the motion for a resolution in the sense of the Kyoto Protocol, in other words with no growth in emissions compared to the base year, and that this applies to all organisations. In the modern age, aviation is always in the forefront when it comes to introducing new technical solutions. It is therefore sure to provide an example in cutting other emissions, although establishing limits is a matter for further negotiation. Despite this, it is necessary to establish standards for volatile hydrocarbons – especially aromatic ones – and solid particulates, oxides of nitrogen and other factors such as noise on an equal basis for all users of the European Union’s air space, in such a way that EU transport firms do not suffer discrimination through the selective application of limits.</p>
<p class="contents">It is similarly desirable to support the use of biofuels. We must not allow unfair competition from foreign transport firms through the introduction of VAT, and it is essential to coordinate such a step across the entire aviation sector and not just within the EU. The operation as a whole will certainly be complex but it is feasible, as long as the conditions set out in the report are adhered to. On behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I therefore strongly urge all Members to endorse the report on reducing the climate change impact of aviation, including our amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude with the comment that flights by military aircraft and helicopters used for espionage and guard duties constitute a significant source of emissions. Let us try to reduce them, Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Air transport is vital to the EU’s economy, accounting for up to 8% of GDP, boosting productivity, attracting investment and encouraging tourism. Air transport has become an integral part of society, allowing us to travel long distances quickly, but also strengthening Europe’s integration, prosperity and political importance. Aviation facilitates social cohesion and cultural exchange. Strategically, air transport is of critical importance, particularly for peripheral regions and islands such as Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">It is easy to exaggerate the contribution from aviation to the present problem of climate change, and emissions from all transport sectors are of concern to the air quality issue and the climate change debate, which is the number one item on every environment agenda. We should not be singling out aviation and ignoring shipping and the considerably greater impact from increasing road transport and car usage.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2003, total emissions from flights into and out of the EU 25 Member States contributed 3.4% of CO2 emissions, which was equivalent to 0.5% of worldwide emissions in this area. Air transport is treated differently under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in terms of how its greenhouse gas emissions are accounted for. It is not directly included in the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">While we should acknowledge the advances made by the European aviation industry’s voluntary initiative, the Emissions Containment Policy, with EU air traffic movements set to double by 2020 over the 2003 level, the real question is whether, on the basis of the polluter pays principle, this voluntary initiative will be adequate to counteract rising emissions from air transport. Do we need legislation?</p>
<p class="contents">Interestingly, a recent House of Lords report on aviation’s contribution to climate change stated that it was insignificant and likely to remain so for 30 years. The industry itself claims that fuel efficiency, direct routing and new technology have already achieved a 70% reduction in aircraft emissions over the last 30 years and that air traffic management, improved holding patterns over airports, and replacement of older planes with state-of-the-art technology in fleet renewal could reduce climate-change impact even further as the number of flights increases each year.</p>
<p class="contents">An emissions trading scheme and auctioning rights are worth investigating, but, I ask the Commissioner, would a stand-alone or closed ETS for aviation not fall at the first hurdle, since all the trading entities would be net buyers and there would be no market? A possible solution, following a comprehensive impact assessment, would appear to be incorporation of aviation into a reviewed existing ETS, with the proviso that all flights landing and taking off in Europe must be included. This should ideally be part of a global solution, with industry and governments sitting down with the International Civil Aviation Organization, as Article 2(2) of the Kyoto Protocol suggests. Do not hold your breath.</p>
<p class="contents">Any economic instruments must have clear environmental objectives, rather than fiscal ones, and must be part of an overall package that addresses technological, operational and infrastructural improvements. An open skies agreement, reducing stacking and taxiing time through better air traffic control management and improved scheduling and coordination within a single European sky policy must all be part of a comprehensive policy mix. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Flying as we do every week to one of the EU's capitals, we should be particularly concerned about making aviation a more environmentally friendly mode of transport. In policies concerning the effect of aviation on climate change, the ‘polluter pays’ principle must be upheld. It is regrettable that air transport does not cover the external expenditure which arises as a result of its effect on the climate. The logical thing would be to include aviation in the EU's trading system for greenhouse gas emission allowances. The funds raised by the collection of such taxes could be invested in new technology dedicated to the production of ‘cleaner’ aircraft. The expansion of rail and bus transport could reduce both the pressure on overloaded airports and the pollution emitted by aviation. Unfortunately, the rail and road networks in Lithuania and the other Baltic countries are not integrated into the EU's infrastructure. They are outmoded and overloaded. If the ‘Via Baltica’ and more importantly the ‘Rail Baltica’ projects fail to receive special EU attention, it will be a long time before rail and road transport in this region are able to help aviation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Lucas’s report meets with my agreement to a great extent and hence I will confine myself to making some general comments on the subject matter under discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we all agree that the dangerous trend of increasing aviation emissions has to be checked. In my view, the simple, common sense options for a solution offering a reduction in aviation emissions are the following.</p>
<p class="contents">First, a general reduction in air travel through encouragement of the use of other, less polluting means of transport, such as rail transport. For this to be achieved, there has to be genuinely fair competition, which historically there has not been. It almost escapes logical explanation why today aviation is still not subject to fuel tax or VAT, and this anachronism surely needs to be corrected. The corresponding air-fare price increases that will result will not only make people use, when possible, alternative, more environmentally-friendly means of transport, but may cause them to limit their travelling altogether, which is not a bad thing.</p>
<p class="contents">The second option is the improvement of the fuel efficiency of aviation engines. For this to be achieved, novel engine technology research and development needs to be promoted even more intensively. State assistance to that end should be encouraged most strongly.</p>
<p class="contents">The third option is the introduction and promotion of aviation fuels which have less impact on the environment. In this respect, more research should be encouraged into novel fuels such as biofuels.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth option would be the phasing-out of old inefficient aircraft, some of which cause two or three times as much damage to the environment as more modern aircraft. To this end, the airline industry must be given clear incentives for regularly upgrading their aircraft.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, there is the option of operating a more efficient service. There has already been mention of aircraft holding circles and running half-empty aircraft. Surely there is scope for improvement in efficiency in that area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This means that around 110 000 aircraft produce emissions that irreversibly pollute the air every day. It is estimated that by 2050 the amount of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere by the airline industry will reach 5% (in 2000 this figure stood at 2%). In accordance with Eurocontrol forecasts, by 2020 the number of flights in the European Union will more than double compared to 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">This data shows that the negative effects of the growth of the aviation industry outweigh its benefits for society in terms of technological progress. We have to try to limit these harmful effects on the environment while maintaining the principle of competitiveness within the growing cheap airlines market, as these airlines have become incredibly popular in Europe. We should also remember that the air transport sector generates around four million jobs, and that is why it is vital to carry out a detailed investigation into the influence of the airline industry on air pollution and the increase in noise levels.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the main pressure should be placed on trade in emission permits and the creation of an appropriate system for enforcing this method. The system for trade in permits for aviation should cover all flights to and from all airports on European Union territory, regardless of the country of origin of the airline. If possible, it should also cover intercontinental transit flights passing through European Union airspace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unilateral measures at national level such as airline-ticket taxes and kerosene taxes will not work. Emissions trading in air transport is the right course of action but, from a transport-policy point of view – or from my point of view – the main instruments contained in the Lucas report are wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we need aviation to be included in the existing EU Emissions Trading Scheme. A separate scheme would be counterproductive and would stall the growth in air transport. That conflicts with our Lisbon Strategy. Why is that the case? There is no market without suppliers and, in the early days, air transport will buy only on the basis of its growth rates and of technical innovations for the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, a separate scheme would require a new administrative structure and contradict our intention to strive for better lawmaking. What would we then do with other modes of transport? Would we need further schemes? This does not make any sense.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I reject the inclusion of non-CO2 climate-change impacts through multipliers. Let us look at Switzerland, Sweden and the United Kingdom, where the NOx problem is regulated by means of landing charges. It makes sense to do it that way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the time, Europe was stepping into unknown territory, because there was only very little theoretical research into the effects of emissions trading. Now, however, those effects are very well known, especially those which hamper European competitiveness, as well as the effects which, paradoxically, damage the global environment.</p>
<p class="contents">As we are now extending the front where the fight against climate change is taking place, we can no longer afford to make the same mistakes again. It is in this context now that the call in this report for the EU to show leadership in the fight against climate change by taking regional and early action reminds me too much of an attitude for which at present we are paying rather a high price. It cannot be considered leadership when we act alone, while others show their support from the sidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that we have to address the problem of emissions from aviation, but the success of the project itself will be decided by the remedies chosen to achieve the goal. Now that we are wise when it comes to the current emissions trading scheme, we know that we need a common global way forward, so that the environment might benefit from it best. If the proposed actions, therefore, are to be realised, they will need to be examined much more widely and approached with caution, because we now need workable practices rather than ideology.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of my initiative and in the name of our group, we have tabled an amendment in which we insist on a clear evaluation of the effects being made, caps on emissions being defined, and an explanation regarding what agency will in practice be responsible for the action to bring about reductions as called for, and, in particular, how we are to ensure that airlines outside the EU are also involved in emissions trading. If we do not have this knowledge base, once again we will be building a house of cards.</p>
<p class="contents">Other options for emissions trading itself should also be studied. The priority remedies are, for example, the development of technology and the smooth flow of air traffic itself, because a good number of emissions are the result of using obsolete fleets and airport congestion.</p>
<p class="contents">It was therefore regrettable that with the emissions directive we made such unsatisfactory progress in such a crucial area. With the Commission now drafting its own proposal on emissions trading in aviation, it is surely time for it to make a comeback. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, there is sufficient evidence in the public domain that appears to contradict what is called for as a solution in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Doyle mentioned, the UK House of Lords recently finalised a report on the effects of aviation on climate change. As she said, it states that the effect would be insignificant and likely to remain so for 30 years. Commissioner, Mrs Lucas, I have a copy of that report with me tonight. I would very much welcome your views on its contents.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, as Mrs Doyle mentioned, figures published by IATA show that over the last 40 years, through technological development, aircraft are 70% more fuel efficient. I have no doubt that such technological advances will continue to improve the situation. We can already see that in the new generation of aircraft: the Airbus 380 and the Boeing 787. Given those two factors I suspect that the report’s author is more guilty of wishful thinking than scientific fact.</p>
<p class="contents">One of my main concerns when addressing the topic is that Europe tries to act alone, making decisions which could potentially place EU airlines at a competitive disadvantage. There are international organisations – one of which is the International Civil Aviation Organization – that regulate the industry at a global level. I believe any action that is necessary should be taken at that level. In my view what is needed is incontrovertible scientific evidence, not speculation. That is why I support a full impact assessment being carried out before any proposals are brought forward.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be careful in the messages that we send out, not only to the aviation industry, which contributes greatly to all our countries’ economies, but also to our citizens, who I believe have the right to continue to enjoy affordable air travel, whether on business or for pleasure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In closing this debate, I should like to say that the Community initiative in the sector in question is extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Bradbourn said, aviation is a global sector and, as such, responsibility for the matters in question must lie with the International Civil Aviation Organization, and account must be taken of scientific results and scientific proof and of the very important study carried out by the House of Lords committee, which I too have seen. Without doubt, we shall have a full impact study to support our legislative proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say that there is excellent cooperation between the European Union and the International Civil Aviation Organization. On the question of climate change, in particular, we must take action at European Union level, including for the simple reason that the European Union agreed in the Sixth Community Action Programme that it must determine, propose and take measures if the International Civil Aviation Organization failed to propose the relevant measures by 2002. This deadline expired a long time ago. Consequently, we must take action and, as I said earlier, the European Council called on the Commission last December to submit the relevant legislative proposal under the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">In all events, the action we are examining will not contradict the European Union's commitments towards the International Civil Aviation Organization, given that the Civil Aviation Organization itself is in favour of an open system of emissions trading; in other words, it has accepted that emissions from international aviation will come under the current national systems of emissions trading rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposal moves in precisely this direction. Last year, as you know, the Community trading rights system was put into practice. This is the first and the largest international trading system and now, of course, is the best time for us to extend it by including aviation in a way that is compatible with the International Civil Aviation Organization.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union accounts for approximately 50% of total carbon dioxide emissions by international aviation, compared with Annex I countries, in other words countries which have restrictions in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol. Consequently, the measure recommended by the Commission will doubtless have important repercussions. We hope that this example will be followed by other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should also like to refer to the concerns expressed to the effect that our proposal will put European companies at a disadvantage, compared with companies in third countries. This is not the case; there is no such risk because, under the Commission proposal, the trading system will cover all airlines operating flights in the geographical area, within the geographical scope of the system, irrespective of nationality.</p>
<p class="contents">This means, therefore, that airlines in the European Union will be treated in exactly the same way as their foreign competitors. I hope that plenary will approve the motion and support the Commission's proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to point to the danger of proposing measures aimed at increasing kerosene prices, take-off and landing fees or flight ticket prices, since these measures would have a direct impact on users, who would have to shoulder any increase in prices by airlines.</p>
<p class="contents">This increase would harm tourist areas, such as the islands, and would increase the costs of imported products, which would have a negative impact for consumers living in island regions.
