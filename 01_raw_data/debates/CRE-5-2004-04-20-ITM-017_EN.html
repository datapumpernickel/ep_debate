Nevertheless, the Member States are free to apply these Directives in the manner they consider most appropriate to satisfying national conditions and needs, and also to establish stricter minimum rules provided that they conform to Community rules and, in particular, the principles of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, we are leaving a margin for subsidiarity in order to adapt and apply the Directives in the most appropriate way in line with the reality and diversity of the various Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers it essential to guarantee a common level of true openness of the electricity markets of the various States and under equal conditions. Within this context, following the adoption of Directive 96/92/EC, that is, the first Directive on electricity, the Commission published an annual comparative evaluation report in which it examined the application of the internal market in gas and electricity in all the States of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">These reports demonstrated a significant difference between the true levels of openness of the market. This led the Commission to propose a second package of legislative measures to complete the internal market in electricity and to prevent the tensions and distortions which were arising and these measures include Directive 2003/54/EC and Regulation 1228/2003, which Parliament and the Council adopted last June and which will enter into force in July 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The new legislation lays down common minimum rules on market openness which are much higher both in quantitative terms, that is to say, the minimum level of openness of the market, and in qualitative terms: legal separation, regulated access for third countries etc.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the quantitative measures, two stages are proposed: a first stage, July 2004, when the consumer market other than homes has to be opened up to competition, and in July 2007, 100% of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, this will result in a reduction of the current asymmetries between the various European Union markets, and will make it possible to achieve what has been the aim since the first Directive: to integrate the European area into a single electricity and gas market, doing away with the borders that remain today and preventing something we do not want: 15 markets, or 25 markets from 1 May, in electricity and gas. This is not our aim. Our aim is to create a European market, an integrated single market in electricity and gas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In any event, we are going to continue carrying out periodic analyses of the true picture of the implementation of the measures adopted and naturally – I repeat – if any Member State fails to implement the Directives and Regulations properly and does not put them into practice appropriately, Mr Ebner, I have no doubt that we will bring the matter before the Court of Justice of the European Communities in Luxembourg, as we did in certain cases in which there was a delay, for example, in implementing the gas Directive or, simply, a transposition not complying with the content of the Directive. In both cases we referred the matter to the Court of Justice and we resolved them amicably with the States in question without the need for an arduous procedure.</p>

Integrating the Iberian market is a very ambitious task. There is also a merging of certain bodies and, furthermore, I believe that recently a certain well-known person has been appointed or selected, who is going to do an excellent job of his new responsibilities in relation to development, specifically on the Portuguese side, as the former Portuguese Minister for the Economy is well aware, and I hope that it will soon be a reality. Furthermore, I hope that this will serve to facilitate not just an integrated Iberian market, but also the incorporation of that market into the European market as a whole. In this regard, we have already talked about other chapters, both the infrastructures for interconnecting the Iberian Peninsula with the rest of the Continent via France, which are needed, and also the regulation we have adopted, the application of which I hope will facilitate trade.</p>
<p class="contents">The voluntary agreements which have been implemented are functioning in a very positive way and are facilitating exchanges in the electricity sector to an enormous degree.</p>

The Forum's report is expected to contain three main sections. A confirmation of the principles agreed at international and European level, an analysis of the factors which hamper and the factors which contribute to the success of corporate social responsibility and a series of recommendations on corporate social responsibility for the attention of the members of the Forum or the institutions of the European Union and other agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">The report will be based on the results of discussions and the knowledge acquired from a series of round table events held between January 2003 and March 2004 in order to analyse some 50 multilateral case studies.</p>
<p class="contents">As stated in the Commission communication on corporate social responsibility in June 2002 and in the interim review of the social political agenda in March 2003, the Commission will evaluate the results of the Forum and will issue a new communication a few months after the submission of the Forum's report.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has been involved in the Multistakeholder Forum procedure since the outset, with the MEP Richard Howitt acting as observer. Consequently, he will be invited to the high-level meeting on 29 June and will receive a copy of the Forum's report as soon as it has been approved and submitted to the Commission. The new communication on corporate social responsibility will be addressed to the institutions of the European Union. I therefore expect the dialogue on this matter to continue and to bear fruit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We would like to see a clear timetable emerging in June, and not postponement to some vague point in the future. I am very pleased that the Commissioner responsible for development has come in at this point as I wish to ask which Commission department – Social Affairs or other – will continue to lead in this area, and how coordination will continue within the Commission, because this issue cuts across many different departments there. I would also like to ensure that a range of parliamentary committees are also involved in the follow-up. This is an issue of extreme importance to Members of this Parliament and, if we are re-elected, we will keep pushing it forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is very positive that all the agencies invited to take part in the Forum accepted the invitation and that significant progress has been made and that everyone has agreed, as you said, for the process to continue. Of course, the Commission sees the Forum not as an advisory committee or as an opportunity for friendly professional discussion, but as a challenging experiment and as an excellent opportunity for the various interested parties to develop a joint approach to this issue. The Forum's objective is to give credibility to this entire process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is therefore waiting for the specific results and, moreover, for a roadmap to be drawn up with the action which needs to be taken not only by the European Commission, but also by the members of the Forum themselves, either alone or jointly with others.

I am glad that Mr Howitt was there for some of the time because he was rapporteur for the Green Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I hope that you were also glad that I was there for some of the time as rapporteur on the White Paper. The intention is that I will be the parliamentary representative on 19 June, as an observer, to which I look forward. I believe that formal invitations will only be sent on 17 May, which is after Parliament has risen. It would be helpful if the invitations could be officially sent earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">It would also be helpful – and perhaps the Commissioner could confirm this – if the invitations were accompanied by a draft of the proposals that will be discussed in June. I am sure that those who attend – and not just the observers – would wish to have as much notice as possible of the proposals for discussion rather than just find out what they are on the day they arrive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Closure of the Bombardier company's European plants</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Canadian group Bombardier has recently announced its intention to close seven of its European production plants: those at Amadora (Portugal), Derby Pride Park, Doncaster and Wakefield (UK), Ammendorf (Germany), Kalmar (Sweden) and Pratteln (Switzerland). Such closures are part of the company's restructuring plan, which involves the dismissal over the next two years of 6 600 workers in various parts of the world, though principally (86% of the total) in Europe. In Portugal, closure of the Bombardier factory in Amadora will put nearly 400 people out of work and will also affect jobs at, and the economic viability of, various related companies.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when Europe is preparing to launch vital railway projects, strategic intervention is called for in order to ensure that Bombardier and other, similar companies continue to operate in EU countries, thereby safeguarding jobs and furthering technological development. What action is the Commission proposing to take in this area?</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission not concerned at the serious implications which closure of the Bombardier plant in Portugal will have? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must tell you that the vice-president of the company sent me a letter informing the Commission of its restructuring plans. In the reply which I sent a short while ago, I express our acute concern and repeat the basic principles which we consider are of fundamental importance in managing restructuring. Restructuring can have serious repercussions on the social fabric of any region, especially in those regions in which there is already little potential for job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can assure the honourable Member that it is using all its powers in this sector. These powers are, first, the legislative measures which exist. We have various directives which seek to guarantee that the workers are fully involved in the decision-making procedure in the event of restructuring. The directive on collective redundancies, the directive on European works councils and the more recent directive on informing and consulting workers constitute the legal framework for protecting workers' rights and safeguarding equivalent conditions. Secondly, there are the Structural Funds, which provide important economic support for economic and social change in areas with structural difficulties. They support the adaptation and modernisation of education, training and employment policies and systems, mainly with the objective of increasing the adaptability and employability of workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in 2002, the Commission requested the opinion of the social partners on a text entitled ‘Anticipating and managing change – a dynamic approach to the social aspects of corporate restructuring’. The document in question advocated an approach to corporate restructuring which balanced the interests of businesses facing changes with the interests of workers in danger of losing their jobs. The Commission accepted with satisfaction the joint text submitted to it by the social partners in October 2003. Restructuring is also included as a key topic in the joint programme of work approved by the social partners in November 2002. The social partners' text is based on experience gleaned from certain case studies on modern restructuring conditions relating to issues of vial importance to successful change management. We need to make use of these guidelines in order to respond better to the challenges which we face in this particular sector.</p>
<p class="contents">They include: the need for changes to be explained and for the reasons for them to be stated, the importance of maintaining and developing workers' skills, the importance of complementarity and cooperation between the various factors when restructuring affects an entire region, the particular situation of small- and medium-sized enterprises and the practical aspects of managing restructuring, which include the importance of investigating all possible alternative solutions in order to avoid redundancies.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like at this point to inform you that the Commission started consultations with the social partners today on how the European works councils established by Community directive about ten years ago can respond more effectively to the challenges of a changing economic and social environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must not forget our important work on corporate social responsibility and the European Observatory for Industrial Change. I honestly hope that, in the case of the restructuring which concerns us today, every effort has been made to restrict the social repercussions in the area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You call it industrial restructuring, but I would call it a ‘process of industrial cannibalism’: in other words, <span class="italic">Bombardier</span> bought companies as going concerns, absorbed them and then closed down some of these industrial units in various European countries – so far in six, including my own country, Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, however, that behaviour of this kind is unfair. The Commission and the European institutions must, of course, concern themselves with ensuring freedom of competition – this is one of our golden rules – but legislation must also be enacted against the behaviour of multinationals or companies undertaking restructuring operations that sometimes border on the criminal because they will destroy the extremely important industrial legacy of knowledge, skills and know-how, as happened at <span class="italic">Sorefame</span>, in Portugal. Rules must also be drafted to protect against the practice of relocation itself. We are entering a new phase and the Commission must have an industrial policy and protect its industry, without indulging in protectionism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is up to the social partners and other third parties to negotiate a possible re-examination of the closure with the company. Nonetheless, the Commission does hope that it will be possible to find an acceptable solution in order to moderate the significant impact on the regions affected by this restructuring.</p>
<p class="contents">As for whether or not these actions by the company are legal, I have to say that the legislation of the European Union on these issues consists of directives which have been properly transposed into national legislation and specific national laws. It is therefore up to the national authorities, including the judicial authorities, to assess the extent to which national legislation has been duly and effectively applied. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In a memorandum dated 17 March, the executive board of <span class="italic">Bombardier</span> <span class="italic">Transportation</span> informed the workers in its factory in Amadora, Portugal, about the restructuring of the group, in particular involving the termination of 5 680 positions in various European countries by the end of 2005. In Portugal, 400 direct jobs will be lost, not counting the indirect jobs that depend on <span class="italic">Bombardier</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">The Portuguese Government has made every possible effort to keep this factory in the country and above all to ensure that jobs are not lost. Investment in the railways and in high-speed trains has been planned and yet the Amadora factory announced its definitive closure for the end of May, citing a lack of orders for rolling stock. The situation facing Portuguese workers is of enormous concern and the following questions, therefore, must be asked: is the rolling stock industry crucial to the European Union or not? Is the Commission or is it not willing to adopt measures, specifically under its transport policy, which will not only save this sector, but also stimulate its development? These measures must not only ensure that jobs are preserved in this sector but also prevent Europe from becoming dependent on other countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I must also say that this specific company, Bombardier, has 35 factories in Europe, a large number of which are, of course, closing. It is closing seven factories, six in the European Union and one in Switzerland, but it nonetheless continues to maintain numerous factories in various areas and employ several thousand workers.

I think that this demonstrates the seriousness of the situation. The case of <span class="italic">Bombardier</span> in Portugal, however, formerly known as <span class="italic">Sorefame</span>, constitutes a real economic and social crime because this is the only company that we have in the railway carriage manufacturing sector, which uses high technology that has been developed over the years, because its closure renders our country entirely dependent on other countries and because, with these workers becoming unemployed, we will lose knowledge that has been built up over decades. This is an economic and social crime.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to ask, Commissioner, how can the European Commission claim to be committed to combating poverty, to creating jobs, to building railways and to environmental, economic and social development, when it allows this to happen with a Canadian multinational in a country like Portugal, which is experiencing serious economic and social problems? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not mind that because the single market for rolling stock should be allowed to work. However, it is seems to me that the public procurement market is not working satisfactorily in the area of rolling stock.</p>
<p class="contents">We should ask the Commission to look at this. We should also ask you, Commissioner Dimas, to ask your Observatory for Industrial Change to look at the whole scenario for employment in the railway rolling stock industry, as it is already doing, for example, in the automotive industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, it seems to me that this is only a way of avoiding a sensitive debate. That is not acceptable, and I would ask the President of Parliament to look into this.

<p class="contents">A pilot project may start some three to five years before the possible adoption of a legal base, provided that the results of the pilot scheme are positive and that the preparatory action decided by the budgetary authority is successful. E-learning and Daphne are examples of this process.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2001 the Commission shared with Parliament the idea of proposing a preparatory action to stimulate and accelerate integration of the use of information and communication technologies in education and training, in developing synergies amongst public and private stakeholders. The results of the preparatory action were positive with regard to the opportunity and convenience of sustained support for these innovative synergy projects, and the e-learning programme was born.</p>
<p class="contents">The Daphne programme came into force in 2000, after the Commission had implemented pilot and preparatory actions in 1997, 1998 and 1999, in which year a legal base was proposed and adopted. Under Daphne, measures were funded to support non-governmental organisations and the voluntary sector active in combating violence against children, young persons and women. The European Parliament strongly supported both these programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">As provided for in Article 49 of the financial regulation, the Commission will, when the preliminary draft budget for 2005 is published, also provide the budgetary authority with an assessment of the results of pilot schemes and preparatory actions entered in the budget for 2004. The same assessment was provided last year in the preliminary draft budget for 2004. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As I recently told Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Commission continues to make good progress on this matter. It is intended to put forward a proposal for a directive to be adopted shortly after final agreement is reached in Basle by the middle of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in response to the request by the European Council in Barcelona in March 2002, the Commission commissioned an impact study and report from Pricewaterhouse Coopers. The final version of this report has now been made available to the Commission. Its conclusions are positive. The new risk-sensitive framework will be good for financial institutions, good for consumers and good for the economy as a whole, with a more efficient allocation of capital. The report also identifies some defined areas where the proposals contained in the Commission's third consultative paper should be further improved. That work is under way.</p>
<p class="contents">Arrangements are also in hand for the report to be discussed with interested Members of Parliament very shortly. The key factor is that the report should be made available in good time to inform the European legislative process. That will be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">The last part of Mr Karas' question concerns the issues on which there is still no agreement in the Basel Committee. As regards the Basel Agreement, only a few issues remain to be finalised by the middle of this year. These include the question of the treatment of undrawn credit card lines, recalibration in the light of the Madrid decision to move to an unexpected-loss-only approach and what is termed the 'stress loss given defaults' question. I am confident that those issues will be resolved by June. The Commission's proposal for a directive will be complete and stable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You are fobbing me off. You say that the findings of this study are available. In that case, why have we not received them? You say that the report identifies some areas where the proposals contained in the Commission's third consultative paper should be amended. What are these amendments? You say that we will receive the report in good time. However, today is officially Parliament's last sitting. It seems to me that omissions have been made here and I urge and request you to make the latest information and the findings of the study available to the market, the Council and Parliament as swiftly as possible.

For example, there are discounts in the capital charges for lending to smaller entities. SME loans below a certain threshold – namely EUR 1 million – may be included in the retail portfolio, which has lower capital requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of the third impact study show that the new rules are good news for loans to SMEs. As far as venture capital is concerned, there is wide acceptance that such investments have a higher level of risk, which is why it is called risk capital. The capital requirements proposed in our third consultation paper reflect that higher level of risk. At the same time, we have been working with industry to see whether there are data that may suggest that for certain types of investment lower requirements may be justified. We have not yet finalised our proposals in this regard, but, overall, it is recognised in many circles that the results of the Basel exercise – as it is now known – are beneficial for small- and medium-sized enterprises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no information suggesting that theft of unencrypted personal data stored in computer systems represents a serious problem for the proper functioning of the free flow of personal data in the internal market, or for the protection of such data. Before introducing new legislation which puts additional burdens on business, it is suggested that business itself should enhance security of personal data by using security systems such as encryption.</p>
<p class="contents">So, while understanding the philosophy behind the question the Commission wants to be certain that it is absolutely necessary to pass this into legislation. We want to be careful with new laws; businesses complain of too much regulation. We all want to deregulate, so let us be careful in this area and only legislate where it is absolutely essential to do so, but not before. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I should like to put a couple of other issues to him. Firstly, would he agree that it would be desirable for the proposed directive on the internal market for services to cover gambling in this way? The issues raised by this judgment and by the complaints strike at the very heart of the issues and barriers that he is proposing to sweep away with his excellent proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue – which he did not touch on – was the ability of governments to try and include public interest and consumer protection issues to prevent gambling operators from setting up in their jurisdiction while, at the same time, actively promoting their own state lotteries and gambling businesses. That seems to be entirely inconsistent and is also an issue that was covered by the Gambelli case. I would also be interested to have his view on that aspect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission will assess whether it should present a proposal for harmonised EU-wide rules on gambling services on the basis of a report that it will put in hand this year.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Media concentration</span></p>
<p class="contents">At its sitting of 20 November 2002 Parliament adopted a resolution on media concentration, in which it called on the Commission, among other things, to draw up a Green Paper by the end of 2003, assessing the development of new technology and new communications, the impact of mergers, alliances, and joint ventures in particular on the internal market and media pluralism, and the current legal position and future developments in both the Member States and the applicant countries. It also urged the Commission, within this parliamentary term, to consider what regulatory options might be used to safeguard freedom of expression and pluralism in the media and, in addition, to submit a proposal to enable the principle of media freedom to be established on a stronger basis in the Treaty.</p>

They cannot be used to adjust purely internal situations within Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As mentioned, existing Community instruments foreseen by the Treaty have the aim of ensuring a certain equilibrium between economic operators. They may therefore directly affect the media, but as an economic activity. These instruments do not affect the media as an information conduit to citizens, or they do so only very indirectly. For example, the Merger Regulation assigns the task to the Commission to establish whether or not media concentrations with a Community dimension are compatible with the common market. The Merger Regulation thereby enables the Commission to ensure competitive medium markets and only indirectly to protect media pluralism.</p>
<p class="contents">It should furthermore be recalled that the Commission supports the inclusion in the draft Constitutional Treaty of Article 11(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which establishes the principle of respect by the Union of the freedom and pluralism of the media.

Their content are products offered by different media companies and they therefore move along the borders of the European Union. This is the roaming policy. One cannot avoid the issue with answers like this. On the contrary, these companies are so big that they operate beyond Europe, offering content that is in a very limited number of hands. I could name such companies but the Commissioner might be able to think of some of them himself. This is a modern day threat, and it is not merely a matter of printed communications.

Therefore while the plurality of the media is obviously an important subject, it is not covered by the current Treaty. If Mr Paasilinna wants to call that an old-fashioned approach, so be it. However, I cannot step beyond the bounds of the Treaty.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Clarification of the Commission's replies concerning Cuba</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission replied in writing to two oral questions relating to Cuba – the Havana Biennial (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2003-0733_EN.html">H-0733/03</a><a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>) and the visit by Patriarch Bartholomeos (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2004-0045_EN.html">H-0045/04</a><a href="#def_1_2" name="ref_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>). The answers given are unsatisfactory and contain statements which I find disrespectful. In reply to the first question the Commission states that it was incorrect to say the EU had withdrawn its funding for the Biennial, when this is not what I said. I referred to the assistance that was being provided, without specifying that this was financial assistance. More serious is the claim that it was misleading to say the EU had decided to freeze cultural relations with Cuba. The Commission's answer to the second question, concerning the visit by the Orthodox Patriarch, reiterates that there were no such EU sanctions – letting it be understood that it was Cuba that was the sanctioning power. Moreover, it also talks of the insults made by high representatives of the Cuban Government against European Heads of State on 26 July 2003.</p>

<p class="contents">Indeed, the honourable Member did not state that the EU had withdrawn funding for the Biennial; he quoted media reports which the Commission indicated were incorrect.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the two new questions, firstly, the Council decided on 5 June 2003 to reduce the profile of Member States' participation in cultural events. This measure implies limiting the presence of Member States' representatives in cultural events taking place in Cuba and has to be seen as a symbolic gesture. It is not designed to reduce cultural activities in Cuba, or limit their funding. Member States with established cultural programmes continued their activities in Cuba. Only the Spanish Cultural Centre ceased to function in August 2003. This, however, was not a decision of the Spanish Government but of the Cuban authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it would have been more correct to speak about insults towards heads of governments rather than heads of states. The Spanish Prime Minister was insulted in a speech by President Castro on 26 July and Prime Ministers Aznar and Berlusconi were insulted in a demonstration on 12 June led by the President and First Vice-President of Cuba and directed at the embassies of those countries. Insults were also addressed to them by President Castro the previous day, according to press reports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would therefore like to thank you for making things absolutely clear. I still believe that these measures restricting cultural relations are pernicious, but now we can return to the tone with which we have spoken over all these years.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: IMF programmes and the EC's overall objective of poverty eradication</span></p>
<p class="contents">Given EC concerns with how IMF programmes can conflict with the EC’s overall objective of poverty eradication, can the Commission clarify EC policy on linking disbursement of EC budget support to compliance with an IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)? In particular would the EC continue to disburse budget support if a country were off track solely on non-core elements of an IMF PRGF e.g. a condition to privatise a state body? Would the EC continue to disburse budget support if a country were off track on an IMF PRGF programme where the EC judged the IMF’s programme to be overly restrictive and to prevent the country from maximising poverty reduction spending?’ </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In practice, this requirement is usually linked to the existence of a national reform programme which is subject to support through the International Monetary Fund's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility. The PRGF is designed to contribute to the reduction of poverty and the creation of economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a country being 'on-track' with the IMF's conditions is generally considered as one of the general conditions for EC budget support. Disbursement of one annual 'fixed tranche' is usually preconditioned by a satisfactory periodic PRGF review of the ongoing reform programme. During such a review IMF staff examine whether agreed benchmarks and other performance criteria have been respected by the government over a given period of time.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Commission entrusts the periodic review of macroeconomic performance to the institution that is best equipped and holds a natural assignment to do so, it is important that close coordination between Commission services – especially the delegations – and IMF staff is ensured. In case of diverging opinions on particular issues related to this review, Commission services and IMF staff must enter into a technical dialogue to try to reach a common position – I say a technical dialogue, but politics is also involved, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">Should the Commission maintain a position different from the IMF's, it may decide to disburse its budget support, despite the fact that the PRGF review may not be conclusive or that the country in other words goes 'off-track'. However, such a decision will only be taken in exceptional cases, for instance when the Commission is convinced that the IMF assessment is clearly too restrictive – or based on relatively minor elements of the reform programme – and that non-disbursement of budget support may jeopardise the government's poverty reduction efforts. In other words, despite linking part of its budget support disbursement directly to these PRGF reviews conducted by the IMF, the Commission takes its own case-by-case decision on whether to carry out a disbursement.</p>
<p class="contents">A similar approach is followed in relation to Community assistance to countries in other regions where general budget support for poverty reduction is linked to the same type of PRGFs.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, we are satisfied that this cooperation also includes the World Bank. We are not totally enslaved into this. It is a partnership and in recent years a more balanced, two-way, equal basis for these discussions has emerged. Today this partnership works. History has also proved that for the many formerly very badly managed economies in the Third World, a lot of progress has been achieved, despite the costs involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
