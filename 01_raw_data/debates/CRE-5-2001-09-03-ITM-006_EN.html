<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mayer, Hans-Peter (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the idea of creating a European form of company obeying the same supranational rules in all Member States is almost as old as the European Union itself. The <span class="italic">Societas Europaea</span> (SE) is the flagship of European company law. The academic foundations were laid in the late 1950s. In 1970, the Commission submitted a proposal for a regulation on the statute of an SE. It contained uniform law down to the last detail.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1989, the Commission submitted an entirely new proposal for a regulation which excluded social and labour law, fiscal law, law on competition, protection of industrial property rights, insolvency law and industrial constitution law. Finally in Nice, political agreement was reached on a Council regulation on the statute and on a directive on worker participation.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the legal base: the 1989 proposal was based on the present Article 95 which establishes the right of co-decision. The Nice proposals are based on Article 308 whereby Parliament would simply be consulted. Article 95 is just as appropriate a legal base for the regulation as Article 308. For the purposes of democratic legitimacy – and in line with decisions of the Court of Justice – the legal base giving Parliament most say should be chosen in such a case. Consequently, Parliament reserves the right, following adoption by the Council, to bring a case before the Court to examine the legal base.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the regulation: pursuant to Articles 2 and 3, there are different ways in which an SE can be established. The capital of the SE must be at least EUR 120 000. There are two different systems of managing limited liability companies under the company law of the Member States. The 'single' system in Britain, for example, provides solely for an administrative body. The 'dual' system, applicable in Germany, for example, provides for a supervisory body and a management body. European unification now requires that both systems be available in each country so that it is possible to choose freely between them.</p>
<p class="contents">Hitherto, company law of the Member States has been such that national companies can only transfer their place of business if they are dissolved and re-formed in another Member State. With an SE, a transfer will not result in the company being dissolved or in a new legal entity being created. The growing together of what used to be separate markets means that we must finally create organisational forms which reflect the new situation in Europe. However, there are serious shortcomings in the structure of the SEs. SEs will differ from one Member State to another. There will not be one European SE, but an SE with French, Spanish or German features, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, even within the same Member State a variety of different SEs will be created to cover various company features such as co-decision making. I consider it essential that, parallel to the entry into force of the regulation, accompanying fiscal rules should also be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">The precise nature of the SE will, naturally, be determined in part by fiscal legislation. To this end, the series of amendments from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is to be welcomed. In conclusion, I advocate launching the SE on its maiden voyage. This will show where repairs are still needed so that one day it will fulfil our hopes and become the flagship. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The former President of the European Commission and Member of this Parliament, Mr Santer, made this form of company a more prominent subject for discussion in the second half of the 1990s. Mr Santer and a number of his fellow campaigners here in Parliament wanted it as a way of attracting global players from Europe to compete in world markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The European limited liability company has hitherto foundered in the Council of Ministers especially because of the issues surrounding the position of workers. In 1970, a regulation on the European limited liability company one-sidedly stipulated just the German model of co-decision-making, although co-decision-making is simply not an item for export.</p>
<p class="contents">In the late 1980s, Parliament was presented with two documents which were intrinsically linked. Dr. Mayer has already outlined these: a regulation on issues of company law – the statute – and the directive concerning the position of workers in the limited liability company or SE. Three models were established, of which one had to be chosen. Even in this matter, there was no general consensus. It was only in 1997 that a solution emerged in the form of a proposal from Parliament. This proposal was underpinned academically by the work of a group of experts under the chairmanship of Etienne Davignon, and the Davignon Report was signed by trade union members and members of employer associations. Whichever way you look at it, this was a breakthrough because it fell back on the recipe for success established by the Directive on the European works council, a subject which we shall touch upon again in the next item on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The following basic principles for the creation of a European limited liability company were now proposed: flexibility, negotiated solutions and minimum standards. Thus, the customs of employee participation existing within the European Union were also skilfully incorporated. In other words, in some countries participation is established through legal channels and in others by means of collective agreements. Now these are combined: as regards the European limited liability company, a special made-to-measure collective agreement is drawn up between the founding board of directors and a special negotiating body of employees and, in the absence of an agreement, the minimum laws governing worker involvement shall be applicable for half a year to a year. The Davignon Report calls these reference rules. The EWC Directive talks of subsidiary requirements. I think this is the better term as it refers to subsidiarity in an exemplary manner. This idea was also decided upon in Nice. We support the regulations governing participation agreed in Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">The report from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs proposes two significant amendments to the Council’s draft. Firstly, we would like a different definition of the term participation from that used by the Council. The designated body representing workers is nothing more than a special European works council for the European limited liability company, incidentally with better legal powers, something which we should remember when amending the Works Council Directive. However, there are, and remain, laws governing information and consultation. It would be wrong to use the term ‘participation’ here.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the original Commission proposal made it clear that the procedure for electing employees onto the supervisory or management board is to be governed according to the provisions applicable in each Member State. In Germany, therefore, employee members must be directly or indirectly elected in accordance with the election of members to supervisory boards pursuant to the German law on stock companies. I am convinced that, in this regard, it is essential not to make a distinction in the electoral process. Under German law on stock companies, members are elected. Under the arrangements governing the European limited liability company, employee representatives will not be elected.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation and directive in question have retrieved the European limited liability company from the frozen depths of European legislation. However, both – and here I agree with Mr Mayer – exhibit major shortcomings. We must finally take the first step, however. After six years, these two legal instruments should be tested and, if necessary, improved. We must get a foot in the door. The next gust of wind will open that door. I think that, with this European model, we are on the right track, including where the social dimension of the internal market is concerned. The European model is, of course, not purely a matter of market economics and, therefore, not purely a limited liability company either. Rather, it is a limited liability company also involving the participation specifically of the employees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Mayer and Mr Menrad have already noted that there is still room for some improvement as far as those proposals are concerned. Nevertheless, I believe we should be very pleased with the progress made on this extremely important subject. Before, it was mainly the American multinationals that considered the lack of a European Company as a deficiency, because they wanted to work in Europe rather than in the individual Member States. It is also for that reason that, as long as thirty years ago, Professor Sanders introduced the concept of ‘<span class="italic">Societas Europaea</span>’ during an inaugural speech at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">We are pleased that the proposal is now before us after thirty years. We regret the fact that it is still not possible now finally to bring the tax systems in Europe closer together and to gear them to one another. This does not mean that taxes should be harmonised. I believe that a band of competitive tariffs should remain in place, but I still think that it is important for a European Company to have the tax systems in the various Member States at least geared to one another. Indeed, we may now have one European Company, but each Member State will still need to apply its own social legislation and its own tax systems.</p>
<p class="contents">It will ultimately be the market which will require that an actual European Company with its own statute be created, something which, at present, is still being hampered by the independent actions of the various Member States. We therefore welcome the European Company. We hope that the evaluations will follow promptly and believe that the market will eventually determine the European Statute a few years following those evaluations. This will benefit a Europe that has the euro and the internal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to back up what Mr Mayer said about the legal base. He is quite right. We have had people playing fast and loose on the whole question of the legal base. We started off with Article 95 as legal base and we have moved on to Article 308 because it suited certain people. That is wrong and Parliament is right to say that at some future date we should be challenging this in court.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on Mr Menrad's report on the information and consultation of workers, I take the two examples of Corus and BMW Rover. The first thing workers knew about the situation they were facing was when they were driving into work and they heard it on the radio. In this day and age that is totally intolerable. Workers should be informed at the very start about the situation pertaining to their jobs because they are part and parcel of that company.</p>
<p class="contents">I should know. I remember many years ago I turned up at my place of work to find that the gates of the factory were locked and all of us were standing outside. We were told by someone who was sent out that we had all been made redundant. I remember that quite clearly because the people who owned the factory still lived in big houses, still drove big cars and still went on holidays. I was a worker in the factory and nine months later I had not received any redundancy money: all I got was my back pay.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the sort of situation workers should not be faced with ever again. That is why I congratulate Mr Menrad on taking this small step on the information and meaningful consultation of workers because it is a step in the right direction. It is not perfect. It will come back and we will improve it. However, it is a step in the right direction and I support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why the circumstances in which this form of company arose and the problems with which we must deal here are all the more regrettable. We all know that the Nice Summit was not exactly a raging success and, instead, produced a meagre result as far as the treaty negotiations are concerned. With this limited liability company, the Heads of State and Government intended to be able to offer us, as a minor success of this summit as it were, something which would at least take Europe a step further. In principle, this is of course to be welcomed. However, it is regrettable – absolutely regrettable – that the Heads of State and Government have disregarded the law and the Treaty by actually changing the legal base on the basis of the motto ‘we have now come to the agreement that, as regards this matter, Parliament is not to interfere’. They have replaced Article 95, which was clearly the legal base for one part of the process, with Article 308, which they have also used to replace Article 137 which clearly would have been the legal base for the other part of the process according to the text of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The result is no co-decision making; the result is unanimity in the Council, with decision-making resting solely with the government. Personally, I do not think that Parliament can accept this. Therefore, by a large majority in the Committee on Legal Affairs, we have amended the legal base and re-established the correct legal base, in other words Article 95 and Article 137. It is also interesting that this has been expressly established in the recitals to the original proposal and that the legal services have given their support to this. We have proceeded with consultations as with a co-decision procedure. I would like to warn the Council of the following: If they amend the legal base for this important process again in its second reading, then they are running the very serious risk of legal action from Parliament in this matter. I believe that we will win this action in the Court of Justice. The practical value of the process is, in our experience, rather limited anyway. I am referring to the letter from the president of UNICE. We have already referred to this within the committee. We have requested that fiscal regulations be revised, and I hope that this revision is carried out soon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There will not be one European limited liability company, but 15 European limited liability companies. What complete disorder! I do not want to go into the details. The Council has confirmed what is common knowledge: that the Council itself is the problem when it comes to European legislation. The Council, not the Commission and not Parliament: the Council is the problem! It still wants only to decide on matters unanimously, and if there is a legal base for doing so – in this case Article 308 – all the better. So we do not need Parliament. But we will – as Mr Lehne said – very carefully consider whether this legal base is adequate, and in emergencies we shall involve the European Court of Justice in the matter. In the hands of the Council, Community law is becoming a new style of international law, with the difference and the practical advantage that it does not have to be ratified either by the European Parliament or by national parliaments. This is the strategy of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Why should this European limited liability company be such an attractive prospect? Why should it be adopted? Is it not the case that this European limited liability company is threatened with the same fate as the previous company patent under the Luxembourg Convention? In this case, the Council, after many years of laborious work, also came to a compromise, and the whole of industry, all parties concerned, were not interested in it. Perhaps things will not be different with this form of European limited liability company. So what are the advantages? Why should we create a European limited liability company? What are the fiscal advantages, for example? I, for one, cannot see any.</p>
<p class="contents">Just one more remark: It may well be that the tenth Directive concerning cross-border mergers of limited liability companies will again be unearthed after this flop, by way of a supplement as it were, because nothing will come of this European limited liability company. But hold on a minute, my friends from the Commission and the Council, nothing came, first time around, of the tenth Directive concerning cross-border mergers of limited liability companies and involving the abolition of participation, and nothing will come of it this time!</p>
<p class="contents">Now that we have come to grips with the European limited liability company as it were, I would like to remind you that other company forms are next on the list: the European association, the European mutual society and the European cooperative. I hope that the Commission lays down proposals on these matters in the near future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The possibility of having a genuine European limited liability company is in line with the thinking which has led us to a European internal market, to a monetary union and to the last phase of the full use of the euro, which we are now approaching.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, as one of the rapporteurs has pointed out, it has taken us thirty years to arrive at this thinking – a little more than thirty years – from the first proposal, in 1970, until now.</p>
<p class="contents">My observation on behalf of the Liberal Group has two aspects to it: on the one hand, we will of course support the proposal; we believe that it represents a step forward within the achievements of the process of the European construction. We must also say, however, on the other hand, that we are not satisfied. As the proposed amendments to both reports point out, the structure proposed for the creation of a European limited liability company is still too complex.</p>
<p class="contents">There are various options and the possible varieties of European company may even arise within a single Member State. It is now thought that if the different methods and options are taken into account and a combined calculation is made, up to two hundred different figures may be reached. We do not believe that this is the most appropriate way to consolidate a European company which would act in accordance with the reality which we have achieved thanks to the European internal market and the monetary union.</p>
<p class="contents">We have therefore also presented a series of amendments on behalf of the Liberal Group aimed at consolidating this key figure for the Economic and Monetary Union and we would very much like the Council to accept them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Immediately before the summer recess, we experienced the difficult situation involving the Take-over Directive, the social aspect of which, in particular, appeared unacceptable to a majority of this House. We can be very clear about this. In this case, the Directive is certainly acceptable, although I share the view of Mr Rothley and others that it is still deficient. However, that is due to a number of other factors.</p>
<p class="contents">Ideally, we should have liked to have seen a kind of package deal emerge, combining the Take-over Directive and the European Company Directive, which would also have taken care of aspects related to participation, information and consultation. At the moment we are facing the difficult situation in which things happen in a certain sequence but in which we cannot entirely follow their interconnection.</p>
<p class="contents">In the final analysis, we naturally agree that, in the framework of what we would then term ‘a European social model’, use should be made of the information and consultation rules that have been included in the reports of Mr Menrad and Mr Mayer which are, by the way, excellent, in my opinion. We should like this to be done in a non-Anglo-Saxon manner, as I indicated in connection with the Take-over Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">If we now compare the European works council, as it exists at the moment, with the legislation under discussion with regard to information and consultation, then this comparison works out in favour of the current model. However, as will immediately be evident from the document, we still have the improvement of the European works council ahead of us. A great deal needs to be done there, so much so that I am not sure what the exact outcome will be.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore ultimately agree on this approach. With regard to information and consultation, we are naturally keen advocates of what is being described as ‘Rhineland working relations’. We accept this as what might be called a minimum guideline.</p>
<p class="contents">For a number of countries, such as Austria, Germany and the Netherlands, the transposition into national legislation will therefore be of the utmost importance, because they generally apply superior regulations, and adaptation could prove problematical.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would draw your attention to the fact that I especially support Mr Menrad’s Amendment No 7 concerning the definition of ‘participation’. It is a challenge for the Commissioner to agree to this and also to handle the legal bases correctly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gallagher (UEN).</span></span>   – Mr President, after 30 long years of negotiations, the Employment and Social Affairs Ministers managed to reach agreement last December on a statute for a European company. The creation of a European company has long been seen as essential to a comprehensive body of European company law which promotes business. In an increasingly globalised business environment, the arrival of the SE is timely.</p>
<p class="contents">Capital moves easily across borders as multinational firms seek out the most attractive business locations. The Union can achieve a great deal in the creation of a single market for goods, services and capital. There has long been a need to create a European company to complement this picture.</p>
<p class="contents">Members of this Parliament hail from 15 different sovereign states and are aware that company law differs widely from one Member State to another. I welcome the fact that this regulation foresees five different ways in which an SE can be established. Member States' company law allows for two different systems of company management. The regulation proposes that both systems be available in each country. Hence companies will be able to choose the approach which best suits their needs.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the slow-down in the US economy and consequently the world economy, it is essential that we, as legislators, do all we can to facilitate business and job creation. The creation and management of European companies must take place with as few hindrances and bureaucratic obstacles as possible. Companies must be afforded the flexibility they need to stay lean and move swiftly in a highly competitive environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur refers to taxation. It must be made clear that taxation policy is a matter for each Member State and its national parliament. Any proposal that corporate tax be paid by SEs and could go into EU coffers is totally unacceptable. The Irish government has a policy of low corporate tax to encourage investment. Our 12.5% rate has proved itself by actually increasing tax revenue while at the same time promoting sustained growth. Ireland could not countenance any suggestion of harmonising corporate tax rates, especially in this period of economic slow-down.</p>
<p class="contents">I commend Mr Menrad and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for their work on employee rights. We in Europe have long held that a partnership approach works best. Companies are reliant on their employees. There must be no erosion of the workers' rights that have been won over time. A European company without participation in some form is unthinkable. There are a number of models of worker participation. It is positive that the regulation avoids a one-size-fits-all approach. In conclusion, the scale of employee participation will be decided through free negotiations between the companies concerned and the workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He asked me particularly to make that point to you.</p>
<p class="contents">I broadly welcome this as a pragmatic proposal. I do not want to reflect on what might have been. I want to address a few remarks to the Commissioner about the implementation of this proposal because it is a welcome advance that we will actually get something into the market place – and that is how we should regard it, – because companies will have the option of whether to adopt this form of company statute or not. It is entirely pragmatic and practical that we will initially have a proposal that will be subject to governments among the 15 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say to the Commissioner that considerable attention has to be given to ensuring that the rules for this new company statute are consistently implemented across the Member States. Currently, we have inconsistent application of company law within the existing Member States' statutes on things like publication of information, timely publication of accounts, proper completion of accounts – all those sorts of issues are currently implemented differently. This new statute has to be implemented consistently and we have to make sure that courts in Member States who will be responsible for this have the training and ability to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I also join in what colleagues have been saying about issues to do with taxation and company law. Mr Mayer, in an excellent report, wisely says at the conclusion that he advocates launching the European statute on a maiden voyage. Well, it will show where repairs are needed – that is certainly true. But we must not overload this with other expectations about aligning company law, particularly tax harmonisation. I join with colleagues who have said how dangerous this is as a concept. We must not overload this statute with things that it was not designed to carry, otherwise it will sink very quickly indeed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have never seen such a light regulation or proposed regulation as this one. It is so light that we are going to have practically no company harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Rothley has said, what we are going to have is fifteen different national laws on the European company, fifteen different European companies and, as Mr Gasòliba i Böhm said, we are going to have more than two hundred possible combinations of different types of company. This is truly the softest type of legislation I have seen in my life.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Council intends to take legislative power away from us: Mr Gallagher spoke of acting as legislators. If we take the Council’s route, Parliament will be deprived of all legislative power. I believe that Parliament would probably take the correct route by challenging this decision before the Court of Justice, because the Treaties cannot be unilaterally modified by one Community institution.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, as Mr Rothley pointed out earlier, the type of European company we are going to create is not going to provide any special advantage, above all any fiscal advantage; if we do not take action in the field of taxation, it is going to be very difficult to bring about the creation of European companies and, therefore, it seems to me very important, as the majority of previous speakers have proposed, that the fiscal field be involved. Mr Harbour spoke of the possibility of the ship sinking. I would say that the danger is that the ship will capsize as a result of a lack of ballast. Mr Harbour probably has some naval experience and he knows that, when a ship carries no weight, the easiest thing is for the ship to capsize and sink for other reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it seems to me that the important thing at the moment is: first, to insist on Parliament’s legal prerogatives, and, secondly, to insist that in order to have a law on European companies we must also incorporate tax aspects. Without taxation it will be very difficult for us to implement a European economic law, a European company law and a European commercial law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proposal determines the registration to a trade regime by companies which may choose this new statute following a negotiated agreement on employee involvement.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these conditions, the Group of the Greens is not turning its nose up at it; the group supports Mr Menrad’s report and its proposals, the aim of which is the swift adoption and effective implementation of this directive. Of course, we will do this in the belief that this required condition certainly does not allow us to consider that European legislation genuinely fulfils current needs. As soon as the vote is over, we must carry on and get back down to work on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">You are aware that this directive will in future only apply to the employees of companies that choose this new statute, in other words, a small minority. That is why we must obviously stop ourselves from celebrating and trying to make an impact. We will only have made progress when we have simultaneously adopted this directive, revised the directive that we discussed earlier on European works councils and approved the Directive on Information and Consultation of Employees under conditions that differ slightly from the position adopted by the Council. The co-decision procedure must be used in order to perform this legislative work under conditions which guarantee a genuine debate, involving society and citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress that the Group of the Greens rejects the pressure that inevitably leads to restricting its right to legislate, on the pretext of being efficient and swift, particularly because, as we all know, this dossier dates back a long way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Max Weber defined the company as an organisation which, while controlling them, is intended to produce goods and services for a market. Obviously, a company can be owned by a physical person or by a legal person, and it is general practice, also derived from the will of the individual businessperson to restrict their responsibility – particularly relating to property – towards third persons, that the businesses of certain economic entities adopt the form of companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the company means plurality, the organisation of goods, but above all of services.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore logical – and I am referring essentially to the social aspects – that there be particular study, analysis and regulation of the involvement of workers in the European company statute and that in a dual system, with a general council and a management and supervisory body, or in a single system, with simply an administrative body, the feelings and knowledge of workers be taken into account, listened to and accepted by means of their representatives, and that workers understand the progress of the company, the risks, the vicissitudes and the objectives it is pursuing.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not have time, and I believe it is unnecessary, to refer to the methods and degrees of participation, to the negotiating body or to the role of the European company in the structuring of European social life. However, please allow me to refer to the role of the representatives of workers at the point of closure of all or some of the establishments in one or various nations, staff relations, the creation of subsidiary companies and, in general, to all the decisions which are essential to the ordinary life of the company. Also important are the transitional period of three years, a high degree of uniformity in the application provisions of the regulation and the transposition of the directive, which would endorse the <span class="italic">raison d’être</span>, facilitate the nature of the European company and help to create more Europe, to the benefit of companies, employment and consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We shall of course deal with the violation of civil rights later. This evening, I would like to touch upon the protest of ten thousand, predominantly young, people against globalisation and economic power. We must take more seriously than before their concerns surrounding the increasing division in the world between the rich and the poor and the exploitation of our natural resources. Precisely because many problems can no longer be resolved at a national level, the European Union is specifically responsible for monitoring unbridled economic and financial dealings.</p>
<p class="contents">Up until now, the European Union has pursued this aim very hesitantly. One of several possibilities open to us is to establish the legal base for employee participation, information and consultation before decisions are taken. The European limited liability company – really an inevitable idea, and also a sensible idea in itself, within the European internal market – is however only acceptable to us as European Socialists with the appropriate inclusion of employees and their trade unions.</p>
<p class="contents">Company decisions are therefore only really thought out if employees’ points of view are considered. Management alone cannot make important decisions. The numerous failed mergers and events at Renault Vilvoorde, Danone, Marks &amp; Spencer and in other companies in the past are, in our opinion, good evidence of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Additionally, I would like to thank the French government for reaching a compromise and for also finally convincing Spain that this legislation must be given the green light. I would like to criticise the procedure decided on by the Council. In this regard, I share the criticism of the Committee on Legal Affairs. However, I would like to say, Mr Lehne, that I did not find the reasons you gave very convincing, since the Council has, of course, been able to count on the support of Parliament. We have also pursued this procedure rapidly and constructively in the course of the Committee’s work. It is not because of us that the procedure would have failed. So, there was essentially no reason to change the legal base. I share the criticism and think that the Council should consider this carefully and also stipulate their reasoning, for we have not, to date, actually heard the reason for changing the legal base.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to extend my thanks to Mr Menrad for working rapidly and constructively with us in the Committee on Social Affairs to bring this report to the vote. I would also like to thank him for being more specific in response to proposals from my group. However, I believe, Mr Menrad, that we are agreed that we must not adopt Amendment No 12. I have at any rate recommended this to my group.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would refer to the appeal to secure a majority of votes tomorrow to enable this ship – as one member put it – to be launched on its maiden voyage, despite some reservations and also in spite of some inconsistencies, which we could not allow to go unmentioned. I think, however, that it would be sensible to bring in a law that takes employees into consideration and includes their interests in time for the introduction of the euro. The planned revision does not need to be deferred for six years. We can certainly carry this out earlier. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Last night, knowing that I would have to speak this morning, I dreamed that I was Mr Fatuzzo the MEP. However, I was an older Mr Fatuzzo MEP with whiter hair and I was also rich, very rich, absolutely filthy rich, so rich that I could swim in a pool of gold like Donald Duck’s Uncle Scrooge. With me in the pool was Mr Menrad, the rapporteur, and you were there too, Mr President. That is right, I dreamed that all three of us were swimming in euro coins. Why is that? Because I had become rich when, following the adoption of the European limited liability company, I had become an industrialist, I had built factories throughout Europe and I had established registered offices of the European company in all 15 States of Europe. This directive is excellent and is the first step along a path that will lead many people to the wealth that made me – the first to set up a European company in all the States – so rich, so stinking rich.</p>
<p class="contents">Well then, Mr President, to conclude my expression of support for this directive, I can only invite Mr Menrad, who has been working on his report and the directive for many years, and you as well, Mr President, to come for a swim in my pool full of euros, to come and stay with me for a holiday in my newly-acquired castle. Only in your dreams, of course, Mr President! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that, in light of the Treaty of Maastricht and the Social Protocol, since 1974 there has only been one legislative instrument adopted at European Union level. Therefore, those of us who are tuned in to the thoughts of millions and millions of workers can today be satisfied because this second approximation is taking place, and then we will also see the reform of the Statute. However, Mr President, the least we can say is that we are going too slowly and with so many preventions and precautions (with regard to certain countries represented in the Council, including my own) that, in the end we have frankly witnessed an anticlimax. Very little has been produced. However, I am going to support it, of course. After so much drought we have this little drop of fresh water which, although it is still insufficient, is beginning to eradicate this terrible anguish which our citizens are also suffering.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind the members of the Council, as Mrs Weiler has said, that what is happening in Europe and in the rest of the world is that the people are extremely concerned, given the social advances they had achieved in each individual country, that the process of globalisation, the process of European Union construction – and next the enlargement of that Union – should not under any circumstances lead to a reversal of those social advances. Nevertheless, we are seeing that many governments, and some sections of political opinion, as well as sections of business, now intend to remove many of the achievements which had been made at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate Mr Menrad because he has defended, from the point of view of the best Christian Democrat tradition, as well as our Social Democratic tradition, the social achievements made in his country of origin and intended for the whole of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">That must be our perspective: to move forward and to take the direction of the most advanced countries, and not of the least advanced; to take up the arguments of those who are thinking of the citizens, of the workers, and not of those who are considering how to remove the historic achievements of those citizens and workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President, despite many doubts, doubts about the legal basis – I believe we will have to make an effort to defend the rights of Parliament – we must not delay this company legislation for one more second since, together with the directive on information and consultation, it must make rapid progress. And there will still be time, with experience, to improve on the current deficiencies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But from our different positions across the House we should not really complain about what this legislation does not do. We should be happy about what it does do, which is to enable a European company statute to come into force after 30 long years.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been said, this is voluntary. We do not know at this stage how many companies will be interested in starting up such companies, nor what flaws they might find in the legislation if they do. We do not know what companies might be interested but are deterred from starting up such companies, again because of flaws in the legislation. Other changes might be needed.</p>
<p class="contents">I discussed with one of the rapporteurs, Mr Menrad, the idea of putting into his report an amendment that this legislation should be looked at again within a reasonable period of time to see what improvements might be needed in the light of experience. He was happy to support this, but very wisely suggested that any such amendment should be put into the main body of the statute report, in other words, the Hans-Peter Mayer report. On that basis I did not table any such amendment here but would highlight Amendment No 16 in the Hans-Peter Mayer report which specifically covers all issues, therefore including consultation issues. Too often EU laws get set in stone. We need to become much lighter on our feet. This should become the rule rather than the exception. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although the first proposal for a regulation dates back to 1970, we had to wait for the Nice European Council before we finally reached an agreement on a draft directive on employee involvement, which supplements the draft regulation on the Statute for a European Company. It was therefore a delicate balance that was found at the Council meeting on 20 December and it is vital to ensure that we retain this balance.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why Amendment No 4, which requires Member States to make appropriate provisions for negotiations in the case of structural changes, seems hard to accept as it amounts to bringing into question the hard-fought agreement. The same applies to Amendment No 7 which seeks to remove the exhaustive list of rights held by the body representing employees in the participation process, which, in practice, leads to a participation system that disregards specific national characteristics and casts doubt upon the safeguard mechanism of rights to participation, set out in the Annex to the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Key players in the economy and society have been waiting for the Statute for the European Company for more than 30 years. We must therefore ensure, ladies and gentlemen, that we fulfil the need expressed by companies for simplicity and flexibility and that we do not, as a result, complicate this statute by incorporating new restrictions which would discourage the companies concerned, and particularly small and medium-sized companies, from using this new tool that is at their disposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am glad that the Mayer and Menrad reports were discussed together because this also underlines the fact that we are endeavouring to live out the social market economy and, rather than play social policy off against economic policy, consider these as complementary and common factors and establish a symbol of unity.</p>
<p class="contents">On which basic conditions is this European limited liability company founded? Globalisation brings home to us what it means for there to be no borders; the internal market is hopefully on the verge of implementation, enlargement of the European Union will unite the continent, and there will be notes and coins for economic and monetary union, with the euro as the visible sign of Europe’s coming together, the symbol of a growing European identity and the expression of the Union’s intention to be a resolute presence on the world market.</p>
<p class="contents">We are agreed upon the objectives. However, transposition is often half-hearted. The keys to this are the legal base, an absence of European fiscal regulation and essential discussions on modernising the regulations governing European mergers. A number of tasks have failed to be undertaken in the Member States at the necessary pace and with the necessary determination. The jurisdiction – the key word here is unanimity – corresponds to the realities of power politics, not however to the requirements of European politics.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I call therefore on the Ecofin Council to devote more of its time to fiscal assessment at Community level and to the necessary fiscal regulations and less time to proposals which undermine the stability pact and weaken the euro. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As we all know, this has been one of the most laborious and long-standing matters which we have dealt with in the European Union, with over 30 years of painful and intricate debates.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout this period, Parliament has always expressed its clear support for the idea of making a Community law form of incorporation available to businesses. However you have on different occasions, most recently in 1990, 1996 and 1998, expressed serious concern about some of the controversial aspects of the texts which were then being discussed, notably with regard to employee participation, which clearly was the most complex issue involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The texts which were finally politically agreed by the Council following the Nice Summits reflect most, if not all, of Parliament's concerns. Those texts are not perfect, but they do translate the broad consensus which now exists within the Council of Ministers and Parliament on the rules which should govern this new form of company. That consensus, as is well known, was extremely difficult to achieve and it must be safeguarded if we wish to see the texts finally adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">In five years' time we shall review both the regulation and the directive after an initial period of experience with their application. That will certainly be an opportunity to deal with their possible inadequacies and shortcomings, some of which have been rightly pointed out this afternoon. For those reasons, and taking into account the delicacy of the consensus established within the Council, the Commission believes that the only realistic option at this stage consists in having the texts agreed in December 2000 adopted by the Council as soon as possible without any changes.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware of Parliament's reservations, as voiced by many speakers this afternoon, about the legal basis chosen unanimously by the Council. The Commission has always supported the strongest possible role for Parliament and we regret that it has been deprived of codecision powers in this matter. But we must admit that there are strong legal arguments in favour of the legal basis adopted by the Council. Even though the Commission did in the past consider other possibilities, we recognise that the Treaty as currently worded makes it difficult to use a qualified majority codecision legal basis in this context, especially with regard to the proposed directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Since many speakers this afternoon have voiced their doubts on the matter of the legal basis, perhaps I can say a few more words on this important matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposed, for both the regulation and the directive, two legal bases allowing for the adoption of the acts by qualified majority voting within the Council. But at the end of last year the Commission was confronted with the fact that the Council had unanimously changed the proposed legal basis of both texts to Article 308 of the Treaty, which requires unanimity. The Commission is aware of and very much regrets the fact that this change has deprived Parliament of its codecision powers on a matter on which it has always expressed a strong interest. But the Commission cannot ignore the fact that the texts agreed by the Council in December 2000 follow very closely the opinions delivered by this Parliament over the years.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, from a strictly legal perspective, the Commission can understand the reservations expressed by the Council on Article 95 as the correct legal basis for the regulation, since the regulation is not aimed at harmonising national company laws. The rules in question address only the future <span class="italic">societas Europaea </span>and they do not affect other national provisions applicable to public limited companies at all. So, although the Commission regrets that the legal basis was changed, there is substance to the Council's opinion on the legal basis, and it cannot, just be dismissed out of hand.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to taxation, which also has been mentioned by a number of Members of Parliament, you may know that the Commission originally proposed specific tax rules for inclusion in the European Company Statute, but the Council insisted on deleting them. I am firmly convinced that tax rules are still needed and I am pleased that the Commission and Parliament seem to agree on this fundamental point. The Commission will probably be producing its analytical study of company taxation in the internal market and a related policy of communication next month.</p>
<p class="contents">Amongst other things, these documents analyse the tax obstacles for cross-border economic activities by all companies in the EU and possible ways of dealing with them. Members of Parliament only have to talk to business people in various Member States to know that those tax obstacles are extremely real and very serious.</p>
<p class="contents">The documents I have just mentioned also look into the specific situation of companies formed under the Statute for the European Company and the Commission believes that they will provide an excellent framework for determining the best way forward. In particular, I believe that serious thought should be given to a comprehensive solution for the current company tax problems for businesses active in more than one Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">In the aftermath of the study I alluded to just now, the Commission intends to launch a broad debate on the future of company taxation in the internal market and the need for fundamental reform, not least in order to achieve the EU objectives of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, as agreed at the Lisbon European Council of March 1999. In this context we shall take up the tax issues relating to the European Company Statute and treat them as a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind the specific issues involved here and the intention companies have expressed of creating European companies, I am confident that Parliament will support final adoption by the Council without further delay and I thank Parliament in advance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
