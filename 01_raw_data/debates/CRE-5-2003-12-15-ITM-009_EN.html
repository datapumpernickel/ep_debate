<p class="contents">Mr President, Council, Commission, ladies and gentlemen, above all, thank you for the pleasant working relationship in this particularly complex and taxing matter, which is both legally complex and politically sensitive. This cooperation has enabled us to vote in December after all, and I can see a possibility of reaching a compromise with the Council in this. We have already consulted the Council, and I can see some scope, that is if Parliament dares take a qualified vote about a package I have distributed a moment ago, for I see that as being, after all, a minimum requirement in the large groups.</p>
<p class="contents">I also thank you for the option of postponing the vote to Wednesday in view of the translations not all having been received. They have now been delivered, but at least I now have some extra time to reach those compromises. And in the final analysis, this is very much to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole procedure has turned out to be very difficult. Parliament had to vote on which committee should lead in handling this report, and that is, as far as I know, unique in the history of this Parliament. This has exposed quite a few sensitivities, some of which are excessive.</p>
<p class="contents">I see the text we adopted at first reading as being a reasonably balanced one. Unfortunately, the Council has once again toned it down considerably with very many instances of the word 'may'. In other words, Member States are 'allowed' to introduce something. These should, I think, nearly all be replaced by 'shall'. Indeed, I take the view that both the environment and the economy would benefit if we could create a level playing field instead of creating this patchwork of environmental legislation about Europe, which benefits neither the economy nor the environment. This level playing field is of huge importance. During the discussion of the previous report, I noticed that many Members could talk of nothing else but the fact that it was agreed in Lisbon that Europe should become the world's most competitive knowledge-based economy. We should therefore have the nerve to take decisions that transcend our national interests, and transcend certain political items which we would like to realise. For after all, it is the result that counts and not the fact that I can walk up to my electorate and say: ‘Look how brave I have been to propose this. I may not have achieved anything, but I have proposed it’. I would regret it if we were unable to reach a qualified majority in some key areas at least, thus giving us some negotiating room in respect of the Council to remove some of those 'mays'.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, the joint proposal does contain many texts that were included in Parliament's adopted text, albeit considerably watered-down by those 'mays', and, last week, I think, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market adopted a number of pertinent texts, specifically on financial security with a built-in ceiling and the compulsory financial insurances that are possible over a certain period of time. It is useful and necessary to be able to guarantee insurability. With unlimited liability, not one insurance company will want to conclude policies, unless they introduce these themselves. I fear that we then end up with a situation that is completely out of control, one I do not think will work, either for the economy or for the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, we have once again endorsed state liability, the governments’ safety net function. It is necessary for all Member States to be forced to monitor carefully the permits that are being issued and to check these as well. We need this big stick.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, an amendment has been rejected on a mitigation system, a system whereby the factors are weighed up. Since an amendment with far-reaching defence measures, full exemptions and exceptions, has been adopted, this amendment has not made it unfortunately. As it has been re-tabled, I hope that we can find a qualified majority for these three important points, and that we can also introduce it in Europe. I think that the environment stands to benefit from this, as does our economy, because we will then have minimum harmonisation. That is particularly beneficial for the environment, which does not have any boundaries. Within the internal market that we want to optimise, there are no boundaries for our companies either, so as far as this is concerned, I think that minimum harmonisation is an excellent starting point that benefits both the environment and our economy.</p>
<p class="contents">If we fail to reach a qualified majority on these points, I think that, on the eve of the elections, this Parliament should hang its head in shame, because we have given the Council free rein to lay down the detail of something that is tremendously important, and I would regret that. I hope that we will be spared this loss of face, and that we manage to find a qualified majority, particularly for the points that I have just mentioned. I will pull out all the stops for this, and we have all day tomorrow as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The process of getting the proposal this far has not been an easy one, as Mr Manders has already said. It took a long time to develop the proposal and the subsequent discussions have demonstrated a great diversity of opinion in the Council and Parliament. With the overall goals of the proposal in mind, the Commission has shown flexibility in helping a balanced compromise to be achieved within the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">This compromise enabled the overall goal of the proposal to be preserved. The common position aims to establish a Community framework whereby environmental damage would be prevented or remedied through a system of environmental liability.</p>
<p class="contents">The main features of the liability regime itself have not been significantly altered except on one point, which is the very broad discretion that is now available to Member States when deciding to remedy or otherwise environmental damage for which no solvent polluter can be held liable.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments under consideration by the Parliament concern several key issues, on which I should like to comment. Firstly, it is proposed in Amendment No 6 that remedial measures in case of damage to habitats and species are only taken within designated Natura 2000 areas. This means in effect that the scope of the future directive would be restricted to the Natura 2000 network.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot support an approach which would narrow the scope of the future directive even further than was agreed in the common position, which in itself was less comprehensive than the original Commission proposal. Conversely, the Commission does not believe it either justifiable or workable to expand strict liability to all occupational activities in the EU. It cannot therefore support Amendment No 45.</p>
<p class="contents">The scope of the directive is also touched upon in Amendments Nos 41, 42, 50 and 51 seeking to ensure that the directive should apply in future when environmental damage caused by an incident involving nuclear activities is not remedied on the basis of the relevant international conventions. The directive would in a way 'complement' the international conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the proposed 'complementarity' approach, the Commission does not believe it can work since it would oblige Member States having ratified those conventions to denounce them. We believe, on the contrary, that the international liability regime for damage caused by nuclear activities should be preserved. It is true that environmental damage will only be covered by this international regime once the new protocol to the Paris and Brussels Conventions, recently negotiated under the auspices of the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency, enters into force. This protocol does not allow the EU to become a party to it. It thus falls to Member States to ratify this protocol so that it becomes applicable.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to mention that the application of the relevant international conventions will be part of the review to be conducted by the Commission, as required by Article 18 of the draft directive.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to State subsidiary action, Amendments Nos 11, 13, 47, 59 and 60 require Member States to take remedial action in certain cases. The Commission’s view, after 13 months of difficult negotiations with the Member States, was that the time and conditions were not ripe for such an approach. It agreed consequently to amend its proposal. The common position leaves a wide measure of discretion to the Member States in deciding whether or not remedial action ought to be taken. This was a key point in achieving agreement among the Member States. The Commission will therefore not support those amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the so-called regulatory compliance and state-of-the-art or development risk issue, some amendments – Amendments Nos 9 and 16 – have been tabled that both seek to exclude from the scope of the directive damage caused by lawful events or which were scientifically unpredictable and to ensure that, under the same conditions, the operator will be entirely exonerated from any financial responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission stated on the occasion of the first reading that it considered that better specification of the scope of the so-called 'permit defence' would be useful, to avoid any suggestion that this might be tantamount to a 'blank cheque' to pollute. The Commission does not see that the alternative wording proposed by these two amendments would constitute a further improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 48 and 61, for their part, seek to ensure that the liable operator will be entitled to invoke regulatory compliance and the unpredictable character of damage as mitigating factors. These amendments are acceptable in part and in principle insofar as their thrust goes closer to the current thinking on these issues, as it emerged from the debates that led to the adoption of the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 52, 53, 57 and 58 seek to exclude from the scope of the directive good agricultural and forestry practice, as defined in some agro-environmental regulation. A total exclusion would be only warranted if the agro-environmental regulation ensured the same level of environmental protection as the liability directive. This does not seem to be the case. The Commission would rather see good agricultural and forestry practices as part of the circumstances which would lead to an attenuation of liability.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 17 seeks to impose proportional liability in case of damage caused by several parties.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that Member States should retain the right to opt either for joint and several or proportional liability – or a mix of both – according to their national legal traditions.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to biotechnology, Amendments Nos 43, 44, 54 and 55 require the Commission to present a proposal to supplement the regulatory framework on liability for economic damage caused by genetically modified organisms.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of economic damage to conventional and organic farmers has been discussed and is still being discussed in the context of the so-called 'co-existence' debate. Insofar as this type of damage represents damage which has traditionally been dealt with by national civil liability laws, it is by no means clear whether Community action is necessary and would show such an added value as being justified under the subsidiarity principle. I believe that the outcome of that debate should not be prejudged here.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of financial security, Amendments Nos 22 and 49 require the Commission to submit proposals for a harmonised compulsory financial guarantee, should no appropriate instruments or markets for insurance or other forms of financial security have developed on their own.</p>
<p class="contents">Everybody is convinced of the important role that financial security, including but not limited to insurance, can play in the implementation of the directive. Member States and market operators, as well as the Commission, will have an important role to play in encouraging a timely emergence of financial assurance systems, products and markets to that effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, it is clear to me that Member States should have the possibility to develop financial assurance solutions at their own pace which are well adapted to their own needs and institutional conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be particularly difficult to adopt rules mandating financial security when the economic operators most knowledgeable and economically interested in developing such products have been unable to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is therefore not in a position to support the amendment on financial security. It is certainly willing, however, to encourage initiatives whereby further impetus should be given to the market and all financial security providers to develop financial security products that would meet the new demand resulting from the adoption of the directive and the fact that operators will now be exposed to liability.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the issue of the extent to which damage should be remedied, there is general agreement that the polluter-pays principle should imply for the liable operator, as for the polluter, payment of all damage caused to the environment. In addition, there is a clear need to have a common understanding, within the Community, of the costs of environmental damage to be borne by the polluter. Furthermore, the rules set out in the proposal specify the full range of remediation actions to be carried out by the operator liable.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 31 to 36 narrow down the scope of damage remediation by suppressing the remediation of interim losses, together with suppressing the concept of compensatory remedial measures. Deleting elements from this range of actions would inevitably result in the polluter not having to carry the full cost of the damage he has caused.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said all that, the Commission can support either fully, in part or in principle several of the amendments proposed. Those amendments are: 4, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 23, 27, 40, 48, 61 and 63.</p>
<p class="contents">We all agree that we want ambitious and workable legislation. The Commission sees the common position as a minimum in this respect. Finding a balanced compromise will be difficult, but the Commission will do all it can to help achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Manders, once more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Niebler (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Thank you, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing especial thanks to our rapporteur, Mr Manders, who has been right behind this directive in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and has endeavoured to unite the various views on the directive’s scope into compromises that all the groups can support. So, once again, my warm thanks to him for that.</p>
<p class="contents">Over 300 000 of the European Union’s industrial sites are contaminated, and so it is vital and right that this directive should be adopted, thereby achieving a substantial advance in the protection of the environment. Let me emphasise, on behalf of my group, that, although we support this directive, we argued strongly, as early as first reading, in favour of keeping a sense of proportion when dealing with this directive, for the best is sometimes the enemy of the good. What is good, in our view, is the consensus arrived at in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. What is beyond doubt is that those who cause damage to the environment in the course of their business have to accept responsibility for it. No attempt is made to interfere with the ‘polluter pays’ principle. If you can be shown to have caused damage, then you are liable for it. With this directive, once enacted, we will be breaking new ground in effectively protecting the environment in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In none of the Member States so far has compensation been payable in respect of simple interference with flora and fauna. This directive changes this, and that is what is new about it. For the first time, compensation becomes payable in respect of damage to protected species and their habitats, too. Whilst we stand by this, I have to again emphasise the need for us to keep a sense of proportion as we prepare to take this step, for there is as yet little reliable data that would make it possible to assess purely ecological damage and to calculate what should be paid for it.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me consider a few individual points that gave rise to controversy in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. Firstly, what are the consequences if an enterprise, in doing its work, remains within the framework of the authorisation given to it? The ‘polluter pays’ principle applies; enterprises that damage the environment must accept liability for doing so. I do think, though, that fairness requires that those who remain within the framework of the authorisation given to them should be able to have the confidence that the authorities will make allowance for this if damage is actually found to have been done.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point at issue is mandatory insurance against damage covered by the directive. I do not think it right to bring in mandatory insurance for environmental damage until such time as reliable data become available. Efforts must be made to obtain this data. The directive helps to do that, in that, for the first time, it imposes a duty to compensate in respect of damage that is done to the environment alone, but businesses, and, in consequence, the insurance industry too, must have time to devise insurance schemes that are affordable and the premiums for which are capable of being calculated. The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market wants that time to be made available to them. In practical terms, that means that our group opposes the introduction of mandatory insurance with immediate effect from the enactment of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point I would like to address has to do with farmers and foresters. If the directive is not clarified appropriately, farmers and foresters will be particularly hard hit by its provisions. Farmers live with nature and make their living from it. It follows, then, that they should be excluded from the scope of the directive if they maintain best agricultural practice in the course of their activities. To frame the directive in these terms is not to give farmers and foresters <span class="italic">carte blanche</span>. ‘Best practice’ is a recognised concept in national and European law, one that the Commission has only recently defined, and it gives expression to an accepted standard.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by summing up our group’s thinking. We want the directive passed into law so that it can improve, in the long term, the protection of the environment in the European Union, but let us not make the mistake of being led by good intentions to attempt the second step before we have taken the first. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is for that reason that we have before us a directive that makes a priority of caring for the environment and preventing damage to it. Achieving that objective requires that we be consistent in applying the ‘polluter pays’ principle, which states that those who cause damage to the environment or bear responsibility for it, must pay for the damage to be dealt with, and that the burden of proof lies with them. Only in this way can we put a stop to negligence and the evasion of responsibility at the expense of society as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The names of two ships, the <span class="italic">Erika</span> and the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, are synonymous with catastrophes that disproportionately burdened public funds and cost many people their jobs and livelihoods. Even minor environmental disasters can bring a community to the brink of ruin, and, although we will never be able to completely exclude the possibility of them, unremitting liability for environmental damage will deter those who might be the cause of them. My group takes the view that there is no room for exceptions to be made, and that is why we want this directive to fully cover sectors with grave consequences for the environment, such as the nuclear power industry or genetically modified organisms. Amendments to this effect are before the House.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by adding something on the subject of mandatory insurance, which is meeting with such fierce resistance, particularly from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. In Germany, if you buy a house or own a flat, you have to take out insurance against fire and the forces of nature, even though, in cases of doubt, it is only you who will be out in the cold. No doubt the situation is similar elsewhere. It is, then, quite incomprehensible that the operators of environmentally hazardous plant or those who use dangerous substances should not have to insure against liability. Must it always be the taxpayer, by way of the public purse, who is asked to pay up when things get really expensive? And are we in this European Parliament really going to introduce less protection, less of the ‘polluter pays’ principle, into this area, than the Council is willing to permit? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Just as Mrs Gebhardt said, we face an unusual situation. There is a danger of Parliament impairing the Council’s common position on environmental matters, a factor that also emerged from Commissioner Bolkestein’s contribution. It might conceivably involve a deterioration in relation to the position in the majority of Member States. That would be a scandal and must not happen. To Mrs Niebler, I wish to say that a strict liability exists that is much more comprehensive on many issues than the situation that would result from this common position. The proposal is not, therefore, particularly radical, either.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to take a practical example. If the committee responsible had its way or if Amendment No 61 were adopted, we should be approving a situation in which it would scarcely be possible to require the Helsinki port authorities to repair the damage that is in the process of occurring there through TBT Poison being produced due to dredging and then spread in the watercourses in eastern Helsinki and in the surrounding archipelago. That is because dredging takes place completely under licence, and the authorities had at no stage been able to foresee that this poison would exist in the dredging waste. This case is now also being dealt with by the Committee on Petitions. I wanted to mention this in order to show how unreasonable it would be to adopt the reservations, now chosen by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, relating to existing levels of knowledge and to exemptions from liability if permission has been given.</p>
<p class="contents">Financial arrangements must be acceptable in the compromise proposal we now have. They cannot, however, be harmonised too far, because we have different, quite creative arrangements in different Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to ask MEPs to remember that ‘state’ is not synonymous with ‘authority’. This matter also affects the local authorities to a very great extent, and this fact must be taken account of in the vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Because we are not just saying 'the polluter pays' and, consequently, whoever has to pay can pollute; we are saying that the polluter must pay the cost of restoring the damage which he has caused. Consequently, the directive may respond to our citizens' huge hopes for public health and the environment and we must not water it down.</p>
<p class="contents">Various views were expressed during the debate. We have proven that we can find compromise solutions such as, for example, the gradual introduction of compulsory insurance so that the cost of the damage is never passed on to the taxpayer and the polluter can cover the damage under his insurance, or the compromise whereby the Member States must undertake to restore the damage if the polluter cannot or if the person responsible cannot be found.</p>
<p class="contents">We have problems, however, to which it would appear that we cannot find compromise solutions: how can we talk of agricultural and forestry practices which somehow exonerate the use of chemical fertilisers, pesticides and weedkillers when we all know – from the Union's own statistics – the damage which they can cause to biodiversity, the ground and water? How can we somehow issue blank licences to polluters, accepting the complete exemption of those who hold licences or respect the current state of the art? We have to find ways here too and the relevant compromise proposals exist. If, however, we do not do something in this direction, industry will never be persuaded to abandon polluting processes.</p>
<p class="contents">So things are still serious and I would say that we should also debate the other issues on which I heard the Commissioner being very negative. We cannot have a directive that says nothing about genetically modified organisms and the damage which their free use may cause or which makes no reference to the damage caused by shipping or the use of nuclear energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Compromise amendments have been proposed which I find to be exceptionally moderate and realistic and I do not understand how citing international conventions, especially conventions which not all the Member States of the European Union have signed, can be the answer to this question. So greater willingness needs to be demonstrated by both the Commission and by us, ladies and gentlemen, so that this legislation really is <span class="italic">the </span>legislation of the parliamentary term.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say something because certain members spoke of 'teratogenesis'. Frankenstein, with his technology, produced a monster ever greater than himself. Let us not therefore put ourselves in the ridiculous position of producing a baby monster which is far inferior to our powers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Its declared objective is indeed to implement the polluter pays principle by making the polluter bear the cost of repairing the damage caused to the environment, but also to act pre-emptively thanks to a financial liability mechanism, designed to encourage economic actors to minimise the risks.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal and, it must be said, the Council common position, leave us completely unsatisfied because they give us a text that, I am sorry to say, does not live up to the stated ambitions. Indeed, we note that it offers economic actors several ways out, in particular through legal derogations from liability, by having an appropriate permit or by having state of the art technology.</p>
<p class="contents">Even these derogations are still considered inadequate by our fellow Members in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which adopted an amendment proposing a supplementary derogation for the agriculture and forestry sector: the respect of good professional practice in agriculture and forestry.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that we are now at second reading and I have learnt to be realistic after several years as a Member of this Parliament. We have little room to manoeuvre. We must achieve a qualified majority, and this is why I added my name, on behalf of my group – and I will support further amendments – those which can be described as moderate in so far as they stipulate a very gradual entry into force of the restricting legislative measures without, for all that, invalidating the essential basic proposals</p>
<p class="contents">I will mention them in no particular order. The first proposal is to remove the planned derogations but turn them into factors that limit liability. This is wholly acceptable and I understand that the Commissioner is open to this suggestion. We are, therefore, concerned here with mitigating factors, which are very different from derogations.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in order that the directive is actually a preventive tool, it is a matter of setting up a mandatory system for financial liability, which will be phased in, that is to say, will be implemented gradually.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it is absolutely necessary that, for a certain amount of time, after an introductory phase, the scope of this directive is enlarged. Fourthly, we are calling, and there are several of us doing so in this Parliament, for additional legislation concerning the liability of producers and users of genetically modified organisms in the event of contamination. I recall that the Commission promised this when Directive No 2001/18 was adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly and finally, the situation must be visibly improved as regards the risks from nuclear energy and of marine pollution by hydrocarbons. Mrs Gebhardt, on behalf the Group of the Party of European Socialists, mentioned the <span class="italic">Erika </span>and <span class="italic">Prestige </span>tragedies<span class="italic">.</span> I will not remind you of this problem but we know that it led to considerable environmental damage.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to say a word about nuclear energy. As regards nuclear energy, in particular, operators’ liability remains limited. The fact that there are international conventions does not mean that the situation is satisfactory. Is it necessary to remind you that, according to a study by a group of researchers at the University of London, a major accident in a nuclear power station would cost USD 10 billion, and an accident similar to Chernobyl with extremely widespread contamination of the territory, USD 40 billion?</p>
<p class="contents">These are factors that I ask my fellow Members to take into consideration when talking about nuclear power. We cannot accept that such a dangerous activity is exempt from such important legislation on the liability of economic actors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Parliament’s readings of directives on seed corn and the tracing and labelling of GMOs, it has been clear that there is a risk of unintentional pollution, even with the correct use of GMOs. What is at issue is pollution due to the spreading of pollen and waste seed accumulated in the seed bank. The experts argue about how much waste seed might be accumulated in the seed bank of the earth and for how long. That being said, GMO pollution is not included in the proposal for a directive on environmental liability. That is incredible, partly in the light of the fact that the ‘polluter pays’ principle is established in the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore able to support the proposals concerning GMOs by Mr Lannoye and others. I think that the ‘polluter pays’ principle should be more than just words. It is time that the EU lived up to its ideals. The EU should therefore require the Member States to impose a duty on GMO corn seed and feed – a duty used to fund control and supervision, as well as indemnification for damage that arises from correct use. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the continuous search for a balance has made the directive now before us far too vague, but I nonetheless believe that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and its rapporteur, in particular, have done sterling work in their quest to achieve a more or less acceptable compromise. I am delighted that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has adopted my amendment on development risks and the permit defence. Both the development risks – which are, by definition, unknown and cannot possibly be discovered on the basis of scientific knowledge – and the permit defence will be included in the directive in the form of the entrepreneur's exemption of liability.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore urge the Commission to accept this amendment. This is absolutely essential if we want to promote the innovation and creativity of European companies, particularly in view of the fact that their American rivals have enjoyed an arrangement of this kind for a long time. I do, however, regret the fact that the text does not give greater emphasis to the principle that ‘the polluter pays’. The current wording in the directive is very confusing and can, I believe, lead to legal uncertainty. I regard this as a definite loophole in the legislative text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, in my capacity as chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I would like to stress the great balance achieved by Mr Manders in tabling appropriate amendments on a matter in which it is easy to see that exaggeration and underestimation are equally unhelpful.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive is complex and the – positive or negative – impact on the environment and the production system as a whole depends precisely on whether we strike the right balance. A directive which went beyond what is sensible would be in danger, in practical terms, of imposing heavy, unbearable obligations and costs on companies, possibly even driving them to relocate to other countries where these rules are not in force - and they would be doing so reluctantly - so that they can compete on the international market.</p>
<p class="contents">I, too, would stress the fact that the – not trivial, but important – ‘polluter pays’ principle, by which those who cause damage have to repair the damaged goods, is essential in a society which seeks to guarantee sufficient quality of life in the future too. It is also important to establish what is covered by the protection and, therefore, the ensuing liability: who is liable, for how long and to what extent. I believe that the Council’s common position is, in itself, a useful contribution in this sense, and we must support it. Thus, the principle of ‘discernment and balance’ – which I am repeatedly stressing and which has been a constant theme running through our debate – has led us to identify protected sites, define responsibilities and provide for exclusion from liability for those who have observed legal authorisations and rules.</p>
<p class="contents">I will confine myself to adding to the proposals of the Committee on Legal Affairs, together with Mrs Niebler – the shadow rapporteur who really has done an excellent job, as was clear from her speech yesterday too – an amendment which I feel to be particularly important, seeking to maker clearer the definition of operator, which, as the text is currently worded, does not make it possible to exclude banks and other financial institutions involved from liability for environmental damage caused by financial operators. As I understand it, the Commission does not agree on this point, which I would like to see explored in greater depth, so as to give greater consideration to whether it is sensible to produce a definition which does not cover all possible eventualities and which might, in actual fact, lead to a claim for damages being made to a financial intermediary. This would appear to be a valid request and I do, indeed, recommend that the House support the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I believe that the Committee on Legal Affairs’ position has been linked to a common position; I hope that it will receive broad consensus in the Chamber in the vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the past the polluter has only paid a fine, but we have had a fundamental shift and now the polluter pays to clear up the damage that he or she has created. That is a fundamental shift in legislation. If we are to enact that then we have to look at the financial security systems behind it. That is why I believe mandatory financial security is important. It is a key point here. I accept the point that Mrs Niebler and the Commissioner made that the market is not yet developed. That is why, in a number of amendments, we ask the Commission to study the whole market and ensure that when we finally bring in a mandatory system at a later date, the whole area is covered.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to add that we have also gauged the points of view of the Member States and given them responsibility for defining low-risk activities, i.e. taking them out. That is a major step forwards for businesses of all shapes and sizes.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Commissioner's point on Member State responsibility, I realise that he had difficulties over the last few months negotiating with the Council on this point and that it has not been easy. However, we have to come to a situation where if somebody defaults, or an operator goes into insolvency and does not have this insurance, somebody has to clean up. Who is it going to be? It cannot fall on the local authorities; it has to fall on a Member State and we cannot allow Member States to just walk away from it and allow pollution to continue to grow. Therefore the Member States have a responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Briefly, on the mitigating circumstances, I am glad to see that the Commissioner is accepting Amendments Nos 40 and 61. I hope they go through. And I am glad to see the mitigating circumstances taken into account, along with permit defences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the moment it is a pious platitude to say that the polluter pays - polluters on the whole do not pay or pay only a small part of what they should pay. It would be a great thing to move forward to a situation where it becomes a principle of law and not a pious platitude that polluters have to pay.</p>
<p class="contents">I was grateful for Commissioner Bolkestein's remarks about Amendments Nos 48 and 61. It is important to take account of permits and state-of-the-art. However, as the common position indicates, there are permits and permits. The degree of detail and specificity of what is permitted varies from situation to situation. In these circumstances, to have an all-or-nothing principle - either something is covered by a permit and, therefore, exempt from any liability, or it is not covered and fully liable - seems like a mistake. It seems right to adopt a principle of mitigation so that there is a sliding scale taking account of the variability of permits and circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner also talked about nuclear liability. I happen to be the rapporteur for the still stalled report on the reform of the Paris Convention. I take his point that this will expand the range and level of liability of nuclear operators, but it remains the case, unhappily, that nuclear power still travels in a boat of its own, subject to a rather special exception to the 'polluter-pays' principle - the polluter pays quite a lot, but not necessarily everything in that case. My Group resents the special treatment of the nuclear industry. We said that during the Euratom debate and there will, no doubt, be other occasions to say it.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also concerned about going too easy on the GMO cases. That is another example where deliberate economic activity aimed quite laudably at profit and gain can cause exponentially spreading damage of a most alarming kind, and not to bring that within the scale of this directive would be to create an unjustifiable exemption.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other points I could make, but there are many speakers in this debate. We are very strongly in favour of this directive and hope that it will leave this House in a really strong form. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This heritage is our shared asset and, in order to protect it, we must be extremely vigilant. We must not turn a blind eye to the damage, which sometimes is in danger of going unnoticed because it does not directly affect private property.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, at this second reading, we do not agree in particular with Amendment No 9 of the European Parliament, which excludes from the scope of the directive activities that have an administrative permit or those not considered to be dangerous according to the state of knowledge at the time when the damage occurred. Those who take the risk must also assume it, and this is why we do not agree with Amendment No 39 either, which seeks to supplement Amendment No 9 to exempt GMOs in advance or to lessen the liability of those who work with them. On the other hand, we support Amendment No 22, which, in contrast with earlier ones, moves towards better protection since it reintroduces the idea of a compulsory financial guarantee to be gradually implemented. Indeed, as regards this point, we cannot be satisfied with the vague wording of the current text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As has rightly been said, we are dealing with a really important Directive. We are all aware of the importance of environmental protection and the fact that this Directive reflects the ‘polluter pays’ principle. However, we must also be aware that polluters are often companies, and we must ensure their survival within our economy. I therefore believe that there are two important principles: the first, which Mr Gargani has mentioned, is not to promote the relocation of our companies towards other markets, and the second is to find the greatest possible degree of harmonisation within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that all the countries of the Union must comply with this Directive, and it must oblige the Member States equally: we must not allow each Member State to apply it differently. The scope must be as broad as possible, as laid down in the common position, and, with regard to the possible exceptions for operators with regard to compliance with any previous legislation, I believe it is true that Amendments Nos 9 and 16 are excessive, as has been said here, and would allow some companies to escape their duty to pay. But it is true that we must seek some mechanism according to which the fact that companies comply with the legislation in force is considered a mitigating factor.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the reparation measures, we must allow the Member States to be able to cover the damage created, as reparation measures, as laid down in Amendments Nos 10, 11 and 12 approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the time period during which a company can be held responsible, I believe that the 30 years laid down in the common position is an excessive period. The environmental contingency it would represent for companies seems to me to be excessive, and I support Mrs Thyssen’s amendment, which would reduce this time period to 10 years: it makes much more sense to reduce the time period during which companies must be held responsible for the environmental damage caused. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, however, in order to mitigate the onerous consequences for companies which are not to blame, Parliament accepted that the licence or failure to diagnose the harmful consequences of the activity at issue in time could operate as mitigating circumstances when charging the operator for the cost of restoring ecological damage.</p>
<p class="contents">This moderate position on the part of the European Parliament is now in danger of being cancelled at second reading, in that there are amendments which, if accepted, will result in complete exemption. The licence and knowledge must be taken into account solely as mitigating circumstances. Similarly, on the question of insurance, the cost must not be passed on to the taxpayer. We insist on the need to lay down the implementation stages of the directive, at reasonable intervals, and to define the types of activities and damage covered in the text of the directive as of now. To conclude, I should point out that the contradictory positions of the PPE-DE cancel out protection and it is worth questioning how it is that, while they are calling here for collective responsibility, they advocate personal responsibility everywhere else. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is also evident from the battle between the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. The Council has struck a feeble compromise, which just may take effect after the review in a few years’ time. At the moment, it is feeble at any rate, and will not do much to help improve the situation of the environment. Where biodiversity is concerned, we are lagging even behind the United States in terms of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important to us, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, to extend the scope of this directive. It has been said before: firstly, nuclear energy, secondly, pollution by sea-going ships and thirdly, damage caused by GM crops. Commissioner Bolkestein, you have the reputation of speaking in no uncertain terms and of not pulling your punches, but I have to say that your hiding behind the coexistence rule is, of course, nonsense. What is at issue here is that the Commission is frightened of pressure from the United States, and it should simply admit this. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy was in favour of extending the directive by these three supplements; the Liberal rapporteur, regrettably, was not.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point is compulsory insurance. That is essential. Unfortunately, the Christian Democrats are opposed to this, and so is the Liberal rapporteur. The crucial question is: who should foot the bill for environmental damage? In its draft, the Commission wanted to pass the buck to the governments, and it is fortunate that these, in the common position, declined to do so. The polluter pays, and so he should. It is the businesses, not the governments, that cause pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to get something off my chest. The rapporteur has made rather a hash of things. He has taken only right-wing views into consideration, as illustrated by the amendments relating to good agricultural practice. He is responsible for Parliament’s lack of power, and industry will be grateful to him. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, like many pieces of legislation it could be many years before we see the full impact of it. It is important, therefore, to take the longer view. On the one hand, unfettered commercial activity, as we all know, can destroy the environment. On the other hand, over-regulation closes down commercial life at a stroke. It is precisely this commercial life which we all depend on, on which our culture and our society is based. The second reading position is an excellent starting point and one which we support. However, there are very important points which we need to bear in mind. The first is the absolute necessity to allow the permit and state-of-the-art defences to remain. It would be terrible to see companies in 20 years' time facing prosecutions for things which they did now, which are later judged to have been wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very concerned also about the workability of the compulsory financial security, whether it is in the form of insurance, bonds or other forms of security. We know perfectly well that the insurance industries are not yet able to offer schemes which would meet the needs of this Parliament or the Commission in bringing forward this legislation. We also know that it would lead to a disproportionate burden on small businesses. Do we wish to be responsible for making small businesses go under because we are putting this compulsory liability on them? Indeed, mention has already been made of the taxpayer having to bear the burden, but if we made this compulsory, it would be Member State taxpayers who eventually would have to stand in place to guarantee this. It is much better to leave this on one side for now and see how the directive begins to work and come back to this in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor can we be certain that pollution will respect the boundaries of the EU, however large the EU becomes. It is important, therefore, certainly with nuclear matters and pollution at sea, that we use those models to carry on with our international obligations and work with our other partners around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Too often the best is the enemy of the good with legislation. We need to be moderate in what we try to achieve today. If we keep with what we are proposing in the common position, this piece of legislation can do some real good and should be welcomed and we welcome it today and we wish to see the directive in place.</p>

It follows that there is no doubt that a responsible European economic and environmental policy must, together with the approval procedure, ensure that serious damage to the environment can be prevented, and that any damage caused can be made good, with the costs being borne primarily by the persons or bodies that caused the damage. As yet, not all the Member States apply the polluter pays principle, and so European regulations are needed to prevent the incidence of distortions of competition in the market.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in relation to this that my colleague Mrs Flemming and I support the re-submission of two important amendments calling for nuclear damage to be included within the scope of the directive. I ask to support Amendments Nos 41 and 42, since this directive is meant to cover activities that actually are dangerous. I regard the decision by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to exclude nuclear power stations from the scope of the environmental liability directive as incomprehensible, as it cover all the alternative forms of energy; whoever is responsible for damage done to the environment by wind power, biomass, biogas and solar energy installations, must be held liable. Why not in the case of damage done by nuclear power? In Amendments Nos 41 and 42, then, we are asking for this to be included.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to put the case for greater legal certainty, which is why we are in favour of the period of liability taking the form envisaged in Mrs Thyssen’s amendment, and of legal certainty being created by approved plant being excluded <span class="italic">de facto </span>from liability. The issue of how costs are to be shared between several different polluters must be clarified. I am very grateful to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for the sensible and moderate approach that it has taken. This is a legal directive rather than an environmental one. Above all else, I am grateful to our rapporteurs, Mr Manders and Mrs Niebler, for the work they have done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, that can have a significant preventive effect and can, as such, be justified. However, we should not, in my view, forget that in the proposal we are discussing this evening, we are introducing ‘liability without fault’. Some see it as self-evident that there can be liability without fault; personally, I think it is, compared to the traditional liability theory of the continental legal tradition, a very radical instrument, and it is precisely because it is so radical that we have to treat it with caution. It is precisely because this instrument is so radical that we have to ensure that a number of pre-conditions are in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Those pre-conditions have to ensure that the regulation is legally certain, that it is practically workable, that it is fair and that it does not interfere too much with innovation and development. I will not list the amendments that are useful in this respect. Everyone who has followed the debate will know that I am talking about, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, the exclusion grounds for licence holders, about the regulation in relation to the state of scientific knowledge, about the exclusion grounds for people who adhere to good agricultural practice and about the replacement of joint liability by proportionate liability.</p>
<p class="contents">The Manders report, as we have voted on it in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, provides for those pre-conditions, so I must congratulate the rapporteur and our group’s shadow rapporteur on the work and on the team effort. I should like to ask those of my fellow MEPs who have difficulty with the restrictions introduced in the report, and also the Commission in a way – for it, as I understand it, also has difficulty with a number of our amendments – to revisit the concept of liability without fault very carefully, to bear in mind the difficult, serious impact this can have, and to ensure that we will eventually end up with a better regulation which, for economic reasons and reasons of fairness, is showing some clemency.</p>
<p class="contents">We must naturally ensure that the earth remains viable, but I think that we must also ensure that we have a viable economy, and that we find people who are willing to go into business here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I understand and share the concern to make progress in environmental terms while at the same time maintaining the economic good health of companies, although I believe that is an argument which is used too often and which often does not respond to the reality of the effort companies can and must make in order to conform to this and other Community legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the common position would have achieved, or has achieved in fact, a satisfactory balance between legal certainty, environmental protection and industrial development. However, I believe that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, despite having done good work, is tomorrow presenting certain amendments – such as No 9 and No 16 – which excessively weaken the common position and which I cannot support. We cannot accept that the mere fact of complying with legal activities should be a licence to fail to comply or to be able to act irresponsibly. If measures such as these are applied <span class="bold">–</span> such as those proposed in these amendments <span class="bold">–</span> accidents such as the Aznalcoyar accident would once again go entirely unpunished in whichever country they took place.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to point out that I support Amendment No 46, since I believe that, otherwise, we would further weaken the system of environmental responsibility in certain types of maritime transport, which I believe to be important.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue of financial guarantees, I believe that it improves the Commission’s proposal – which did not provide for them – but that it has not been either as ambitious as initially hoped or as concrete as it could have been. I understand the need to give companies a period for adaptation and I hope, of course, that they will do so as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, it does not make any substantial changes to the Council’s approach but clarifies a number of its fundamental principles so that the directive can be implemented in a more uniform manner over Union territory.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the impact that the regulation will have on industrial activity, we deem it necessary to remove the asymmetry between the legislation of the countries of the Union so as to avoid distortions to trade or to competition between companies. However, a number of principles must be clearly stressed: we need to avoid the concept of ‘operator’ being extended to parties responsible for monitoring activities. The identification of merely potential damage is contrary to the principles of legal certainty and could therefore lead to lengthy disputes which cannot be addressed with the technical and scientific instruments available.</p>
<p class="contents">The operators responsible for the damage must have the option of taking the necessary measures themselves and informing the competent authorities in due time. Intervention on the part of the authority, where either preventive or remedial measures are concerned, should be limited to cases in which the operator is not prepared to act or is unable to do so, in that it is not acceptable for the authority itself to be given the power to take the unquestionable decision of adopting such measures itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, therefore, such intervention only becomes necessary in the case of what are known as ‘orphan’ or ‘public’ sites, or in the event that the operator fails to act. These provisions must be laid down so that decisions are not left too much to the discretion of the Member States. The text of the common position states that the individual Member States may, at their discretion, grant exemptions for exceptions where damages are caused by an emission or activity or event allowed in applicable laws and regulations or in an authorisation issued to the operator or which was not considered to be harmful according to the state of scientific and technical knowledge at the time when the emission was released or the activity took place.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the apportioning of the burden of costs where the damage has been caused by more than one party, the Council has given each Member State the right to provide for both joint and several, and proportional liability, according to the national legislation in force. The apportioning of joint and several financial liability, in addition to being in blatant conflict with the ‘polluter pays’ principle, would certainly make it more difficult, if not impossible, for operators in production sectors to calculate insurance premiums and other financial security.</p>
<p class="contents">Liability and related costs must, therefore, only be apportioned on fair, reasonable bases, with the requirement, moreover, that each operator performs a part of the remedial operation which corresponds to that operator’s share of the liability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The common position which was sent to Parliament for second reading is clearly a compromise. The main issue at this stage is whether it is possible to improve it without opening a Pandora's box and possibly jeopardising what has been achieved so far.</p>
<p class="contents">I am well aware that this proposal is complex and sensitive. Difficult choices have to be made among competing interests. We believe that the common position preserves a generally satisfactory balance and it is with the aim of seeking further improvements, whilst maintaining this balance, that the Commission will consider the amendments adopted by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like once again to thank the rapporteur, Mr Manders, and may I also thank you, Mr President, for giving me the floor a second time in this debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
