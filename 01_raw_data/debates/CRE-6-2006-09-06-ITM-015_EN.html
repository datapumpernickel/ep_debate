<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Carmen Fraga Estévez (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (ES) </span>Mr President, as rapporteur for this report, the first thing I would like to stress is the unquestionable role that a credible label or certification can play, among other measures that can be taken, in our efforts to guarantee sustainable fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the issue has been on the table in the European Commission since the 1990s and so far nobody has decided to deal with it. In the meantime, in a market that is becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues, private promoters of eco-labels for fishery products are feathering their nests, causing complete confusion amongst consumers, at best, and more than likely discrediting the system in general, since when a premium can be added to a product by saying that it is ecological, without the need to prove it, then fraud is a likely outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">I am one of the people who have often reminded the Commission that it should deal with this issue as soon as possible. Hence the disappointment that some of us felt when the Commission finally published this communication: a document almost without content, lacking in analysis, which makes no commitment whatsoever and which does not provide any criteria or guidelines to follow.</p>
<p class="contents">It clearly did not require more than ten years to achieve this result and the Commission is clearly totally overwhelmed by the reality of the attractive market in eco-labelling and the many private interests that sustain it, some of which are laudable and some of which are not.</p>
<p class="contents">In that regard, I would like to mention that, when he appeared before the Committee on Fisheries on leaving office, the former Commissioner Mr Fischler confessed that something he had been unable to tackle by the end of his term-in-office had been rules on eco-labelling and that that – and I quote – was ‘due to pressure from many quarters’. To this we can add the fact that reliably establishing the criteria for defining a sustainable fisheries product is undoubtedly a much more complex task than it may at first appear. We must get to work though, because other interested parties are doing it for us and many of them only have their own interests in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is not alone in this task either, because it already has the guidelines issued by the FAO, and debates in many international fora, including the World Trade Organisation. Governments, NGOs, private companies and fishermen have also expressed their opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">By means of this report, with the invaluable and varied contributions of many colleagues, including those of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the European Parliament is also offering its contribution to the definition of guidelines that will enable consumers, politicians and the fisheries sector to become more involved in the sustainability of fisheries resources.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that, in a global sense, a Community system of labelling must be consistent with the existing guidelines of international bodies, that it must not lead to any kind of discrimination, nor create obstacles to trade, particularly that of the least-developed countries, and that it must act as a weapon for combating illegal fishing by denying it access to the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to its internal functioning, the Committee on Fisheries believes that, regardless of whether there are one or several labels, always of a voluntary nature, the system must be a single system and must be promoted by the European Union, which must establish its operating rules and guarantee the independence of the accreditation and certification bodies, as well as the transparency and accuracy of the information at all stages in the chain of custody, from the fishing vessel to the final consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">We also call upon the Commission to present, within six months, a communication on the minimum requirements and guidelines for a Community scheme for labelling fisheries products. I would also like the Commission, finally, to clarify whether it is in favour of calling it an eco-label, or whether it is opting for another name and why, and we would urge it to take account of the considerations addressed to it by this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased at the high degree of interest they have shown in the Commission’s communication. In fact, the report is a fitting and valuable contribution to the debate on eco-labelling. It contains many elements and ideas that are helpful to strengthen further the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission indeed attaches great importance to the development of a consistent policy on eco-labelling and to a consistent integration of environmental concerns into the Common Fisheries Policy. Together with other actions proposed by the Commission, such as the implementation of sustainability which leads to sustainable yields, or the promotion of more environment-friendly fishing methods, I see eco-labelling as a complementary tool for a more environment-friendly fisheries policy. At the same time it satisfies the interests of both consumers and the industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mr Morillon for his description of eco-labelling as a positive sanction supporting sustainable behaviour. Eco-labelling is a relatively new approach in the context of sustainable fisheries management. It is based on a voluntary and participative approach, through which fishermen will in future, within the limits of the standards set by legislation, define requirements and implement them. Such a voluntary approach has been adopted in other fields, particularly in that of food safety with the enforcing of the HACCP system, and has proved highly successful. I thank you for lending your support to that approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy to see that the Commission and Parliament share the same views on the overall objectives of eco-labelling schemes, on the principles and features that credible schemes should contain, and on the need to address properly a complex and currently rather anarchic reality. Traceability, transparency, a sound scientific basis, and third-party certification are essential. I see these as the prerequisites that will help us make the most of eco-labelling schemes and that will contribute to the sustainability of fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission we opted for launching a debate on the right approach rather than proposing operational provisions at too early a stage. I understand that many of you feel that the Commission should have been more assertive. However, I am convinced that it was wise to proceed as we did.</p>
<p class="contents">Due to the originality of the approach, the ambitious objective we have and the controversy that issues like these invariably raise, it would have been premature to bring forward an operational proposal as early as June last year. I assure you that our choice to launch a debate first has proven to be successful. It has facilitated and accelerated the exchange of views and relevant experience between all sides concerned. As a result we now have a sound and almost complete picture of the situation, on which we can base further Community action.</p>
<p class="contents">The active participation of the Community in the FAO debate has given us an early advantage, and by launching the debate and participating in fruitful exchanges of views we have strengthened our leading position in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The definition of the notion of sustainability is at the heart of the debate. Many of the parties involved have inquired about relevant criteria. To follow up on this, DG Fisheries has set up a group of independent experts to work on that very issue. The expert group is on the point of concluding its work. Based on that work the Commission will draft guidelines for the setting-up of eco-labelling schemes and will propose a list of minimum requirements against which private eco-labelling schemes could be assessed.</p>
<p class="contents">I have taken note of the resolution’s request for a communication to be addressed to the Council and to Parliament within the next six months. I have no difficulty in reverting to Parliament. However, at this point in time, the shape and form of the Commission’s proposals have still to be determined.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at the broader picture, I believe it would be more appropriate to come back to Parliament once the whole consultation exercise has been concluded. That would allow us to carry out a thorough assessment of the following discussions and consultations: a second shareholder consultation, to be held before the end of this year, which would be an opportunity to gather views on the future guidelines; further discussions in the Council in the months to come, which will conclude the current discussion phase; and, additionally, the report from the expert group, which will form the basis for the preparation of operational provisions that could be tabled during the course of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">All this will give us a further opportunity to discuss the future Community approach towards eco-labelling on a consolidated and even more informed basis. That whole process should lead to the adoption of specific and concrete decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendments 1 and 2, the Commission believes that eco-labelling is a tool that will contribute to a more sustainable exploitation of fish stocks and improve the effectiveness of the Common Fisheries Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendment 3, it reiterates some of the advantages of adopting the third option for establishing minimum requirements for voluntary eco-labelling schemes, as mentioned in the Commission communication.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank you for this report and the wider debate generated on eco-labelling. I am confident that at the end of this process we can put into operation a proper basis for eco-labelling schemes that should have far-reaching and positive effects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The overall objective is to encourage the sector to adopt fishing methods more in keeping with the objectives of sustainable economic, social and environmental development.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, there is no denying the facts: the overexploitation of fisheries resources affects 25% of species and, in the case of a number of these, in a particularly worrying way. Where cod alone is concerned, stocks are down to a third of the minimum volume recommended by scientific experts if this species is not to become extinct. These are the terms in which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has emphasised its priorities in the opinion it has drafted. We have our doubts about the option favoured by the Commission in this debate, namely that of establishing minimum demands – as referred to by the Commissioner – regarding these eco-labelling schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">Our own choice is meant to be more ambitious: single, centralised labelling according to essential criteria whereby the scheme is transparent, optional in character, accessible and credible – a point emphasised by the rapporteur. Admittedly, the success of this initiative depends on the actors in the sector being properly consulted. In the end, it basically depends, however, on consumer choice. In this connection, it is instructive to visit, as I myself have done, the fish counter of a supermarket and read the injunctions to ‘protect the sea’, ‘support sustainable fishing’, ‘fish ecologically’ and so on. There is a host of confusing messages.</p>
<p class="contents">With this proliferation of labels, the risk we run is that of missing our target. Consumers will feel neither involved nor encouraged to make the more informed choices we should like them to make, and we shall not have succeeded in achieving our objective, that is to say of creating a virtuous circle. I therefore share Mrs Fraga’s conclusions and hope that the Commission will, in the end, take a serious and analytical look at the options proposed and will take account of our recommendations in the next stages of this process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How do the various labels that currently exist succeed in protecting fishing and in enabling us to say that fishing is sustainable?</p>
<p class="contents">The report states that the European Union must address the issue of curbing the proliferation of different eco-labels and guarantee the establishment of a Community system that is based on the same principles and on the same basic requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">We support that decision, but it must be stressed first and foremost that the implementation of an eco-labelling system will have a strong impact on production in the entire sector: we must begin by starting and developing a debate with operators in the sector so as to carefully assess the consequences for the sector that will result from the decisions adopted for this certification system.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must bear in mind the specific characteristics and features of the coastal areas in which the system will be applied: in other words, the standards and rules will have to be adapted to the reality of the local ecological, environmental and socio-economic system.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the application of the label must be backed up by socio-economic activity-based initiatives aimed at encouraging operators in the sector to join the voluntary system and by information campaigns aimed at consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must pay attention to the fact that the implementation of an eco-label for fishery products must be thoroughly integrated with the recognised quality systems in force so as to prevent any overlapping or discrepancies between laws, so as not to cause confusion among consumers and so as to create synergies among the systems, thus enabling resources to be saved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In-depth study of consumers’ preferences and attitudes is a fundamental need for any industry, and that clearly includes the fisheries products industry. The change in living habits and the introduction of new technologies have led to an evolution amongst European consumers, who are increasingly concerned about their health and also the protection of the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the best methods for providing information is labelling, which must therefore be clear and comprehensible and contain accurate information. I am therefore delighted that the Commission is at last dealing with this debate on systems of labelling for fisheries products with a view to defining the European Union’s approach to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that the increasing importance that consumers attach to sustainable development has led to a disconcerting range of private labels, without any kind of control, which may undermine their initial purpose, that is, as guarantees of a catching and processing system that respects the environment. If, furthermore, it provides additional information on the sustainability of the product, the independence of the control and certification body must be guaranteed, as the rapporteur quite rightly points out.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I agree with the words of the Spanish Director-General for Fisheries Structures and Markets, Alberto López, who pointed to the need to prevent the trivialisation of eco-labelling. In fact, if the labels do not conform to standardised, accredited parameters, all we will achieve will be labels that are all at that level; harmonisation will take place, but for purely commercial reasons, rather than with a view to tackling the real issue. In this regard, I can only applaud the FAO’s initiative to audit all eco-labels in order to identify those which have technical and scientific support and seek consistency and harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Committee on Fisheries share the Commission’s objectives, such as sustainability and the need for European action in this field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It identifies the crucial issues and contributes considerably to the debate concerning them.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the amendments, we support only Amendment 2, taking the view that Amendments 1 and 3 are covered sufficiently by the existing text.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, whatever system we develop must be voluntary, in the sense that companies should be able to choose whether or not to become involved. It must also respect the need for other types of labelling, such as those concerning quality. That said, the report rightly draws attention to the difficulties of doing no more than establishing minimum criteria for voluntary schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">FAO standards mean that there must be a dimension of public ownership. This requires some form of independent monitoring at the very least.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, we believe that a single Community labelling scheme merits fuller exploration. There are clearly potential advantages and disadvantages, but it should be possible to devise something which recognises different fisheries and products, but is neither cumbersome nor bureaucratic.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever the eventual choice, speaking personally as a consumer rather than a legislator, I would make one plea for the use of some clearly identifiable common symbol, comparable to the CE mark currently employed, where we have harmonised rules concerning the health and safety of products. We hope that Parliament will give overwhelming endorsement to the report and we look to speedy progress towards an appropriate outcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have an election in Sweden. One of the election issues is the lack of cod. Voters ask me: ‘How am I to be ethical in eating fish?’ Only this week, I have given them six pages of recommendations on precisely that subject. We need labelling that is easily understandable so that we can go home with a clear conscience and eat good fish. Those who buy eco-labelled fish also want to know that the stock is not threatened. If the last cod is eaten, having been caught with very good equipment, in the correct way and under the right circumstances, it is still the last cod. Such a situation is emphatically not sustainable ecologically. I therefore think that Amendment 2 is important, emphasising as it does that threatened species, precisely by virtue of being threatened, simply cannot be fished in an ecologically responsible way.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to emphasise two aspects of Mrs Fraga Estévez’ report. Independent control, as mentioned in paragraph 6, is very important in conferring credibility. Moreover, it is very important that we in some way facilitate clear labelling for small-scale fisheries. Clear labelling may constitute a competitive advantage for small-scale fisheries. We must therefore ensure that it can be exploited and puts small-scale fisheries in a fair competitive position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first issue raised by this report is whether there really is a need for eco-labelling for fisheries products, and whether this can actually help add value to the product and in turn bring benefits to the consumer. </p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur points out, according to Regulation (EC) 2371/2002, all fisheries activities carried out in the EU should by definition be sustainable, since they should conform to Community standards. It therefore follows that all fisheries products caught on the basis of those standards will have eco-labelling. Nevertheless, any eco-labelling of fisheries products caught on the basis of criteria other than those laid down in existing legislation concerning the fishing catch may lead to discrimination between producers. We therefore feel that eco-labelling would be a positive step. Eco-labelling also takes place in farming, aquaculture and processed foods, enabling issues relating to the environment and food safety to be properly addressed. Eco-labelling would also work in relation to all imported products, which would have to comply with the Community regulation on fisheries products.</p>
<p class="contents">A further issue is whether a Community-level label of this nature would bring benefits over the variety of existing labels on the market, as highlighted by previous speakers, given that these labels can be misleading to consumers and are often simply the result of a marketing strategy by companies, without any public certification. </p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, we believe that a Community-level label would be complex, bureaucratic and excessively restrictive for organisations in the fisheries sector and for the Member States. What is needed is to set up a public certification framework with the direct involvement of the authorities in the Member States. This is the right way forward for defining the rules on this issue, in which there is a legal vacuum. </p>
<p class="contents">As regards the issue of the added value that may accrue from this kind of labelling, we believe that there is a need to ensure its distribution in the value chain in order that producers’ efforts and investments might be rewarded without consumers being penalised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The danger is that when the EU bureaucracy and red tape get to work, the system that emerges could be unwieldy, excessively burdensome and very expensive. The fisheries sector already suffers enough from EU stipulations and restrictions. The most that the EU should do is to set minimum requirements to be met by voluntary eco-labelling schemes. Thus I would have to part company from those who support a single Community scheme with what is termed ‘ambitious criteria’, but which to the industry might seem more like excessive regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Fundamentally, we are looking for good traceability and proof of sustainable practices. These can be secured by setting sensible and manageable minimum standards. We do not need another array of regulation or army of inspectors. We need sometimes to temper Utopian environmental demands with business reality. Whatever the eventual outcome, I hope that will be a hallmark of the scheme. Nonetheless I congratulate the rapporteur on her thoughtful report.</p>
<p class="contents">Tonight I also take some pleasure in commiserating with our rapporteur. I refer of course to the fact that tonight my small country of Northern Ireland famously defeated the mighty football team of Spain at Windsor Park in Belfast. That is something that does not happen very often, but when it happens it is worthy of note! It comes on a good day: a day when Northern Ireland football supporters won the coveted Brussels International Supporters Award for 2006, which is sponsored and supported by the EU.

<p class="contents">A number of new, high-quality eco-labelling schemes have appeared around the world, including one in my country, POPA (the Azores Fisheries Observation Programme), which certifies the tuna catch in the Azores Autonomous Region. The problem is that not all environmental certification programmes prioritise the protection of the biological heritage of our oceans. Instead, there is a range of economic interests often hidden behind this kind of labelling, and this is why, in order to protect the environment and the consumer, we must proceed with great care and assume our responsibilities as political decision makers. </p>
<p class="contents">Among the different proposals put forward by the Commission in this communication, the one that can best serve the interests at hand is that of establishing minimum requirements for voluntary eco-labelling schemes. In this way, on the basis of these pre-established minimum requirements, eco-labelling schemes can develop freely, on a flexible, voluntary basis, via public or private initiatives, yet within a generic regulatory framework. </p>
<p class="contents">As a public entity, the EU must define these minimum requirements because only then will it be possible to protect the general interest and the prerogatives enshrined in the Common Fisheries Policy. </p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should also like to point out that this is work that we have to do, both in the context of the Union and in the framework of trade relations outside the Union, in order to guarantee transparency, credibility and fairness, not least because eco-labelling is set to become a further means of distinguishing between products with repercussions for competitiveness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Eco-certification and labelling lie at the centre of the recent reform of the Common Fisheries Policy.

<p class="contents">One would be tempted to say that in the fisheries sector, every free fish that is caught at sea or in inland waterways deserves an eco-label: it was, after all, raised in a sound, natural living environment, but that is probably not the intention and we will therefore need to look at what can be done at international level, including outside Europe, on the basis of criteria issued by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). In that sense, I have to say that I agree with the report by Mrs Fraga Estévez.</p>
<p class="contents">If you opt for a European eco-label, you have to do it properly. That means that the fish that falls within its scope must meet all the rules with regard to the enforcement of the quota. The rules of environmental legislation must also be met, which also requires the necessary efforts from the Member States, but it could be a good guarantee.</p>
<p class="contents">If you do not do it that way, then it is better to get the industry to deal with it and ensure that a good label is introduced in response to consumer demand. I, however, would opt for the rapporteur’s line, with clear-cut conditions, also for the Commission, so that the eco-label meets the European quota regulations and everything that is connected to this. In that way, the Commission facilitates and industry submits the applications, which appears to be the right way of going about things.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to add a brief comment about small-scale coastal fishing, something to which, I think it good to devote attention. I myself come from an area where small shrimps are caught. An eco-label has now been introduced in that sector as well, which I welcome, certainly if that also emphatically involves sustainable fishing, as well as a number of other things.</p>
<p class="contents">In that sense, I am pleased with this report and pleased that this House, by means of Mrs Fraga Estévez’ report, can make a positive step towards sound qualified European eco-labelling. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have found this debate extremely interesting and I feel that the rapporteur is quite right to highlight the lack of tightness in the definition of the options presented to us by the Commission. What I find absolutely central to the issue is what is referred to in point 8 of our resolution, which is also found in the opinion of the Committee on the Environment; namely that the labelling will only be properly effective if it is uniform and easily comprehensible to the consumer. This is incompatible with a system in which the Commission has a secondary role and in which publicity concerns carry greater weight than a series of tight, objective criteria. From this point of view, therefore, I feel that we must adopt a strong, centralised position, as highlighted by the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment. We must not backslide on this position, because otherwise we run the risk of wasting our efforts and losing the initiative completely.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also wish to congratulate the Commission on starting a dialogue on eco-labelling.</p>
<p class="contents">Eco-labelling on fisheries products states that they were produced in accordance with a specific series of environmental rules and that their method of production does not have adverse repercussions on the environment. It is very important that we ensure that eco-labelling is reliable. This will protect both fish stocks and consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">An effort must be made to inform consumers, who must support it, be informed and understand that, in buying eco-labelled products, they can be sure that they are buying healthy and safe food and that they are protecting the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">We will all win from these efforts: consumers will win because they will be supplied with safe and healthy products, undertakings will win because they will increase their competitiveness and the environment will win because its resources will be exploited ecologically.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I wish to recapitulate: firstly, labelling must be voluntary; secondly, labelling must be dominated by a spirit of transparency, so that no one doubts its reliability; thirdly, labelling must be by an independent authority and fourthly, this effort requires – and I emphasise this even though it is self-evident – fishermen to be present at the talks. Woe betide if we ignore them. We need to sit down at the same table, we need to consult them and they need to understand that the effort being made is in their interest. Fifthly and lastly, this effort and the principles laid down and adopted by the European Union must be combined with similar action on a global scale and all the states must adopt these principles, because it makes no sense if the European Union alone is protecting the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It stresses the basic function of labelling and its importance in improving the quality of fish products and giving the fishing sector a proper social structure.</p>
<p class="contents">I can state with satisfaction that the new Member States from the Baltic region agree with the aims of the Commission’s communiqué. However, their position expressed a preference for certain aspects of the problem of labelling. Four issues are of particular importance in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Baltic states decidedly support the idea of establishing minimum requirements for eco-labelling programmes, in line with the expectations of the parties involved, namely the fishermen, processors and consumers. These programmes should be based on voluntary participation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the principle of voluntary participation must mean, in practice, the rejection of all economic discrimination or trade barriers.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, a major element of these guarantees must be to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises and firms from less developed countries have equal access to the system.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, there is also concern in Baltic states about the limitations related to the control and supervision of fishing in open waters, which has been occurring for years and has been difficult to eliminate. At the moment, it is easier to see a difference in terms of environmental consequences in the aquaculture sector, where labelling is far easier to introduce.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that I agree with Mrs Fraga’s ‘tool in the box’ message, which is an inspiration for the European Union, and provides us with a real opportunity to show the world how to look for ways of implementing long-awaited schemes in the field of eco- labelling. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As usual, she has produced an excellent report; we expect nothing else from her.</p>
<p class="contents">Labelling is the ‘in’ word at present, and if we must have it, let us keep it simple and clear. It should not be a further burden on the industry. I would also plead for input from those who have to implement this labelling to make sure that it is clear and transparent, that it is of good design and can easily be seen and understood.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Maat was right when he said that the Commission must make a good job of it. I fully support what he says.</p>
<p class="contents">This must not be used as a stick to beat the industry. I am concerned that it could be used by some of the scientists and others as an opportunity to curb TACs and quotas when there is disagreement between fishermen and the scientists.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe we need or require a ‘one size fits all’ policy. If we go down that road, we will create a hornets’ nest. Not everywhere has the same problems and I am deeply conscious of the need, where necessary, to ensure that regional differences are respected.</p>
<p class="contents">I listened to the Commissioner with interest. He said he would come back to Parliament when the Commission had taken a decision. Might it not be better to consult Parliament along the way, rather than come back and tell us what you have decided, Commissioner? You talked about a ‘tool in your box’. This must not become another tool in your box thanks to which you can place bureaucratic control on the industry. I am not totally convinced that the consumer is really demanding this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, can I say to Mrs Fraga Estévez and to you, Mr President, there is great joy in Belfast tonight: we beat the Spanish football team 3-2. Northern Ireland is a very small place of one and a half million people, and we have had many problems over the years. It seems that at football we can beat the English, we can beat the Germans and we can beat the Spanish, but last Saturday there were lots of tears in Belfast when Iceland beat us 3-0. So it is a source of great joy tonight that we have beaten Spain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although not in agreement on all aspects, the Commission and Parliament are on the same wavelength as regards moving towards adopting decisions based on tariff assessments and broad consultations. I would underline to the last speaker, Mr Nicholson, that the debate tonight fully reflects the way the Commission wanted to involve Parliament before entering the legislative phase of what needs to be done on eco-labelling. Obviously, when it comes to that legislative phase, the involvement of Parliament will be a top priority prior to finalisation of the whole process relating to the eco-labelling scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me refer to some specific points that were raised during the debate. Most of the existing schemes are in effect relatively consistent and are not misleading. The Commission’s preferred option for establishing minimum criteria for eco-labelling schemes will, however, bring order to the system, where necessary, and increase consumer confidence. We will also be ensuring better quality products and providing for transparency and the traceability of products on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">On the point raised by various speakers on the preference for a single eco-labelling scheme, it is still early to take a definitive and final decision. The Commission has, however, indicated its preferred option and I should underline that the Economic and Social Committee, the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Agriculture, and most industry and stakeholders’ representatives support that option. However, although a preference for Option 3 <span class="bold"></span> the Commission’s preferred option <span class="bold"></span> which is to say the setting of minimum criteria, seems to be emerging, no agreement has yet been reached between Member States at Council level.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I underline the fact that it is still too early to take a firm and definitive stand on how to proceed. However, this debate has certainly helped to better inform us on Parliament’s position and on that of its various Members.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of the harvesting of fisheries resources in a sustainable way, I wish to refer to the Commission’s communication, which underlines that the aim of the policy on eco-labelling for fish and fisheries products is based on the concept of sustainable fishing. The communications spells out that eco-labelling schemes, if based on clearly-defined criteria and appropriate indicators, can assist in both monitoring the progress made on sustainability in fishing and in raising public awareness on sustainability issues. It goes on to make reference to sustainable exploitation with regard to Article 3(e) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the other points raised, I agree with the comments on the importance of independent accreditation and certification. Guarantees in this area are provided by ISO standards and procedures. However, the Commission has no direct competence to enforce those norms.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with the comments made to the effect that eco-labelling needs to be clear and clearly understandable so that it is easily understood by consumers. Moreover, eco-labels offer the possibility of helping to combat IUU fishing and of promoting proof with regard to sustainable fishing practices.</p>
<p class="contents">By virtue of the whole exercise undertaken, we will be increasing awareness among the general public. FAO criteria will be taken into account when it comes to laying the basis of eco-labelling schemes. Moreover, the schemes must not be cumbersome to SMEs, or so complex that they cannot be effectively implemented by stakeholders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
