<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cunha (PPE-DE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (PT) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in this proposal, the Commission is seeking to amend the basic regulation on the common organisation of the market in tobacco (Regulation (EEC) 2075/92), fixing the premiums and guarantee thresholds for leaf tobacco by variety group and Member State for the 2002, 2003 and 2004 harvests. On this basis, one might assume that the Commission proposal is of a fundamentally technical nature and is confined to adapting the main instruments of support for tobacco production, in accordance with changes in supply and demand in the market. Furthermore, this adjustment is made necessary by the current arrangements, since producers must be notified about quotas before 15 April and the relevant contracts be drawn up before 30 May.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, with the excuse that Regulation (EEC) 2075/92 needs technical updating, the proposal goes much farther. In fact, it indirectly introduces a reform of a much broader political scope and goes so far as to set the phasing out of tobacco subsidies as the ultimate objective (see recital 5). In doing this, the Commission is in actual fact determining the scope of the decisions which have been proposed and which, in due course and subject to the relevant proposals, will have to be taken by the Community institutions. There are two reasons for this: first of all, the Commission launched an evaluation study of the COM in raw tobacco, which should enable an assessment to be made of the effects of current Community policy on the sector, and its conclusions will only be available at the end of 2002; secondly, it was the Commission itself that undertook to submit proposals on the new tobacco policy at the beginning of next year, but only on the basis of the studies that are now being carried out. Of course, this proposal will have to be consistent with society's growing demands for sustainable development and high-quality products and, in the same context, must provide an adequate response to the official statements issued hitherto concerning the sector’s future.</p>
<p class="contents">Your rapporteur is of the view that the European Parliament cannot allow the Commission to pre-empt and make assumptions about the decisions that both the European Parliament and the Council will be taking in the coming months, on the basis of the evaluation studies and the latest data recorded in this sector, which I have already mentioned. In this context, the rapporteur's amendments are confined to improving the Commission's proposals in an essentially technical way and explicitly rule out the possibility of entering into a far-reaching political debate on the future support arrangements for tobacco, which can only be tackled rigorously during 2003, taking into account the studies and reports mentioned above.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be considered, however, that this position of the rapporteur does not simply mean accepting the <span class="italic">status quo</span>, which, furthermore, he feels is unsustainable. To this end, the rapporteur tabled Amendment No 23, in order to regain the original spirit of commitment towards the Community Tobacco Fund. This amendment has two implications: firstly, not only accepting financing by the Fund of actions to prevent nicotine addiction and of experimental action to encourage tobacco producers to switch to other crops and economic activities, but also maintaining the financing of agronomic research into varieties of tobacco that are less damaging to the environment and to health; and, secondly, increasing the levy on producers’ premiums from 2% to 3%, thereby rejecting both the present figure of 2%, and the Commission’s proposal of 5%. And, in order to ensure consistency with this vision of commitment, the rapporteur proposes that we also reject Amendments Nos 9 and 13. The around 130 thousand tobacco producers in the European Union, most of whom live in the least-favoured regions of southern Europe, deserve to have the competent Community institutions concern themselves, in a responsible way, with their future. Hence, also, the importance of having sufficient evaluation and impact studies of the current situation so that we can make responsible and realistic proposals for the future, but only once we know exactly what the effects of the current policy are. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Production of this crop is hardly mechanised, so it has considerable social significance and an impact on employment. Tobacco is grown on small family plots in regions classed amongst the poorest in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall give you an example affecting my country directly. Tobacco represents 25% of final agricultural production in the region of Extremadura. The argument linking the end of aid to tobacco and consequently the end of its production with health considerations is quite mistaken, unfair and regrettably also hypocritical. Nobody would dream of suggesting stopping the cultivation of plants used to produce alcohol through distillation because of the health problems caused by alcohol. Nobody has suggested closing down the factories manufacturing cigars and cigarettes either, or banning the sale of these products.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly the case that the withdrawal of aid would put an end to tobacco production in Europe. This would not, however, improve the health of European consumers because the gap left by Community production would be filled by imports from third countries. Anyone wishing to continue smoking could do so. What is at issue is simply commercial interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The only way of tackling the health issue is to pursue the approach launched some time ago by the European Union. This involves developing methods of cultivation and introducing less harmful varieties whilst also boosting information campaigns designed to reduce consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">The opinion of the Committee on Budgets is that agronomic research financed by the Tobacco Fund should be intensified. The European Commission, on the other hand, wishes to stop research and promote conversion, though no viable alternative is suggested.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is exceeding its competence on this issue. Its role should be to extend the aid regime, in a spirit of continuity. We therefore request the deletion of recital 5, and we believe the legal service of the Council of Ministers agrees with us on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are two separate issues and I think that the Commission should realise that, as should many of the honourable Members.</p>
<p class="contents">We are against smoking and we must do all we can to stop it from spreading and reduce it. I have no objection to that. But if we abolish tobacco growing, all we shall do is condemn a number of European citizens to financial ruin and give a fillip to tobacco farmers in third countries. All we shall do is reduce our exports and increase our imports. All we shall do is increase the dole queues in the European Union. Is that what we are trying to do? Is that our objective? In other words, do all those who maintain that, if we grub up tobacco farms in Europe, we shall help reduce smoking, mean to tell us that we need to grub up vineyards in order to fight alcoholism? Do they mean to tell us we should close our car factories in order to reduce the number of fatal road traffic accidents?</p>
<p class="contents">It is time we stopped being two-faced, faced the facts and dealt with things in the proper manner. It is time we sat down together, with an open mind and our eyes wide open, called a spade a spade and worked out a strategy to drastically reduce smoking and its harmful effects and a strategy to develop the economy of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For the rest, however, as he himself has said, the subject of tobacco as dealt with in this specific proposal for a Council regulation is a purely technical matter concerning the 2002, 2003 and 2004 crops. The Commission was wrong to try and introduce political criteria into the debate; apart from the fact that they have nothing to do with the aspects of the issue at debate here, they are also completely groundless, premature and even, I would say, provocative as regards the more general working of and prospects for the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that tobacco is a prime example of a very labour-intensive crop grown on family-run farms and poor, barren soil, meaning that, apart from anything else, it allows man to live and work in areas which, if deserted physically and ecologically, would have incalculable social and environmental repercussions. The Commission knows all this and it was the Commission which used to take every opportunity to reiterate it. Lately, however, motivated perhaps by the expediency of supporting its misguided intervention in Gothenburg, it has omitted to repeat its earlier references and is in danger of putting the debate on this issue on the wrong footing. The right footing is exactly as suggested by Mr Cunha in his report with the support of the Committee on Agriculture, which plenary is called on to endorse and which the Commission is called on to respect in any future action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The statistics show that approximately 130 000 farmers and around 400 000 seasonal workers are involved in tobacco growing, in addition to all those involved in the production chain. This is therefore a serious matter which we feel requires greater analysis on the part of the Commission, not least in the light of Communication No 264 of 15 May 2001, which contains a clear statement to the effect that, should the Commission decide on a political proposal for action, all the repercussions and implications of this strategy for tobacco growing and the reduction of aid to growers would, indeed, be assessed.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason and also for the reasons expounded by other Members regarding the limited actual effect the measure would have on cigarette consumption, as regards the issue of smoking, it is therefore important, moreover, to preserve the research fund, particularly for agronomic research on broad-leaf tobacco, for that represents our only hope if we are to reduce the harmful effects of smoking and contribute to the right of all consumers to health too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It raises the key question as to whether we should continue to subsidise the cultivation of a plant, the main use of which is in the manufacture of a product recognised as being extremely harmful to human health. Tobacco, I am sorry to say, is a hard drug, and we must have the courage to say this.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem dates back a long way and the Commission is using this proposal for updating the regulation to clearly say that we must move away from the system of tobacco subsidies. However, as we must give farmers the time to change activity, the debate initially focuses on the time they are given to do this. And Mr Cunha’s proposal was, from that point of view, very reasonable. It is natural to allow them time – but not too much time – for the planned assessment. The Greens believe that the current situation must be tackled now, whether or not we are continually told that these are poor farmers. As far as I know, Alsace and Andalucia are, in terms of farming, fairly prosperous regions. The question is to determine whether, at this point, we must subsidise, in other countries, growing dangerous products such as cannabis, for example. And we must, at this point, have the courage to say so.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two points to the second question which is that of the Community Tobacco Fund. The first point is the level of the deduction to be introduced as of 2004; the second is the tasks given to researchers who are funded in this way. We believe that an increase from 3% to 5% for this Fund is a positive step; in this area, the Commission’s proposal has very wisely used the carrot and stick approach in order to refocus these tasks over the long term and to replace agronomic research into making tobacco slightly less harmful with measures to support specific initiatives that encourage tobacco growers to switch from tobacco into other crops.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget, however, that products other than the cigarette can be produced from tobacco. It can be an aid to medical research, for example. It is also an excellent natural insecticide. But these are specialist niches, and there is a great deal too much cultivated tobacco for these uses.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greens will not, therefore, vote in favour of the amendments which have undermined Mr Cunha’s patient work. Instead, we will support the Commission in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a considerable achievement, if we take into account that he has had to cope with a scenario created by the Commission, which, as stated by a previous speaker, is plainly hypocritical.</p>
<p class="contents">We might agree that tobacco is a danger to health. Taking this argument to the extreme, one could suggest banning the import of tobacco. I suspect, however, that few Members of this House would be prepared to vote in favour of closing our borders to tobacco from the United States. Treasury Ministers are delighted with the income generated by tobacco, whilst Health Ministers rail against it.</p>
<p class="contents">Just now, for the first time, charges of smuggling have been brought against multinational companies bringing tobacco into the European Union and attempting to avoid paying the duty due.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of lessons to be drawn from that and from the prohibitionist experiments conducted in Europe and elsewhere. In the first place, ceasing cultivation without stopping imports has no impact on the availability of a harmful substance. What it does is make the Community market more attractive to goods from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, prohibition does not stop consumption. Instead it boosts smuggling, to the detriment of health checks and of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, tobacco production generates more employment and stimulates more economic activity than many other agricultural practices such as meat production. Yet the Commission often displays undue leniency towards these other practices.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I also believe that the confusion the Commission may create between the documents submitted to the European Council at Göteborg and the conclusions of the Council is totally unacceptable, and drastically alters the institutional balance. In my view therefore, the Commission’s assessment of the Göteborg European Council destabilises the principles and operation of the Community institutional relationship. I trust the European Parliament will reject it, taking account of the Council’s Legal Services’ contribution to the work of the COMIT. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This change involves paving the way to phase out tobacco production without providing an alternative. However, tobacco production is valued by disadvantaged areas and by many small- and medium-sized growers. The workforce employed underpins the economic activity of rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union produces 5% of the world’s tobacco and imports 70% of its requirements. By ceasing this production, Europe will be dependent on imports and consumption will not be affected in any way. Tobacco has serious implications for public health and our approach to this subject must take this into account. Our priority must be to educate young people to deter them from smoking. Manufacturers also play a part in prevention by financing the Community Fund, which should have been used to inform consumers and also to make progress in research into the harmful effects of products. Unfortunately, no calls for tenders have been issued since 1997. By maintaining production in Europe, we are giving ourselves the means to control the quality of tobacco production and processing. We are also giving ourselves the means to develop less harmful varieties. Producers will not agree to increases in levies on the premiums to finance something that will lead to them being put out of business.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group can do nothing other than to reject recital 5 of the Commission’s proposal, which spells disaster for small- and medium-sized growers that help to maintain an agricultural activity throughout the Union’s territory. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But, given the European Union’s tobacco deficit, our action must, of course, be based on demand and not on supply.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us bear in mind two figures: we consume 800 000 tonnes of raw tobacco and produce 250 000 tonnes in the European Union. Europe imports 70% of the raw tobacco it needs, and so the European Union is far from being the world’s biggest importer. It is therefore obvious that any action that seeks to reduce production would only increase our dependence on imports.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, however, the social effects of such measures that give me cause for concern. Need we point out that tobacco growing is very labour intensive and involves 130 000 growers and 400 000 seasonal workers, which amounts to more than 500 000 jobs? Need we point out that the first processing stage provides 18 000 permanent and 40 000 seasonal jobs in rural areas? Need we point out that tobacco growing is carried out on small family-run farms of between one and two hectares of tobacco, and, on average, tobacco production makes up 60% of the family’s income? Need we point out that most of these farms are situated in disadvantaged regions which many people have left to go to live in towns, which have experienced rural depopulation and problems farming the countryside in rural villages? Need we point out that tobacco growing, which brings in a steady income, greatly assists in maintaining the farming population and therefore trade and public services?</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we must take an extremely careful approach to changing the set-up of the COM in tobacco. When the reform of the COM in tobacco was approved in 1998, Parliament and the Council planned to carry out an assessment of this reform at the end of 2002. This assessment alone will provide a basis for an appropriate consideration of the future of tobacco growing in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore share the view of the rapporteur that no decision should be taken on the future of the existing tobacco regime until we have the results of the studies that are currently being carried out. And I would point out that the Commission must submit a new proposal on the tobacco sector in 2003. For these reasons, I am pleased that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has refused the planned quota and premium reductions which would have severely affected farmers’ income, would have hampered the restructuring of plantations and would not have encouraged farmers to switch to other crops.</p>
<p class="contents">We also oppose the plan to increase farmers’ contribution to the Community Tobacco Fund, given that this Fund – which has an annual budget of EUR 20 million – has been substantially under-utilised. Lastly, we also rejected the Commission’s plan to refocus where support from this fund is directed.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, Madam President, the Commission has put before us a flawed reform, one that, let it be said, also has a tinge of shallow populist rhetoric and hypocrisy, and could have serious social consequences for this sector. The Committee on Agriculture supported the wise recommendations of our rapporteur who has drafted suitable and solid proposals which do not confuse tobacco and nicotine addiction, and I hope that the House will follow suit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is always difficult to talk about tobacco, for we always end up falling into the trap of populism. We know that today’s report is only one of the stages in the discussion, for the real debate on tobacco will start with the Commission’s proposal next year. However, there are three fundamental points to note. Firstly, apart from some rare exceptions, tobacco is produced in the poorest and most depressed areas of Europe. The populism we talk about is also a characteristic of conversion plans: in those areas – and I am referring to the situation of my own country, Italy, but the same applies to parts of Spain or Greece – it is not possible to convert production. And this populism continues to confuse production with consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">As a great French writer said, although it is certainly possible to kick a habit, it is very difficult, for superhuman willpower and, above all, a great deal of time are needed. Well then, when it comes to smoking, it may well be that we should invest heavily – and this could be part of the Committee on Agriculture’s proposal – in an educational process which starts with schools. As regards this sector of agriculture, we must endeavour to realise that entire family networks are dependent on tobacco for a living and that sudden decisions such as those contained in the Commission’s proposal would lead to social and economic collapse that we cannot afford. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As an aside, it was stated that Andalusia is a very rich agricultural area. I have to say that I would be delighted with an income from agriculture as high as that enjoyed by the citizens represented by Mrs Auroi, and so would my Andalusian constituents.</p>
<p class="contents">I side with those in favour of retaining aid to farmers, although I do not smoke myself and advise everyone not to take it up or to stop. I believe it would be a mistake to reduce the cultivation of tobacco or do away with it altogether. My reasons are that this would entail a high social cost and that no suitable alternative crops have been identified. It should also be remembered that those who advocate cutting off aid to the sector on the grounds of health protection fail to take into account that subsidising European production would have no impact on consumption. This is because the European Union imports 70% of its raw tobacco. Nonetheless, we have already been presented with a proposal providing for gradual elimination of tobacco without the relevant studies to ensure alternative sources of income following replacement of this crop.</p>
<p class="contents">There are no such alternative sources of income at present. Discussion of reform can only begin when the results of assessment of the COM in tobacco are available, not in any event before 2003. The Commission aims to replace agricultural research with action to support the development of specific initiatives encouraging tobacco producers to change to other crops and engage in alternative economic activities generating employment. Deductions from the producers’ premiums are to be implemented progressively starting in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community Fund financed by deductions from the subsidies has been underused. This was due to serious mismanagement by the Commission. If the latter handled the existing budget so badly, I have grave misgivings as to whether it would do better with a significantly larger sum. It should be recalled that there have hardly been any calls to tender so far.</p>
<p class="contents">The Fund must of course continue to serve its purpose and pursue research into varieties more suited to demand and causing as little harm as possible. Obviously it must also investigate alternative uses for raw tobacco and its environmental impact. Increased deductions should not be an excuse for covert reductions of the producers’ premiums.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by emphasising the important social and economic role played by tobacco cultivation. It calls for a sizeable workforce on family plots. The debate on tobacco and public health should not therefore be restricted to the agricultural context, targeting the weakest link in the chain of tobacco production. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We disagree with any proposal which is based on the premise of abandoning tobacco production and tries to gild the pill by allegedly seeking alternative forms of employment and income for producers. We all know full well that tobacco is grown in disadvantaged areas in the south, mainly barren mountainous areas, and that it is a crop traditionally grown on holdings on which nothing else will grow. It is the sole source of income and means of survival for people living in these areas, for whom there are no alternative forms of employment. It is infuriating that proposals such as this are being made at a time when smoking is on the increase and 70% of the tobacco used is imported. Consequently, any reduction in tobacco growing in the Community will wipe out thousands of small and medium-sized holdings and increase imports and merely serves the predatory interests of the huge tobacco industry and distribution monopolies, at the expense of producers and consumers alike. The only thing we should be reducing are imports, not the income of European farmers, and every suitable measure should be taken in order to do so. Any other proposal is anything from hypocritical to highly suspicious and a smoke-screen for unlawful interests.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Cunha report is concerned, it contains a number of good points, but it too accepts the objective, albeit with reservations, of reducing tobacco growing in the Community, perhaps over a longer period of time. This is clearly illustrated, for example, in Amendments Nos 7 and 12, calling for tobacco growers to be encouraged to switch into other crops, which is why we shall be voting against it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I make no apology for that. I support the Commission very much on what they are trying to do in phasing out tobacco subsidies and I would encourage them to continue at a faster pace, rather than a slower one. We cannot justify European taxpayers' money being spent on tobacco production. One of the key objectives of the common agricultural policy is to produce good, wholesome food for the consumers of Europe. I cannot quite see how tobacco fits into this scenario.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a great deal of respect for Mr Cunha, the rapporteur, but on this occasion he has got it wrong. He is a little like King Canute, who wanted to stop the tide coming in but was unsuccessful. The Committee on Agriculture did not face up to the realities. Over the past ten years we in Europe have spent GBP 6.5 billion or EUR 10 billion – GBP 2 for every citizen in Europe – to subsidise tobacco. One third of this tobacco is of very low quality and is seldom smoked at all. Another third is dumped on Developing World markets which then destroys their markets for tobacco. Is this a role of the common agricultural policy? It is a role we have tried to avoid. Only one third of this tobacco is smoked in Europe. We cannot, therefore, justify the support that we are giving. We all accept the need to support farming in rural communities, but we have to find different crops and different ways of supporting them in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point I wish to make is that, of all the areas of this support that I dislike, the continuation in Amendment No 17 of the support for very low-quality tobacco is the most wrong. If anything should be corrected it is this. I urge the Commission to phase out the growing of this very low-quality tobacco immediately. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This proposal fixes the premiums and guarantee thresholds for the next three years, changes the scope of the Tobacco Fund and slightly simplifies the common organisation of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as premiums are concerned, the Commission proposal is that the current amounts should remain unchanged, with the exception of variety group 5, which Mr Parish referred to earlier, where we propose a 10% reduction. This being the case, we cannot accept Amendment No 17; the reduction in premiums for this variety group has only been proposed because the market situation is now totally untenable, with prices in free fall and very high stock levels which will affect future developments on this market.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as guarantee thresholds are concerned, the Commission proposal is that they should gradually be reduced by 2.6% to 334 000 tonnes by 2004. This figure more or less corresponds to quantities produced in the 1999 and 2000 financial years. Amendments Nos 18 and 19 are not acceptable to the Commission because the suggested guarantee thresholds and the way in which they are broken down bears no relation to current production demands and efforts to encourage varieties for which there is greater demand.</p>
<p class="contents">Recital 5, which the honourable Member referred to earlier, reflects the political framework underlying the proposal as regards the Tobacco Fund. This proposal is a twofold proposal. First it amends the scope of the Fund, by dispensing with funding for agronomic research in order to support producers switching to other crops and, secondly, it gradually increases the amount retained to 5%.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has created a new political framework in its communication on a strategy for sustainable development. We are working towards phasing out aid for the tobacco sector because we are required under Article 152 of the Treaty to guarantee a high level of human health protection in all Community policies. We too are aware of the fact that there is no direct relation between tobacco production and smoking levels, that is, people will not stop smoking because we provide less support for tobacco growing.</p>
<p class="contents">The political question lies in Article 152, which quite clearly states that a high level of human health protection shall be ensured in all Community policies, that is, including all aid policies. Which means that the other question no longer applies. The deletion of this recital suggested in Amendment No 2 is therefore unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor is the suggested reference to the European Parliament's resolution in Amendment No 3 acceptable because it has nothing to do with the proposed regulation. Amendments Nos 4 to 6, calling for an assessment of the social and economic impact have already been overtaken by events. We are already carrying out a comprehensive assessment which also deals with these aspects. The Commission cannot therefore decide on a timetable for abolishing aid here and now, as called for in Amendments Nos 25 and 26.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of the potential impact of phasing out aid to tobacco growing, especially in various production areas such as Greece, Spain and Italy, where the social and economic structure is particularly fragile. The Commission communication therefore makes provision for measures designed to create alternative jobs and profitable economic activity under rural development plans to support producers switching to other crops.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 7 and 11 calling for continuing aid for agronomic research are unacceptable because promoting measures to switch into other crops is now a strategic priority and we must move decisively in this direction. The Commission takes the view that tobacco producers must be offered new ways of diversifying into other crops or other sectors. Funding can be provided for research under the Community research policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Information campaigns on the harmful effects of tobacco consumption need to be extended and new information campaigns need to contain more comprehensive information on the harmful effects of smoking. That is why we propose gradually increasing the amount retained to 5% by 2004 and why we cannot accept Amendments Nos 7 or 9. Amendments Nos 22 and 23 calling for an additional 5% to be retained are unacceptable because they will overstretch a great many enterprises financially.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 7 and 16 are unacceptable; they are superfluous because the assessment due for completion by 2002 also deals with these aspects. The same applies to Amendments Nos 10 and 24. Amendments Nos 1 and 8 are unacceptable because the derogation for cooperative undertakings is difficult to justify. However, may I remind you that the auction procedure is optional for producer Member States and they are free to decide whether or not they consider it advisable to introduce this procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to point out that the individual components of this proposal, by which I mean maintaining premiums at current levels, adjusting thresholds to current production levels, the three-year period of validity and promoting diversification, form a balanced entity which is tailored to producers' requirements and takes account of new prospects. In the first quarter of 2003, the Commission will present new proposals to the European Parliament and the Council for the future of the sector thereafter, based on the results of the assessment, which should be available by the end of this year.</p>

What we are doing in this proposal is as follows, as I have already explained: in order to be able to take account of the Commission communication to the European Council, we must develop alternative forms of employment for people at the same time as phasing out tobacco subsidies. We do not just want to apply a wait and see policy here; we want to test out various alternatives in a sort of pilot stage and see what the best and most promising alternatives are. Some of the 5% funds which I referred to will be used for this. If you take a close look at the Commission communication on sustainable development, you will see that what we are starting to do is to phase out tobacco subsidies and develop suitable alternatives in the areas affected at one and the same time. That is what I explained and that is exactly what we want to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
