<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watts (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – Mr President, I begin by paying tribute to the Council and the Commission for the efforts they have both made to reach an agreement on a text which I believe will significantly improve maritime safety. But the question that has yet to be satisfactorily answered is why did the <span class="italic">Erika</span> have to break up for the glaring deficiencies in maritime safety to become apparent? Indeed we only need to look at statistics produced by the Paris MOU organisation to see the appalling state of too many of the world's ships. These statistics were available long before the <span class="italic">Erika</span> and continue to show that standards are actually deteriorating. As rapporteur, I maintain my position that the <span class="italic">Erika </span>package will help to improve maritime safety but I am afraid will not prevent another <span class="italic">Erika</span>. I do not make that point lightly. It will only, as an amendment to an existing directive, be effective if the Member States concerned are willing to implement it effectively. If you look at the existing controls, several Member States simply fail to fulfil their legal responsibilities. I am very pleased that the Commissioner has taken swift and decisive action to try to ensure that this is no longer the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the joint determination on the part of the institutions to toughen these measures. In particular, I recommend that we support the proposals to focus our checks on the black-listed flag states and introduce a ‘three strikes and you're out’ rule whereby a ship detained for the third time within a specific period will be banned from Europe's ports.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret the lack of progress on the issue of the voyage data recorder, the ‘black box’. We believe, as a Parliament – and we have said this many times in the past – that this is essential for both environmental and safety reasons. We are pleased that the Commission favours, in principle, a ‘black box’ being fitted to all ships. We are pleased that the Council has made a political commitment to this effect. But what we need is not a political commitment but a legally binding commitment to ensure that these are introduced to old ships and new within five years. The case for fitting VDRs has been made very often. Indeed the IMO itself has agreed in principle that they should be fitted. Vessels fitted with voyage data recorders have a better safety awareness and a better safety record. In other words, it is not just useful after the event but contributes – in my view – to a change of the safety culture for every ship to be fitted with a ‘black box’ voyage data recorder.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the UK Marine Accident Investigation Branch, the reluctance to accept the value of data recorders and take positive measures to fit them in merchant vessels is "a contributory factor to the poor safety record of some ships sailing today". A ship fitted with a ‘black box’ is a safer ship.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that the Commissioner and the Commission have worked hard to try to seek a compromise in this very difficult and complex area. I would welcome tonight a report back on progress with regard to reaching a satisfactory compromise on the particular issue of the ‘black box’. The public simply will not understand why, after so many tragic events at sea – the <span class="italic">Herald of Free Enterprise</span>, the <span class="italic">Scandinavian Star, </span>the <span class="italic">Estonia</span>, the <span class="italic">Erika</span> and many others – we cannot just get on and fit ‘black box’ voyage data recorders.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I thank my Parliamentary colleagues for the assistance they have given me over the past few months in preparing this report. I say that to colleagues from all political parties, from all Member States. I also look to them for continued support through the codecision process. This, I believe, will be the first time in the field of maritime safety that we as an institution will be using the new powers granted to us by the Amsterdam Treaty. Let us use them so that we can look in the eye the families that have lost loved ones at sea and say to them that we will not compromise on safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ortuondo Larrea (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, it is now a year and a half since the tragic accident of the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, which caused a real environmental disaster on the French coast near the Straits of Dover. During this time the European Parliament has been working on a proposal made to us by the Commission, called the <span class="italic">Erika I</span> package, containing two or three important reports. One of them has been approved; the second, by Mr Watts, has been commented on by him; and the third deals with classification societies, the organisations that specialise in carrying out vessel safety inspections. These are of particular importance to us because, if we do not manage to properly ensure that ships sailing under the flags of European Union Member States – or better still all ships – do so in suitably safe conditions, we are going to have to put up with a lot more accidents like that of the <span class="italic">Erika</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, as I said at the beginning, it is a year and a half since that accident in December 1999 and we are still here debating the Commission proposal at its second reading. I think we will have to go on debating it in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that we in the European institutions are responding adequately to citizens’ demands. I believe they want faster, more effective responses in areas that do not just affect people but, as in this case, also affect the environment, animals and plants.</p>
<p class="contents">On 30 November 2000, the European Parliament approved eighteen amendments to the Commission proposal at first reading, and in its amended proposal of 12 December 2000 the Commission only partially accepted Parliament’s amendments. On the basis of the political agreement reached in December 2000, the Council approved its common position on 28 February 2001, in which it accepted fourteen of the amendments proposed by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">When the matter was considered anew in the Parliamentary Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, certain questions were again raised. I shall mention in particular, in increasing order of importance, first that recognised organisations should not be authorised or engaged if they or their staff have certain links with ship owners or operators. The Committee has also accepted that it should be general practice for recognised organisations to consult with each other periodically to maintain their quality standards and also that these classification societies should agree to provide the Commission with periodical reports and be willing to cooperate with Port State control administrations.</p>
<p class="contents">There was an amendment, which I myself withdrew at the Commission and Council’s demand, concerning the cases where a classification society did not have its headquarters or main office in the European Community. I believe this matter is also important, because we are going to monitor classification societies that are based in our countries but not those possibly recognised ones that have their headquarters outside our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">But the most important thing – and this is where the greatest disagreement lies – is the financial liability of classification societies when they are negligent in some way in their vessel inspection duties. In view of the Commission’s proposal that there should be a ceiling to this financial liability of classification societies, the European Parliament has attempted to find a compromise with the Council’s position by providing an option, so that instead of a fixed limit there can be a range within which each Member State can choose its own most fitting or most appropriate ceiling. The Council, however, rejects this position and does not want to talk about ceilings.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we need to go into this further in order to reach an agreement as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After months of work, Mr Watts and Mr Larrea have succeeded in reaching consensus on both reports in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. We had a united stance at the first reading and we will be united again for the second reading tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I do not want to say very much at all about the information they have presented on this matter, but will move straight on to procedure. I regret, however, that the Council again rejected our offer to carry out an informal conciliation procedure so that the Erika I package could be concluded with regard to these two directives in the next few days. Our offer was to seek a compromise prior to the official second reading in Parliament and then jointly conclude the dossier in the next few days with the confirmation of the Council. I think it is a pity that this cannot be achieved. There are two remarks I would like to make here: first I would like to mention that I had to negotiate hard with Mr Gayssot, the French Transport Minister, like my colleagues on the railway package, but at least he was available and we were able to speak. The Swedish Presidency was not there at all.</p>
<p class="contents">As the European Parliament, we should pass a resolution that unofficial three-way discussions should only be agreed to if the minister participates. After all, we do not send our <span class="italic">conseillers </span>to an informal conciliation procedure; we try to bring our own personal weight to bear.</p>
<p class="contents">The second practical point concerns what the Council offered us twice as a compromise, which in fact was an insult to our intelligence, since it was not a compromise at all. I only hope that the Council, and the Swedish Presidency, may yet think better of it. We are prepared to continue negotiating until the end of June, after this resolution and after the Council has passed a resolution on this matter, in order to reach an outcome quickly in a Conciliation Procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I have an important request to make of you, Madam Vice-President: we as the European Parliament represent the concerns of the Commission in this matter, as the Commission too wants to introduce a voyage data recorder. However, as Parliament we are very much afraid, no, we are sure, that the Council is always putting the brakes on us and delaying this matter so that we cannot move on to Erika II. If the Commission is in favour of voyage data recorders, it should support us in the Watts report.</p>
<p class="contents">The same goes for the Ortuondo Larrea report. We are on the side of the Commission, which has proposed maximum limits. When we suggest as a compromise setting minimum and maximum amounts for the financial liability of classification societies, then this is a fair compromise. Mr President, I hope that the Commission not only has its eye on the Council, but that it will honour its promise, bearing in mind that the Commission and Parliament are natural allies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Before the court this is certainly likely to be the case, but on the high sea we can give God a helping hand, and I believe that the Commission did this when it originally put forward the Erika I package. We should perhaps recollect here that this package also included the port state control administrations, the classification societies, and proposals with regard to double-hulled vessels.</p>

Mr Ortuondo pointed out earlier that one and a half years have now passed and I believe that at some point the people too will say: how long does it actually take you in Europe to pass regulations when a disaster like the Erika takes place? It would be good if the Council would make a bit of an effort, as our colleague Mr Jarzembowski said earlier. The Commission and Parliament are ready. All we need for proper regulation is the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is obvious that – as Mr Watts said – the only issue left to discuss is that of the voyage data recorder. We must be able to find a solution here. I have no wish to conceal the fact that I personally am not one hundred percent convinced as regards the issue of ceilings for the liability of classification societies. However, I think that if we as a Parliament want to stay together, then we must be united in a conciliation procedure too. Sometimes, therefore, one must be able to set aside one's own reservations. But an abstention from voting is also a possible way of demonstrating unity in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I have a small request: could you perhaps, independently of the two dossiers, give an appraisal of what was decided by the IMO at the end of April on the issue of double-hulled vessels, and tell us what the opinion of the Commission is on it? That would be good, because then we would have the whole package. We clearly ought to enter into the conciliation procedure with the Council. But maybe then it would not take so long. Because – and Mr Jarzembowski is quite right – it is high time that we concluded this and time that we were able to tell the public that we have taken political action. The public expects this, and so it must be done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reports focus attention on the essential factors in increasing maritime safety.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still, however, much to be done to improve maritime safety. Besides imposing stricter rules, we have to ensure that the solutions implemented are realistic and, furthermore, viable.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has incorporated in its general position a large number of the amendments adopted at Parliament’s first reading. Regarding classification societies, the problem is amending the article that deals with liability in such a way that maximum as well as minimum limits are defined in it. Many Member States do not, however, intend to accept that a maximum limit should be set.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the directive on Port State control, the problem is the black boxes, which we must hurry to fit in vessels. There must be a black box on all ships, but financial reality makes it necessary to seek solutions wherein present cargo vessels could be equipped with technically simplified black boxes.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the approval and scrutiny of classification societies must be tightened up. Expanded inspections must be made of high-risk vessels in particular. The criteria for allowing high-risk, blacklisted vessels access to a port must be made more stringent.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group thinks it important that a solution be found for the problems, that both proposals be adopted speedily, and that we make progress in matters of safety. I still nevertheless wish to draw attention to the fact that decisions made solely within the Union to increase maritime safety are not enough. For example, questions of liability must be dealt with on a global basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, I should like to echo what Mr Jarzembowski said. I believe that there is a great deal of truth in it. It is all about the procedure at the moment. I am increasingly being driven to distraction with regard to the way in which we are time and time again pushed into codecisions. I would want things to move faster, and that should be possible. In fact, everyone – whether it be the IMO or the Commission – is convinced that such a voyage data recorder, for example, is useful. Ultimately, we have very difficult procedures behind us, involving Mr Gayssot, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>. In my opinion, we should be able to achieve results faster one way or another, not just now, but also in future. That is one thing. Secondly, I believe we are right in retrieving the VDR by means of an amendment and, thirdly, it is even more important specifically to consider the evaluation of port State control, for that is what matters. That also includes the quality of that Port State control; not just the technical side of things, but also the human factor, such as the way in which the crew is set up. I have a good mind, pending the second Erika package, to ask again for extra consideration to be given particularly to the crew, the number of crew, the nature of the crew, etc. I believe we simply need to draft another proposal in this connection, for we are not adequately covering that area, and the public will be at a loss to understand why that is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To do this, they used their own ships which were registered in the country in which the owner was based, and mainly employed crew from their own countries. The substances they transported were less harmful than now, and they were little affected by extremely cheap competitors, particularly from the Third World. Furthermore, they could not afford any major scandals affecting public opinion in their own countries. It is precisely in those circumstances that working conditions and safety in shipping were far from ideal. But State governments and trade unions were better equipped than they are at present to monitor the course of events.</p>
<p class="contents">If businesses wish to withdraw from State intervention, this can best be done in shipping activities partly carried out outside of the territorial waters of States. In those areas, attempts are made to use unsound ships and underpaid crew. These ships are registered in a country other than that of the owners, and that is preferably a country were taxes are low and the level of inspection negligible. Crews are recruited where unemployment is high and wages are low. Many ships are obsolete and neglected, and the chances of waste and cargo ending up in the sea are significant. Safety for the crew is generally minimal, and the environmental risks high. I am, in fact, of the opinion that ships should not be inspected by private classification societies, but rather by the government, in sound coordination with trade union and environmental movements. Until that is the case, it remains crucial to ensure that classification societies are not dependent on those they are meant to monitor, for, without such a guarantee, any form of control would be an empty exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">I am keen to support proposals which rule out classification societies if they have ties with the ship’s owner and which demand better periodical inspection of these societies. That is a step forward, as is banning single-hulled tankers and refusing access to ships from states sailing under a so-called ‘flag of convenience’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We of the UEN Group consider particularly important the fact that the Council, like the European Parliament, has endorsed the principle that the system for inspecting certain potentially dangerous ships, an extended inspection to take place annually, should be mandatory rather than discretionary. Who knows how many environmental disasters we could have averted for our marine life, our coasts, our fishing fleets and our tourist operators? Who knows how many oil tanker wrecks, how many deaths, how much serious pollution we would have avoided in our continent if proper inspections had been carried out? Let it be quite clear that these inspections should not just assess the technical aspects of vessels but also respect for social standards on crew living and working conditions and crew training as well. I would point out that 70-75% of accidents are caused by the human factor.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by saying we welcome the fact that the Council has recognised the importance of installing voyage data recorders, better known as black boxes, on board vessels.

Out of 1 200 applications for compensation, only 200 have been paid under the IOPCF Convention. The sums which are being claimed,<span class="bold"> </span>and which are justified, are systematically reduced on an arbitrary basis. The procedures take so long that many coastal businesses are at risk of bankruptcy, particularly shellfish and fish farmers, and the fishing and tourist industries. The IOPCF Convention functions as a mechanism to limit the responsibility of the oil companies, which are thus exonerated of a considerable proportion of cover for the damage that they themselves have caused. It is now more obvious why the United States steered clear of this mechanism; as the settlement by Exxon of the total damages caused in the Exxon Valdez disaster, in other words, FRF 50 billion, would never have been paid<span class="bold"> </span>had it become involved. The total damages caused in the sinking of the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, are admittedly more modest and are currently estimated to be FRF 5 billion, but a maximum compensation of FRF 1.2 billion can be paid under the IOPCF Convention and not a penny more, because compensation paid under the Convention relates to sums held by the Fund, and not to the losses sustained by the victims. The State and local authorities are therefore forced to make up the shortfall, which means that the taxpayer has to bear the costs of a proportion of the responsibility that falls to the polluter. We absolutely must correct this extremely serious discrepancy. We have made a good start with the first Erika package, which is being considered tonight at second reading and we, in my group, approve of the improvements proposed by the rapporteurs, for giving responsibility to ship classification societies. However, when this House considers the second Erika package, we must ensure that a genuine system of responsibilities is established that is clear, fair and which also acts as a deterrent to the two main players, the shipowners and charterers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only this week there was another accident involving a cement freighter in the so-called Kadetrenden channel in the Baltic Sea between Denmark and Germany. The delicate-sounding names of the ships, like <span class="italic">Erika</span> or <span class="italic">Ievoli Sun</span>, should not blind us to the fact that in European waters there are all too many unseaworthy rust-buckets plying about. As someone who lives on the German coast all I can say is: enough is enough!</p>
<p class="contents">The present proposal, which is now before us for its second reading, is a part of the so-called ERIKA-1-package named after the first, very competent proposals of the Commission in response to the accident involving the tanker <span class="italic">Erika</span> off the coast of Brittany. When we concluded the first reading, we were full of optimism, inspired by the Commission’s new-found élan, and we believed that our amendments would be – must be – approved by the Council too, because speedy implementation was supposed to follow. But then things do not usually happen quite as one expects them to.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, unfortunately, we are not much further on. And yet the recommendations of Parliament were entirely reasonable and this was reflected in the common position. Unfortunately, it was not then possible to reach a positive outcome early in the context of the three-way discussion. I say early, I mean of course in logical sequence! I very much regret this because avoiding a conciliation procedure would have speeded up the entry into force of the regulations. Can anyone possibly understand the Council’s blockade any more? There is no doubt that we need a practicable and fair solution to the issue of the liability of classification societies, and one that is also appropriate in terms of competition. We need to have ceilings for financial liability and the amounts need to be insurable. I therefore welcome the proposals relating to this. We must not forget that the issue of liability is not a question of one-sided apportioning of blame. All players involved must bear their recoverable share of the responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">This, of course, is expressed in the form of a greater duty of care – from the shipbuilder to the ship-owner – than has hitherto been the case, and also in concrete sums of money. I say we ought at long last to take a step forwards in the interests of safety. I call upon the Council to support the Commission and us and make its own contribution actively and visibly in the interests of safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, my thoughts turn to how important the forthcoming Erika 2 package will also be in warding off the single biggest environmental threat to the Bay of Finland, namely the construction in Primorsk.</p>
<p class="contents">We are on the way to landing ourselves in an extremely difficult situation in which what are perhaps the worst tankers in Europe are to be used to transport large quantities of oil in the sensitive Baltic. In connection with the discussion of this package, I would appeal to you, Commissioner, quickly to take such measures as will ensure that we obtain the ‘black box’ Mr Watts is talking about, as well as a reporting system for the Bay of Finland. Ice classification must also be taken into account in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we must note that, even though it is the accidents that attract attention, deliberate emissions are unfortunately the source of the greatest pollution. There is much to suggest that prosecutors in the European Union must begin to cooperate better within the framework of Eurojust and, in that way, dare to address this phenomenon. Unfortunately, we are sent many reports, but the prosecutors rarely set to work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is good. However, it would have been better to act before an accident than after one.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two interesting factors in this context. The first is that the Erika was registered in Malta. Malta-registered vessels have been involved in quite a few losses. In the current membership negotiations, there are therefore reasons for imposing far-reaching requirements when it comes to maritime safety and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The second factor is that the <span class="italic">Erika</span> had been approved by an Italian classification society. There has been a lack of supervision of classification societies. This is shown, in particular, by the fact that the same classification society also approved the <span class="italic">Ievoli Sun</span>, which sank less than a year after the Erika. Tougher demands upon classification societies are therefore one of the most important components of the proposal we are to adopt a position on. Such a system would have placed a number of question marks over this particular classification company and certainly over a number of others, too.</p>
<p class="contents">Other efforts are required, too. It is important that the rules governing double hulls should be as stringent here as in the United States. However, rules alone are not enough. The <span class="italic">Ievoli Sun</span> was only eleven years old and fitted with a double hull. However, the vessel was poorly maintained, had a poorly trained crew and had been detained in a Dutch port three times before the accident occurred. It is therefore of the greatest importance also to tighten up on Port State Control and clearly to increase the minimum standard for both vessels and classification societies.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal tabled by the Commission is crucial and an important step in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This accident revealed the limitations of a political approach that tried to deal with maritime safety exclusively within the framework of international organisations like the IMO. Therefore the Commission and especially the Commissioner Mrs De Palacio must be congratulated on the excellent work they have done over this period. In one year they have tabled six proposals aiming at improving maritime safety, showing the great importance attached to this subject. I should also like to congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr Ortuondo and Mr Watts, for the excellent work they have done.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, one year on, although it seems we could be quite satisfied with the way we have responded to the expectations of our citizens, I think we should already have given these measures final approval. In view of the urgency with which both this Parliament and the Council have dealt with this package of measures, one might think we have been able to react quickly. In reality, however, the debate on this subject has lasted quite a long time, and if we go to conciliation we shall still have to wait several months before we see these measures finally adopted, which will affect the credibility of the institutions we represent. And even though one year may seem a relatively short time by Community standards, we must agree with the Commission that perhaps we are jeopardising the effectiveness of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> package by discussing matters of secondary importance.</p>
<p class="contents">The very extensive international safety regulations that today govern maritime transport have brought about a drastic reduction in accidents and pollution, and the measures we are debating today show the commitment of our institutions to enhancing vessel safety and the protection of the marine environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to keep up this sense of urgency in our work without resting on our laurels. I trust in this Parliament’s determination to move the Erika II package forward with the three new measures that complement those we are debating today, and I agree that the Council too must hurry up and support Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us all pull together, so to speak, so that we can present a united front to the party we really have to convince, which is against this proposal as it stands. It is an extremely reasonable proposal, which is not intended to distort the initial position. Ultimately, we are calling solely for this instrument which is so very important – as the rapporteur, Mr Watts, made clear – more in terms of the culture of safety than in terms of efficiency: this black box can genuinely change behaviour, it can force people to realise that the issue of safety exists and that they must be properly equipped. The aim is therefore to introduce, as far as is possible, a new culture of safety, and to define a different two-pronged structure for financial compensation.<span class="bold"> </span>Moreover, I feel that Parliament's proposal gives much more consideration to the principle of subsidiarity, which gives each Member State different options to choose from.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, basically, there is no great dispute. What is truly incomprehensible is how the Council can fail to realise the importance and political consequence of a taking a timely decision on this matter. It has already been said that we cannot allow issues which are, when all is said and done, so minor, further to delay an initiative which would carry great political weight, not just because it would put an end to and remedy a situation which has caused great alarm but, in particular, because it would show that, for once, we are being more far-sighted. We would not want, one day, even before we succeed in launching this measure, the accidents of lots of little <span class="italic">Erikas</span> which, I am sorry to say, continue to take place in our waters,<span class="italic"> </span>to cause another major disaster. We do not want this to happen and we call upon the Council to act wisely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Because it is more environmentally friendly, we have also talked about the need for or the suitability of modal transfer onto short sea shipping, which could be an element in the Community strategy to comply with the Kyoto commitments; about the fact that recent studies show that sea transport is responsible for only 12% of all discharges into the sea, or that it is the most energetically efficient mode of transport, and that compared with overland transport structures, which are highly saturated in developed countries, especially in Europe, the sea is an open, free infrastructure that is still far from saturated.</p>
<p class="contents">The media occasionally report on the tragedies that occur, sometimes with the loss of human lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, because of both the extensive international safety regulations and the more rational attitude and greater awareness that today govern sea transport, accidents and pollution have been considerably reduced. I believe that the measures under consideration today reveal the commitment of our institutions to take on and to enhance vessel safety and the protection of the marine environment, and for that we must congratulate the Commission and the Vice-President, who have tabled six legislative proposals in less than a year. They have reacted well.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I want to talk about vessels not just as places of work but also as places where the living conditions of professional seamen are developed, and therefore I think that, in addition to the efforts to improve safety for the lives and wellbeing of seamen, an effort also needs to be made to improve the living and working conditions for these workers while they are aboard ship. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, first of all I want to thank the rapporteurs for the excellent work they have done all this time on these two very important proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to remind you that the <span class="italic">Erika</span> package, as has been said, was presented just after a truly regrettable disaster, which caused environmental problems for four hundred kilometres of European coastline; we acted swiftly and appropriately in the proposals, but in the informal trialogue we have regrettably been unable to reach an agreement between the three institutions. What the Commission regrets most of all is that we have been so close to reaching one: only a tiny bit more was needed. In the end it was non-essential aspects that separated us, but I fear that these aspects will make us go to conciliation and we will take another three or four months to achieve an agreement on the proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">All this when we can all – Parliament, Commission and Council – be very proud because thanks to our firmness, particularly in Parliament and the Commission, thanks to our work by common accord we have succeeded in getting the International Maritime Organisation to adopt our demands in practically every detail on the use of double hulls as a better or equivalent system to ensure greater oil tanker safety, laying down maximum time periods in which single-hull tankers can be retained and allowed to berth in our ports.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to face the facts, but of course the Commission will carry on working so that in conciliation we can reach this agreement between the three institutions as soon as possible. Basically between Parliament and the Council, although we shall perform our mediation duties, which is our job.</p>
<p class="contents">Points concerning crews have been brought up during the debate. I agree with you – several of you have mentioned it – that the crew problem is crucial. We have presented a communication on seamen, on crews, on their preparation and training. We understand that positive proposals must also be submitted, and we are examining how to extend the benefits of proposals such as the one currently in force in Great Britain, the tonnage tax, how to encourage other Member States of the Union to adopt these kinds of measures, because of course disasters often occur simply through human error. It is true that others are due to substandard vessels, as has been mentioned here, but all too often it is a matter of human error, lack of preparation, sometimes even details like the fact of speaking different languages and not understanding each other, and things of that kind. That is why this point has to be emphasised here, because there are safety aspects connected with it.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us move on to the proposals. With regard to Amendment No 1 to the Port State control Directive, I must say – as I have reiterated on other occasions – that the Commission fully agrees with what the rapporteur, Mr Watts, says on the need to gradually incorporate in fleets the mandatory installation of black boxes in those fleets sailing to European Union ports. But we insist that this is not the place: we are raising it in the <span class="italic">Erika II</span> package; Parliament is discussing it, and in my understanding it is not in this Directive that we should be raising it.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that the proposal to automatically ban a vessel for not having a black box is not practical. Clearly a vessel cannot be banned from sailing without an initial inspection, and as a matter of principle a ban cannot be used as the solution to just any problem concerning safety on board vessels. In the port state control system, a suitable response to that omission is inspection and subsequent detention of the vessel.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed amendment, moreover, includes vessels over three hundred tonnes gross, which far exceeds both the international system and the Commission’s proposal, which only covers those over three thousand tonnes gross.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it is highly likely that at an international level vessels will be fitted with a simplified voyage data recorder, which will be much cheaper to install and will nonetheless provide the essential data, which are also so important for facilitating inspections by port authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also feels that the proposed amendment should not be included in Article 7, since it refers to penalties for prolonged lack of compliance by vessels that do not meet minimum standards or that fly flags of convenience, and here we are talking about penalties against a vessel for a specific omission. Most of all, however, our view is that these issues refer more to the future amendment that would have to be introduced in the other proposal that forms part of the <span class="italic">Erika II</span> package.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree, then, Mr Watts – I have told you so several times – with the need: you are quite right to include black boxes. The problem is where. The voyage data recorder would also have to be considered. We have to analyse the possibility of combining them or just think about one system or the other depending on the type of vessel and the type of cargo it transports.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Amendment No 2 concerning the review clause, the Commission can accept it, but the review process should take into account a period of three years from the date of implementation of the Directive and not from the entry into force of the Directive, since it is necessary to assess the implementation of the Directive after a significant period of time. With this partial modification we have no problem in accepting it.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the second item in the package, the Directive on classification societies, I should like to point out that I fully agree with the rapporteur, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, and all the other Members of Parliament who think that it is all too easy for the Member States to simply place the whole burden of liability on the classification societies and thus exclude their own liability as regards genuine control by the port authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the subject of liability, which is the most controversial amendment, I should like to point out that unlimited liability is already a principle in the case of major offences. I regret that in the end, because of the problem of minor offences, we have not been able to reach an agreement on this initiative. Compared with the major improvements in maritime safety that are achieved here in the general text, the truth is that in the end we have got tangled up – I repeat, I feel quite sad at this – in an aspect that is of minor importance in comparison with the whole.</p>
<p class="contents">In the end, however, focusing on the proposed amendments to the Directive on classification societies, the Commission can accept Nos 2, 5, 6 and part of 7 – provided that the reference to its duplicating IMO Resolution 847/20 is suppressed. We cannot, however, accept Amendment No 1. In this respect we agree with Parliament that there should be no family or business links between the shipowner and the classification society, and this is already included in the text. The problem is that the proposal you make goes one step further and therefore implementation becomes practically impossible. I hope you can reconsider this amendment, because I really think it would be better for everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 3 and 4 deal with the critical subject of liability. Parliament wishes to set maximum levels of liability, and I agree that the principle of liability should be kept. In fact the Commission sought the upper level for harmonisation in the proposal for a ceiling. I must remind you, however, that on all the other subjects we have reached an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, we must try to move the proposal forward as soon as possible. We will have to seek agreements if we cannot get to a second reading. The Commission will always be there to propose formulas and help mediate, but in any case I must again reiterate the excellent job done by the two rapporteurs, both Mr Watts and Mr Ortuondo, and this House as a whole, because I believe it has been extremely useful not only for the Commission’s positions but also in general for improving the quality of the proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
