<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Colajanni </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (IT)</span> Mr President, this House, which has always followed events in the Middle East with attention, dedication and passion, does not need to be told how critical the present situation is, not just because the peace process has been on hold for 18 months and because the painstakingly achieved Wye Plantation agreement has not been implemented, but also because of the continued building of new settlements and the non‐completion of the corridor which is supposed to link the West Bank to Gaza, not to mention the matter of the airport, the port and the prisoners: the causes of contention are legion. I would point out above all that the outcome of the Israeli elections will be crucial. It is not up to us to tell that country what type of government to vote in; naturally we hope to see a victory for parties which desire peace or can put together a grand coalition that is not influenced by extremist groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Circumstances in the region as a whole are worrying: nothing has been settled in Lebanon or Syria, and nor is any headway being made on implementing the Barcelona agreement and process, because it is quite impossible to contemplate a massive programme of investment if there is no security for individuals. The Palestinians are in an untenable situation. Huge efforts have been made by the EU over the past few years, without which the Palestinian Authority could not have been formed; the Palestinian Authority owes its existence to the European Union. Our assistance has been vital to the survival of the Palestinian Authority and also to the life of the Palestinian people, especially in Gaza, a tiny patch of land where a million people live as if in a sort of concentration camp. Even though our assistance has been granted under extremely difficult and quite abnormal economic circumstances, it must continue. Is it fair to demand that the Commission guarantee transparency and combat waste and fraud? Much has been done in this regard, but it is unfair to ignore the fact that any action carried out in that region is hampered by security measures and other constraints which defy economic reason. Unless we understand this, we cannot understand what has been achieved there.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now turn to a particularly sensitive matter. We must realise that we have both asked and obtained a great deal from the Palestinians: free and democratic elections which are a model for many free countries in the region; the nullification of the PLO Charter provision pledging to destroy Israel; an intensification of the fight against terrorism; a curbing of Hamas activity. We are rightly continuing to demand more democracy and lawfulness within the Palestinian Authority. Now, however, we must ask one more thing of the Palestinians, and this is the key point of my resolution. The date of 4 May is a landmark which could prove disastrous. We must now ask the Palestinians to make one last effort, namely to turn back the clock, to postpone their unilateral declaration of independence. But we must give them a good reason to do so, and I believe that a solemn political undertaking must be made by the guarantors, by which I mean the United States, European Union, Russia – in other words, the major Oslo powers. We must issue a binding political statement confirming the aims of the Oslo accords and, above all, guaranteeing that the Palestinian people will retain their full right to self‐determination beyond the deadline of 4 May 1999, which was set five years ago in Oslo.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Palestinians understand the sensitivity of this situation and are awaiting a move from their main partners in dialogue and international guarantors. Furthermore, in my opinion they realise that a unilateral declaration of independence on 4 May could provoke a reaction from the Israelis – as already announced – and that such a reaction would damage the peace process. I believe they understand that such a step could bring victory at the Israeli elections for parties hostile to the peace process, and are therefore disposed to put back the date. But an initiative is required from the EU, the USA and Russia, and this is the most useful thing that can be done at present for the Middle East peace process.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Sakellariou </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office, Mr Vice‐President of the Commission, the Euro‐Mediterranean partnership, which began so promisingly at the Barcelona Conference in November 1995, has today not yet really got underway, having been in existence unofficially for three and a half years. I have presented two previous reports to the House on the Euro‐Mediterranean partnership, which led to corresponding resolutions by the European Parliament on 11 October 1995, shortly before the Barcelona Conference, and on 13 March 1997, shortly before the Malta Conference. I am pleased to say that in both cases the European Parliament voted by an overwhelming majority in favour of the proposals put forward, and I hope that this time too our position will be adopted by a similar majority.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have before us this time is a recommendation to the Council, which has deliberately been kept very short so as not to repeat the proposals of the two previous resolutions, which are already known and have been adopted. I would like to draw your attention to four points, Mr President‐in‐Office, and I would ask you to comment on these.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the deadlock caused by the Netanyahu government in the Middle East peace process has also had a very negative influence on the Barcelona process. Mr Colajanni has just spoken about the Middle East peace process, so I do not need to explain this further. If we wish to take the Euro‐Mediterranean partnership forward we must also take on a more active role in the Middle East peace process. I am not referring to our financial role, as in terms of payment we are top of the league. I am referring to the political area of the negotiations, where our envoy, Miguel Angel Moratinos, must finally be allowed to sit at the negotiating table in the peace talks.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must involve the whole of the Mediterranean area in the partnership, leaving no gaps along its shores. So I agree with my colleagues from the Euro‐Mediterranean Parliamentary Forum that Libya should also be invited to participate. In my opinion, the recent developments in resolving the Lockerbie problem have created more favourable conditions which might allow Libya to be invited to the next conference.</p>
<p class="contents">The Balkan states, which were not able to be present from the beginning, should also be invited, at least as observers this first time. Increasing the number of participants could prove to be a positive development by providing the conference with fresh momentum.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we need new impetus not only in terms of participants but also in terms of content. In the area of security policy in particular, we could present old proposals in Stuttgart, such as confidence‐building measures and a stability pact for the Mediterranean, and new proposals, for example arms limitation and disarmament agreements. We could also breathe new life into the Barcelona process in the area of domestic policy by including immigration issues.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns the indebtedness of the countries concerned. We were prepared to commit a very considerable sum to this Mediterranean policy, but any investment or efforts here will be fruitless unless we can agree on a reasonable way to write off their debts beforehand. I am thinking here of Chancellor Schröder"s proposal at the G8 summit that the money repaid as debt write‐off could at the same time be used and invested for the development of the countries in question.</p>
<p class="contents">If we try to take this approach, to give the process new momentum, Stuttgart could actually be a success.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Tomlinson, </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control. ‐</span> Mr President, the politics of the Middle East have long been a matter of prime concern to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, and I wish to congratulate Mr Colajanni on his excellent report.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the concern in the House extends far beyond the Foreign Affairs Committee, and during the last year the Committee on Budgets has been heavily involved in the future regulations for financing the Middle East peace process and eventually, when Commissioner Marin himself became involved in this process, we saw the results of excellent cooperation between the Commissioner and the Committee on Budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, the Committee on Budgetary Control has long had a deep interest, a concern that arises from the fact that something in the order of 54 cents in the dollar of the Middle East peace process is financed by the European Union budget. In a very difficult political situation it is nevertheless part of our responsibility in the Committee on Budgetary Control to ensure that the European taxpayer gets value for money, as well as the resources put there by the taxpayer having maximum political effect in the peace process. To that end, inevitably the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control raises the critical points rather than the complimentary ones.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like here and now to say that we have been more than pleased with the cooperation we have had from Commissioner Marin, who has answered a very detailed series of questions, followed up by a very detailed set of supplementary questions on a number of the problems that arise in the Middle East from the implementation of the process and that we are very grateful for the cooperation we are seeing from the Commission for a small mission from the Committee on Budgetary Control that will visit the Middle East, particularly to see the value‐for‐money questions in the Occupied Territories. It will obviously be at that time that we will make a final judgement on the value‐for‐money questions and that will be done in the context of the discharge procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, we congratulate Mr Colajanni on his report, we raise the critical questions about the quality of expenditure and we congratulate Commissioner Marin personally on the way in which he has engaged himself with the Committee on Budgetary Control and with the delegation in trying to ensure that we report properly to Parliament in terms of discharge.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Samland </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. – (DE)</span> Mr President, Mr Tomlinson has already mentioned the points that we have been discussing in great detail in recent weeks, particularly in connection with his report on the Palestinian issue and the new rules which we have fortunately been able to put together in a joint package with the Council and the Commission. With the exception of the points that we had asked the Commission to change once again, we are satisfied with its proposal, which has now eliminated the problem areas that we raised in the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would like to take this opportunity to mention two points once again. Firstly, this is a programme that involves partners whose expenditure in the course of the year is very difficult to estimate at the beginning of the year. It is not like the usual Community programmes, where we can calculate exactly what resources are needed. As a result, there is a backlog of funds, in other words funds were earmarked which were subsequently not used and these are now left over.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what we need – and I know how difficult this is, as we also attempted to improve this procedure in cooperation with the Commission – is a more reliable procedure, including in terms of the anticipated expenditure in a particular financial year. I would therefore ask the Commission to try to provide us with greater certainty in planning and implementation in the course of the year. If you look at when the funds were used, you can see that a considerable percentage were not used until the last few weeks of the year. However, in accordance with the Notenboom Procedure, October is the latest we can carry over funds not used in the current year. We therefore need greater assurance from you in future: immediately after the summer break we need you to give us a summary of how much money is still expected to be spent, as we both know that last year we again had to forfeit funds because they were not going to be used in the few remaining weeks before Christmas.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that this is a big problem, especially for partners whom we simply have to deal with differently than we do within the Community; however, we will not be able to avoid this problem, and we do not want to weigh ourselves down with a huge burden for the future. I would therefore urge that this should be taken into account in the report in future, and this is the purpose of the amendment by the Committee on Budgets. We have also included it in our opinion on the report.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Verheugen, </span>  <span class="italic">Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the presidency welcomes the fact that today the European Parliament is looking in depth at the Middle East and the role of the European Union in the Middle East peace process. As you know, the European Union is a resolute supporter of the peace process in accordance with the Oslo and Madrid agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1996 the European Union appointed the Spanish Ambassador, Mr Moratinos, as the EU"s special envoy for the Middle East peace process. Since then Mr Moratinos has dedicated himself with great energy and initiative to the aim of bringing the peace negotiations to a successful conclusion. Every presidency has devoted considerable attention to this region.</p>
<p class="contents">From 10 to 14 February the German Foreign Minister, Mr Fischer, visited all the states in the region and the territories administered by the Palestinian Authority, where he took part in the talks on achieving progress in the implementation of the Wye River Memorandum. I mention this here because the European Parliament"s resolution could give the impression that the EU is not sufficiently represented in the peace process. I would like to point out that so far the European Union has rightly decided to support the USA in its various committed attempts to achieve a peaceful solution in the Middle East, rather than to compete with it.</p>
<p class="contents">The USA has for a long time been a partner that is accepted by both sides, and we recognise and respect its role and its importance in the region. We must remember that this is a difficult process, and that while progress has been made setbacks have also been encountered. The Palestinians" right to self‐determination conflicts with the Israelis" right to live within secure and recognised borders. In view of the complex history of the conflict, tenacity and patience are of particular importance.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point I would mention that the European Union has already made a vital contribution to the progress of the Middle East peace process. The EU has been most generous in its financial support for the Palestinian areas since 1993. Not only has it made an important financial contribution, but by doing so it has also allowed the political agreements to be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is aware that a number of problems have arisen here. The negative economic development in these areas is of course disappointing and sobering, especially in view of the extraordinary efforts we have made. It is genuinely alarming that the population"s standard of living is lower today than in 1993. I believe that the problems are certainly largely due to the deadlock in the peace process and the resulting shortcomings in the implementation of the economic agreements. But the Israelis and Palestinians themselves also bear responsibility, and each must ensure that international aid is applied more effectively than before in their own regions.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget, however, that there are also very successful EU projects that have significantly improved living conditions. Examples include the building programme for schools, water treatment plants in Bethlehem, Nablus and Hebron, and waste disposal in Gaza. It is certainly no consolation to imagine the disastrous route that economic development in the Palestinian territories would have taken if aid from the EU and other donors had not been so generous. One thing is certain: without this aid the territories administered by the Palestinian Authority would not have been viable and as a result the entire peace process would have been in jeopardy.</p>
<p class="contents">We should bear this in mind in future, since our disappointment at the economic development of the Palestinian territories must not undermine the EU"s fundamental financial commitment. Financial aid is political aid. Without our support the peace process and, accordingly, the people in this area would not have stood a chance. I therefore welcome the EU"s offer of substantial aid for the period 1999‐2003 at the donors" conference in Washington and most recently under the German Presidency in Frankfurt.</p>
<p class="contents">On that occasion, on 4 and 5 February in Frankfurt, details were given of how EU funding is to be more efficiently applied. Reference was made not only to obstacles caused by Israeli bureaucracy but also to the difficulties within the Palestinian administration that were rightly addressed in your parliamentary report. By taking over the joint presidency of the conference, the EU also illustrated its commitment effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the EU"s support for the Middle East peace process also has a further dimension: the Euro‐Mediterranean partnership. With the third follow‐up conference of EU foreign ministers and their twelve Mediterranean partners under the Barcelona process in Stuttgart next month, the EU will be making a further specific contribution to regional integration and economic development in the Middle East. We are hoping that this will provide further support for the peace process and open additional lines of communication and dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to look at two further points contained in the European Parliament"s motion for a resolution. The first is the reference to the need to support Jordan. The presidency is very much of this view, as economic and political stability in Jordan is a crucial factor in peace‐keeping in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Foreign Minister, Mr Fischer, also spoke to the new King Abdullah during his trip to the Middle East and expressed the EU"s wish that Jordanian policy should continue as before. King Abdullah assured him of this. It is very much in Europe"s interest that security and stability in this important state should be maintained, and the EU should therefore help Jordan as far as possible. The General Affairs Council of 22 February asked the Commission to examine how the EU can help, taking national contributions into account.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns the lack of water resources in the Middle East. We all know that this is one of the most serious problems in the region and that all states affected will sooner or later be forced to cooperate. Ambassador Moratinos has already held various talks with Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority on this subject, and he has also set up a task force on water issues. During his trip to the Middle East, Foreign Minister Fischer emphasised Europe"s interest in finding a solution to the water problem. Various Member States are involved here.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that the European Union will continue to play an appropriate role in the Middle East peace process. We will pursue our policy with commitment and patience, with great dedication and acuity, and in agreement with the United States. I am sure that in the not‐too‐distant future the parties will achieve the peace in the Middle East that all sides would like to see.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Marín, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. – (ES)</span> Mr President, today we are discussing two documents which, both with Palestine and with Libya, are going to be of great importance for the future development of the European Union"s Mediterranean policy. I would like to thank Mr Sakellariou and Mr Colajanni for their reports, especially since both Members are particularly interested in these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I am only going to give you a very brief political analysis because what the President‐in‐Office said corresponds exactly to the Commission"s position. I should therefore like to keep my analysis short, as I have little to add to what the President‐in‐Office said.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards what Mr Colajanni said, I agree with him that the Stuttgart Conference is very important and comes at a very delicate time politically. As Mr Verheugen pointed out, the Commission and the special envoy, Mr Moratinos, accompanied the Presidency and we had the opportunity to witness the atmosphere there and the problems involved in trying to find an appropriate solution in a difficult political situation. On the one hand, there is the deadline of 4 May that is laid down in the Oslo agreements; on the other hand, there are the Israeli elections, which are naturally going to play a key role in the peace process and in the implementation of the Wye Plantation agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two positive points that I would like to mention. We have worked tirelessly in recent months with the German Presidency – whom I would like to thank publicly – in order to conclude the association agreement with Egypt. In principle, I believe that we will be able to complete these difficult negotiations before the Stuttgart Conference, thereby allowing this important country to finally have its own agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a point about the procedure in the light of what Parliament has recommended. It is true that the ratification of the agreements is progressing very slowly at national level. I would like to take a moment to talk about Mr Samland"s proposals both for the programming and also for the programming of the joint agreements. As you reach the end of your time in the European Parliament, Mr Samland – as I surely am too, since some people are trying to ensure that I leave before my time – I would like to tell you that the system of joint agreements is being changed. If we do not amend that system at the next intergovernmental conference, Mr Colajanni, the average time needed to ratify the agreements at national level will continue to be between two and a half and three years. That is not the Commission"s fault. The problem is that we have a cyclical programming system that needs to be reviewed, and we will have to find solutions for the future through calm and peaceful discussions with the European Parliament and with the Council. I agree with you that there are some things that need to be changed as soon as possible and one of those, Mr Colajanni, is the system of ratifying joint agreements. However, I have contacted some of the Member States by letter to try to speed up the process.</p>
<p class="contents">You raised a key point: how to resolve the disruption affecting the peace process and the Barcelona Conference. We have talked about this on many occasions. In my opinion, the solution will involve organising a meeting similar to that held in Palermo, and we are working with the presidency and have had many technical meetings on this issue. The Malta Conference could not succeed because it took place at the height of the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians. But in Palermo, great efforts were made and it became evident that the political forum of the Barcelona committee had to be maintained at all costs. It is the only point of political reference we have in the Euro‐Mediterranean sphere, given that the multilateral process and the regional process are not working at this point in time. I am very hopeful and believe that we will be able to make significant progress in Stuttgart.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the peace process in the Middle East, we fully agree with what the President said and with Mr Colajanni"s philosophy. We must make every effort to try to obtain an adequate solution for 4 May and a commitment on the part of the Israeli Government to quickly move the peace process forward. In this respect, I have little to add to what was said by Mr Colajanni and by the President‐in‐Office, Mr Verheugen.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as assistance to the Palestinians is concerned, I would first of all like to point out, in relation to what both Mr Samland and Mr Tomlinson said, that the Commission has taken the fundamental step of following up the Tomlinson report by fixing the timetable for the next few years at the conference of donors in Washington and Frankfurt. I welcome the fact that distinguished members of the Committee on Budgetary Control are soon to visit the Territories. But the problem lies in the difficulty of drawing up a financial programme in a situation where there are security problems, terrorist attacks, a lack of dialogue between the Israelis and the Palestinians, closures of the Territories, and obstacles to the distribution of goods. These are all problems that we are very well aware of and they make it difficult to prepare the financial programming.</p>
<p class="contents">That is where the special regulation in the Tomlinson report, approved by Parliament, comes into play. As a result, I cannot promise the chairman of the Committee on Budgets that there will be 100 % funding for the financial programme. That is impossible. I cannot predict whether or not the Wye Plantation agreements will be implemented. I do not think that Mr Samland can ask that of the Commission, of the Member States, or of this Parliament. If the Wye Plantation agreements are implemented as they should be, we will be able to present the financial programme to the Council and to Parliament. If the Wye Plantation agreements do not work, then that will be very difficult. And this is something that I want to stress. Nevertheless, we are going along with the reasoning put forward by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Verheugen made a very important point. In February, at the meeting in Frankfurt, the Presidency and the Commission highlighted the two most significant problems of the last five years. To ensure that the Palestinians enjoy economic development, two requirements must be met: there must be greater transparency in the Palestinian budget, and Israel must put an end to its restrictive policies. If the Palestinian economy is not transparent, there is the risk of corruption, whereas an open and transparent Palestinian economy would make it more difficult for problems to arise. However, in order to achieve this, Israel must accept the fact that a bilateral agreement has already been signed between the Palestinian Authority and the European Union. Indeed, the Commission has emphasised this point on many occasions. It is a fundamental element of our cooperation and we must let the Israeli authorities know that it is a mistake to implement such restrictive economic policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Israel has every right to demand security and greater cooperation in the fight against terrorism. However, it is also evident, as highlighted in the Colajanni report and the Commission communication, that economic development in Palestine is also a key element in ensuring Israel"s own security. Israel will become much more secure as the Palestinian economy grows. If there is no development, there will be more poverty, a greater degree of marginalisation, further difficulties for the Palestinians, and a greater likelihood of extremist tendencies developing.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we want to complete the financial programming for the next few years and, in conclusion, I would ask Parliament to understand one point in this respect. The Commission is going to propose to Parliament and the Council that it should no longer be responsible for the Palestinian Authority"s current expenditure. I want you to understand this. Over the last five years, in order to implement political decisions taken by the Council, for exceptional reasons, and to keep the Palestinian Authority active for political reasons, the Commission has had to finance current expenditure operations that were not included in the economic assistance programme. That was a purely political decision and it must be seen as such.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore do not want the Commission to deal with any more current expenditure. But what will happen if the borders are closed in the next few years? Are we going to let the Palestinian Authority fall? No, we will not. But what the Commission will propose is that in each instance a joint decision be taken by the European Parliament and the Council. We believe that this is a reasonable solution. However, Mr Tomlinson, when you present the report on the discharge, I would ask you not to forget that, for political reasons, the Commission has allocated current expenditure that, in principle, was not included in the economic development programme. There is nothing to hide here and I am speaking very openly. We do not intend to repeat this in the future. Nevertheless, what I do want to state very emphatically is that you cannot accuse the Commission and Commissioner Marín – and I say this without any complex – of having acted wrongfully: the only thing I have done is to implement the political decisions of the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of Jordan is an example of a typical problem of political compromise. The old MEDA programme, which is being updated, included a special structural adjustment programme for Jordan. The Council has stated that the Commission was asked to draw up a special programme for Jordan and that is the case. Once again, Mr Tomlinson, Mr Colajanni, we will have to choose between the political option on the one hand, and financial rigour on the other. And as far as Jordan is concerned, if we have to act politically, then let us do so.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Libya, Mr Sakellariou, we have a political problem that must be solved at a political level by means of a political decision. You are perfectly aware of that and, therefore, we will first of all have to find a solution according to the formula put forward by the Secretary‐General of the United Nations. It is, of course, only right that the Libyan dispute should be resolved. It would also be a positive step if Libya were to participate in the Euro‐Mediterranean Conference. But we all know that there is a precondition. If we can find an answer to the precondition, we will have resolved a political problem. It would naturally be better if Libya"s relations with the European Union were to return to normal. But there is firstly a precondition to resolve.</p>

This recommendation, which will be adopted by Parliament tomorrow, was addressed to the Council presidency, but the Council presidency has not discussed what was in the recommendation.

However, I would also like to thank Mr Tomlinson and Mr Samland, as I firmly believe that the links between foreign policy, the budget and budgetary control must be strengthened in future so that perhaps some of the things that have happened recently could be avoided. Being involved in foreign affairs, I know how important financial resources are in conducting foreign policy, but as a Member of Parliament I also know that we in this House and also the public must be sure that the resources are used properly and efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to comment on a point raised by Commissioner Marín. It was really very interesting, Commissioner. You said that we must decide between policy and financial stringency. Perhaps together we can find a way of combining the two, of taking very useful action in the political sphere and yet being at least efficient in financial terms. You are right on one point: Parliament itself was probably not prepared to make the link between policy and financial stringency. We, at least in my group, are fully behind what you proposed here yesterday. We will support you in uniting policy and financial stringency.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two comments on what Mr Sakellariou proposed. I support what he said about Libya. I have myself visited Libya and spoken to those in charge, and I believe that many people there are ready and willing to become part of the international community once again. The conditions you mentioned, Commissioner, will of course still apply. Perhaps I could make one further point about the Colajanni report as I and others prepare for a trip to Syria and Lebanon. I believe that we must do everything we can to encourage Israel to withdraw from Lebanon, in its own interest and in the interest of the peace process, so that a similar process can then be begun with Syria in relation to the Golan Heights.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would call upon the Commission and the Council to approach 4 May 1999, an important historical date for the Palestinians, in such a way that it does not provoke renewed conflict but instead marks a further step towards peace.</p>

The President‐in‐Office has left when we are in the process of debating a recommendation to the Council. I think that that was very impolite behaviour before the House, particularly since it was not due to reasons beyond his control: he is currently attending an informal meeting in Room 100.

One often has the feeling when discussing Mediterranean affairs that the European Union treats them with a certain disdain, as though Libya, the Middle East and the Balkans are really rather a nuisance. And yet this is both our most sensitive and most fascinating border. Here, different cultures have been in contact for centuries, more often clashing than meshing, but also trading and establishing the principle of communicating vessels in important areas of culture, philosophy and mathematics, to mention but a few. It was not possible in the past, and is even less so today, to define the Mediterranean countries merely as those whose shores are washed by that sea. The concatenation of problems – one need only think of the Middle East and the Gulf – is such that these borders can no longer be drawn in the manner of the Romans, who wrote on their maps just beyond the southern shore of the Mediterranean: ‘<span class="italic">hic sunt leones</span> " – ’here be lions".</p>
<p class="contents">The first fundamental mistake would therefore be for Europe to think that the Mediterranean area can be confined to countries which resemble it to a greater or lesser extent: the multifarious array of cultures and political systems cannot be narrowed down artificially. Europe must foster cooperation with all the coastal states – obviously including Libya – and also, where problems do not stop at geographical borders, with their neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">My first point, therefore, relates to the Mediterranean countries in their entirety. My second is as important as it is insidious, and answers this question: is the problem of the Mediterranean a matter of joint economic development with Europe? It is, but, if we think it is only or mainly that, we shall be making the second fundamental mistake: it is also a matter of joint civil development. How? By imposing a common denominator on the whole of Europe? That would be the third fundamental mistake. Allow me at this point to quote a highly authoritative speaker from the Islamic world, President Khatami of Iran, whom it would be absurd to ignore. According to him, before a people can accept change and evolution, it must first be conscious of its own existence and historical identity, so as to have a point of departure. This is just what the West has sometimes misunderstood when following its colonial and post‐colonial inclinations.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, it is not always easy. We are dealing with very different countries, but isolation will not solve problems which should instead be entrusted to the wisdom of politicians: Libya should teach us a lesson. True fundamentalism must never make us forget that behind it lie problems on which we can legitimately comment: Islam, for example, is not necessarily intolerant in itself; intolerance is caused by social and economic problems when they are allowed to fester.</p>

We must persuade the Palestinians to postpone that declaration. Something has to be done here. And I think we should commit ourselves to recognising that state if it is declared. We should not forget that 4 May marks the end of the transitional phase of the Oslo Agreement, at which time the final outcome of the negotiations will become apparent.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that a postponement is important in order to stop extreme elements from gaining the upper hand in the Israeli elections. The problems in Lebanon are big enough. Europe must preach moderation and a willingness to compromise and must hope that the people and government of Israel can find the way to peace and dialogue. This peace process is also extremely important to the Barcelona process, which is likewise deadlocked at present.</p>
<p class="contents">Aside from the peace process, the Union must invest in democracy and human rights. Good governance is the basis for successful progress. The Union can foster these processes by focusing its attention on civil society. With luck, all the problems over the legal base for providing funds have been resolved. The Union must also support the organising of a parallel meeting of NGOs during the Euro‐Mediterranean summit in Stuttgart. My group, the Liberals, endorses both reports because they take account of the fine detail and give the European Parliament a voice at a time of such significance in the region – for peace, security and a promising future.</p>

But great as this passion is to move the situation in the Middle East or Mediterranean area forward a little, we are still dependent on developments on the spot, such as elections in Israel and Algeria.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the date of 4 May hangs over us like a sword of Damocles. The rapporteur calls on the Palestinian Authority to desist from a declaration of independence. If it happens, I fear it may have implications for the financial assistance we provide. That is already the subject of criticism, and we want better scrutiny of it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear too that we must ask the Israelis, after the elections, to make serious efforts to move the peace process forward. In the run‐up to the elections, positive noises have been heard, for example about a possible withdrawal from Lebanon. The rapporteur speaks of unconditional withdrawal from Lebanon. I cannot go along with that, since Israel can in no way be sure that Lebanon can control the fundamentalist military groups there. Nor are things clear with regard to the deeply entrenched Syrian presence in Lebanon. Withdrawal from Lebanon without any agreements with Syria is an invitation to violence.</p>
<p class="contents">So we must remain hopeful that a coherent solution will be found, so that part of the external threat to Israel is removed and realistic possibilities are created for further and more specific ties with the Palestinians. Restoration of the peace process may help our policy on the Mediterranean, but it is not the only factor. The Commissioner mentioned Egypt earlier. After three years of talks, it is very important that we should now involve Egypt in the peace process. It is a shame that the Council representative is no longer here. I echo Commissioner Marín in urging the Council to bring in Egypt as an important country. That will be a step forward.</p>

They were unanimously adopted by our committee and also have the support of our group.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a comment on the Sakellariou report. Mr Sakellariou quite rightly highlights four basic areas: finding a solution to the Middle East problem; increasing the number of participants at the conference to include Libya and the countries of the former Yugoslavia; content, and the debt issue. However, I should like to ask whether, with the way things are developing at the moment, these are the only issues. Perhaps there is a new, important issue – which indeed is not new, judging by the force with which it has emerged – in the Mediterranean area, which threatens to destabilise the whole of the Eastern Mediterranean. Is it possible to move towards a Mediterranean zone of safety and cooperation without tackling the Kurdish question?</p>
<p class="contents">The Kurdish question affects Mediterranean countries, it affects Turkey and Syria, and it affects countries which, as Mr Graziani said, are extensions of the Mediterranean region, such as Iraq and Iran. The Kurdish question is closely interwoven with, and is destabilising, relations in Mediterranean countries, such as the relations between Greece and Turkey, Turkish‐Cypriot relations, or the wider relations in the Eastern Mediterranean region. We cannot afford to ignore the Kurdish question and it must be integrated into issues relating to Mediterranean cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Do we want policies to combat terrorism and violence, and to tackle issues which the European Parliament has repeatedly and wholeheartedly condemned? Do we want to take action at international level? Do we want to promote political solutions instead of violence? If this is indeed what we want, I think we must concern ourselves with how to integrate the Kurdish question into our deliberations on achieving peace and security in the Mediterranean region, to which the European Parliament hopes to contribute.</p>

Both of them deal with issues – the Middle East peace process and the Euro‐Mediterranean process following the Barcelona Declaration – which are currently deadlocked, as colleagues have pointed out. We could certainly not disagree with what Mr Colajanni said about the outcome of the Wye Plantation agreement and the significant fact that the ‘land for peace' principle has now been accepted. We must however acknowledge that the current deadlock is largely due to the ambiguous attitude of the Israeli Government and the obstacles it is raising, and I believe that this must be emphasised by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lebanon and Syria questions must be solved too, without a doubt, if there is to be peace in the Middle East. Here I would recall Parliament's efforts to set up ‘people to people' initiatives; I believe that a more effective response is required from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the deadlock in the aftermath of the Barcelona Declaration, we too should like to see all the countries concerned participating – not only Libya, but also the countries of the former Yugoslavia and Albania – and we should like Macedonia to have special observer status.</p>
<p class="contents">I would conclude by stressing that the present situation was caused largely by the European Union's current shortcomings in tackling common foreign and security policy problems. Unless this state of affairs is rectified, the prospects are bleak indeed.</p>

<p class="contents">As is his custom, Mr Colajanni has produced an excellent report which is balanced, prudent and which searches for even the slightest sign of progress towards peace in order to defuse the many occasions for confrontation and obstacles which arise on a daily basis in Israeli‐Palestinian relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, my group has serious reservations as regards the general position adopted. It is very diplomatic and seems to take as read the Israeli Government"s volte‐face on the resolutions on the peace process, to which it is nevertheless committed. The rapporteur proposes a further effort by the Palestinians, a degree of procrastination in order to delay any unilateral declaration of independence by the Palestinian Authority. But we do not believe that diplomatic efforts are justified when the spirit of peace has been violated and Mr Netanyahu is seriously in the wrong on this point, most probably to the detriment of the long‐term interests of the Israeli people.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union will gain little by not daring to speak its mind. It would be making a mistake in continuing to believe that the United States must to some extent be left to act alone on this issue, with the idea that this forces it to be more open to Palestinian proposals and to put up greater resistance to its own pro‐Israeli lobbies than if the Union were to clearly state its position and bring pressure to bear.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, as Mr Sakellariou and Commissioner Marín pointed out, the position we must adopt on this subject is largely determined by the position we must adopt in order to relaunch the whole process of Mediterranean cooperation. The position we take will have a determining influence on the consolidation of peace at the gates of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from the clauses on human rights and democracy, every option must be envisaged in a flexible frame of mind in order to genuinely relaunch the Barcelona process. The solution to the economic and demographic difficulties of the countries in question will clarify, facilitate and anchor the gradual appeasement which time alone can bring to the eternal dispute between fraternal enemies which is undermining the Middle East.</p>

We know where the responsibilities lie: with the Israelis for their intransigence, and, for reasons which are all too evident, with the sole superpower, the United States, for the support it is giving to the Israeli policy. For electoral reasons, the powerful support the Israeli policy finds in Washington and elsewhere will never be subject to any serious criticism on the part of American politicians, and particularly those who run the federal administration.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the responsibility also lies with the servile alignment of European policy with that of the United States, even when US policy is contrary to Europe"s most obvious interests and even where we have the political and legal means to oppose it. This is true, for example, with regard to Lebanon, whose political subjugation and continued occupation we continue to tolerate. It is also the case in Iraq where the blockade and the bombings have cynically continued for years to the detriment of the civilian population, when there is clearly no security consideration to justify such a policy.</p>
<p class="contents">When are we finally going to use France and the United Kingdom"s voting rights on the UN Security Council – which could even win the support of China and Russia – in order to put a stop to this scandal?</p>
<p class="contents">As regards our military interventions, if they are essential, why must they be carried out within the framework of NATO, which has no legal or political justification except to chain us to the decisions made in Washington?</p>
<p class="contents">We claim to be able to solve the problem of Albanian immigration in Kosovo yet we are incapable of solving immigration problems in Strasbourg, Hamburg, Brussels or Genoa. Our inconsistencies in this field will benefit neither our interests nor peace in the Mediterranean.</p>

So I must be brief and, after thanking our two rapporteurs, I would like to make five points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, Europe is currently obsessed with its enlargement towards the East and Agenda 2000. It should concern itself more with the south, and, as a result, its Mediterranean policy. This is ultimately a question of survival, for Europe and thus for us.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in this connection it is now time – behind the statements of principle and the agreements signed – to act, and act quickly. There are too many long delays in ratifying agreements between Europe and southern countries followed by further overly long delays before concrete, quantifiable and, above all, visible actions are implemented in the field.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, although we must continue to hold talks with everyone, in the case of Libya, Mr Sakellariou, we must first demand the extradition and trial of the terrorists who blew up aeroplanes and killed hundreds of innocent people. The families of the victims demand this and are appealing to us in their suffering.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, everyone agrees that Europe must be more active politically as regards the Middle East. Indeed it must, but at the present time it must act without interfering in the forthcoming elections; otherwise, we will be acting contrary to our objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Europe must take initiatives to avoid a unilateral declaration of independence by the Palestinians on 4 May, while supporting the principal of a Palestinian state. This is a double requirement which anyone with good sense today recognises as a condition for relaunching the peace process immediately after the elections.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lambrias </span> <span class="bold">(PPE). </span>‐ <span class="italic">(EL) </span> Mr President, the Mediterranean policy of the European Union must be our most effective, high‐minded and unanimous policy. As all wise men have pointed out – it would be sufficient just to mention Braudel – the Mediterranean is the cradle of Europe from a historical, cultural and ethnological perspective. It is also of major significance in current geopolitical terms, because it connects the continent of Europe with the troubled region of the Middle East and also with the awakening giant that is Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">However, our Mediterranean policy is our most neglected, irresolute and ineffectual policy. The events of 1989, with the overthrow of the autocratic regimes of the Eastern bloc, served to highlight the need for an enlarged Europe to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. We have come to realise, rather belatedly, that enlargement must be balanced against the need to meet the challenges thrown up by the South. Not until the end of 1995, with the Barcelona Conference, did we attempt to open up prospects for cooperation, though with pre‐defined commitments and an unlimited time scale.</p>
<p class="contents">As pointed out by Mr Sakellariou, the rapporteur, the fruits of this endeavour remain negligible. In the ensuing three years, the Middle East peace process has not ended the drama in the region, nor has the human rights situation improved. Indeed, in many respects it has deteriorated. Nor has the threat or the use of violence among partners ceased to be a political instrument. Also, as a look at the map is enough to convince anyone, the partner relationship is fragmented and ad hoc. Many countries that border the Mediterranean remain outside the plan which, in order to be effective, must be cohesive and all‐encompassing. Moreover, the lack of an honourable and realistic settlement of the immigrant problem is poisoning relations on all sides. We must make a courageous and flexible effort. This effort needs to be coordinated, as we have bitter experience of aspirations that are disjointed. The European Union must play a leading role in breaking the deadlock in the Middle East and this particular policy must fall in line with enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. If none of this happens, our Mediterranean policy will remain a cosmetic declaration and an excuse which fails to solve any of the burgeoning problems in the very region where Europe and European civilisation were born.</p>

I will only refer to the Colajanni report which attempts, among other things, to redefine the role of the European Union in the Middle East peace process. I find this report balanced but, given the ever‐changing situation, its content is repeatedly being called into question.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, there are certain elements that do not change. The Union"s foreign policy in this particularly troubled region of the globe must no longer be limited to simply being the principal donor of economic and financial aid in the form of the vast sums made available to the Palestinian population. These sums, however, have still not produced the desired effect: the substantial fall in the average earnings of the Palestinians is proof of this. Europe must therefore cease being an economic giant and a political dwarf. It is now more essential than ever to have a true European common security policy. Only then will we be listened to and have a genuine role to play on the international stage.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic and political situation has deteriorated sharply over recent months and the Lebanese thorn is proving increasingly painful. Given its complexity, the situation in the Middle East requires negotiated solutions involving the various parties. We must remember that Lebanon is under Syrian supervision and that the south is occupied by Israeli troops. The peace process must continue and we must avoid at all costs the useless sacrifice of human lives.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention paragraph 29 of the resolution concerning the occupation of southern Lebanon which is now very much in the news. I believe that a unilateral Israeli withdrawal must be possible, provided it is coupled with guarantees for the Hebrew state. In my view, we should therefore eliminate the term ‘unconditional".</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Elmalan </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy on the Middle East tends to place the Israeli Government and the Palestinians on the same footing in terms of responsibility for the current deadlock in the peace process. This does not reflect the reality of the situation. It is the Israeli Government which has gone back on its previous commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not accept the way in which the report tries to organise pressure on the Palestinians to postpone their declaration of independence on 4 May 1999. Should not the role of Parliament, and of the European Union, be to make every effort to ensure that the peace agreements are honoured, that is, all the peace agreements? These explicitly set the date of 4 May 1999 for the declaration of Palestinian sovereignty.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem remains in connection with the Mediterranean policy: the situation in Western Sahara. Here, too, the peace plan is deadlocked. The UN Secretary‐General, who is personally committed to resolving the conflict, set a new deadline of 31 March 1999. I would call on the Council to intervene speedily in order to ensure that the conditions established by the United Nations are respected by that date and that the Sahrawi people can express their right to self‐determination and independence.</p>

It seemed to be the dawn of a new age, a welcome opportunity to establish new relations and revive cooperation between Europe and the Mediterranean countries, particularly in the political, economic, financial and cultural spheres.</p>
<p class="contents">The delay is deplorable for two reasons: firstly Europe's lack of a common foreign policy, and secondly the stalled Middle East peace process. Until such time as security can be guaranteed in Israel, peace will be nothing but wishful thinking. It is vital to step up the EU's relations with Jordan, given the major role played by the late King Hussein in overcoming the stalemate in negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">A Europe which is incapable of giving itself a political identity cannot claim to have the weight required to play a determining role, both in guaranteeing peace and in fostering cooperation and development. And yet the EU has to play an increasingly important part in these processes. Otherwise its role will simply be to beat the human rights drum: a noble role, without a doubt, but utterly useless in terms of influencing proceedings, unless our words are followed by deeds.</p>
<p class="contents">Two factors seem to me to be germane to a policy of economic revival and reform: firstly, debt cancellation for countries undertaking to reinvest the amounts involved in development projects; and, secondly, closer cooperation with SMEs andcraft undertakings. It is not ‘cathedrals in the desert' that will generate growth, but the organisation of a network of small businesses geared to making high‐quality, typical and distinctive products. Expanding the production base in the Mediterranean countries will help to combat illegal and clandestine immigration, which represents a running sore both for the immigrants and for the European host countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, let me finally turn to the German Presidency, which is hosting the Euro‐Mediterranean Committee in Bonn on 19 March and Stuttgart on 14 April, to say that we hope these meetings will finally lead to tangible progress.</p>

It does not listen to us and I would like to thank Commissioner Marín as he has provided us with some of the answers we had hoped to receive from the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I would very briefly like to say that we are dealing here with an extremely old problem, perhaps one of the oldest problems affecting humanity. But we are faced with a very specific timetable beginning with the Stuttgart Conference on 4 April. A month later, there is the possible declaration of independence by the Palestinians, and then there are the Israeli elections. I think that we need to take a very practical line in this dual debate, covering, as it does, two issues that are very closely linked. Although we have tried to take them in isolation at times in order to make progress, it is clear that the cornerstone of the Mediterranean process rests to a large extent on finding a successful solution to the peace process in the Middle East because that is the only multilateral forum that exists in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the European Union should promote something that the Presidency mentioned. Without being too specific, it is basically the fact that, clearly, there is a right that we must recognise. Exercising that right is another matter, and that is an area where we can help. Indeed, we can also set an example. We certainly have the ability to contribute, and I believe that we can actually do so: issues such as water and regional development spring to mind here. But, in my opinion, we also have the authority and the opportunity to establish that there is no fundamental inconsistency between a declaration of independence and allowing those who have their own identity and who might help find common ground in many areas to return to the negotiating table.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what we have done and I think that that is where our strength lies.</p>

<p class="contents">There is one very important point regarding the Colajanni report and that is paragraph 13, which refers to the need for an initiative on the part of the Council to make the new presence of the European Union in the Middle East more visible. I very much regret, and indeed it is a great shame, that the Council is not present at this debate, as we are thereby being deprived of the right to obtain answers on a number of points which, unfortunately, lead to false reasoning regarding the content of this new initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is making a mistake by leaving it entirely up to the United States to formulate proposals for a solution to the Middle East problem. The Council is mistaken if it thinks that the presence of a single representative, who is unaided and lacks the support of any form of infrastructure, can solve the problem. The Council is wrong if it thinks that the presence of the European Union should be confined to trips and contacts and that it should not include recommendations on the specific issues and problems which make up the Middle East question.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on the President‐in‐Office to tell us: firstly, what the position of the European Union is on the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Golan Heights; secondly, what the opinion of the European Union is regarding a solution to the problem of Southern Lebanon and, thirdly, what will happen to the agreement between the European Union and Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, in order for us to arrive at that point, the institutional presence of the Council in the Middle East needs to be re‐examined. This can only be achieved if a decision is finally reached to set up a joint task force comprising the Council, the Commission and, possibly, the European Parliament, which can tackle each of these problems in turn.</p>

<p class="contents">The report talks about the Middle East. But I thought that for us, as Europeans, the area in question was the Near East. It is the Middle East for the United States and that is of some importance as it means that European politics are, in fact, looked on as subordinate to US politics. That is why I think it is worth making the distinction. The Commission communication is a good one. I would even go so far as to say that it is progressive since it presents figures and puts forward arguments relating to the political failings and how the situation of the Palestinians has deteriorated since the beginning of the peace process. The conclusion to be drawn from this is very clear if we compare the European Union"s contribution with that of the United States and the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must play a greater role as a joint leader rather than sitting on the sidelines. And in order to do so, the European Union must become an ethical point of reference for what is happening in the Near East. We must therefore state clearly that if an international agreement provides the legal authority for the Palestinians to declare an independent state on 4 May, then the European Union must support such an international agreement with all the consequences it entails. If we do not, we will constantly be defending the aggressor and exonerating it, while asking the victim to remain calm. Clearly, we must do exactly the reverse.</p>

<p class="contents">The European Union has a duty to stand up to this. The obligation to intervene, invented to support causes that were far less just, must be applied to the Middle East with determination and steadfastness. It is time to ensure that Israel can no longer harm the Palestinian people as it has been doing for more than 50 years.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe cannot allow an imperialist and racist Israel on its borders to remain with impunity. The Palestinians" aspiration of finally receiving the land promised to them a thousand times over is totally legitimate and the intention of the Palestinian Authority to declare on 4 May 1999 the independence of the territories that are still occupied, must be supported by the EU at a political, financial and, if necessary, military level so that a free Palestine can finally flourish.</p>

I shall not dwell on the difficulties in the peace process, because the rapporteurs have already done so, or on the need for a more incisive EU role, because most of my colleagues have already done so. I would rather refer to the limitations of the instruments in the Barcelona process. I think we all now realise that multilateral relations and decentralised cooperation – which were perhaps the most worthwhile of the Barcelona instruments – are faltering, whereas bilateral relations between the EU and the Member States are suffering from all the problems linked to ratification dates which have been recalled by Mr Marín. I for my part would invite the Council to react to five very detailed proposals contained in the Sakellariou report: human rights, encouraging active participation by civil society, enabling new states to participate politically in this process, debt and immigration. Perhaps, if these proposals are taken up by the Council in Stuttgart, this very difficult and complex process will be revitalised. I believe that if the Commission receives much clearer political input, it will be better able to extricate itself from the managerial problems which we all realise are extremely awkward.</p>

I wish to stress that her position is identical to mine. Obviously, if we are in agreement from one side of this House to the other, it means that this approach, and this one alone, is the right one. So I shall use my minute and a half – which, as the speaker before last said, is somewhat ludicrous given the important points needing to be made – to express a few thoughts to Mr Marín, but not without first thanking Mr Sakellariou and Mr Colajanni for their remarkable work, which thoroughly covers every aspect needing to be covered.</p>
<p class="contents">To continue this theme of thoroughness, I would just comment on one of these aspects: civil society. Mr Vallvé mentioned it a moment ago. After Barcelona, ideas and proposals were put forward concerning civil society, and it does not seem to me that they received due consideration. Mr Marín, I agree with you that it is difficult to handle situations of such sensitivity and importance. It is also true, however, that where credible external bodies exist – and there are some in Europe and in the Mediterranean – then your hand should probably be strengthened from a managerial point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">And, finally, just one comment of substance: after Barcelona, Palermo, Malta and Naples, let us not be lured into making Mediterranean tourism policy the dynamo of growth. That would be quite feasible, but let us confine ourselves to tackling more serious problems, namely those highlighted by Mrs Napoletano and myself.</p>

While repeatedly denouncing supposed human rights violations in Israel, Parliament is treating human rights violations on the part of Arab dictatorships and the Palestinian administration with much greater caution.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider direct interference in the election to be unacceptable. Israel is the only democracy in the region and the political strategy of the democratically‐elected government should be respected. After all, the peace process did not reach a state of deadlock because the wrong politicians are in power in Israel but because Arab terrorists refuse to end their campaign. Critics of Israel have not yet learned very much when it comes to supporting Israel in the fight against terrorism, which costs the lives of hundreds of innocent people every year.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to comment on a point made by one of the previous speakers, who described the Gaza Strip as a concentration camp. This comparison with the Nationalist Socialist death camps is absolutely outrageous.</p>

Parliament has already done this itself at the Euro‐Mediterranean Forum.</p>
<p class="contents">Mauritania is one of the five countries that together form the Arab Maghreb. It is important to coordinate the Maghreb as a whole because of its social and economic development, and in Europe"s history there are terrible examples of what has happened when a geopolitical Arab region has been divided.</p>
<p class="contents">Mauritania is also involved in NATO"s Mediterranean dialogue. This suggestion is far from being premature as Mauritania has been participating in the process since it first began. As Commissioner Marín is aware, Mauritania has participated as an observer for ten years. I think that that is too long to continue being an observer and that it is now time to provide Mauritania with the opportunity to take part.</p>
<p class="contents">The Euro‐Mediterranean process is global in nature and includes countries such as Sweden, Finland, Portugal and Ireland. Why, then, should we not include this ancient country from the Arab Maghreb?</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, this would be an excellent time to remind the Council that Parliament supports Mauritania"s full participation in the Euro‐Mediterranean process. This idea was approved and incorporated by Parliament in the Final Declaration of the Euro‐Mediterranean Forum. The Council is not present here as its representative preferred to attend an informal meeting. As a result, I would ask you to forward this speech to the Council because if not, it will not be aware of this matter and the Stuttgart Conference is due to take place at the beginning of April. I would therefore ask you to pass this on personally since the Council should have been represented here.</p>

<p class="contents">However, when it comes to the Middle East peace process, we are repeatedly given the impression that Israel is considered to be largely responsible. I also notice that these reports are tolerant towards shortcomings on the part of the Palestinians, but where similar shortcomings are detected on the other side they are accompanied by warnings or criticisms. Some of the wording is also reminiscent of the resolutions on countries in Africa which waver between military dictatorships and one‐party regimes and regularly have to be warned to observe the principles of democracy. But Israel is more or less the only functioning democracy in the whole region and it is also a country that is particularly under threat.</p>
<p class="contents">When Members of this House always demand that the same concessions should be shown to the parties to the conflict, we wonder why the same tolerance is not shown towards Israel. Why is Israel required to accept a separate Palestinian state instead of also expecting the Palestinians to appreciate that Israel is currently in a special situation and that allowance must be made for its sensitivity, especially after the repeated terrorist attacks? Now, more than ever, patience is required, as it always is when a country is about to hold important elections. This patience will certainly also be required when the deadline of 4 May, agreed in Oslo, expires. We cannot then allow one side to create a fait accompli.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view it would not hurt us to be more pro‐Israel in our advice. It deserves it.</p>

In the Middle East peace process, the United States is jointly responsible for the implementation of the accords, whereas the European Union remains on the sidelines of discussions concerning the political future of that region.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Stuttgart conference will be an opportunity to launch the reform of a policy based on the principle of attentiveness in distinction, which means playing an active role in the Mediterranean Arab world without forgetting the unalterable historical and cultural differences which divide us.</p>
<p class="contents">The best guarantee of stability, especially in international politics, is a healthy, sensible realism. That is why I see the need for a common immigration policy: a restrictive policy applying rigidly the principle of Community preference. I believe in the effectiveness of well‐organised cooperation, but I am suspicious of moves to integrate Mediterranean states into our Union which, I would remind you, is a community of European countries.</p>

I would like to congratulate him on his excellent work and on having prepared such a well‐structured and comprehensive report.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to concentrate mainly on the European Union"s role in the Middle East peace process. I must say once again that I am very concerned at the lack of progress that has been made recently in securing a final peace settlement that is acceptable to both sides. In my opinion, the European Union must be very clear and must ensure that its position prevails. As the leading provider of economic assistance to the region, it can no longer allow itself to remain in the background when it comes to political questions as – and I would stress this point, Commissioner – the European Union is the biggest provider of per capita aid to Palestinians in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the EU"s cooperation with the Middle East at a political level, we must continue to make every effort to help build autonomous and independent institutions for the Palestinian people. Our aim must be to promote and structure a civil society in Palestine, as was mentioned earlier. We must also ensure that the aid we provide is used to train civil servants who will be the backbone of a new civil administration.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as economic assistance is concerned, the Union must be able to transform its aid into tangible and lasting results on the ground with a view to improving the welfare of the Palestinians and generating an economic fabric in the region that affords Palestine a certain degree of independence from other countries. This is particularly important, for example, in terms of ensuring that they have the ability to export their own products. I agree with the rapporteur that it is essential to monitor the way in which the Palestinian authorities make use of the aid donated by means of auditing procedures, and this should mean that all expenditure and all measures taken are totally transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve all this, we need not only the Union"s commitment, but also the participation of Israel in order to allow economic development in the region. In that way, both peoples will be able to coexist and respect each other, which is necessary for peace in the region.</p>
