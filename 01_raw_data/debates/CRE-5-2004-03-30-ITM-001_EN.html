<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to take part in this debate and, looking at the speaking list, I am sure it will have been worth waiting for! It is very important for us to have the opportunity once again to discuss the European Union's relations with Latin America, and I am particularly pleased that we have the views of two very distinguished colleagues who know so much about the subject and who have committed themselves so enthusiastically and knowledgeably to strengthening our relations over the last few years.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreements which we are discussing today mark an extremely important step forward in our relations with Central America and with the Andean Community. I am therefore grateful for the strong support that the European Parliament gave to them.</p>
<p class="contents">As the House knows, the commitment to negotiate new political dialogue and cooperation agreements with each region was made at the Madrid EU-Latin America and Caribbean summit in 2002. The European Union has delivered on this commitment. Negotiations were successfully and rapidly concluded after just two rounds in October 2003, and both agreements were signed on 15 December in Rome.</p>
<p class="contents">These new agreements are ambitious. First of all, they institutionalise and strengthen the political dialogue: the San Jose dialogue with Central America that was initiated in 1984 and the ministerial political dialogue conducted with the Andean Community that goes back to the 1996 Rome Declaration. Secondly, they expand the scope of both the political dialogue and the European Union's existing cooperation with the two regions, for example, by including some new areas such as migration, conflict prevention, good governance and counter-terrorism activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, having negotiated these agreements as rapidly as possible is not enough. We must also make sure that they enter into force quickly and I hope that ratification procedures on both sides will be speedy. This is important, because the new areas addressed by the agreements reflect the very real concerns of both regions.</p>
<p class="contents">At the European Union-Latin America and Caribbean summit in Madrid it was agreed that the conditions were not right to launch negotiations for association agreements. These political dialogue and cooperation agreements were seen as an intermediate step: the aim of the agreements is to create the conditions which would allow the negotiation of association agreements, including free trade agreements, in the future. The Heads of State and Government also defined what the main requirements were for advancing towards an association agreement, notably the achievement of deeper regional integration and the completion of the Doha Round.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to underline the importance of the recently negotiated agreements as an instrument towards our common goal of negotiating association agreements with these regions in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now two years beyond one summit, on the eve of another – the Guadalajara Summit – and we must re-assess our relationship with these regions. There are many questions we should ask ourselves. To what extent are the conditions we set out in Madrid still valid in the light of recent developments? How should the absence of substantial progress in the multilateral trade negotiations affect our relations with these regions? How can we ensure that we do not inadvertently in any way undermine our principal trade objective of promoting multilateral agreements and completing the Doha Development Round? Otherwise, would we not risk the opening of such negotiations becoming a mere political gesture, as we want agreements with content that go beyond what can be agreed at multilateral level? Is there an acceptable political formula to cover all these objectives?</p>
<p class="contents">Regional integration remains of key importance: it can contribute to fostering political stability, economic and social development and social cohesion within each sub-region. The Commission considers that further progress towards deepening integration is a sign of political and economic maturity. How can we measure progress in regional integration? I believe the essential elements for measuring progress revolve around three fundamental elements: a fully operational institutional framework, the existence of a customs union and the reduction of obstacles to intra-regional trade.</p>
<p class="contents">The next joint step should be to evaluate progress achieved by both regions with a view to preparing the ground for the opening of negotiations. I would underline that this process should be carried out in an objective manner and we should not set impossible standards that might only lead to frustration among our counterparts.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has always supported regional integration. We are convinced that it should continue to do so. This support is not only one of words: under our regional programme for Central America, the Commission has approved one project in support of the Central American Customs Union worth EUR 8 million in 2001 and a second one in support of the regional integration institutions and the involvement of civil society in the process of regional integration worth EUR 15 million in 2003. A further project in support of the development and implementation of common policies to the value of EUR 10 million is currently under preparation. In the Andean Community, projects on statistics, customs, competition and trade-related technical assistance, together worth more than EUR 15 million, are being implemented and there are plans to strengthen this form of cooperation in the forthcoming revision of the regional strategy paper, adding another EUR 4 million to the economic regional integration objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Central America, the Andean Community and Latin America as a whole are not suffering from a lack of interest from our side. In the current financial perspectives from 2000 to 2006, funds for Latin America are about 20% higher than in the former financial perspective. The Community budget spends about EUR 0.15 per capita in Asia, while three times that much per capita is spent in Latin America. Perhaps of the greatest significance, we are now actually spending the money we commit. In 2003, 100% of the payments, as well as 100% of commitments, were used.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to emphasise once again that relations with Latin America are a geostrategic priority for the European Union. I have been particularly pleased in recent weeks to be able to discuss our relationship with representatives of Mercosur, with all the foreign ministers of the Andean Community and with representatives of Central America. I very much hope that we will be able to have a successful summit to follow up the one in Madrid, which will focus on regional integration and social inclusion. I also very much hope that the summit in Guadalajara will be able to see a further development in our relations with the two regions with which we have only recently negotiated sensible agreements.</p>

They clearly demonstrate a concern and a sense of priority, and I would like to say to him that the assessment of this Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and the Central American region will essentially depend on one factor, and that is what prospects this period the Commissioner has described as transitional will open up.</p>
<p class="contents">From our point of view, and on the basis of this Parliament’s Resolution of 15 November 2001, this type of political and cooperation agreement must open the way to preparing association agreements which include a free trade treaty, in accordance with the intense aspirations of our Central American partners and, in my view, fully in accordance with the political, economic and commercial interests of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, the key question is whether a period of negotiations is really being opened up for an association agreement with the Central American countries, and also with those of the Andean Community, of a similar nature, <span class="italic">mutatis mutandis,</span> to those reached with Mexico and Chile, and the one which is being negotiated with Mercosur, as a prelude to a more general strategic perspective which should lead to a global interregional agreement and the creation of a Euro-Latin American free trade area.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now being offered an opportunity, at the third Summit to take place in May, to demonstrate a sense of anticipation and foresight, explicitly opening up this prospect.</p>
<p class="contents">Changes are taking place in the region, a region – as we all know – plagued with difficult structural and economic situations, serious ones, but there are undoubtedly encouraging signs; there is a shared will amongst the Presidents of the region to move forward pragmatically in the field of economic integration; there is a new stage for the Central American Bank for Economic Integration, which I believe to be very hopeful; there are plans for the reform of the integration institutions, in particular fairly thorough reforms of the Central American Parliament and, in this regard, the European Union’s presence and voice must contribute to demonstrating clearly that we do not just indulge in diplomacy when there are situations of conflict, but that we apply the same effort and the same sense of priority which was put into decisively assisting the peace processes in the region, that we still have the will and the determination to aim at improving the political, economic and social situation in a region so devastated by historical and current problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I would like the Guadalajara Summit in May to clearly open up a stage in which the implementation of this Agreement is handled with the greatest possible will, which also involves maintaining the commercial facilities enjoyed by the countries of that region, within the system of generalised preferences and the special ‘drugs’ system, and, above all, that there be a specific commitment made to negotiating a genuine association agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">While we are on the subject of the Guadalajara Summit, I would like to mention to Mr Patten in particular an issue which does not strictly relate to Central America, but which could be a success story for the Summit in a specific field: there are several black holes in the current world situation, and one of them is called Haiti. And the commitment to prolonged and intense assistance from the European Union, in agreement with the Latin American partners and perfectly in agreement with Caricom, with the OAS and with the United Nations, could, I believe, be a success story for the Guadalajara Summit, which will be consolidated if good intentions are then followed by determined and sustained actions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In order to dispel any doubt, I would also like to congratulate the Commission on its diligence in presenting the guidelines for concluding these Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreements – and I am sure that Mr Patten will remember the meetings we held, with Mr Lamy as well, prior to the Madrid Summit. I would also like to congratulate the Commission on its diligence, efficiency and speed in negotiating these agreements which, as Mr Obiols i Germà has just pointed out, Parliament sees as forerunners to association agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">With the discussion in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the vote, which was unanimous, on these two agreements – something which does not happen very often – and with today’s debate in plenary and the subsequent vote, one stage is being closed and another opened up, marked, I would say, by the forthcoming Guadalajara Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Patten knows better than anyone, we live in a complex world, in which the European Union has both internal responsibilities, such as the birth of the Constitution or enlargement, and also external responsibilities: the new relationship with Russia, our continuing problems in the Balkans, our responsibilities in Central Asia, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan, the Middle East problem and taking relations with the United States in a new direction. In summary, Mr President, the world is a big place and Latin America is just one part of it, but I believe it is very satisfactory that we are acknowledging, as the Commissioner has done, that Latin America continues to be a priority area for the European Union, amongst other things because we have common values and a shared history.</p>
<p class="contents">On 19 March a meeting was held between a large delegation of Members of this Parliament and representatives of the Latin American Parliament and its President, representatives of the Andean Parliament and its President, representatives of the Central American Parliament and its President and representatives of the Parliamentary Commission of Mercosur and its President as well. That is to say, a meeting of parliamentarians which represented more than a billion citizens of Europe and Latin America.</p>
<p class="contents">That meeting established conclusions on how to mark out the route towards the bi-regional strategic partnership which was established at the two previous summits. We Members of Parliament who attended it – Mr Obiols was there and other Members of this House who are attending this debate – concluded that we did not need a long catalogue of declarations and statements, but that, in order to realise that bi-regional strategic partnership, we simply needed a series of concrete proposals, which we set out in the form of a decalogue.</p>
<p class="contents">That decalogue focuses fundamentally on three areas. On the area of political dialogue and will, because – let us make no mistake – it is political will which has driven these relations forward over recent years, and we are therefore proposing the creation of a Euro-Latin American parliamentary assembly, somewhat similar to the Assembly which has been established in the field of Euro-Mediterranean relations. We are proposing to renew and update the ministerial political dialogue, to agree in international fora and in the United Nations system between European and Latin American positions and also to sign a Euro-Latin American Charter for peace and security with a view to creating a forum in which we can deal seriously with issues relating to security and defence, which currently have no specific forum. Above all, we are proposing a renewal of the bi-regional political agenda in order to be able to discuss issues such as those relating to terrorism, the issue of the reform of the United Nations system, the threats to governability, a review of the fight against poverty and many other initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, Commissioner, political dialogue, however thriving it is, will end and come to nothing unless we translate words into actions. It is clear that one very obvious field in which we must translate words into actions is that of commercial relations. We are therefore proposing that, at the Guadalajara Summit, specific dates be indicated for the association of the Andean and Central American countries, without subjecting them to discriminatory conditions which have not been imposed on other countries or groups of countries, and there are grounds for a debate here – you have referred to integration – on whether integration should be a prior condition or whether it would follow on from association. This Parliament believes that we must make real progress towards integration, but it is perfectly possible for integration to follow on from association agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">We also understand and share the desire for the negotiation of a balanced agreement with Mercosur to be completed before the end of this year and this Parliament also believes that, whilst complying with bilateral and regional agreements that have been negotiated or which are in the process of being negotiated, we should promote a kind of Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) with soul, European-style, in which we provide an institutional dimension and complete geographical coverage for relations between the European Union and Latin America.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe, Commissioner, that we must have a cooperation policy which can in some way be adapted to this new concept, to this new idea of association. In this regard – and you know what Parliament’s thinking is – Parliament has insisted on having a differentiated legal framework and we also believe that we must promote an entire range of policies in the field of education, culture, vocational training and scientific and technological cooperation. As you know, Commissioner, Parliament has proposed the establishment of a bi-regional solidarity fund, an initiative in which we do not want to create additional bureaucratic structures. We believe that this must be interpreted flexibly and incorporated into the Commission’s initiatives, but we also believe that this initiative must take advantage of the financial opportunities offered by both the European Investment Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say finally, Commissioner, that, as you can see, Parliaments’ proposals are extremely ambitious. We hope that this ambition is shared by the Member States and by the Commission in the Communication it is preparing, so that a clear and well-defined message can be sent regarding Europe’s commitment to Latin America. I would also like to say that, in order for this message to be effective and have a multiplying effect – and I make this proposal on behalf of my political group – we must restore and consolidate the strategic alliance and harmonious partnership between the European Parliament and the Commission, which has resulted in so much progress between the European Union and Latin America, as soon as possible.</p>

Perhaps for this very reason it may be interesting to relate a brief history of this relationship over recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">Since being all but absent from the agenda during the seventies, it was enhanced during the following decade, coinciding with the disappearance of the dictatorships and the spread of democracy. Thus the first generation agreements were born and the economic contributions which improved cooperation were increased. In the following decade – the nineties – the third generation agreements were born with the inclusion of conditionality clauses and support and promotion for peace processes.</p>
<p class="contents">These more committed policies gave the European Union great visibility, ending the century with the negotiation of an association agreement with Mexico, which was a milestone in the European Union's policy.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this led to the expectation that we would continue along this path. Nevertheless, during the first half of this decade association has only been extended to Chile. The ambition for a new strategy appears to be paralysed and strangely this coincides with the enlargement of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the United States is extending and continuing bilateral negotiations aimed at consolidating its position in the region – which, furthermore, is nothing new – with the same countries from which the European Union is demanding the signature of a hypothetical association agreement as a prior condition for regional integration. Two very different approaches.</p>
<p class="contents">In a few months’ time, the Heads of State or Government of the subcontinent and the European Union will meet in Mexico. This summit will be a great opportunity as the Commissioner has stated. The idea of this meeting is magnificent, provided that it produces more than a list of good intentions. Perhaps the Commissioner could give us more details so that we are better aware of the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been said, the city of Puebla has recently been the venue for the meeting between European Members of Parliament and the Parliaments of Latin American political integration. The debate gave rise to a series of agreements and objectives which are expressed in the final document and which can be summed up as greater bi-regional cooperation, greater integration, strengthening of parliamentary dialogue and the agenda for association.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreements we are analysing today are undoubtedly more ambitious than those signed in 1993. Let us trust that they enter into force within more reasonable timescales. I would personally like to be optimistic and for these agreements to be a valid instrument for moving forward with association. It is the case that current commercial exchanges are very modest – and this is reflected in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy’s text – even with the facilities provided by the system of generalised preferences and, furthermore, these exports, which are not sufficiently diversified, are constantly subjected to reductions in international market prices.</p>
<p class="contents">An association, however, is rather more than a commercial agreement, the implementation of an economic policy or a development cooperation project: at times like this, the era we are living in, in which nothing is immune to globalisation – including terrorism – association agreements must also be seen as instruments for collective security.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about countries with difficulties, with levels of poverty which are so high that that poverty may come to threaten internal peace, but which, at the same time, have extraordinary potential, which are culturally close to us and which see us as a model of opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, given that the texts of the agreements cannot be modified, this debate should at least serve to ensure that Parliament's opinion is taken into account if it is finally decided to take a more committed step and, as has been done with the southern Mediterranean countries, to make progress on association with the Andean countries, the Central American countries and – we should not forget – the countries of Mercosur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why we regret the lack, in these proposals, of attention to an integrated economic and social development strategy, which, needless to say, is what that region deserves.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, a partnership-oriented agreement on cooperation with the Andes countries can help defuse the explosive political and social situation in the region. I would mention Columbia as a case in point. Over the past fifteen years, more than two million people have been driven out of their homes in that country, and there is an enormous humanitarian need. We need to step up our efforts in order to find a solution, with political means, for the armed conflicts, and to restore peace and social justice. The social situation in the Andes countries deserves more attention. Many of their inhabitants are still living in abject poverty. Two extremes: in Columbia, the so-called richest country, a quarter of the population has to manage on less than USD 2 a day. In Ecuador, the region's poorest country, this percentage is even higher than 50%. In the Central American countries, on average, a third of the population has to live on less than USD 2 a day. In Nicaragua, only four years ago, 10% of the poorest Nicaraguans accounted for less than 1% of total consumption, while 10% of that country's richest inhabitants took up more than half of total consumption. Malnutrition has been a serious problem for years in those countries, and it has got even worse in Guatemala.</p>
<p class="contents">In the political dialogue, the Commission remains focused on the governments and their machinery. That is necessary, but it is, in fact, of huge importance also to involve the region's parliaments and civil society in the dialogue. This will benefit human rights, democracy and transparency more than if we focus only on diplomatic channels. Consequently, the EU should not only broaden the scope of the political dialogue by adding more partners, but should also complement it by integrating social and economic strategy as a priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must thank him for his frankness, because in a way the two concepts are contradictory.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate on the Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreements between the European Union and Central America and the Andean Community are a good example of the current situation of our relations with these countries, which I, in addition to the words you have used, would say is currently unsatisfactory. This is a Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement, but we are not making progress with our commercial relations. In reality, over recent years our relations with these areas of the world have not progressed in the way this Parliament would have liked.</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis facing the Andean countries as a whole and in each one of them individually has not been helpful in terms of improving these relations. Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia are experiencing very difficult times which have hindered their processes of sub-regional integration, and this has not made it easy to make progress on our relations with them.</p>
<p class="contents">The same can be said of Central America, where huge swathes of the population, young people in particular, who are increasingly marginalised and turning to crime as a result of their social marginalisation, are becoming an urgent problem for these small Central American States.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the agreement with Mercosur, which is on the point of being signed, if things go ahead as planned, will be added to those in force with Chile and with Mexico and that these two regions can benefit from more ambitious agreements, the results of which will not be seen by the current Commission and Parliament, but by our successors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">They are two agreements which I could define as heaven: a lot of good combined with no bad whatsoever. We are all in favour of cooperation, of exchanges, of the development of democracy etc., but there is nothing tangible in these agreements. There is no financial obligation, no commercial obligation and no institutional obligation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is happening, furthermore, at a time when Latin America, despite its difficulties, is experiencing a period of stability, that is to say, there is some lack of stability but, despite the poverty – which Mr van den Berg referred to – Latin America today is generally speaking a peaceful and calm subcontinent. There are no international conflicts, there are internal conflicts, but they are on a very small scale compared to those during the eighties, and I have the impression that this is the time for us to effectively help the good people of Latin America to move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to do this, however, we firstly need a specific policy with regard to the region. I do not know whether this policy has to be strictly one of free trade or increasing exchanges with them, but one which at least helps them to form a differentiated entity. Because what characterises Latin America at the moment is that it is a region which is very different from the other regions of the planet. In this regard, the Commission's failure to adopt a specific financial regulation for Latin America seems to me to be an enormous error.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the important thing from now on, rather than offering formulae or recommendations, is to listen to these Latin American countries and to work together to help them to develop and, perhaps, if that continent continues to develop, we may find in Latin America the necessary counterbalance which we are currently lacking in other parts of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite this limitation, they very clearly express Parliament’s position on the need for the agreements to go beyond what is known as ‘political dialogue and cooperation’ and become genuine association agreements. As a matter of fact, these two reports and four opinions received only three votes against, with the opinions of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy preventing unanimity. Whilst we all know of Parliament’s unhappiness with simply creating the political conditions necessary and imposing a model and whilst it is a matter of regret that the Commission proposals do nothing more than pave the way for future negotiations, Parliament uses these reports to suggest that the agreements on which it has been consulted should constitute a stage of transition and of preparation.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that what is at stake is the concept of cooperation and we would, therefore, like to go further, as advocated in the opinions of the Committee on Development and Cooperation. It is indeed regrettable that these agreements are geared towards preparing a political framework that makes matters dependent on free trade agreements and that there is no understanding of these agreements as being part of an integrated strategy for economic and social development to combat poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Through these agreements – to use an expression favoured by Commissioner Lamy at the 7th Joint ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly – it would allow clauses excluded from the WTO Cancun meeting to come in through the back door. The ACP countries are attempting to prevent this in the economic partnership agreements and, amongst other issues, to prevent various forms of liberalisation being imposed in areas for which they are attempting to find solutions that are best suited to their national situations, specific characteristics and processes. In particular, we are talking here about public services, the fields of health, education and water supply – particularly the latter, because this is crucial to many of these countries. It is significant that, amongst the various approaches, as these agreements illustrate, they are looking to achieve the same thing, which is to foist a single-society economic model on a market which is free but not fair. At the moment, the aforementioned cooperation does not cover economic and social development strategies to combat poverty, and everything is dependent on a market- and profit-driven ideology, thus widening the already shocking social disparities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, this is a policy that is not democratic, with violent intimidation leading to the withdrawal of candidates in 100 municipalities at last October's elections. It cannot bring the much-needed security that the Colombian people deserve. Uribe's policies for mass arbitrary arrest have shot prison numbers up by more than 10 000 in the last year. The countryside is flooded with military personnel, and orders have gone out to kill people in groups of four or less in a sickening attempt to reduce the number of recorded massacres without any real diminution in the grisly death toll afflicting the country. Indeed, evidence from the Colombian Commission of Jurists, backed up by the University of Bogota, shows that there has been no reduction in deaths at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we also condemn the murderous and brutal activities of the guerrillas, but two-thirds of the human rights abuses are perpetrated by the Colombian military or their paramilitary allies, which Uribe is now cynically seeking to legalise.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we should use the political dialogue to maintain Europe's opposition to the military solution represented by Plan Colombia, to condemn human rights abuses on all sides in the Colombian tragedy, to insist that Colombia abide by all the commitments made in the London Declaration of 2003 and to act as advocates for grassroots projects, such as the EU-funded peace laboratories, which truly point the way to a just and lasting peace for Colombia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Allow me, though, also – on the subject of the Association Agreements that we are discussing today – to point out a more general desire voiced by the European Parliament to achieve stronger, more voluntarist and more incisive agreements between the different stakeholders of the European Union and the Andean Community or the countries of Central America.</p>
<p class="contents">These agreements stress and emphasise the institutionalisation of political dialogue and the improvement of governance. Can we talk about governance without linking it to the issue of the global development strategy, designed, for example, to combat poverty? Can we talk about improving governance without talking about, and touching upon, the issue of economic and social integration? These are elements that are, I believe, missing from our approach.</p>
<p class="contents">It is imperative that three points are raised. The first is the question of the role of dialogue between the different parliament members and with the national parliaments. Today, the members of parliament from the different countries represented are pointing out their weak position and their marginalisation in the current type of political system. This was mentioned in the report on our meeting in Puebla at the beginning of the month. As was done in our final memorandum, it is up to us to once again give them the role to which they are entitled and to also grant a role to the different actors representative of civil society, whether they be unions, companies or organised civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns the issue of regional integration, which is fundamental. Can we, however, be happy with free trade agreements whilst ignoring the social aspects, especially the issues concerning fundamental rights; in other words, without talking about the actual situation when it comes to the populations’ well-being?</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we are faced with countries where poverty is extreme. That is what we are all saying. We should, however, have the political courage to know exactly what we are talking about when we talk about poverty. The poverty of the populations is extreme, but it is on the issue of unfair distribution of wealth that we must speak out and help our parliamentary colleagues to act …</p>
