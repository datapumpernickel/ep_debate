<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Casaca (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal before us represents a revolution in control systems and provides the technical bases for a revolution in the method of managing the common agricultural policy. The proposed method is based on a modern geographic information system in which the cartographic information on holdings is digitised and integrated with the alphanumeric information needed to describe the holding and the aid received.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of control, this method has enormous advantages and significantly reduces the possibility of fraud or any other irregularities. In terms of managing the CAP, this will finally create a management infrastructure with the technical basis to transform a policy which until now has irrationally subsidised the richest countries, regions and farmers and encouraged surpluses and environmental damage. The new system is geographically oriented, it will encourage sustainable agriculture and it will assist the regions and rural communities which are most in need. This shows that there is the political will and discernment needed from the European institutions to put a new policy into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the integration into the system of virtually all the sectors financed by the CAP should be sought. The recent Court of Auditors report on classical swine fever shows that, even in areas where the geographic information initially seems less important, this is actually decisive and may form a fundamental instrument in rationalising the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that there is therefore every advantage in immediately integrating into the system three sectors which are not included in the Commission proposal. These are oil, flax and hemp and tobacco. For the first, this involves integrating the existing specific geographic information system into the general system. For the second, we know that the Commission has already proposed the integration of this sector into arable crops but we do not know when and if the Commission proposal will be approved. As for the third, its integration is the most necessary and urgent. The fact that tobacco is not at the moment subsidised per hectare but by quantity produced in no way affects the possibility of this being immediately integrated into the system and even less so the advantages which this offers. The application of a geographic control system will ensure that subsidised tobacco is actually produced on the holdings for which the aid is claimed.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it would be absurd for the extensive information which the Commission requires from each holding in order to clear the accounts not to be integrated into the new system. In this respect, the Commission should reduce its requirements to what is necessary and reasonable. It must realise firstly that the CAP is placing an increasing and hidden administrative burden on national and regional authorities. Secondly, farmers should not be required to spend more time filling in forms than milking cows or tilling the earth. We do not want to turn farmers into bureaucrats. Although it is necessary to fight fraud, we must also prevent the complexity of the system causing a multiplication of minor formal irregularities and farmers being unfairly penalised. The simplification of the legislation applying the CAP is an absolute priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, our expectations of the Commission are as follows. It is incomprehensible that a project of this size and scope should not culminate in the processing at European level of all the information gathered. It is unthinkable that a common policy such as the CAP should be handled like a collection of fifteen national policies or, even worse, like a pile of unconnected invoices from 80 or 90 national payment authorities. The Commission must process all the geographic information now required from the fifteen Member States in a coordinated manner. However, it is also vital that this precious resource is used to further the policy of economic and social cohesion, environmental protection and even regional development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This opinion has tried to correct the Commission’s approach, which ignores most of the essential elements, not only for control, but also for administration. This source of information is found in the administrative information resulting from the payments of the EAGGF. Regulation (EC) No 2390/1999 demands that the Member States provide the Commission with the data on the payments of the EAGGF-Guarantee. Nevertheless, it only demands that that information is communicated to them on request and exclusively for the preparation of verifications <span class="italic">in situ</span> in the process of the settlement of accounts.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation creates various control limits. Effective administration must be able to provide the institutions responsible with the elements for analysis and decision and amongst these elements is the cost-efficiency index. This approach must be applied systematically and must be based on the analysis of the payments corresponding to each regulation. The fact that this information can only be requested for the preparation of verifications <span class="italic">in situ</span> in the process of the settlement of accounts<span class="bold"> s</span>ets a time limit on the availability of the fundamental information for administration and control. Once the process of the settlement of accounts<span class="bold"> </span>is over, it is no longer possible to make any analysis of administration or control activities. However, as well as these verifications relating to the settlement of accounts, effective control requires other instruments such as, for example, the cross-checking of the different information available.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to reduce these deficiencies, it has been proposed to use the information available within the framework of the above-mentioned Regulation (EC) No 2390/1999 in the integrated administration system, which Mr Casaca spoke about earlier in this magnificent report. Therefore, in the first stage of the establishment of this integrated administration and control system, it would be sufficient to regulate the conditions for delivering the information mentioned and the need for the Commission to store it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a very technical subject and indeed to comprehend it one needs an understanding of almost all the details of the entire common agricultural policy. Mr Casaca has made a very good effort to explain it to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to thank the Commission for its continuing efforts to tidy up the whole business of accounting in the area of agriculture. It is extremely important. We have recently been talking about regional funds and cohesion funds but the common agricultural policy is extremely important. It is the greatest instrument we have for cohesion since it is the only rural policy which the Community has and it brings immense benefits to peripheral areas and to people who are in businesses that are not otherwise viable.</p>
<p class="contents">The policy was given a bad name in the past when most of the funds were channelled to the agricultural industry through the processors and exporters. We had the possibility for large amounts of fraud and racketeering through the payment of monetary compensatory amounts. With the reorganisation of the policy we have a new situation. It is fair to point out that the most recent report by the Court of Auditors for the year 1998 has not drawn attention to any single major failure of the Commission in this entire area. There have been problems but they were isolated, small offences, relating to areas of aid and also to premiums and the failure of national governments to understand the details of European law. But we have to recognise that for the most part the Commission was given a clean bill of health for 1998 which is the most recent report we have and it is to be congratulated on that. Considering that this is something like 48% of the entire budget – EUR 38 or 39 billion – it is quite an achievement, spent over fifteen countries, that the budget was within two and a half per cent of estimate and that waste and the possibility for loss were lower than the average for the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The changes to the whole system have made it easier to control. The fact that more money is now going directly to farmers makes it easier to understand exactly what is happening.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed changes will readjust our system of accounting to the new policies that have been devised. It is reasonable to expect Member States to produce the sort of detail that is necessary for the European Commission both from the management point of view as well as that of accounting, to have exact details of where and to whom the money is going, down to the last recipient. This is welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the amendments proposed by Mr Casaca, we can support all of them. We have received complaints from some people about the proposal to introduce tobacco. Maybe, as things stand at the moment, because the money goes to processors there is some point in saying that it should not be extended. But we spend EUR 1 000 million on the tobacco regime. There are about 135 000 farmers, about 135 000 hectares. That means approximately EUR 7 600 per hectare, approximately EUR 7 600 per farmer. That is a lot of money. It is only reasonable that we should seek to establish that this money goes to the farmers and applies to the hectares, as Mr Casaca has suggested.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is asking for a divided vote to enable those who do not like the tobacco regime to vote against it but, on the other hand, our amendment is a message to the Commission that we really think this should be clarified so that the money will go exactly where it is supposed to: to rural areas and to farmers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My group will of course support it. The integrated administration and control system is actually the central plank of our present agriculture policy. We need reliable information on final beneficiaries, the number of animals kept and the surface area being cultivated. This is a difficult task which is only possible at all by virtue of technological progress. Mr Casaca’s report covers this to a considerable extent.</p>
<p class="contents">Welcome as this is, we should nevertheless not lose sight of the fact that this will involve changeover problems. We learnt that when the present system was introduced under the 1992 regulation. Today, eight years later, two Member States have not yet implemented the system at all or only in part. We cannot allow delays of this kind to occur again. This subject was addressed at the time of the 1998 final discharge. The Commission informed us that the advance payments for these two countries, Greece and Portugal, had been reduced. That alone is not enough. In such cases there must be tangible sanctions that really bite, linked to the process of clearing the accounts.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with the final discharge, the Commission also presented the 1998 monitoring statistics to us. I do not want to burden you with figures here, but I will perhaps give you a short extract. In 1998 in the 15 Community Member States there were more than 3 million applications for “area” aid. Of these, some 12% were checked, partly on the spot and partly by satellite. Of those applications checked, over 40% were inaccurate. We should not of course immediately assume that deception was intended in every case. In some cases, there were technical oversights, in others misunderstandings about interpreting the rules, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, these amounts add up to millions of course. These figures therefore demonstrate just how urgently a properly functioning control system is required. As the European Parliament rapporteur responsible for anti-fraud measures, I would like to bring a serious problem in this area to your attention. All the Member States report any irregularities to the Commission, but only a few Member States tell the Commission which of these cases are classified as fraudulent.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, according to the statistics, in the United Kingdom there were 4 995 cases of over-declaration, 971 cases of duplicate applications and 52 cases of “false” applications. But not one of these cases was classified in the statistics as being fraudulent or as giving rise to suspicions of “serious negligence”. Finland, Austria, Portugal and Sweden do not report any such cases either. So is there a kind of fraud-free zone in the EU? I very much doubt it.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem we have here also occurs in other budget areas. The administrative controls more or less work, but we do not have a reliable overview of criminal aspects. This problem needs to be solved as a matter of urgency if we really want effective deterrence in order to combat fraud. The ideal way of achieving this is to set up a European public prosecutor’s office for financial matters, which this House has repeatedly called for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The far-reaching management and control measures which the Commission proposes are therefore very appropriate indeed. It is a matter of great urgency that such a large part of the EU’s expenditure should be used correctly and efficiently. </p>
<p class="contents">I do, however, wonder whether the proposed measures are the most effective. In this respect, I would refer to the useful input from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this report. The Committee claims that, when data is collected, the existing databases are ignored, would you believe! This is how useful information for managing Community aid falls by the wayside. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is right in saying that the Commission is acting in an absurd manner. </p>
<p class="contents">Data on payments or revenue in respect of the EAGGF, Guarantee section, can only be used at the request of the Commission for closing accounts. But surely this is no reason to ignore this information. The existence of this wealth of information should have been a reason for the European Commission to adapt Regulation 2390/99. We at the European Parliament can still rectify this mistake made by the Commission by including an amendment to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development’s recommendation, which unlocks this source of information for the management of Community aid. If the regulation has been amended to this effect, we will back it without hesitation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, the reservations expressed by the Executive, particularly the Commission’s position on Article 1 of the proposal, are unfounded.</p>
<p class="contents">The products which the rapporteur intends to add to the list all fall within sectors of considerable financial consequence whose control mechanisms have proved to be insufficient. In fact, these products have all been subject to fraud and irregularity in the past. Moreover, the extension of this system to a greater number of products would facilitate sound, effective management, which would lead to simpler procedures for both the Executive and farmers. It is, in effect, necessary to harmonise the excessive number of different regulations which are currently in force, for the purposes of containing costs as well.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the above considerations, I therefore call upon the Commission and the Council to incorporate the position of the Committee on Budgetary Control and, in particular, Amendment No 1 and Amendment No 2. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I too would like to warmly thank the rapporteur, Mr Casaca, and the Committees on Budgetary Control and on Agriculture and Rural Development for their proposals in the form of amendments and above all for the constructive debate on this proposal. I am particularly grateful for their support for the basic principles underlying the Commission proposal, on which we are in agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I cannot agree to all the amendments tabled by the committees, I would like to make it clear that the Commission supports the committees’ basic view that the integrated administration and control system needs to be further strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendment No 1, the Commission’s main motivation in presenting this proposal was firstly to adjust the integrated control system to the new legislative situation arising from Agenda 2000, secondly, to introduce the geographic information systems designed to improve the identification of agricultural areas and, thirdly, to stipulate compatibility between IACS and administration and control systems for other Community aid systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Also on amendments, I would like to make the following point: in the case of Amendment No 1, I agree with the criticism raised earlier in the debate that not all Member States have yet made sufficient progress in establishing IACS. However, it was not because of the transposal situation that the Commission presented its proposal for an amended regulation, but rather to introduce the new geographic information systems available.</p>
<p class="contents">As has also been explained, we have already taken advantage of the charging procedure, by setting a charge for those Member States lagging behind in that context also. Amendment No 2 suggests that various other aid systems should be brought under IACS, with those for olive oil, tobacco, flax and hemp being mentioned in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one particular point that must be borne in mind here: these schemes are not exclusively “area” aid schemes, so they cannot be wholly brought under IACS. However, IACS will, of course, be applied as far as possible in these cases. In particular, if flax and hemp are now to be integrated into the arable support system, IACS will then be fully applied. But IACS or the geographic information system will also be used for determining areas and for drawing up the olive sector register. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendment No 3, the Commission is opposed to automatic exemption from the requirement to submit an area aid application for applying aid under a scheme not directly linked to agricultural area<span class="bold"><span class="italic">. </span></span>The Commission has in any case already granted an exemption of this kind for special cases, and it should retain the option of first being able to check whether such an exemption is sensible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is in full agreement with Amendment No 4 to the extent that it refers to Article 10, which is to be deleted. However, it is not possible totally to delete the provision affected in the way proposed. The Commission must also retain the right to carry out checks in relation to IACS.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now turn to the other points raised in the debate. It has been proposed that payments should be centralised and that all data should be centralised. We believe that the effect of this would be exactly the opposite of what we wish to achieve. What we are looking for here is subsidiarity. We cannot carry out all the checks from Brussels. We know that there are millions of applications, and that means that it is only possible to check and control applications for compliance with the rules through decentralisation. If we need information, we can in any case always access case-by-case details via national IACS operations and through national payment agencies. There is no problem there. But for the same reason, it would not only be organisationally counterproductive in terms of modern management but also highly costly to automatically send all data to Brussels and store it centrally there.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bösch pointed out that of all applications checked with regard to area, 40% were inaccurate. However, we need to clarify what we mean by inaccurate applications, and above all just what the defects are.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, if you look at the European Court of Auditors’ Statement of Assurance and in particular at the representative spot checks carried out by the Court of Auditors for 1998, the following facts emerged with regard to the support system for producers of arable crops: out of the entire random sample taken, a total of 16 substantial errors were found in relation to area. The deviations in these 16 incorrect applications were in ten cases between 0% and 3%, in four cases between 3% and 5% and for only two applications in the entire random sample for the whole Community was the deviation over 5%.</p>
<p class="contents">The other point that Mr Bösch raised, and which I also consider to be important, is the question of possible criminal aspects. The issue here is to what extent actual incidences of fraud are not subject of adequate prosecutions.</p>
<p class="contents">You all know that under present legislation and also in accordance with the current contractual arrangements, all matters relating to criminal law are the responsibility of the Member States. If cases of fraud or suspected fraud should actually arise in this area, then the national public prosecutor’s office should automatically be involved. The extent to which it would make sense to set up some kind of European public prosecutor’s office for financial matters or to introduce some kind of European financial prosecution procedure is an issue which ultimately has to be discussed in the framework of the Intergovernmental Conference, because it would imply a treaty amendment.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
