<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Elmar Brok (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, right up to the present day, the enlargement of the European Union has been the most successful aspect of its foreign policy, for it was a means of extending the area of stability and peace in Europe, and also of further advancing the cause of peace, freedom, human rights and the rule of law. This is an important point, and one of which we must not lose sight either now or in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">It also has to be clear to us, though, that stability is an achievable goal only if the European Union is strong enough to develop the ability to master these tasks; that, for example, was why the Constitutional Treaty was a retrospective attempt at really making the addition of ten new Member States workable in institutional terms and in terms of the objectives involved, and the reason why we are in such difficulties now is that the ratification process is going nowhere.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to realise that the European Union's capacity for accepting new members is one of the essential aspects of the Copenhagen criteria, although there are good reasons why that has been purely declaratory in nature. When we reach the sort of interface that we will reach after Bulgaria and Romania we will, however, have to bring this into play and redefine it. It is for that reason that we ask the Commission, by the end of the year, to define what is meant by the European Union’s absorption capacity with reference to this and this will enable us to make use of it. What makes that so extraordinarily important is that this is not just a constitutional issue but also touches on issues of the European Union’s financial capacities and much more besides.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that we have to make it clear to just what extent the European Union is capable of accepting new members, and that this can affect the ‘yes or no?’ decision at the end of the day. The prospect of EU membership is to be held out not only to countries that have already commenced accession negotiations, that have candidate status or to whom one has been promised post-Thessaloniki – which promise, let me point out for the avoidance of former doubts and in order to re-clarify matters, cannot be withdrawn – but also as an incentive to highly-important internal reforms and to such states as Ukraine, European states that are currently subject to dictatorships and need to have such a perspective if they are to be kept looking westwards.</p>
<p class="contents">For that, the Neighbourhood Policy alone is not enough. In some instances, the countries themselves or the European Union itself are currently finding it too much to combine this with the prospect of full membership, for it can in many cases be realised only in fifteen years’ time. If this project is to be credible, something between the two is needed, something with which these countries can have the prospect of full membership held out to them, without us being put under unrealistic pressure to give it to them at once.</p>
<p class="contents">This should be open to every state that is not currently a Member State of the European Union. I would like again to emphasise that this can be the final stretch in countries such as Norway – which is also a party to the Schengen convention – so decide on the basis of their participation in the European Economic Area. If I may be permitted to talk in terms of a ‘European Economic Area plus’, then there is much that can be done with such a multilateral project in the fields of the internal market, internal and external security, environmental policy and much else besides.</p>
<p class="contents">It can also be an intermediate stage, though. If states that, today, have the prospect of accession held out to them post-Thessaloniki – such as for example the countries of the Western Balkans, whose development is expected to take different periods of time – should decide to use it as an interim stage to full membership, then what was promised at Thessaloniki would not be made void. It is on this basis that we can achieve a new degree of flexibility by making this prospect credible, for things can happen at once without the intervening fifteen years of negotiations, and then we will have to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’.</p>
<p class="contents">So, yes, I do see that enlargement, in some countries, entails plebiscites, and so we have no idea whether ratification will eventually happen. What that means is that this is not just an attempt at an ‘everything or nothing’ strategy, but also at creating ways in which these countries might be given credible perspectives, while at the same time saving and driving forward the political project that is the European Union.</p>

This topic is the subject of constant discussion in the Council, not least with reference to the practical decisions that we have to take. As has been reported, we had in Gymnich a very good and thorough debate on this subject, and we will continue with it. I believe it to be quite essential that we should do so, since refusal to debate is a cause of public suspicion, and we must take care to reinforce the confidence of the European public in the European project as a whole and to create more trust and more clarity. That is one of my core concerns in my position as President-in-Office, and it is for that reason that I welcome the debate that is now underway.</p>
<p class="contents">It is because we need public support for the enlargement process that we have to improve the flow of information and our public relations work, while also explaining the individual steps better. We quite simply have to make it clear that we will be thorough and circumspect, and that, while we will not act precipitately, we will not arbitrarily step on the brakes either. This is something I regard as an essential consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Heaven forbid that we should, by introducing this concept of ‘assimilation capacity’, impose an additional and arbitrary obstacle; on the contrary, it is about being aware, becoming aware, and making others aware of certain quite central and self-evident fundamental truths. Every step in enlargement, every new accession requires two participants, one of them being the European Union, and the other the country that is to become a Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to prepare for the next accessions as best we possibly can. In this sense, too, Salzburg was important to me, for it was important that we should look back over the last three years and forward to the next practical steps, in that it enabled all of us to be clearer about where we stand and what actual preparedness there is, whether at home or abroad. We can also have confidence in the expert knowledge that we gained during the last enlargement and should be determined to apply the knowledge of transformation that we have on a partnership basis.</p>
<p class="contents">As was said in the earlier debate, ownership, too, underlines European standards, which, though fair, must be stringently complied with, as was made unmistakeably clear in the Commission’s report in November 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">In this debate, though, we should also be honest about the expectations people have of the European Union, not least the expectations of the people who live in it. We owe each other clarity, and it is we alone who can give it to each other. We must not make out cheques with nothing to back them up.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I urge a more nuanced approach to each individual country, for we need to be fair in our dealings with each and every one of them, and we must make that a certainty. The presidency will therefore be giving particular attention, in the ongoing debate, to the contributions made by your House.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me sketch out, in just a few words, the actual decisions that we are currently working on. The first has to do with Romania and Bulgaria, concerning which the reports are encouraging and we already have the goal of accession on 1 January 2007, albeit with the possibility of its being delayed by a year. Turkey and Croatia’s accession negotiations have begun; the starting pistol was officially fired on 3 October last year. We are now engaged in screening the <span class="italic">acquis</span>, that is to say in analysing the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire.</span> We, the presidency, have written to Croatia and Turkey to invite them to set out their negotiating position on the first chapter, ‘Research and Development’.</p>
<p class="contents">We share your House’s view that continued progress in the fulfilment of all the political and economic criteria and in the effective realisation of fundamental rights, the rule of law and democracy is required. As regards Turkey, we in the presidency welcomed the closure of the Orhan Pamuk case and made it clear, at the recent meeting of the troika in Vienna, that we expect the trials still pending under Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code to be dealt with similarly, or, indeed, the law to be changed.</p>
<p class="contents">We, too, are closely monitoring the implementation of the Ankara protocol and will ensure that it is reviewed this year in the relevant bodies and in accordance with the Council statement of 21 September 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">We regard the commencement of the accession partnership with Croatia as equally important, and have welcomed the Croatian prime minister’s undertaking to ensure unconditional cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the continuation of the same. We share your House’s view that Croatia is contributing more to regional cooperation and that further efforts are required.</p>
<p class="contents">I have said what needs to be said about the Western Balkans. The Council’s strategy for obtaining Serbia and Montenegro’s full cooperation with the International War Crimes Tribunal is also clear, and we sent out a very clear signal relating to it at our last meeting. We support the UN special envoy in Kosovo, Martti Ahtisaari, in his work, and I believe that the European Union, through the efforts of its special delegate Javier Solana, is capable of helping, in an enormously positive and diplomatic way, to reach an agreement on the conditions for the 21 May referendum.</p>

As he rightly said, enlargement is indeed one of the EU’s most powerful policy tools to pursue peace and prosperity, liberty and democracy. The eastern enlargement of 2004 sealed the peaceful reunification between Western and Eastern Europe. Now our energy is focused on a peaceful unification in south-east Europe. Our gradual and carefully managed accession process is based on three key principles.</p>
<p class="contents">First, we have consolidated our enlargement agenda. It means that we must be cautious before taking any new commitments, but likewise we must stick to our prevailing commitments towards candidate or potential candidate countries already in the process. Our consolidated enlargement agenda focuses on south-east Europe: Bulgaria and Romania, and Turkey and Croatia and the other countries of the western Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we apply rigorous conditionality. Combined with a credible accession perspective, conditionality works. It has helped to transform Central and Eastern Europe into modern democracies. More recently, it has inspired bold and significant reforms in Turkey and increasingly in the western Balkans. This is also proven by some recent important events, as General Ante Gotovina is behind bars in The Hague, while the novelist Orhan Pamuk is free to express his opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement policy and neighbourhood policy complement each other. Furthermore, the Commission is ready to deepen further and upgrade cooperation with our neighbourhood partners once the main priorities in the current action plans have been properly addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we should avoid the pitfalls of an overly theoretical debate on the final borders of Europe. As we now have a consolidated enlargement agenda, a theoretical discussion, for example about whether Ukraine should even join the European Union, would benefit neither us nor the Ukrainians, now that Ukraine’s future path and democratic development is at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, the pace of enlargement must take into consideration the EU’s absorption capacity. The Commission has always had this view. Enlargement is about sharing a project based on common principles, policies and institutions. The Union must ensure that it can maintain its capacity to act and decide according to a fair balance within its institutions, respecting budgetary limits and implementing common policies that function well and achieve their goals.</p>
<p class="contents">For over three decades, the EU has successfully absorbed a very diverse set of countries, as we can see from the composition of this House, for instance, including the President in the Chair in charge of this debate and the Commissioner involved. By developing its policies and institutions, the Union has responded positively to new circumstances, such as the fall of dictatorships, the collapse of communism and the rise of economic globalisation. Enlargement has proven to be a successful shock absorber for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we need better communication. The report rightly calls for a communication strategy and, indeed, broad public support is essential for everything the Union does, including enlargement. I rely on the political and financial support of Parliament to pursue a well-informed debate on enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, consolidation was necessary to avoid overstretching on our enlargement commitments. But let us also keep in mind our own strategic interest: it would be utterly irresponsible to disrupt a valuable process that is helping to build stable and effective partners in the most unstable parts of Europe. If we were to go wobbly about the western Balkans’ European perspective, our beneficial influence, our political leverage, our impact would be seriously eroded, just when the region enters a difficult period of talks on Kosovo’s status.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU perspective is the key to a sustainable settlement for Kosovo and to democratic development in Serbia and the rest of the region. It is the foundation that keeps the region on a peaceful and reformist track. Therefore, for the sake of Europe, let us not shake this foundation, ensuring that the still fragile Balkans building does not collapse at our feet, in our own front yard!</p>

Congratulations also to the Commissioner for the Commission's global and integral communication which you have presented to us.</p>
<p class="contents">I should very quickly like to make the following comments:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the central view in the Brok report on the importance of the European prospects of a number of countries, most of which are in the Balkans, is correct. At the same time, paragraphs 5, 9 and 10 of the report, if read together, give the reference point on the basis of which the European Union now sees future enlargements.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Turkey is concerned, I want to say that I support the European prospects of Turkey, but I think, as you quite rightly said, that we need to focus, initially, on the question of the Ankara Protocol. The Protocol alone – I repeat the Protocol alone – must be ratified, not the unilateral declaration, and, of course, the question of updating the legal framework within which this country operates.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Kosovo is concerned, I agree that attention should be paid during negotiations to its final status, but we also need to prepare ourselves for how the decision taken on the final status of Kosovo is to be applied.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the FYROM is concerned, it now has the status of a candidate country, that is correct but, precisely because it has the status of a candidate country, it also has rights and obligations, one of which is to demonstrate a constructive attitude in dialogue with Greece, so that the final issue pending, that of the name, can be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as far as Serbia is concerned, I agree with the need and with the fact that Serbia's cooperation with the Tribunal in the Hague is its obligation, but this is one part of a set of criteria which Serbia needs to meet and I want to ask that we be careful not to 'Croatise' the case of Serbia. On this issue, Minister, you also have a personal view. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jan Marinus Wiersma, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PSE Group</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the Commission, in its document, is not mincing its words: while there will be no fresh enlargement round involving a large group of countries at the same time, it is arguing – and rightly so, I believe – that the European Union is, and indeed will be, an organisation that remains open to new members, but under certain conditions. Whilst the addition of ten new countries in 2004 was a success, not all citizens see it that way. An extra effort to recount this success story is therefore called for.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the group, I can say that we support the thrust of the Brok report, and I would thank him for the interesting preparation round we have been involved in over the past few months. The Social Democrats are emphatically in favour of the extra attention that is being devoted to the criterion of absorption capacity. The <span class="italic">impasse</span> surrounding the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty plays an important role in this. Without internal reforms, it will be difficult to steer the accession of new Member States effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">As expressed in previous resolutions, we take the view that the Treaty of Nice is not a basis for new decisions on accession. There is, however, more need for more clarity surrounding the concept of absorption capacity, as laid down in the Copenhagen criteria, and the report is right to devote attention to this aspect too.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to outline where the Social Democrats stand in respect of the possible accession of various countries. As far as our easterly neighbours Ukraine and Moldova are concerned, we think that now is not the right time to discuss their accession. Instead, we should invest in practical cooperation. We have concluded action plans with those countries, and we should try to bring them to a successful end.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Balkans, we back the Council’s position. In principle, the western Balkan countries hold out the prospect of membership, although they will join at different times. As for Turkey, as far as we are concerned, we will continue on the chosen path. We are on the eve of starting a process that will last many years, and it is extremely important that we hold firm to the pledge, but also to the conditions, that we prescribed in this connection.</p>
<p class="contents">While I am on the subject of the Balkans, I should like to add that, whilst it goes without saying that the Copenhagen criteria remain of vital importance to us, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament continues to set great store by cooperation with the Yugoslavia tribunal as a criterion. I also think – and there has been much talk about it – that regional cooperation can make a significant contribution to the <span class="italic">rapprochement</span> of those countries to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally – and this may well be the most important point of the whole discussion – the report mentions the possibility of setting up a fresh multilateral framework for European countries that have not yet joined the European Union. For some countries, that could be an alternative to membership, while for others, this could be an intermediate step towards it. For Ukraine and Moldova, for example, a structure of that kind could be a sound follow-up step, but for the countries that are already recognised as potential members, I would stress that this is an option, and not an obligation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also how it is set out quite clearly in the Brok report. It is something for which those countries can opt, should they decide that it would be useful to them to do so. It is not an alternative to the prospect of membership. That applies to Turkey as well as to the Balkan countries. I want to stress that this is how we interpret paragraph 10 of the draft resolution. It is in that way, and no other, that we in the Committee on Foreign Affairs have reached agreement with the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The unification of East and West in May 2004 marked the end of the division of Europe and showed what power there is in the dream of a unified Europe based on democracy, free trade and respect for the rule of law. EU membership was the spur that helped the powerful forces for reform in the former Communist dictatorships. The prospects of EU membership are also hugely important to the negotiations and reforms in Turkey and the Balkan states. In these regions, the EU has incredible reserves of what is known as soft power and which contributes to a more stable and more democratic Europe. We in my group believe that it is important, as the Treaty says, for us to keep the door to continued enlargement open. Naturally, the criteria must be applied, and the EU’s capacity to receive new countries is an important consideration. We need, however, to change internally and to engage in the debate about enlargement without putting the blame on it.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware of the fact that there is an ongoing debate in many countries and concern about the rapid pace of EU enlargement and about the way in which things might develop. That conversation must be conducted respectfully and straightforwardly, but we must also dare to stand up for the advantages of enlargement and to call attention to these. In that context, the debate about economic protectionism is extremely worrying. We have a responsibility for neighbouring countries. Our promises to the Balkan states and to Turkey must be kept. It is they that set the pace, and we do what we can to speed things up. We must also keep the door open for other countries such as Ukraine and perhaps also, one day, Belarus, even though the situation there now is incredibly troubled. The hope of EU membership is what keeps the opposition and the forces of democracy alive there.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we are opposed to defining Europe’s geographical borders. This Parliament has given impetus to enlargement, and, a year ago, we stood in the Chamber in Brussels, wearing our orange scarves, and applauded President Yushchenko. We adopted a resolution in which we talked of Ukraine’s prospects of membership. That is an objective, and perhaps a distant one. Just as Mr Brok said, the Ukrainian people are poised between democracy and dictatorship. If we establish borders for Europe, they will interpret this in terms of our slamming the door in their face. It would be an historic mistake.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of introducing new concepts such as multilateral agreements, let us – as Commissioner Rehn also said – take the opportunity to customise the neighbourhood strategy for prospective Member States and to give practical shape to it. To now put forward new concepts which we have not properly debated and of whose implications we are unaware does not seem very productive at the moment.</p>

We think that the concept of absorption capacity should be better defined. It is a trendy, all-purpose concept on which everyone can hang whatever they like, and that means that the question of geographical borders will need to be answered, for we can no longer dodge that question.</p>
<p class="contents">We share the view that it is necessary that the EU will think about an intermediate step between full membership and neighbourhood, for the sake of those countries that have no membership perspective as yet. I am not, therefore, talking about Turkey or the western Balkans, but rather about Ukraine, Moldova or Belarus. I have to say that my group and I were deeply disappointed, and extremely vexed frankly, to see that in the run-up to this debate, the media twisted the words in the report, the result running counter to a number of central points.</p>
<p class="contents">If we read the media ahead of this debate, the ultimate conclusion is that an intermediate step should be created for countries including Turkey and the western Balkans. It is no coincidence – for let us be quite honest about this – that this happens to be the view held by the rapporteur, and one that he never had any intention of concealing. Mr Brok has always been opposed to opening negotiations with Turkey and has, since the rejection of the constitution, increasingly grown sceptical about the membership perspective of the western Balkans. The rapporteur is fully entitled to his view, but that is not the view of the majority of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. What is more, it is not what his own report states either.</p>
<p class="contents">It would become the rapporteur to spell out, outside of this Chamber, what is in his report, and does not mistake its contents for notions of his own. What Parliament states in this report is that we do not want to tamper with the membership perspective of Turkey and the western Balkans and that intermediate steps would only be an option for those countries if they themselves were to decide in favour of it. Everyone knows just as well as I do that all those western Balkan countries and Turkey do not want to go down that route; they want full membership. Let us stop creating ambiguity in this Chamber, but, above all, also outside of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was seen as a reunification of Europe and as the victory of the West in the Cold War. After the major enlargement of 2004, that climate changed dramatically. Public opinion in the old Member States does not experience this enlargement as a success, particularly as a result of the increasing exploitation of the disparity between high-wage and low-wage countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The politicians too, are distancing themselves from it. This change is palpable in the report on the enlargement strategy that is the topic of today’s debate. Attention is being drawn to the EU’s absorption capacity, to the external borders, the costs that are involved in enlargement and to administrative problems that are attributed to the absence of a European constitution. As a result, Romania and Bulgaria are likely to be the last countries that are allowed to join in the short term. Other European states are being referred to the neighbourhood policy. Even for the three countries that have already been selected as candidate countries, no date of accession has been given.</p>
<p class="contents">Everywhere across the western Balkans, in recognised states, as well as in federal states or protectorates striving towards independence, where groups of people who speak different languages and practise different religions, and who, in the 1990s, were at daggers drawn with each other, public opinion now expects miracles of a swift accession process to the European Union. The EU uses those expectations to demand reforms, and in that way, makes deep incursions into the administrative choices that are being made over there.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU does not, for the time being, want enlargement, but it does want influence outside of its borders. That is why Bosnia and Herzegovina now have a tax system that nobody asked for, and the regional autonomy that was guaranteed in the Dayton agreement is being pushed back. According to the propaganda posters, it is thanks to the EU’s military presence that this country is on its way to joining the European Union. Public opinion in Montenegro and Kosovo, areas where four years ago, along with 12 Member States, the euro was introduced as legal tender, take it as read that they will soon be admitted to the EU as independent states, while the Hungarian-speaking people of Vojvodina expect protection against Slav dominance.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, the EU’s actions have left all these people disappointed. Do we not have anything to offer those countries in the western Balkans other than the invitation to form a common market in the territory of the former Yugoslavia and to adapt their government and their economy to our wishes without them being able to join before 2020? My group can muster little enthusiasm for this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">We also recognise, however, that thanks to this text, it is possible to stress that the forthcoming referendum in Montenegro must be taken seriously and that the conflict about the use of the name Macedonia should be resolved quickly in sound consultation between Greece and its northern neighbour. What is also positive is that in Kosovo, a solution must be found in the short term which accommodates the needs of both the large Albanian majority and the Serbian and Roma minorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sad to say, there is one candidate country pervaded by chauvinism: that country is Turkey, which is the subject of enough controversy already.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this current backdrop, I have two questions I would like to put to Commissioner Rehn. Is there any truth in the information, which I received from an expert last night, that the position of the Christian churches in Turkey has visibly deteriorated lately?</p>
<p class="contents">In light of this information, the assassination of the Italian priest, Andrea Santoro, on 5 February, in the port of Trabzon is not an isolated case. An identical murder was attempted very recently in the town of Mersin and direct threats are against churches via the telephone or even in newspaper columns. Incidentally, according to the Anglican vicar Ian Sherwood, who is active in Istanbul, the Turkish elite regards the spread of Christian literature in Turkish as intellectually unacceptable, if not potentially criminal. How, Commissioner, can that be reconciled with freedom of religion in Turkey? As far as I can gather, no progress whatsoever is being made with regard to this important item of the political criteria of Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="contents">I happened to hear last night that Trabzon is situated in what is called the valley of wolves. ‘Valley of the Wolves’ is also the title of an original Turkish film production which literally oozes chauvinism and is known to be radically anti-Christian, anti-Semitic, anti-American and anti-Kurdish. It is already a huge box-office hit in Turkey and has won euphoric acclaim from Prime Minister Erdogan’s immediate <span class="italic">entourage </span>and the president of the Turkish Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he has taken Prime Minister Erdogan and Minister Gul to task over this Turkish chauvinism, which is completely incompatible with European values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We definitely need to strengthen the Neighbourhood Policy and we need a new, more serious relationship between the Union and the countries with which it shares its borders. Until now, the Neighbourhood Policy has not been sufficient as an instrument. This has been proved by the fact that during its implementation, the countries influenced by its scope experienced periods of crisis and destabilisation on a large scale.</p>
<p class="contents">New forms of cooperation as proposed in the report cannot, however, close the door to membership. We have to be aware today that either we offer countries on our eastern borders the prospect of membership or our appeals for democracy, market economy and respect for human rights will remain empty words. Unless they are offered at least the prospect of membership in the distant future, these countries will return to the sphere of Russian influence and all that this entails with regard to democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in the very same report we see the development and strengthening of views on enlargement in terms of absorption capacity. This term was never clearly defined and today is nothing more than a clever-sounding excuse, a cheap explanation for backing out of the enlargement process. If absorption capacity is to be based on acceptance of the Constitutional Treaty, then one could have the impression that the authors of this text definitely want to close the door to everyone. The Treaty, in the version we know today, can never resurface.</p>
<p class="contents">Demanding that the European Commission defines the borders of the Union is a mistake. It will only bring embarrassing political discussions on the subject of geography and will definitely weaken the influence the Union has on the processes of democratisation, stabilisation and the strengthening of pro-western policy in neighbouring countries. This Parliament has often been at the forefront of the integration process. It has set far-reaching goals. Today, this same Parliament is proving to be the most conservative and passive of bodies. This begs the question: why? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report lists such a catalogue of fundamental problems that it is puzzling why people fail to draw the only logical conclusion, which is that it was a fatal mistake to start negotiations about Turkey’s accession to the European Union in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Belder explained in detail a moment ago, there are violations of the rights of national and religious minorities. Torture is still rife, and based on Article 301 of the criminal law among others, the free expression of opinion and freedom of the press cannot be guaranteed. Also, Turkey blatantly fails to meet its obligations in connection with the customs union. Cypriot ships and aircraft are still not admitted to Turkey’s territory.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past weeks, we have also noticed tension escalating between the Turkish authorities and certain Kurdish groups. No one other than the second-in-command of Turkey’s army is being accused of having stage-managed a bomb attack with a view to blaming the Kurds. Some of the military see this indictment as a ploy directed by the government, which would like to destabilise the general in question on account of his attitude towards Muslim fundamentalism.</p>
<p class="contents">In some quarters, the possibility of a fresh military coup is even mooted, should the situation escalate any further.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be admitted that there seems little to look forward to, and that in a country that aspires to join the European Union in a few years’ time. We should, in fact, come clean and say that it is totally absurd. The report is right to remind us that the Copenhagen criteria include our own absorption capacity. On that basis alone, we should reverse the decision to open negotiations with Turkey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Each of them has its own particular problems and needs to be judged on the basis of its own achievements, and so it would be highly desirable for consideration to be given to Croatia’s accession at an early date. To do so would send an important message of stabilisation to the entire region, since Croatia's achievements in both the political and economic spheres are in no respect inferior to those of the next two accession countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, though, that we are coming to the close of the debate, I want to address an idea – one that is concealed in the Brok report, but more prominent in the public media. I refer to the allusions to changes in the enlargement strategy. The question is asked as to where the borders of the EU are, but nobody is answering it. Commissioner Rehn himself said earlier on that this is a question that has to be answered, and it is precisely this that has the public worried. My personal view is that the accessions of Bulgaria, Romania and the countries of the Western Balkans will mean that the EU will have reached its limits. For all the other countries, we have devised the new instrument of the Neighbourhood Policy and must get to grips with it. The rushed negotiations with Turkey have done what remained to be done to make our citizens insecure and disoriented.</p>
<p class="contents">For ten years we have been saying that there must be no enlargement without institutional reform of the EU, but the Council did not begin to do justice to that until after the last enlargement, and for that we were all punished by the results of the referendums in France and the Netherlands. But it would be fatal if we were, on that basis, to draw the conclusion that no further accessions must be allowed. We must waste no time in laying hold of the necessary instruments, for which, of course, the Constitutional Treaty makes provision, and use them to restore our capacity to welcome new members. If we do not want to jeopardise what has been up to now our great commitment to the Balkans, we must remain consistent and purposeful in continuing to bring these countries closer to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much welcome what both Commissioner Rehn and Mrs Plassnik have had to say on this subject. All these states were rightly promised accession to the EU subject to their fulfilling the criteria. That was and remains an important motor for change in the aftermath of the terrible conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and of Ever Hoxha’s dictatorship in Albania. It is apparent to any rational person who even casts a glance at a map that this region is in the middle of the EU. If it enjoys stability, then so do we. The 1990s saw us all experiencing and suffering the opposite of that, but I do fear – and I can tell the President-in-Office of the Council that the vagueness and imprecision of what was said in Salzburg gives me reason to – that certain Europeans are intent on leaving the South-East European states in the lurch a second time, and that is what we cannot allow to happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our debates can no longer be about our preference for one country rather than another; instead, we must, at last, face up to the question as to what sort of political system the European Union can actually afford if it is to become better able to take decisions and act on them. That is the fundamental issue on which all others depend.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for that reason that our next step must be to clarify terms that have not as yet been defined. The Copenhagen criteria make reference to the concept of ‘assimilation capacity’, while not, however, defining it. As I see it, it must involve at least the political and institutional arrangements set out in the Constitutional Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">While I have listened attentively to what the Commissioner has said, he can correct me if I am wrong, but I have not heard him say anything about this. Inherent in the decision as to what is a criterion of capacity to assimilate is the potential source of dissent between us and the Commission. Among the important criteria are that the European Union should be funded in such a way as to have a viable future and its being accepted by the people who live in it. If we are to talk in terms of credibility, that credibility, and the criteria that can properly be applied to capacity to assimilate, require that it should not be possible for another country to accede for the foreseeable future once Bulgaria and Romania have done so. Credibility is about more than a promise to accept people at some unspecified time; it is also about specifying the conditions under which they can be accepted at all, and that means that we have to be more precise about such concepts as ‘enlargement perspective’ or ‘prospect of accession’.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to be very clear in our own minds that the belief that a country’s accession will resolve tensions and internal security problems is an erroneous one. Such tensions and problems must be resolved before accession negotiations start. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It also reflects the doubt felt by many in respect of further enlargement. That is why such great store is set by absorption capacity, which, if the report were to be approved without any amendments, would even be given a geographical dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the view of most in my group that absorption capacity does not require any prior geographical demarcation in order to be fleshed out, since the Union’s demarcation will in the first instance be political – not that that will be easy, either. What matters most is that the EU should deliver on its promise of enlargement, certainly also with regard to the countries of the Western Balkans. Whilst the countries in question are still years removed from possible membership, the time has come to set down some firm agreements on this matter and even to put forward a time schedule. Needless to say, all the criteria, particularly the political ones, need to be met.</p>
<p class="contents">From what I gather, that is exactly what the President-in-Office of the Council said in her response. I take the view that vagueness about eventual membership and a fleshing out of the criteria will only delay the process, because this vagueness would be used as an excuse, from which nobody stands to benefit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to remind the House that, a few years ago, political scientists and analysts could not imagine that the day would come when the Iron Curtain would no longer be there. But it has gone now, and in that we can rejoice. I appeal to the House to be cautious in predicting what the European Union will be like in twenty, thirty, or forty years’ time, when most of us will have long ceased from active involvement in politics.

That is the question. Who decides who will join Europe? Until recently we said no to Croatia. The prosecutor, Mrs Carla del Ponte, said no, Austria put on the pressure and Croatia is in. Is this the political will of Europe? Of course, it is not very smart to have to tell our friends the Turks that they must not insult the President of the European Parliament. It is not very smart for us to take them EUR 139 million in the occupied areas and for them to pelt the members of the European Parliament with eggs and stones. They need to change their attitude, not just one article in their constitution. They cannot have this special treatment. They cannot threaten a state of Europe with war, with a <span class="italic">casus belli</span>, while we talk about letting them in. Can they not recognise a government which has been recognised by the other 24? These are not logical formulations.</p>

<p class="contents">Let us simply focus on priorities when it comes to enlargement. The countries of South-Eastern Europe should be in line after Romania and Bulgaria, which should accede to the European Union in 2007 and not 2008. After Croatia and Macedonia we should open another set of doors to Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Kosovo and Albania. This is the logical direction to follow. It is a question of strategic thinking and also of increasing security on the Old Continent. All in all, it will be beneficial from an economic point of view, as we will spend less on enlarging the Union by the next few Balkan states than on throwing money into the bottomless Balkan pre-accession coffers. The resolution of permanent conflicts in this part of Europe costs more than it would cost to have these states in Europe and thereby have them following the political and economic rules of play of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not fear expanding the Union as a result of the accession of the next few states. I know that this fear has become what you might call ‘trendy’. It is particularly useful in election campaigns which are continuously taking place in various EU Member States. If our Union is to be more effective economically and is not to fall behind in relation to America and Asia, it should progressively abolish the division of Europe into two parts: Europe A, or in other words the European Union, and Europe B, meaning all that which is not part of the Union. History has also shown that a Union that expands is a Union that is more secure. An invitation to accession negotiations, even without the prospect of joining the Union in the near future, is like the starter’s flag that is raised at the start of a motor race. The drivers must have a goal to aim for; they must know where the finishing post lies. Then they may travel far, negotiating many turns and even overcoming engine failures. What is important, however, is to set the wheels of accession in motion.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s motion for a resolution rightly highlights the fact that it is precisely this impulse that supported reforms in Turkey, Croatia and the Western Balkan states. Yes, enlargement is expensive, particularly in the short term, but it is a worthwhile investment in the long term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome its boldness in recognising the fact that the western Balkans should be an integral part of the European Union in the future. I am convinced that we have to respect our commitments; we cannot close the doors to those countries that were offered a membership perspective or to those countries that deserve such a perspective in future in the light of the EU Treaty provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not, however, repeat our old mistakes. We have to be prepared for enlargement. First and foremost we have to provide the financing. We also have to prepare our citizens for the enlargement perspective by explaining the great benefits of it. We have to stop making past and future enlargement a scapegoat for our internal, mostly domestic, problems and inaction.</p>
<p class="contents">In preparing for enlargement, we have to be rigorous, we have to adhere to conditionality, we have to be sincere with our partners. Let us not, however, be overly dogmatic. It is perfectly possible to open the doors to Croatia without the Constitutional Treaty. It is enough to introduce the necessary adjustments in the Accession Treaty. Croatia should not be a victim or hostage of our problems with the Constitutional Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the report’s innovativeness and courage. We could discuss the idea of intermediate steps towards reaching accession provided they were not permanent – intermediate steps, yes, but not as a substitute for membership. Various considerations should not be used as an alibi for inaction or for closing the doors to countries that will one day merit membership, such as Ukraine. The Union’s borders are already defined by the EU Treaty, which provides that ‘any European state which respects the principles ...’, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me repeat: enlargement is one of the most successful of the Union’s policies and therefore we should make good use of its potential to build a strong, secure and influential Union, faithful to its values of solidarity, democracy and openness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Do we think of it as a means to an end or as a political entity in itself? Do we want a free-trade OSCE to stabilise a problematic neighbourhood, or do we want a political union empowered to act on the basis of its own laws? The Brok report is a good thing, in that it really does change the perspective in favour of the second option.</p>
<p class="contents">It is said of us politicians in general that we are incapable of giving praise, but the SPD’s Mr Kuhne has just spoken on the basis of an outstanding document that the German Social Democrats have adopted, and the absolutely marvellous thing about it is that it defines where the SPD stands on enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is indeed the case that, as regards Bulgaria and Romania, the decisions have been taken, but we have to consider the possibility of treating them separately if their performance so warrants. It is not the means that are crucial, but the ends. It is quite possible that negotiations with Turkey will produce an outcome other than full membership, and here comes a key sentence: ‘We will no longer go along with the progressive softening-up of the accession criteria,’ say the German Social Democrats, and we German Free Democrats agree with them one hundred per cent.</p>
<p class="contents">Assimilation capacity is also defined; here, the main problem is that the European Union’s capacity to assimilate the new members is in part dependent on the agreement in principle of the people in the Member States. I see that as quite crucial if we want to carry the public with us. If we want them to remain good and faithful citizens of the European Union, we will have to take their wishes into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, we do not see any progress here and, in particular, innocent citizens are still being killed in Kurdistan.

They were saying ‘no’, particularly to Turkey. All we are getting here is more centralisation at the same time as more expansion to make an unworkable whole, and this in the very week that Germany has been told to get its economic house in order!

The truth is that they want money. They want yet more money.

<p class="contents">The predominant feeling in my country during the referendum was one of fear of being inundated by Polish plumbers. Reality is different: since the most recent enlargement by those countries, the Netherlands has earned EUR 2 billion annually. It is precisely those people who have always advocated this enlargement that have to communicate this very information on enlargement, while at the same time keeping an eye on the balance between enlarging and deepening, for this balance is lopsided at present. The Treaty of Nice was not really good enough for 25, and it will certainly not be enough when another two countries, namely Romania and Bulgaria, join us shortly. I think it would be good for us to commit ourselves to putting our own house in order first with a new treaty before we accept two more countries. We should commit to this off our own bat.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I think it important that countries on the edge should not wait for the European Union to finish its homework before they can start the deepening process with a kind of partnership. If they wish to become true members, and Europe appears to be able to cope, moving closer towards membership could then be the next step for them.</p>
<p class="contents">This report does not in any way detract from the rights of candidate countries that have this status at the moment, and I should like to make this quite clear. This credibility, however, must also go hand in hand with us attaching credibility to the criteria. This means, and Mrs Plassnik is right in saying, that Turkey must monitor the free expression of opinion, not only for the sake of this one author, but also for others, that freedom of religion must be guaranteed and also that we make progress where Cyprus is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the Age Package Deal, but it would be brilliant – and I hope the Commissioner is taking note of this – if Turkey could be persuaded to ratify and implement the protocol. How do you intend to achieve this clarity, Commissioner? For once that is done, much progress will also be made in relation to Cyprus itself. From that point of view, I am completely behind Amendment 4, in which we in this House spell out once again that we want to do our duty for the sake of the people in the south, but certainly also for those in the north of the island. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is not right, however, to force an economic or political unity that is not wanted by those affected, or is not viable in itself. It would be much more effective to enlarge the already existing CEFTA, as proposed by the Croatian Government, because it has already proved to be a successful and good cooperation, and this is where the Balkan States should be included.</p>

In this respect, it is extremely worrying that on the basis of the proposal of the Council, affected countries will not receive adequate financial support in the future, and they will have less support next year and in the following years than they have had so far. And this casts doubts on the credibility of the entire accession process. Therefore, we want to see a considerable increase in available funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: when assessing each country, we must consider their individual achievements, and en bloc or collective assessments of any kind cannot be accepted, because these countries must show their maturity individually.</p>

I am sure that if the European Union was able to formulate its position on all matters in this way, it would certainly be better supported and understood by its citizens. I would like to speak about the section of the report which talks about Turkey. I entirely agree that the European Union's expansion strategy has undoubtedly encouraged democratic, political and other reforms in Turkey and the other states mentioned in the resolution. However, it is equally important to note that, and I quote, ‘while a political transition process is still underway in Turkey, in 2005 the pace of reforms has slowed and the implementation of reforms remains uneven’. This is the exact reply I received yesterday from Commissioner Rehn to my verbal question on the implementation of the European Parliament's resolution on the start of negotiations with Turkey. This is also indicated in the draft resolution we have debated today, that is, that the pace of reforms in Turkey in 2005 was not only insufficient, but it actually has slowed down. This may be interpreted as Turkey's unpreparedness to carry out reforms which would bring it closer to the European Union, or perhaps even as an unwillingness to commit itself to the elementary obligations of possible membership.</p>
<p class="contents">I also share the regret expressed in Mr Brok's report and in the resolution over the unilateral declaration made by Turkey when signing the Additional Protocol to the Ankara Agreement. I believe that it is necessary to remind Turkey that recognition of all European Union Member States is an indispensable component of the accession process.</p>
<p class="contents">True, what I am about to say is not in the report, but I am sure that the acts of genocide committed against the Armenian nation 90 years ago should be recognised by Turkey at the highest level, as this more than any other action would bear testimony to the fact that Turkey's position, even regarding these painful events of the past, is in tune with the spirit of the Copenhagen criteria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union often uses double or even triple standards when it requires and expects something completely different from two candidate states, while it hardly ever calls to account its own Member States in matters regarding ethnic minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Following an armed insurrection, Albanians living in Macedonia were given administrative and even territorial autonomy of the widest extent, while in the case of Romania, the European Union does not press for territorial autonomy for the almost one million Hungarians living in Székely Land. The European Union promises independence to Kosovo, but for Vojvodina, it does not even recommend the autonomy that had been stripped away by Milosevic.</p>
<p class="contents">Please support the Hungarian amendment proposals aimed at the preservation of the multi-ethnic character of Vojvodina, the protection of minorities and the widening of provincial autonomy. Commissioner Olli Rehn knows very well that there is no solution without autonomy for Swedish-speaking Finns in Finland, and there cannot be a solution in the Balkans or for the Kurds living in Turkey, either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, as a strategic objective, enlargement can be the scapegoat for collective European impasses and that, in my opinion, should be avoided. Within this framework, the message sent by the Austrian Presidency and the meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs in Salzburg on the final objective of the integration of the countries of the Western Balkans into the European Union is indeed especially important. We are saying yes to the integration of the countries and no to special relationships.</p>
<p class="contents">From this side, the Commission should speed up the submission of its proposal for the granting of entry visas to the citizens of the Balkan countries. The question is deeply political, not bureaucratic. The doublespeak in the European Union on Kosovo is causing concern. The absence of a joint EU policy will have negative consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as far as Cyprus is concerned, I believe that the time has come for political initiatives to be taken to create necessary political and social osmosis at the level of civil society between the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots. The role of catalyst belongs to the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is my duty as leader of the Moldova delegation, however, to remind us all of the fact that there are two countries even closer to the heart of Europe which need the promise of European Union membership just as much as the Balkan countries and Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has clearly expressed its support for the aspirations of Ukraine and Moldova to become candidates for membership of the European Union. Moldova has been making a huge effort for two years.</p>
<p class="contents">Ukraine has also recently shown that it wishes to become a European country. I sensed that very clearly when I visited Ukraine last week.</p>
<p class="contents">I am disappointed, however, with the excessive emphasis placed on the fourth Copenhagen criterion in the report. At the same time, I agree with Elmar Brok that the European Commission should define the nature of accession capacity as soon as possible. This should not be a vague excuse for rejecting countries wishing to accede to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Thessaloniki Summit in 2003, our union has been reformed. This is the success story of those countries that fulfilled the Copenhagen criteria. Potential candidate countries must in future also be evaluated on the basis of transparent criteria.</p>

<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I am from a country that, according to all the figures and data available, benefited very considerably from the last enlargement, yet, even so, the popular view of both the European Union itself and its enlargement is a very critical one, so let me make a few personal observations on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be no Europe without frontiers; <span class="italic">‘L’Europe sans frontières n’existera pas’ – </span>yet Europe was always a political project. That is why neither geographers nor historians nor rulers will be any use to us in the political decisions that we have to take; what will decide the issues will be the common will of those who share in this community of values and laws, namely us and – as is the norm in democracies – the people themselves. Where, then, do we stand now? Looked at objectively, 3 October last year saw the taking of political decisions with far-reaching implications; what is ahead of us now – ‘us’ being the Council and the Commission with our partners around the world – is a period of quietly working on the issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just make three more comments on the geographical issues in the Balkans: what is this, in essence, all about? What are we working on? I believe we are working on Europe as a peace project, on its reunification, on the overcoming of the East/West divide, on doing away with the division created by Communism. It is intolerable that the Balkans should end up in some European no man's land; we must again spell out where we see the added value for ourselves, for our own people, and for the peoples of the Balkans an added value made up of the rule of law, of security and of economic opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may turn to Turkey, to which many Members made reference, in the currently ongoing process, the Commission and the Council are addressing not only the progress Turkey has made with its reform process, but also, and quite specifically and directly, what remains to be done in such areas as religious freedom and the free expression of opinion. We did this in our troika meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say something about Ukraine. Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and I were recently on a troika mission in Ukraine together, and I can give you the same message that I gave there: it is that Europe, the European Union, would like to see a stable, self-confident and successful Ukraine, but, above all, a Ukraine that faces up to the task of transformation and tackles it with determination. The European Neighbourhood Policy and the action plan that is about to be reviewed for the first time during the Austrian Presidency provide us with a good and appropriate array of instruments. There is also considerable potential for such things as a deeper agreement that might well include a broad-based free trade agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For instance, the accession negotiations with Turkey are likely to take 10 to 15 years. I do not expect anyone seriously to question our existing commitments in South-East Europe because it is really a matter of our own security and stability that we can enhance peace, democracy and increase prosperity in that very sensitive area.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have a consolidated and sufficiently demanding enlargement agenda. The enlargement train is no bullet train, no TGV, no Eurostar; it is a normal train or, in some cases, even a local train, but, most importantly, this train is moving, it is in the process and is thereby transforming the countries that are in the immediate neighbourhood of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the borders of Europe, the Commission works on the basis of Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union, which states that any European country that respects and applies the European values of democracy, human rights, the rule of law and fundamental freedoms may apply for membership of the Union. That does not mean that every European country must apply or that the EU must accept every country, but at the same time it means that it is not sensible to close the door forever by drawing a line across the map to define Europe once and for all, which would seriously damage our possibilities of having a beneficial influence and strategic leverage in our immediate neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, although no final borders of the Union have yet been determined, the EU is developing other forms of partnership and cooperation with our neighbouring countries, for instance in the form of the European Neighbourhood Policy, which can be further developed and upgraded.</p>
<p class="contents">A few comments and points have been made concerning absorption capacity. I would like to give a very brief historical overview. That concept was first explicitly mentioned in Copenhagen in 1993 when the European Council stated that the Union’s capacity to absorb new members, while maintaining the momentum of European integration, is also an important consideration in the general interests of both the Union and the candidate countries. That concept and its consequences have been examined regularly by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In its Agenda 2000 – and I am happy to refer to that because I was a member of the Steering Group for Agenda 2000, which was adopted in 1997 – the Commission examined the impact of the accession of central and eastern European countries from two angles: its impact on EU policies such as agriculture or regional policy, and its budgetary consequences. As a result, this work led to the setting of critical parameters in the negotiations that followed, in the decisions of March 1999 at the Berlin Summit and in 2003, when the countries of eastern and central Europe were allowed to join the European Union. This facilitated the accession of EU-10 and, by those means, we successfully combined our historic mission of reunifying the European continent and taking care of the practical considerations, which are also of concern to our citizens today.</p>
<p class="contents">Later on, we examined that concept during the accession negotiations, in some chapters in particular, such as that on the free movement of persons and the financial chapters, and more recently the Commission also examined that concept in our 2004 Issues Paper on questions arising from the Turkish accession perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">I would recommend this paper of October 2004 to all Members of the European Parliament. It is still worth reading and outlines very well the broad consequences of possible Turkish accession to the Union if, one day, Turkey meets all the conditions for accession.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, the upsurge in capacity is an important concept, and it has also been referred to in the negotiating frameworks for Turkey and Croatia. I can assure you that we bear this in mind throughout the negotiations, and it is also a leading concept in our strategy document of last November. We base our work on that concept and it is a very important consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, referring to what Mr Eurlings said about deepening and widening, I belong to the camp that thinks that the deepening of political integration is indispensable in order to make the European Union more effective and democratic. We must make the Union function better, and that was and is the purpose of the Constitutional Treaty. Therefore, we need a constitutional debate and, in time – sooner rather than later – we need to decide on how we reform our structures so that they are more effective and democratic and so that the European Union can have more clout in external relations, in Common Foreign and Security Policy and in preserving the security of its own citizens against international crime and terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">That must be done in the near future, not in the distant future – not in 10 to 15 years, for instance, when Turkey might be able to join – for the sake of Europe, and we need it already for the European Union of 25 or 27 Member States. Therefore, rather than talk about absorption capacity, I would prefer to talk about the functioning capacity of the current European Union to ensure that we serve our citizens better in terms of both policies and institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
