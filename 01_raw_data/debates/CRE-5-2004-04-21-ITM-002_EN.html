<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Roche,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, following the targeted killing of the new Hamas leader, Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi, the President of the Council issued a statement on 18 April expressing his deep concern at the ongoing and seemingly endless cycle of retaliatory violence involving Palestinian groups and the Israeli authorities and defence forces. The statement condemned both the assassination of the Hamas leader and the suicide bombing at the Erez crossing into the Gaza Strip which took place on the same day. The statement went on to say that such violence should end immediately and pointed to the self-evident futility of such violence, either as a means of freeing Palestinians from occupation or bringing long-term peace and security to the people of Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the Council once again reminded the Israeli Government that extrajudicial killings are contrary to international law and pointed out that respect for international law should mark an immediate distinction between democratically elected governments and terrorist groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, at the conclusion of the foreign ministers' informal meeting in Tullamore on 17 April, the President of the Council issued an important statement on behalf of his colleagues concerning the current situation in the Middle East. The EU foreign ministers reaffirmed certain basic principles of European policy towards any settlement in the Middle East conflict, including its commitment to a negotiated two-state solution agreed between the parties. This would result in a viable, contiguous, sovereign and independent Palestinian state, existing side by side and in peace with an Israel living within recognised and secure boundaries.</p>
<p class="contents">The ministers reaffirmed that the roadmap represented the only route to achieving such an outcome. The Union is determined to pursue vigorously the course set out in the roadmap and calls on both sides to fulfil their obligations under the roadmap. The established position of the European Union, restated by the European Council of 25 and 26 March, is that the Union will not recognise any change in the pre-1967 borders, other than those arrived at by agreement between the parties.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union has emphasised that no declared views on the possible shape of the final settlement can pre-empt the negotiations of that settlement. Ministers pointed out that the refugee question, and the manner in which the right to return may be realised, are also final status issues. The roadmap states that a final and comprehensive permanent status agreement that ends the Israeli-Palestinian conflict must include an agreed, just, fair and realistic solution to this question.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the Union has noted President Bush's reaffirmation of the United States' commitment to the roadmap and to a negotiated settlement. The Union emphasises the principle, shared by President Bush, that final status issues are a matter of negotiation and agreement between the parties themselves and that they must not be prejudiced.</p>
<p class="contents">Ministers also agreed with the President of the United States that secure and recognised borders should emerge from negotiations between the parties in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 242 and UN Resolution 338. These and other relevant Security Council Resolutions must form the basis for a just and lasting settlement of the conflict. In other words the conflict will not be sorted out by unilateral action.</p>
<p class="contents">The prospect of Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip is welcome. The European Council has stated that such a withdrawal should represent a significant step towards the implementation of the roadmap, provide that it is carried out in accordance with certain conditions. This is an opportunity which the international community, led by the Quartet, should seize. The proposed withdrawal should be properly orchestrated with the international community, so as to ensure that an orderly situation in Gaza results, which would permit the maintenance of security as well as the rehabilitation and the reconstruction that is so urgently needed in that area. The Union urges all parties urgently to undertake preparations towards that end.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis the European Union is ready to support the Palestinian authority in taking responsibility for law and order, as well as to continue the Union's existing aid to the Palestinian authority and to examine possible future needs that may arise in the context of a new situation in Gaza.</p>
<p class="contents">Ministers also stressed the need to avoid a political vacuum and the dangers that it would involve in the interim period between now and the beginnings of any withdrawal. They recalled that there are a number of measures which need to be adopted in the period immediately ahead in the political, security and humanitarian spheres in order to prevent further deterioration and in order to resume progress.</p>
<p class="contents">An end to violence and terrorism, as well as the resumption of the ceasefire embracing all of the parties and all of the groups, is essential. Both sides need to resume negotiations on the peace process without further delay. We all know from past experience and from history that resolution to difficult and complex issues invariably comes through negotiation, and in fact only comes through negotiation.</p>
<p class="contents">A just, lasting and a comprehensive peace must meet the legitimate aspirations of both the Israeli and the Palestinian people and must include Lebanon and Syria. All states in the region must exert every effort to promote peace and to combat terrorism. The European Union looks forward to the forthcoming meeting of the Quartet at principles level. The Quartet should play an active role in pursuing the goal of a comprehensive regional peace and encourage the parties to move ahead vigorously on the basis of the principles outlined above.</p>
<p class="contents">The ministers will have a further discussion on the Middle East process at the meetings of the Council on Monday. They will consider the position to be taken by the European Union at the meeting of the Quartet, which will take place in New York on 4 May.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that I have succeeded in giving the Members a clear impression of how actively focused this presidency remains when it comes to the very difficult situation in the Middle East. We will, by the same token, listen with great attention to the views of Parliament on this important issue at this time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I do not wish to repeat or intend to repeat what the presidency has just said about recent discussions on the Middle East by the Council or how it has reacted to the statement made by President Bush in Washington last week after his meeting with Prime Minister Sharon. The statement surprised many people, whether understandably or not, and one cannot disguise the fact that it seems to have caused great concern in the Arab world. Some have subsequently argued that it should not have done so. They have said that it offers a way into the implementation of that roadmap, rather than a tearing-up of the roadmap. They have argued that we should seek out the positive, like the promised and welcomed Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, rather than focus on the negative.</p>
<p class="contents">So be it. I do not seek to second-guess the doubtless well-intentioned interpretations of others or to undermine efforts to make the most of the present, exceptionally difficult, situation. Some of course always see a glass as half full when others believe it is half empty. Others find it rather challenging to believe that a glass is half full when they cannot see very much liquid in the glass at all. I guess that like beauty, truth is in the eye of the beholder. I do not wish to dwell on those matters. I will just make five points which we must address if we are to draw anything positive from the present grim situation.</p>
<p class="contents">First, as the General Affairs and External Relations Council and the European Council has said again and again, a final settlement can only be achieved as a result of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, resulting in two viable sovereign and independent states based on the borders of 1967, perhaps amended by agreement, living side by side in peace and security as laid out, for example, in the roadmap.</p>
<p class="contents">This has been the main thread of European thinking, from Venice in 1980 to Berlin in 1999, to Seville in 2002 and right up to the latest European Council conclusions of last month. It is not surprising that we have agreed with what for 37 years has been the consistent American position, that settlements beyond the 1967 borders are illegal and represent 'obstacles to peace'. We all know what the ingredients for a final settlement will be. They are contained in the Mitchell report and in subsequent documents, including the Arab League peace initiative of 2002. They are also in the roadmap that has been endorsed by the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">A settlement does not await some heavenly insight. It awaits the exercise of political will by both sides – Israeli and Palestinian. It is in my judgment a tragedy that the courageous proposals of the representatives of civil society who negotiated the Geneva initiative do not seem to be shared by the political leadership in their communities.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, we deplore the violence which postpones reconciliation and any chance whatsoever of peace. We have always deplored without reservation and condemned with all our strength the suicide bombings that take innocent lives and the dark propaganda that clouds the minds of so many. We are also profoundly critical of heavy-handed military retaliation which destroys lives, homes and livelihoods, the sort of retaliation which increases extremism and does not increase security. We believe that targeted assassinations are wrong, illegal and counter-productive.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the Palestinian politicians whom I most admire, a voice of sanity and reason, referred recently to the deafening sound of war drums on both sides and to the bitter fact that both communities seem to be locked in an embrace in which all that seems to matter is causing pain to the other side. There is plenty of pain on offer, but not much promise of peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, whatever the criticisms of the European approach to the dispute, we can say that we have sustained, throughout the weeks, months and years of bloodshed and hopelessness, institutions which can one day form the basis for a reformed Palestinian Government. That has been the policy of the European Council, endorsed by this Parliament. We have been congratulated for what we have done by, among others, the World Bank. Only recently I received a letter from the Palestinian Finance Minister, Salam Fayad, which noted that with the help of the European Union the Palestinian Authority has now delivered on all of the reform commitments it had made to the Palestinian Legislative Council a year and a half ago. There is now a high degree of accountability, with transparent budget procedures. There are no more cash payments to Palestinian security personnel, whose salaries are now transferred through bank accounts.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been encouraged, in private, to do more – to give more help. We have been criticised in public for doing anything at all. Some have argued that there could actually be a no more serious accusation than that the attempt to promote reform and sustain some sort of life in Palestine has bankrolled terrorism. Parliament has held its own inquiry into these matters and OLAF has investigated these allegations.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no more to say on the subject, save to pay tribute to my officials who have tried to implement a difficult policy honestly, transparently and with integrity. When I look at what has happened in the last few years I can see all too little else that has achieved as much as they have.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the future, it is said by some – perhaps a trifle glibly – that after the promised withdrawal we will rebuild Gaza and try to create the foundations for a new Palestine. What they presumably have in mind is a Palestine which is genuinely viable, not a collection of isolated bantustans divided by tanks, settlements and walls.</p>
<p class="contents">We are certainly prepared to continue our humanitarian assistance and to support the rebuilding of the infrastructure of those areas from which the Israeli defence forces withdraw. But I have to say that this time we should seek certain guarantees from the Israeli defence forces that they will not destroy again what we build. They should take into account the five points made by the European Council of 25 and 26 March, notably, the anchoring of the withdrawal within the roadmap and the facilitation of economic life in the territory that the Israeli defence forces leave.</p>
<p class="contents">It was the World Bank that noted that the biggest obstacle to economic revival is lack of access and a lack of sufficient freedom of movement of persons and goods. Access to the outside world is essential for reviving the Palestinian economy. We should also seek to ensure that humanitarian assistance can be provided as it would be elsewhere. At present it costs more to provide the assistance than in most other places because of the behaviour and activities of the security forces.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to find a way back into implementation of the roadmap then we need to discuss very carefully with the Israeli Government the terms of withdrawal and see how we can associate the management of the withdrawal with the objectives of the roadmap. Our aim must be that Israelis recognise again the Palestinian Authority as their partner in the peace process. The objective should be to hand over Gaza and parts of the West Bank to the Palestinian Authority, not to Hamas, and to ensure that the handover takes place in an orderly fashion, not in a way that leads to more chaos and more violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there are still – thank heaven – some moderates in Palestine, Israel and the Arab world. I ask this question as quietly and diplomatically as I can: how much support are we giving those moderates today? If we are not prepared to be courageous for moderation, how can we expect them to be?</p>
<p class="contents">It is not hyperbolic to say that the outlook today in the region is more worrying than it has been for some time. It certainly seems to me a good deal more disturbing than it looked, for example, at the beginning of last year when we were being told that the road to peace in the Middle East lay in the military liberation of Baghdad and the installation of democracy in Iraq. Maybe one day Iraq will be stable and democratic and maybe it will be a beacon for other countries in the region. How could one hope for anything else? Whatever one's views about the past, what else is there to work for? However, if we are to have any chance of achieving that outcome and of encouraging modernisation and democracy in the whole region, then we have to avoid words and policies that alienate large parts of the Islamic world and threaten the very clash of civilisations which all sane men and women should want to avoid at all costs.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been a deeply depressing feature of my five years as a Commissioner that the world I look out onto today seems to be far more dangerous than it was in 1999. We must always try to work for a better world and not throw in our hand in introverted despair. Today, among other things, we must see what we can rescue from what is left of the Middle East peace process. It is not a very encouraging prospect, but what alternative is there?</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Laschet (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, I think the start of the Commissioner's speech has made it clear that recent events require some interpretation. Do we regard the course set out in the roadmap as dead and buried following the meeting between Prime Minister Sharon and President Bush, or should we see new opportunities that can be exploited over the coming days, weeks and months? I must admit that the Irish Presidency's initial reaction tends towards the first position, whereas the stance adopted by a number of foreign ministers in their statements leaned towards the second.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself endorse the position adopted by the foreign ministers, including the German foreign minister, who said that this initiative brings movement into the process which we should now exploit. Despite all the scepticism that we might feel at the proposed withdrawal from Gaza that was outlined to us yesterday and again today by the two representatives of the Geneva initiative, the European Union should bring its influence to bear on the parties to the conflict, especially Israel, and make it clear that this withdrawal must be the first stage in its withdrawal from all the occupied territories. In that sense, the withdrawal is the right move. That being the case, a Prime Minister who is affiliated to the right wing in Israel and who may soon be responsible for ejecting settlers from their homes in Gaza by force needs a broader framework in which to explain his position.</p>
<p class="contents">If the withdrawal from Gaza is indeed successful and the orderly handover to the Palestinian authority takes place as demanded yet again by the Commissioner a few moments ago, and if many of the homes currently being used are then offered to people from Gaza, and if the infrastructure is not dismantled but handed over to the Palestinian authority, this may well offer a fresh opportunity for peace. If we take the attitude that the whole thing is pointless and doomed to failure, we will have no chance of influencing the process. However, if we see this as a positive opportunity and work within it, I believe that the roadmap can be revitalised.</p>
<p class="contents">Reading the US President's letter to the Israeli Prime Minister carefully, we see that the Israelis are also expected to play their part. The President himself refers to UN Security Council Resolution 242. The President himself also says that only negotiations can ultimately produce a solution. We should emphasise these passages of his letter in our further positions on this conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make a second point. I believe that it is indeed the case that a solution to this conflict, which is not restricted solely to Gaza, can only be successful over the long term within two viable and independent states.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner also referred to the work of this Parliament in relation to the deployment of European funds. We have adopted two reports on this issue, a majority and a minority report, but there was 80% agreement on the findings. One of these findings can be shared with the House today: the accusation that the European Union has funded terrorism cannot be proven and is untenable. On the issue of whether the decision to provide direct financial assistance was right or wrong, we can adopt various positions. However, the decision was taken by the foreign ministers, not the Commissioner. The Commission has done its utmost to contribute to the reform of the Palestinian authority. It has been at pains to exercise control over the use of European funds, and we can confirm today that the situation in the Palestinian authority has indeed improved compared with three years ago. We must thank the Commission and Commissioner Patten for their work on this issue, notwithstanding the divergent political views on whether the decision was right or wrong. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Naturally, I believe that the Road Map is still ineffective and I wonder what has happened to the pressure on Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament also calls on ‘the United States Administration to assume their responsibility vis-à-vis the present crisis’. In my opinion, that government has not only failed to assume its responsibilities, but has given in to the Israeli Government. Powell’s comments of last Thursday are, in my view, a mixture of absurd wishful thinking and cynicism, when he said that the meeting between Bush and Sharon has produced positive results for the Palestinians and their aspirations for a State. This is demonstrated by the fact that the minister without portfolio of the Israeli Government, Gideon Ezra, stated on Friday that Powell’s comments, intended to soften Bush’s pro-Israeli tone, do not reflect the opinion of Bush himself.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s Resolution also calls for both parties ‘to make a serious effort to resume genuine negotiations’. In my opinion, the Palestinian National Authority has been waiting for months for the resumption of those negotiations, but it is clear that Israel does not want to negotiate with the Palestinian National Authority and is prepared at this point, with the full support of Bush, to withdraw unilaterally from Gaza outside the framework of the Road Map.</p>
<p class="contents">It has become sufficiently clear, in my view, that it is not a question of Gaza first and West Bank second, but of Gaza only.</p>
<p class="contents">Following so many events we should remember another two paragraphs of our Resolution; paragraph 48, included following the killing of Sheikh Yassin, which: ‘calls on the Council and the Commission to consider acting in full compliance with Article 2 of the Association Agreement with Israel should the policy of extrajudicial killings continue’. Well, the extra-judicial executions are continuing, most recently of Abdel Aziz Rantisi. I therefore believe that Parliament must reiterate its request to the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, finally, in paragraph 49 Parliament ‘asks the Council to invite the Member States in the UN Security Council immediately to table a proposal for an international peacekeeping force at the 1967 borders, with the mandate to protect both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples from terrorist attacks, military incursions and interventions’. We must also reiterate that demand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It may well be that Israel keeping some key West Bank settlements and Palestinians accepting that the return of refugees will be to a Palestinian state – with which I personally agree – would indeed be part of an eventual negotiated settlement. The Quartet, with EU leadership, must disprove, however, Mr Sharon's claim that his plan constitutes a critical blow to Palestinian hopes of statehood.</p>
<p class="contents">I am absolutely committed to the existence of Israel as a Jewish homeland and state – though one in which Arab Israelis have full, equal rights – and Israel's right to live in peace and security within recognised boundaries. My dismay at the occupation is not only about the misery of ordinary Palestinians but also how the role of colonial occupier is damaging Israel's integrity and its commitment to the rule of law. I condemn all terrorism against Israel and I do not see suicide bombers as purely the product of desperation among Palestinians – real though that desperation is. There is also exploitation of young people and a despicable culture of martyrdom in a perversion of Islam.</p>
<p class="contents">The wall or fence might be capable of justification if it were on the Green Line – but it is not. The Bush-Sharon policy of military defeat will not ensure Israel's security. Hamas is a dangerous and uncompromising organisation dedicated to Israel's destruction, but the recent illegal assassinations of its leaders simply create more bitterness and recruits for terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">I am deeply worried about the rising incidence of anti-Semitism in Europe and take a strong interest in combating it, as well as other kinds of racial and religious prejudice. The delay by the EU Monitoring Centre in producing timely work on the threat to Europe's Jewish communities naturally fed suspicions about bias. We need renewed vigour in exposing and rooting out anti-Semitism and in establishing the dividing line between legitimate criticism of the policies of the Israeli Government and the demonisation of Jews.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand the shock that Israelis must have felt at the poll last year that said that 59% of Europeans considered Israel a threat to world peace. I believe that many respondents read that question as being about the conflict between Israel and Palestinians, but it was deeply unhelpful to pose it in that way. However, the result was a wake-up call. We need a more intense EU-Israel dialogue. That is why I personally oppose any calls in the European Parliament to boycott Israel, and calls for cutting academic links are completely counterproductive. I have equally resisted moves to eliminate EU funding for the Palestinian Authority. I welcome the fact that it is Palestinians themselves calling for a clean-up of corruption, but Israel needs a negotiating partner and the sub-Saharan poverty level of Palestinians would be even greater without EU support.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is unworthy of Israel and its tradition of justice to persecute Mordechai Vanunu in a vindictive manner after his release. He has served his sentence and he should now be free. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is one of the heroes of our time, the man who confirmed that Israel has significant stocks of nuclear weapons that could turn the whole of the Middle East into a nuclear desert. For this achievement in the service of peace, his reward was to be kidnapped by the State of Israel and sentenced to 18 years’ imprisonment.</p>
<p class="contents">The surrounding world largely forgot him. Israel is allowed to possess its nuclear weapons in peace, while Arab and Muslim states that attempt to obtain protection for themselves against the threat of Israel’s nuclear weapons are bombed to smithereens and destroyed. Why does the world community not intervene in regard to Israeli nuclear weapons? Why does the same not happen to Dimona as happened to Ossirak?</p>
<p class="contents">The unbalanced approach on the part of the world community is one of the reasons for the despair that now prevails in the Middle East, a feeling confirmed here in Parliament yesterday by two of the area’s foremost peace campaigners, Abraham Burg and Yassir Rabo. In <span class="italic">Le Monde</span>, Egypt’s President Mubarak stated that hatred of the United States in the Arab world has never at any time been as strong as it is today. The United States backs Israel 100%. For that reason, the United States cannot bring about peace on its own. A better balance is needed, and the EU could bring this about by backing the Palestinians as strongly as the United States backs Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU could translate its words into deeds and implement Parliament’s call for the association agreement with Israel to be suspended. The EU could despatch troops to protect Palestinian areas. The EU could demand that Israel dismantle its stocks of nuclear weapons. The EU could issue an invitation to Vanunu and grant him asylum in the EU country of his choosing.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU could go still further. Some years ago, I met Shimon Perez. He proposed that both Israel and Palestine should be offered EU membership, on condition that they had achieved a stable peace. Clearly, the EU has an attraction beyond its borders that it does not always have among its own Member States. Let us make use of the fact. Offer EU membership to Palestine and Israel as a reward for achieving a definitive peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The illegal executions of Hamas leaders will have a boomerang effect, and new leaders are always waiting in the wings. Sharon is only able to do this because of the unconditional support he obtains from President Bush. Things agreed in Washington are an affront to its partners in the Quartet, and the EU in particular. To my knowledge, the European Union has not been consulted once. We, the European Parliament, must demand that Javier Solana puts his foot down in his dealings with the Quartet.</p>
<p class="contents">If the USA now wants support for Iraq, it must in turn come up with support for an international force in the Gaza Strip following an Israeli withdrawal, and in the West Bank as the following step. Solana could also put the Geneva Accord on the table. After all, Colin Powell has approved this, and it has his support. This must also be clarified. Avraham Burg, who was present in this House yesterday, once said that the roadmap had to be produced in Geneva. I think that, as a signal to the Palestinian people, we can demand an increase in the humanitarian aid we give to this impoverished people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It must make clear to Israel, to the Palestinians and indeed to the United States that we are serious about finding a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">For that to happen, the international community, via the Quartet, has to act as an even-handed broker for peace. It is deeply regrettable that the United States administration, for purely electoral reasons, has decided to ditch the roadmap. We have to try and revive that, insofar as we can, and I wish the presidency luck with its efforts to achieve that over the next few weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we have one weapon in our hands which we have consistently refused to use or even to threaten to use, and that is the suspension of the Association Agreement with Israel. What other weapon do we have in order to pressurise Israel to take its responsibilities seriously in that region? There is no other way in my view that we can bring the Israelis to the negotiating table in a serious frame of mind. Certainly the decision of the US Government last week to play to the Sharon government has not resulted in the ending of its assassination policy. It has not resulted in the ending of its 'apartheid wall' policy or of its policy of strengthening settlements in the West Bank, all of which is a recipe for continued pain and disaster in the Middle East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I listened to the weariness in Commissioner Patten's voice when he was speaking. It is a weariness shared by us all in that we have to return the same issue over and over again. It saddens me to note that, in the three short weeks since we last debated this issue, the situation has become worse, not better. We are all depressed by the endlessly grim sequence of events in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate, however, gives us an opportunity to continue to remind all of the players and parties in the Middle East – to take up the point made by Mr De Rossa in his final contribution – that people must behave even-handedly and within the acceptable limits of international law. We should also take the opportunity to remind other parties that there is no alternative to full and impartial negotiation of a two-state solution, that this solution should result in a viable, contiguous and sovereign, independent Palestinian state, and that the roadmap is the only available way of achieving that.</p>
<p class="contents">If I correctly heard Mr Laschet, he raised two points. First, I believe he suggested that the presidency views the roadmap as somehow dead. That is emphatically not the case. That is certainly not the view of this presidency. We have said time and again that the roadmap is the only viable way out of the current morass. Mr Laschet also seemed to suggest that we see no opportunity for movement arising from the Israeli plans for withdrawal from Gaza. That does not accurately reflect either the presidency's position or the position I stated at Tullamore.</p>
<p class="contents">I reject the notion that European Union Member States are in any way disunited on the matter. There is absolute agreement within the Union on this. The Council of Ministers made that clear. The important, substantial and final statement unanimously agreed by the 25 ministers last weekend makes the position very clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Questions arise as to whether the roadmap is dead. The roadmap remains the only framework; it is the only option available. There is nothing else available. That point has to be made clear. I am confident that not only is the roadmap as valid and as centrally relevant now as it was when it was first put in place, but its relevance, importance and significance must also continue to be reiterated, particularly when the Quartet meets – probably in New York on 4 May.</p>
<p class="contents">The question was raised as to the plans to dismantle the Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip. Again, the foreign ministers and the general affairs ministers made it clear that there are five elements in this area: first, withdrawal in Gaza must take place within the context of the roadmap; second, it must be seen as a step towards a two-state solution; third, it must not involve the transfer of settlement activity to the West Bank; fourth, there must be an organised and negotiated handover to the Palestinian Authority; fifth, Israel must facilitate the humanitarian reconstruction of Gaza, in which the European Union has invested very heavily.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of anti-Semitism was raised. The ongoing difficulties in the region must never be allowed to become the basis for anti-Semitism to raise its head in Europe again. I agree with Baroness Ludford on that particular point. Her point has been taken. Last autumn the European Union took an unprecedented initiative at the UN General Assembly in proposing a stand-alone resolution condemning all manifestations of anti-Semitism. At the OSCE conference that will take place in Berlin on 28 and 29 April the Union will play its full and appropriate part in addressing and condemning this appalling phenomenon.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr De Rossa has said a great deal on this issue with which I agree wholeheartedly. The European Union must be an even-handed player. Mr De Rossa is absolutely consistent and right about that. He is also right about the need for all the players to take a balanced view. However, I am not so sure that he was correct when he suggested that suspension of the Association Agreement is an appropriate tool. Suspension is not on the agenda at the moment. Consensus within the Union would be required for such a step. Those arguing that such an action should take place would have to consider the undesirable consequences arising from it.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 2 of the Agreement reinforces obligations already incumbent on the signatories in respect of human rights. Perhaps we should emphasise that responsibility. Meetings of the Association Council with Israel provide the European Union with an opportunity to emphasise our concerns – and those stated so many times by Mr De Rossa – to the Israeli authorities. It is better to have a channel to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be wrong to let the debate pass without mentioning suicide bombings and terrorist attacks against Israel. The Israeli viewpoint, all too often, is that we are not mindful of their concerns. That is not the case. Suicide and terrorist attacks against civilian targets are condemned. They are an abomination. We all condemn them. Suicide bombings advance no legitimate agenda and can only do damage to the interests of the Palestinian people as well as causing further untold mayhem, damage and suffering to the Israeli people, which has suffered far too much in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to be even-handed in this. I believe that Europe is even-handed in this. I agree with Commissioner Patten that, if Europe yet again rebuilds what has been put in place to support the Palestinian people, the least we can expect is that the Israeli authorities should support, respect and protect that infrastructure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
