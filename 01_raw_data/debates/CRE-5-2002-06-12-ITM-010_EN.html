<p class="contents">Because of this, the Council of Ministers of 17 July 2000 called on the Commission to introduce a regulatory framework for alcohol of agricultural origin, but the Commission went much further and proposed a COM, which did not include any financial measures but did allow for the possibility of establishing tariff quotas and safeguard clauses, prohibiting or restricting the use of inward processing arrangements, and a specific provision on aid.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal, however, made by the Commission did not include synthetic alcohol, although 70% of ethyl alcohol users can use it industrially; only the 30% involved in the production of spirit drinks can only use alcohol of agricultural origin.</p>
<p class="contents">Because synthetic alcohol was not included, and because at the time no legal basis could be found for bringing it into a COM, Parliament referred the report back to committee two months ago. Afterwards the Council continued its deliberations and has reached an advance agreement to include synthetic alcohol and has asked us for a second report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council and Parliament are now in agreement, and I think the Commission should take this into account. This report proposes in one of its amendments – the most important one – to change the title: instead of a COM, what is proposed is a Council regulation laying down specific measures concerning the market in ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is proposed that synthetic alcohol should also be included in these measures, especially with regard to statistics. It is also proposed that the Management Committee for Wine should have competence in these matters, but that a specific working party should be set up within the Management Committee for Wine to deal with alcohol of agricultural origin. It is also proposed that Article 10 should be deleted because, as this is not a COM, an article referring to aids does not make sense. Besides, as these are national aids, I think they come under the heading of all state aids, regardless of whether they are for agricultural alcohol or for some other matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, please pass on all these amendments, which I ask should be voted on in the House tomorrow, to the competent Commissioner, together with the understanding that the Council and Parliament are in agreement on this aspect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am extraordinarily grateful to our rapporteur, Mrs Ayuso González, who has made exemplary use of the limited room for manoeuvre available to Parliament. We would, Commissioner, have liked to reject the Commission proposal as a whole, as it took no account whatever of the Council's request. Close cooperation with all concerned parties has enabled the rapporteur to lay before us a genuine compromise on which all of them were able to agree.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirty years of discussions have now got us to the point where we can give this sector a regulation that provides for the required statistical surveys, and does so primarily within the framework of a simple Council regulation. Secondly, this regulation does not, in essence, call for any statements on aid legislation. Thirdly, it includes industrially produced alcohol, agricultural alcohol's direct competitor. As a matter of urgency, I appeal to the Commission to stop resisting this compromise approach. In the event of a qualified majority in Council, it has previously been the practice for the Commission not to insist on a unanimous vote unless there are legal difficulties, but, in this instance, there is no sound reason to insist on unanimity. The Commission's instruments are perfectly adequate for the purpose of monitoring this sector, in which no distortions of competition occur.</p>
<p class="contents">Not one of the candidate countries wants to adopt or copy the German model which is the subject of this dispute. If the Commission holds fast to its legal position, then I appeal in equally urgent terms to the Spanish President of the Council. When it comes to the interests of German distillers and the interests of our cultural landscape, I appeal to Mrs Künast, the German Federal Minister for Consumer Protection, Food and Agriculture, to vote on 27 June in such a way as to achieve unanimity in this matter. Throughout long negotiations, Parliament has done everything in its power, and now we are counting on your support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I was interested to discover that the United Kingdom appears to be the second largest producer of ethyl alcohol and, along with other producers, is of course concerned at increasing imports but rather static Community demand. We know that imports into the Community have tariff concessions which have been agreed by the Council of Ministers. The industry tells me that there are subsidy regimes in the exporting countries which naturally they do not view very favourably. Our producers are also concerned about the prospect of duty-free entry from the 48 least-developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We understand these concerns, but I do not believe that removing the prohibition on state aid provisions, which are provided for in Amendments Nos 7 and 19, is a solution to the problem. I would certainly hope that these will be opposed and I will be voting against them.</p>
<p class="contents">On the positive side, the specific measures proposed by the Commission are welcome. They are certainly preferable to an interventionist organisation and I welcome the change in nomenclature that the rapporteur has introduced. I hope that the provisions are non-discriminatory, that they will provide for the continuance of the trade without any great hindrance, and that our competitiveness will not be too much affected by imports. The proposals do involve a minimum degree of administration and documentation.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that Parliament will reject Amendments Nos 7 and 19, in which case I will be able to support the report. I cannot say that this is the view of all the Members of the PSE Group, but it is certainly the view of some of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, may I begin by thanking the Members of this Parliament for the work they have put into considering the proposal for a common market organisation for alcohol. In particular my thanks go to the rapporteur, Mrs Ayuso González, for her analysis of the proposal and the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I comment in more detail on the amendments proposed, I would remind you that this is another proposal to establish a set of common rules for the alcohol sector after several attempts in the past, all of which failed for various reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is of the opinion that the actual market situation in this sector makes it necessary to propose at least a minimal set of rules and that, accordingly, the chances of success this time are fairly good. Most of the amendments proposed can be accepted by the Commission. All amendments relating to the change of title are acceptable. Indeed if the title proposed by the Commission creates problems because it refers more to an intervention system not provided for here, a more appropriate title reflecting the content of the regulation as suggested by Parliament can be considered.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments on including synthetic alcohol in the article on market information can also be accepted. Parliament initially proposed to extend the proposal to synthetic alcohol, which is not an Annex I product and therefore is not part of the common agricultural policy. For most outlets except alcoholic beverages, both agricultural and synthetic alcohol can be used and therefore compete on the same market. The suggestion in the Agriculture Committee's report that synthetic alcohol should be included in the article on data collection to establish a yearly market balance of the sector, and to have better market information and increased market transparency, is one which the Commission is willing to consider.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments 7 and 19 concerning deletion of the state aids article are not acceptable. The Commission is of the opinion that all provisions proposed are necessary to establish a set of common rules for the alcohol sector, including the provisions on application of the rules on state aids. Without fair application of those rules, there would not be a real common set of rules for agricultural alcohol, and I would point out that those rules already apply to synthetic alcohol.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is well aware of the concern that the application of state aid rules may create a problem for the functioning of the German alcohol monopoly. I would repeat that the purpose of this proposal on agricultural alcohol is <span class="italic">not</span> to put an end to that monopoly. If alcohol production by German farmers under monopoly rules, including federal payments, is necessary to maintain valuable eco-systems or to cover the extra costs of environment-friendly production methods, current state aid rules offer substantial scope to grant aids for those purposes or rural development aid schemes could be used. On the other hand, small distillers producing not only alcohol but also spirits could benefit from the de minimis rule on state aid for non-agricultural products.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is willing to try and find a solution, but cannot accept the proposal to simply delete the related article on state aid from the draft text. A solution should be found within the context of that article. Amendment No 8, which refers to the declaration on rum under the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement and asks for special treatment to rum producers affected by the application of EU policies is also difficult to accept.</p>
<p class="contents">By definition, the proposed regulation should comply with all bilateral and international agreements, as stated in Article 14. It is neither necessary nor appropriate to grant special treatment to one category of partners within a specific agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 13 can be accepted except for the reference to CN code 3814 0090 in the definition of non-agricultural alcohol because that code covers mixtures of alcohol with solvents and is not limited to non-agricultural alcohol. Adoption of Regulation No 142/2002 has solved the problem of imports of those mixtures.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 14, 16, 17 and 18 are purely technical improvements to the text that have also been discussed in the Council, and there is no problem in accepting them.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 20, however, is more difficult to accept. The Commission does not want to create a specific working group on alcohol as part of the wine management committee. The Commission's aim is the same as that in the amendment, that is, to bring together the real experts on alcohol. For that reason, the Commission has already made a statement on organising the work of the wine management committee in such a way that all alcohol-related items are grouped together in order to permit Member States to send the real experts to the meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">Although Amendment No 21 is acceptable, I must point out that it limits the Commission's scope to take transitional measures more than the original proposal does. This text appears in other regulations and is therefore acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Amendments Nos 22 and 24 are concerned, the Commission of course agrees that the rules on state aid should be applied in this sector, too, and therefore should not be deleted. I also recognise the value of existing aid systems in certain Member States, especially for small agricultural distilleries, and the need to find a solution for them. The notion of a transitional measure is certainly one I must give thought to, but I am not yet in a position to indicate the specific nature of the solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 23, as indicated a short time ago. The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 3, 5, 13 and 15 on including synthetic alcohol in the proposal as far as the system of data collection is concerned. According to the Court of Justice case law, it can be included without changing the legal basis of the proposal and therefore the Commission is of the opinion that the global alcohol market is satisfactorily addressed by this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that my comments today have clarified the Commission's position on this proposal. Moreover, I should like to thank Members of Parliament for their constructive suggestions, which we shall of course consider, and for the time they have devoted to this process, and in particular I would thank the rapporteur, Mrs Ayuso González, for her contribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
