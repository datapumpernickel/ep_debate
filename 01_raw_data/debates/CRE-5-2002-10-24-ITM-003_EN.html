<p class="contents">Since 1996, when the first guidelines were adopted, certain salient events have taken place on the European energy scene. I shall limit myself to pointing out the most important, namely the first phase of the internal market, increasing use of natural gas – which also reflects our concern for improved environmental protection – the setting of more ambitious objectives with regard to the use of renewable energy sources and, lastly, the prospects that have now been confirmed with regard to the enlargement of the Union. The Commission proposal reflects these events in the priorities of our energy network policy and in the other provisions of the guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important element of our proposal is the establishment of twelve priority axes for the development of the energy networks, in order to integrate them fully at European level. These axes determine the broad lines that are essential to the operation of a competitive energy market and improved safety of the energy supply, specifically with regard to natural gas.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to note that the Barcelona European Council gave its approval to the swift implementation of these projects and clearly recognised their political importance for the European Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you that, in addition to the proposals for a revision of the guidelines for transport and energy networks, the Commission has also proposed to adapt certain provisions of the Rules of Procedure with regard to financial aid for these networks.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the Commission has suggested the possibility of granting more financial aid, specifically up to 20% of the priority energy network projects. It is clear that increased aid will only be granted to projects that really need it and in which there is a clear prospect of accelerated development, effective implementation and added value for the Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of the energy networks, this concentration of financial means is taking place with a limited, low, constant budget and therefore there should in theory be no concerns with regard to the impact on competition or on spending, because, I repeat, the volume and quantity remain the same.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, with regard to all the consequences of enlargement, I would like to ask you to be patient. A large number of projects of interest to the candidate countries already appear in this proposal. The Commission considers, however, that these countries need to undergo an initial period of increased competition in the energy market before implementing the priority axes. As far as possible, the Commission will present a proposal in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have briefly summed up the Commission’s objectives in presenting this proposal and I eagerly await the debate on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a result of congestion and insufficient joint activity, certain Member States can now only profit to a limited extent from the advantages of the open markets, meaning that competitive advantages for consumers are becoming increasingly smaller. The European Commission is therefore right to propose a reform of the guidelines for Trans-European Networks in the energy sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The revised proposal takes account of the liberalisation of the energy markets, the increasing external dependence on energy and the stricter requirements to get sustainable sources of energy accepted. These are the objectives which have been emphasised by the political leaders on the European Councils of Stockholm and Barcelona. Concentration on a new list of priority projects forms the core of this proposal. Member States will give special support and attention to these projects. The maximum percentage for co-financing will be increased from 10% to 20% and from now on the construction phase will take precedence.</p>
<p class="contents">The question which immediately comes to mind is whether this is the best solution. In my opinion, a massive subsidy for the energy sector is not a good solution because I feel that it is at variance with the current trend towards liberalisation and the creation of a competitive internal market. It must be emphasised that the main responsibility lies with the energy sector and with the industry itself. Measures which are taken on the basis of this decision may in no way be allowed to cause disruption of competitive practices within the internal energy market. I also feel that Community aid should only relate to the design phase. Subsidies for the construction phase such as proposed by the Commission should then only be granted in exceptional cases. In this context, the integration of renewable energy sources constitutes an important factor. In my opinion, these will contribute in future to the diversification of energy sources and thus as such to the continuity of energy provision within the European Union. Support of tangible projects such as off-shore wind parks should therefore be encouraged.</p>
<p class="contents">The way in which the Commission wants to implement all this does give rise to a number of questions. I think it is not a good idea to give the European Parliament a <span class="italic">droit de regard</span> only when the issues concern strategically important changes to project specifications. It is important to seek a balance between, on the one hand, a quick reaction by the Commission to new developments and, on the other hand, the need for effective control by Parliament. To satisfy the need for transparency, the Commission needs to submit regular reports.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I would like to emphasise that actual measures will be necessary if we want to reap the rewards of the internal market. In fact, the new guidelines might significantly contribute towards coping with the problems of: the continuity of energy provision, the integration of renewable energy, the outermost regions as well as enlargement. I would like to clearly point out that Community aid must be applied pragmatically and that, in the first instance, accountability must be given to the energy sector itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He took the views of the shadow rapporteurs into consideration back in the formulation stage in an exemplary manner and the levels of cooperation we have seen have been fruitful.</p>
<p class="contents">We must take account of the fact that in rather more than a year’s time there will be 10 new Member States in the European Union. Their concerns are also our concerns. The candidate countries must be included in programmes like the TEN-Energy programme as swiftly as possible. All candidate countries have huge problems with regard to their electricity transmission networks. In the Baltic countries there are no such networks as such. If and when Ignalina is closed, and whatever decisions are made concerning bituminous shale, the Baltic countries’ energy strategies cannot rely exclusively on Russia. What sort of timetable does the Commission have for including the new Member States in the trans-European networks?</p>
<p class="contents">I have given emphasis to the question of whether the EU should support the private sector. The basic philosophy here is that the energy sector must be one in which the market economy works unaided. Only in exceptional cases can public sector aid be granted to the private sector. The Commission’s contribution, which in the end is the European taxpayer’s money, must not be raised from 10% to 20%. Previously, aid was available only for studies in the planning stage. If the Commission’s new proposal is accepted, aid would also be granted for project development.</p>
<p class="contents">There is always the risk that project coordinators will increase their costs just to obtain as much aid from the Commission as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">It is good that the Commission will provide support for building trans-European networks. This programme and this amount of money, however, will have only a limited effect, and will not solve the problems of Europe’s energy infrastructure. The solution to the problem of bottlenecks is to be found in the Member States rather than in this EU programme. There have been a lot of problems when constructing power lines as a result of the way in which decisions have been made at local and regional level. Residents complain about electromagnetic radiation, the impact on the environment, blighted landscapes, and so on. It is for this reason that no solution has been found for the largest bottleneck in the European electricity networks, which is on the border between Spain and France.</p>
<p class="contents">Matters relating to technology must not be linked to this programme. We are now deciding on trans-European networks, without adopting a position on what technology is to be used in producing the energy transmitted through the network and what its source is. The supplementary role renewable energy sources play in basic production is a part of the European energy palette. In certain circumstances they serve as excellent local solutions. This report is about infrastructure, not energy production. The network and production must be kept separate.</p>
<p class="contents">As a separate issue I want to mention Amendment No 9. If this is meant to suggest that renewable energy sources will result in lower charges for the consumer, that is not true. All the research shows that nuclear power is the cheapest option for the consumer of all forms of energy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is proposing an electricity interconnection capacity of at least 10% as a European minimum level. The level of interconnection is already 20% in some countries, however. The Commission should set its targets higher and insist on a level of 20% for all Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rapkay (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by making a point of thanking Mr Beysen. It is unlike me to start a speech by congratulating the rapporteur, because I think that is what we are here for and we generally make a good job of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, however, that Mr Beysen deserves special praise for his hard work in contacting the other groups right from the start, in order to ensure the report was as unanimous as possible before it was tabled in plenary. And he has succeeded admirably. So thank you for involving us from the outset. As a result, my group feels there is no need to table any amendments because, in my opinion, what Mr Beysen has done is fine as it is.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to just comment briefly on three political points that are important to me. First, as the Commissioner made clear, this decision comes under the general heading of the liberalisation of the energy market; in other words, it contributes to what is already on the Council's agenda. And when it comes to the overall package to open up the energy market, let there be no mistake, we have handed our homework in on time. We adopted our first reading here in plenary on 13 March, after the Council urged us to get a move on. The Commission did likewise; it too has done its homework, unlike the Council. The Council is doing what it always does, what it does best – nothing at all. It sits and talks and fails to come to any decision. That amounts to institutionalised indecisiveness, and that is why we need to say at this juncture: this is an overall package and we want results so that we can move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I really do think the Commission was right in this context to suggest – and our resolution should reflect this – that strategically important projects in the trans-European energy network sector should be given top priority. By which we mean projects which are vital for security of supply, strategically important projects which are important in opening up the market, especially those relating to one part of this package I referred to, namely the regulation on which Mr Mombaur acted as rapporteur. It is a pity he is not here today; I think he too would have had a few comments to make here.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, unlike traffic networks, the industry and companies involved in the energy networks generally make real money. They make money! And that means that it is primarily up to the industry to finance these projects. It is our job as legislator to support this by putting framework conditions in place, which brings me back to the fact that the Council needs to wrap things up. So that is how we want to go about this, by cofinancing support but with the companies in the front row when it comes to putting money in the kitty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has raised some important points, and our group supports his approach. The Commission is proposing that financial support for the trans-European networks must be stepped up. This is to be supported in order to foster the internal market in electricity and gas. As has been said here, it is also important to connect the new Member States to the internal market in energy. This point of view is also contained in the report adopted by Parliament on cross-border exchanges in electricity.</p>
<p class="contents">It has also already been said here that the main responsibility for constructing and maintaining adequate energy networks lies with EU industry and business. In this sense the energy networks differ from the trans-European networks, which receive large amounts of public money. Network operators, however, have no interest in removing bottlenecks in the supply to their neighbours. For that reason, state intervention and EU aid to promote competition is well justified. Naturally we also have to see that aid does not distort competition and that it is used for the right purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">Concentrating EU aid on priority projects will encourage the removal of bottlenecks and boost competition, giving consumers greater choice. In this way Europe’s own energy resources will be put to more effective use and the European economy will be given a boost.</p>
<p class="contents">In developing the trans-European energy networks, account must also be taken of social and economic rapprochement. We also have to ensure networks are developed in island, peripheral and remote regions. If necessary we must provide support for connecting the networks in these regions to other networks. Following on from Union decisions, we also have to encourage the diversification of forms of energy and increase the use of renewable energy sources. We have to ensure that decentralised renewable energy can access the network at a reasonable cost.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent massive storm damage was a reminder that we must insist on companies and industry being sufficiently prepared to repair damage speedily and restore networks in all regions of the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Security of supply is a prerequisite for the political independence of our countries and of Europe. This security requires a diversification of energy sources and will involve major long term, not to say extremely long-term investment. Energy is, furthermore, an important factor in land-use planning and falls entirely within the field of public services in the truest sense of the word. I would add that we must always bear in mind that when we talk about energy and about transport networks that, whereas new infrastructures must be created, existing infrastructures must also be reorganised in order to make better use of them. Lastly, there must be – and I wish to express this forcefully – an obsession with the environment in all its dimensions: the visual dimension, pollution, and the despoliation of resources, not forgetting the issue of waste.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, with regard to the report by Mr Beysen, whom I congratulate on his work, I can state my broad agreement with the proposals that have been made. We must in fact improve and extend the energy transport networks and, by means of studies and investment, support the implementation of the least profitable ones where they are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The internal market in energy is necessary but what it needs more than deregulation is investment throughout the Union, especially in the least accessible and least densely populated regions. No one would deny that the interlinking of networks is necessary. Let us not forget, however, that we need energy to put into these networks and a number of conditions must be met if we are to achieve that.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to confirm the importance to us of renewable energies, of research in this field and of the public investment needed for its development. I must also admit that I do not fully understand the connection that some people wish to make between this aim of developing renewable energies and a liberal approach that often leads to a quest for the lowest cost in the short term, without worrying about the consequences in the medium and long term.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, whilst remaining critical of the liberal principles that I believe are dangerous for Europe’s energy independence and for small consumers, not forgetting the least-favoured regions, I believe that the Commission guidelines on the Trans-European Networks are a step in the right direction and, as they stand, I thank you for them, Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no academic evidence for this. What do we have to do if we want to reduce oligopolistic tendencies in the European market? Firstly, we must reduce market dominance. We need to bring in measures such as divestiture in those countries where there are dominant operators. Secondly, we must increase centralised electricity production, because that is the only way to make the sector more competitive in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">Independent research shows that there is no economic rationale for spending billions on a new electricity grid. I have with me some summaries of these studies and I will hand them over to the Commissioner. So what should we do with the public funds available to us? We should spend them on gas pipelines, because that will bring more competition and security of supply. We should spend money on offshore projects in the North Sea and the Baltic.</p>
<p class="contents">Historically, this market and the grid which exists in Europe were set up to promote centralised fossil fuel and nuclear power plants. If we want fair competition, we have to use some public money to provide a level playing field for offshore projects. We have enormous potential for this.</p>
<p class="contents">This should not be a Christmas gift shop. If you look at the annexes to the report, this is a Christmas gift shop with all the electricity lines any operator ever wanted to build in Europe. This is not a good use of European public funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It raises a number of issues which relate to the region I represent, Sardinia, but which also concern all the islands in the Community and, therefore, around 15 million citizens dispersed throughout all the seas of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The general framework governing the trans-European networks described in this proposal includes, of course, the desire and the intention to help the underdeveloped regions. The amendment I have tabled equates the situation of the islands to that of the less-developed regions, for energy is one of the sectors in which islands are at a greater disadvantage: there is not one island on our continent that does not have an energy problem in terms of cost, quantity, capacity for progress and economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">Some practical measures have been taken, for an important project has been included in the list of projects of common interest which concerns two islands in the Community – Sardinia and Corsica – specifically, the gas pipeline which will convey a considerable amount of methane gas from Algeria to Italy, France and southern Germany. It has been included among the projects of common interest but not yet among the priority<span class="bold"> </span>projects.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that, if the European Parliament adopts my amendment, a further boost will be given to this project whose implementation is awaited by a significant part of Europe, and, if possible, to other projects, which will then be practically implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is about a logistics system in the European Union that we are trying to build. It appears that electricity consumption will continue to grow over the next 20 years but that the rate of growth will fall off or slow down. At the same time the production of electricity and other forms of energy will go down in relation to consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Nordic countries have opened up our electricity markets. For example, in my own country, Finland, households have been able to choose their electricity supplier for many years now. This practice has worked well in the Nordic countries, and even Norway, a country outside the European Union, participates.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of renewable sources is increasing in our logistics system and limiting carbon dioxide emissions has also become a key issue. Natural gas is also growing in importance.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be on our guard against the emergence of monopolies and reliance on just one supplier, which would cause huge problems. Let us just recall how things went for Enron or how things are still going for a certain large company in Great Britain. Where are the largest and nearest energy resources from the Union’s point of view? They are in Russia. Now while the relevant Commissioner is listening attentively over there I would propose that, at the next summit between the European Union and Russia, an attempt at some sort of concrete agreement is made on energy, both gas and electrical energy, because we are very interested in both and we will be dependent on Russia for gas within 20 years or so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No one would be, of course, if it were truly a matter of meeting the needs of the people. The real issue, however – as the report makes quite clear – is to make the construction and the maintenance of infrastructures in the field of energy subject to the laws of the market. In order to establish a more open and competitive internal market for energy, public funds supplementing private funds will rise from 10% to 20% of total investment. Members from the <span class="italic">Lutte ouvrière</span> are opposed to the use of public monies to increase private profits.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides which, the aim of increasing interconnection between gas and electricity networks is not to rationalise energy distribution at EU scale, but instead to open up the entire gas and electricity market to competition. What this means, where France, for example, is concerned, is another step closer to the privatisation of <span class="italic">Électricité</span> and <span class="italic">Gaz de France</span>, a process that we reject entirely. We reject it, as do the tens of thousands of workers who demonstrated on 3 October in Paris for <span class="italic">Électricité</span> and <span class="italic">Gaz de France</span> to remain public services. We also oppose any attack on salaries or on the pensions of workers in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The various States or the European Community itself must be able to fund an energy transport network which is fit for the twenty-first century, whose management criteria are not profitability or the quest for profit for a few but which are to meet the energy needs of everyone and equal access for everyone. We do not think, however, think that by allowing themselves to be guided by private interests, the current European institutions will achieve this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
