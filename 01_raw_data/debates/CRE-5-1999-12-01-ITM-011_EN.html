<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Breyer (Greens/ALE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, this directive is the second daughter directive within the framework of the directive on ambient air quality assessment and management and the proposal is part of an integrated raft of measures aimed at combating air pollution. I think we all agree that the people of Europe should be able to breathe cleaner air and indeed the latest publication by the European Environment Agency states that the level of air pollution in most cities poses a threat to health and that almost 40 million people in the 115 largest European cities are exposed to at least one pollutant which exceeds the WHO air quality guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite political initiatives aimed at reducing pollution and improving air quality, it is assumed that passenger transport needs will increase drastically over the next ten years and that the number of vehicles will increase by 25%, increasing air pollution still further. In a report this year, the WHO comes to the conclusion that air pollution caused by traffic kills even more people than car accidents and that the economic costs are high. It is therefore important to reduce the level of air pollution, to limit the consequences for particularly vulnerable groups and to ease the burden on the health systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The important point about this second daughter directive is that it is the first time that a limit value has been set for benzene and carbon monoxide in the EU. This is an important step, I would even go so far as to say that it is a milestone in air quality legislation now that, for the first time, a limit value has been set for benzene, a carcinogenic substance which can cause leukaemia. We know that petrol and oil are sources of benzene and 80% to 85% of the benzene in the European Union comes from the combustion of petrol by road traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">Until now there has been no threshold value as far as health risks are concerned and therefore no level of benzene is free of risk. The precautionary principle in the EC Treaty makes a limit value with an extremely low risk of illness compulsory, however. The Commission has proposed an annual limit value of 5 micrograms per cubic metre of air for benzene, to be attained by 2010. This is fully endorsed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. However, the Committee on the Environment does not support the Commission’s intention to give <span class="italic">carte blanche</span> in the form of unlimited derogations by proposing that, in the event of so-called socio-economic problems, countries may apply for a transition period of five years, which can then be extended for a further five years. The Committee on the Environment expects the directive to be properly implemented and proposes that no more than one five-year derogation should be allowed, during which a ten microgram limit must be observed.</p>
<p class="contents">Other amendments have been tabled in plenary, coupling this derogation to other conditions in order to ensure – and this must be made quite clear – that these regulations are not a loophole for non-transposition of the directive. The Committee on the Environment therefore makes it quite clear that it cannot be assumed that a twin-track environmental policy will be operated. I think that it is extremely important, also in view of enlargement, that we set a good example and do not send out the wrong signal to applicant countries. The Committee on the Environment would therefore like to make it clear in its proposal, which is more precise and more strict as far as derogations are concerned, that there can be no question of a twin-track environmental policy and that the aim must be to achieve a high level of protection for everyone in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee also proposes that the public should be better informed in future and that the proposed measures should be extended still further by other measures. I think that if we can manage to get the Commission to support the Committee’s proposals, then we will have reached a real milestone on the way to better air quality and we will have helped considerably to make it clear that carcinogenic substances have lost in the environmental stakes. We want to improve the air quality in Europe, thereby making a major contribution to health protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The air quality framework directive is implemented by issuing daughter directives on a series of air pollutants. This is the second such daughter directive and it relates to the limit values for benzene and carbon monoxide in the air and the corresponding control and information requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of our proposed amendments is not only to stipulate strict environmental protection requirements but to format these requirements so that they can be transposed and complied with by all Member States. In order to achieve this objective, certain compromises need to be made, especially with regard to our southern Member States. From this point of view, the specifications of the European Commission and the extensive amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection are very demanding. The Finnish Presidency is making a serious effort to make use of the new legal possibilities afforded by the Amsterdam Treaty and to bring this proposal into force after the first reading with the amendments of the European Parliament. We all know how urgent the problem of reducing air pollution is, also with respect to climatic change.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Breyer has already pointed out, the real aim is to improve health protection for our citizens. On these grounds, I welcome the plan of the Finnish Presidency. But that also means that we in the European Parliament must responsibly create the right conditions. It is precisely for this reason that I am unable to agree with certain proposed amendments adopted by a majority in the Committee on the Environment and tabled mainly by Mrs Breyer and her group, because some are superfluous and do not help to improve the text while others have no place in this proposal for a directive because they do not concern the scope of the proposed directive. It is for this reason that we reject a series of proposed amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">My proposed amendment of Article 3(2) was adopted by a large majority in committee. In consultations with advisers, our rapporteur, Mrs Breyer, and experts, we again supplemented and tightened up this amendment. This is proposed amendment 22, which I would ask you all to support. I would like to thank Mrs Breyer. She was at pains to find a consensus and it was not easy, but I think that if we confine ourselves to the basic proposed amendments which improve the Commission proposal, and this refers mainly to Amendment Nos 1, 5, 7, 10, 11, 15, 16 and 22, it should be possible to pass this important directive quickly. I imagine, hope and expect that, in its reply, the Commission will support this directive and really pave the way for it to be implemented as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I particularly welcome the fact that provisions are geared at several points in the report to particularly vulnerable groups of people and the extensive duty to provide information. The second daughter directive within the framework of improving air quality in Europe must, of course, like previous directives, meet the following objectives, namely to define and stipulate air quality objectives at European level and to create air quality assessment criteria based on standard methods. Care must be taken to ensure that useful information on air quality is available and provided to the public. The objective – and I think that this is the fundamental objective – is to maintain and improve air quality.</p>
<p class="contents">If this directive is transposed consistently and quickly, I think that we really will be one step closer to this objective. Of the two air pollutants in the report, you will certainly have noticed that there is less discussion of carbon monoxide. The proposed limit value of 10 micrograms/m3 over a period of eight hours, which tallies with the WHO guideline, is accepted by all parties. This acceptance no longer applies to benzene, as you will have gathered from the previous comments. I think that it is hugely important that, for the first time, we have an EU-wide limit value for a carcinogenic substance and it is precisely because of the high health risk, i.e. the cancer risk, and because of the precedent which it will set for other as yet unregulated carcinogenic substances, that it is important for the limit value set in this directive to be transposed into practice as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">My group therefore supports the Commission proposal, i.e. 5 micrograms/m3. As far as the content is concerned, we support working towards a future reduction of this limit value, but we feel that a realistic objective will result in faster implementation at this point in time. The real political priority as far as I am concerned is to comply with limit values in all areas, including so-called hotspots, and we must avoid overly generous derogations which will provide a loophole for non-compliance with the limit values for benzene. Regional and local agencies must be involved in finding a solution so that air quality can be improved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One is the place that I read about in our national newspapers. Some of them, at least, feed their readers a diet of lies and half-truths to whip up hatred of all things European. And the other is here; the place which actually exists, where I find myself working amongst colleagues and others trying to make this continent a better place for its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">This draft directive belongs to the second of these two worlds. Its simple aim is to cut pollution and improve the air we breathe, which circulates from one country to another without respect to national boundaries. Who can be against that?</p>
<p class="contents">The public information insisted upon in the draft directive is vital and gives the opportunity to back up legal measures with the right of the public to name and shame those governments which fail to take the necessary measures to comply with this directive. And, if we fail to achieve the targets for reducing benzene and carbon monoxide emissions, it will not be the fault of industry. They have done their part through technological change. It will be the fault of governments for not having the political courage to curb the use of cars in our cities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Liberal Democrats welcome this measure. I anticipate us supporting all the amendments which have been tabled.

We hope that this will be taken up by the Commission so that ambitious measures for fighting pollution can be quickly established. We know that benzene causes leukaemia and that the incidence of leukaemia among children is increasing. We also know that road transport causes considerable air pollution and, in particular, that this type of transport is unfortunately on the increase rather than on the decline. This directive has therefore been long-awaited and must be a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we support this report, we have sponsored some amendments, two of which I must defend more particularly. The first is Amendment No 17 in which we ask for the removal of the derogation which, in our opinion, deprives the text of its substance and which can only delay the application of the directive. This is the main weakness of this directive. Also, in Amendment No 20, we suggest that the Commission lowers the benzene emission limit from five micrograms per cubic metre, as proposed by the Commission, to four micrograms per cubic metre. This threshold must be lowered in consideration of the toxicity of benzene. We are, of course, still a long way, perhaps a very long way, from the precautionary principle which should be guiding our policies, but I accept that this is progress and it is a start. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore support a daughter directive being drawn up concerning the substances carbon monoxide and benzene. Given the high toxicity of benzene, there is a direct link between air quality and public health. The proposed standards are ambitious: a 70% reduction in benzene emissions and a 30% reduction in CO emissions. It is hoped that these objectives, as well as the first daughter directive for air quality, can be achieved. Huge efforts will be required in the process. </p>
<p class="contents">Combustion processes in both industry and transport will need to run their course in order to restrict the emission of carbon monoxide. At power stations, waste incineration plants, cement furnaces and in cars, there are ways of reducing the emission of carbon monoxide. In the case of forest fires, however, very little can be done. Preventing forest fires and other uncontrolled combustion processes could, therefore, make up a large component in the policy when this directive is transposed. </p>
<p class="contents">In order to prevent the emission of benzene, the use of car fuels, among other things, will need to be handled with care. I do wonder therefore if the standard for petrol stations will be met. If no measurements are taken at petrol stations, no action will be taken. If measurements are taken, on the other hand, it is highly improbable that the standard for benzene will be met. Therefore, Commissioner, I would urge the European Commission to study the section on measurements more closely. Representative measurement is necessary here, otherwise air quality will not improve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, this directive must be generally welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">Air sampling must be organised to give an accurate assessment of annual personal exposure levels, and I am concerned that some amendments that call for roadside inlets would give a distorted picture of the problem. Individuals are not exposed to kerb side concentrations continuously. It is the building line which is important and that may be more than five metres from the kerb.</p>
<p class="contents">The unqualified derogation for benzene levels, referred to by Mrs Breyer for socio-economic reasons, at first seems bizarre. One would have thought that communities living in our disadvantaged areas, with all their associated health problems, would be those most in need of cleaner air. However, if this regulation were to result in the closure of a major industry in that area, the results would be counter-productive and would exacerbate the social and economic problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Although petrol engines are the primary source of benzene, metallurgical coke-works are also implicated. If the most stringent aspects proposed are implemented, this part of the steel-making industry could be forced abroad, probably to eastern Europe, which brings me to my last point.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal does not specifically address the problems of air pollution in applicant countries; and I think it is irresponsible, given the eminent enlargement, for Parliament not to be given any information regarding pollution levels in countries like Poland and the Czech Republic; and the likely cost and time scale involved in bringing them up to exacting new standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Could I suggest, Mrs Wallström, that in future, when environment legislation like this is considered, the full implications regarding applicant countries be taken into account and publicised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, I must stress the positive effect of her public health proposals. The Commission’s proposal, supported and furthered by this report, establishes the principle of ambient air quality assessment and management with regard to two major sources of pollution: benzene and carbon monoxide. These are both produced by road traffic. It has rightly been emphasised that benzene is a carcinogen which causes leukaemia and that carbon monoxide can lead to toxic lesions on the heart and brain, and even to death in high concentrations.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not make people’s fears worse but we must ourselves realise and make others realise the dangers of not adopting realistic and necessarily stringent measures. These must allow as little derogation as possible so that we can assess, control and restrict to the minimum polluting emissions of these two noxious gases. This is even more vital as these gases are more dangerous for children, the elderly and anyone suffering from heart or respiratory problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Breyer report is of great interest to the consumers which we all are. Although the initial aim was to ensure that the public has easy access to up-to-date information, the rapporteur has gone further by specifying not only the frequency with which information must be made available, but also the range of media to be used in distributing this information. This is not unimportant.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of Europe are entitled to know about the quality of the environment in which they are living. They must be able to judge the measures taken by the competent national or local authorities to provide the scientists with quantified data so that the air which they breathe can be improved. These measures constitute a strong political signal about the political choices made on transport.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore invite you all to support the rapporteur without hesitation. Her proposals are both ambitious and realistic and clearly show the Council how demanding the European Parliament can be on the environment, public health and consumer protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking the Environment Committee and in particular, of course, the rapporteur, Mrs Breyer, for her valuable report. Thank you also for your valuable input into this discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal before us is the second that the Commission brings forward under the Framework Directive 96/62 on air quality assessment and management. It will set new limit values. These limit values are based on the latest advice from the World Health Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many areas in which the Commission can agree with the constructive amendments proposed by the Committee. We accept amendments that bring this proposal into line with the final position on the first air quality daughter directive, 1999/30, which was adopted in April this year. We, therefore, accept Amendments Nos 1 and 6.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the Environment Committee's view that the most critical area for discussion is the limit value for benzene and the timetables for meeting it. Benzene is difficult since there is no identifiable threshold for effects. The Commission can, in principle, accept Amendment No 2, which makes this clear. We suggest a slight rewording in line with standard terminology; that is: "Whereas benzene is a human genotoxic carcinogen and there is no identifiable threshold below which there is no risk to human health;"</p>
<p class="contents">Where the limit value is concerned, the Commission believes that its proposal for an annual average concentration of 5 micrograms per cubit metre is well balanced. It will provide a high level of protection, but should be generally achievable throughout the Union over the next ten years. The Commission can therefore not accept the part of Amendment No 20 that would set a limit value of 4 micrograms per cubic metre. However, it is clear that limit values for carcinogens must be kept under constant review.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will report on benzene as part of a new integrated clean air programme in 2004. As the proposal makes clear, we will then consider whether to propose a new limit value for the longer term. Although the Commission considers that its proposal is generally achievable by 2010, there are some uncertainties. This is largely due to the fact that at present there is no limit value for benzene and no consistent monitoring across the Union. It is, however, clear that the ease with which problems can be tackled depend to some extent on climate. The Commission has, therefore, asked Parliament and Council in Article 3(2) whether this should be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Having listened to the debates so far, the Commission feels that Member States should be able to request longer time scales for meeting the limit value for benzene, where the 2010 deadline would cause serious socio-economic problems. It does, therefore, not accept Amendment No 17 nor the remaining part of Amendment No 20. We do agree, however, that conditions for obtaining a derogation should be made more clear and be tightened. On balance, the Commission now considers that it may be feasible to limit extensions to a maximum of five years. It therefore accepts most of Amendment No 22, which we prefer to Amendment No 5. It does not, however, feel that it can support a temporary limit value of 10 micrograms per cubit metre without information on feasibility. The Commission cannot accept that part of Amendment No 22. Amendment No 11 is partly related to Amendment No 22, and the Commission accepts it in part. The Commission does not accept the part of Amendment No 11 which would insert a requirement that a more stringent limit value for benzene should be proposed in 2004. The proposal already makes clear that the aim of the review will be to look at the latest evidence and, if necessary, to improve protection still further. We should leave such decisions open until we have all the evidence in front of us.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept Amendment No 10 which points out the importance of looking at effects on sensitive populations. The Commission agrees with the Environment Committee that indoor conditions have significant effects on health, but we do not think this proposal is the vehicle for considering how to tackle this issue. The subject is much wider than benzene and carbon monoxide and needs, therefore, to be looked at in a wider framework. From a technical point of view, Directive 96/62 defines ambient air as 'outdoor air' only. The Commission cannot therefore accept Amendments Nos 3 and 12 nor the partly related Amendment No 18. Indoor air, as I also know that Mrs Breyer is engaged in this issue, could be taken up within the framework of a new environmental action programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Providing good up-to-date information to the public is the key element of the new framework for improving air quality. The Commission can accept that part of Amendment No 7 which would add to the list of means that Member States might use to inform the public about air quality. It does not, however, accept that part of the amendment that would require Member States to make lists of organisations that get information and send them to the Commission. It was decided during discussions of the first daughter directive that such lists would be too bureaucratic and could even be misleading. The Commission accepts Amendment No 8, which requires better public information on carbon monoxide as an improvement to its proposal. It can also agree in part with Amendment No 9. Annex 6, part two, deals with data on pollution levels. This should actively be made available to the public in line with the Aarhus Convention. The documentation referred to in Annex 4, part three, is, however, highly technical and potentially voluminous. It should be available on request but should not be actively disseminated.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees with the rapporteur that Member States should take particular care to provide information to the public in any area with extended timetables for meeting the limit value of benzene. We can, therefore, accept Amendment No 19 in principal. We would propose adding to Article 6(2): "Member States should pay particular attention to providing information on concentrations, plans and programmes to the public in areas referred to in Article 3(2)". The Commission can also accept Amendment No 4 in principle. We suggest, however, replacing the words 'measured data' by the word 'concentrations'. This shows that information must be forwarded whether it was obtained by measurement or by some other method.</p>
<p class="contents">A third objective of both the Air Quality Framework Directive and this proposal is to ensure that Member States assess air quality in a consistent and comparable way. The Commission does not, however, accept Amendment No 13. There are technical problems with the amendment as drafted, and it is unnecessary. Member States will have to inform the Commission about measurement methods, numbers and locations of measurement stations every year. This is already stated under the general reporting requirements of Directive 96/62 and the related Council Decision 97/101 on a reciprocal exchange of information on air quality.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also does not accept Amendment No 14. It is not compatible with decisions of the first air quality daughter directive. General technical advice is that for annual average limit values, measuring close to the building line better reflects the exposure of the population. The Commission can accept Amendment No 15 in part. It considers that this proposal should be brought into line with Directive 1999/30 by inserting the words 'where there is more than one measurement station within the zone or agglomeration at least one should be placed close to traffic and at least one should be oriented to the urban background'. It thinks, however, that the additional requirement that at least half the stations should be traffic-oriented is over-prescriptive.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission agrees with the intention of Amendment Nos 16 and 21. Directive 96/62 allows the use of random measurement if it can be shown to be sufficiently accurate. These amendments seek to say what that means for benzene. Amendment No 16 follow closely the first daughter directive. The Commission considers, however, that in the case of the annual average limit value for benzene, it is possible to demand a higher standard of accuracy equal to that set for continuous monitoring. It can, therefore, accept Amendment No 21 in preference to Amendment No 16.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall close by saying that I hope it will be possible to reach a rapid agreement on this proposal. At present, there are no Community limit values for benzene or carbon monoxide. It is essential to get this legislation in place so that proper monitoring can start, and Member States can identify the problem areas. This is a crucial factor to assure that public health is properly protected throughout the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">A final word to Mr Goodwill on enlargement, because you really have a point there. At the moment, it is difficult to have good information on these matters and good measurement from the applicant countries. We have to follow this very closely. We already work together with the applicant countries and we have done screening reports as you already know. So we have to do a great deal of work together with the applicant countries and you have an important point. This should be added to our list of work that we have to pursue from now on. So, thank you for that; and thank you for the discussion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
