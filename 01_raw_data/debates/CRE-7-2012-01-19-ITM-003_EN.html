In doing so, it sent a clear message to the European Commission that it should restore the balance of power between farmers, on the one hand, and the processing and distribution industries, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">The report that I am presenting to you today finalises the work that we have done by analysing the upstream farming sector. Farmers sell their products but they also buy or use numerous inputs, notably fertiliser, seeds and fuel. These inputs are generally sold to them by large multinationals that operate in an extremely concentrated environment that is lacking both transparency and competition. Farmers also need land and water to work.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, the bills that farmers have to pay are rocketing while, at the same time, the prices at which they are selling their products are stagnating or even falling in certain cases. They are caught between a rock and a hard place.</p>
<p class="contents">The report that I am presenting to you today proposes concrete solutions to improve the economic situation of agricultural holdings and farmers’ incomes. Farmers must be supported through new agricultural development structures that will enable them to cope with future challenges, be they environmental, such as global warming, or economic, such as market booms, caused largely by speculation.</p>
<p class="contents">The measures envisaged by the CAP reform, proposed by the Commission and currently under discussion in Parliament, may, if applied effectively by the Member States, improve soil conservation, maintain agricultural biodiversity, and reduce soil and groundwater pollution. This agronomic development will reduce the quantities of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides used. At the same time, farmers will be able to retain a greater share of the added value generated by their work. This will have several consequences. It will help to consolidate farmers’ revenues, contribute to Europe’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce the pollution of our water resources.</p>
<p class="contents">European agriculture uses more energy than it produces. Without oil, we would be unable to feed ourselves. What a paradox! Between 2000 and 2010, the price of fossil fuels rose by more than 60%, yet farmers are unable to reflect that increase in the prices of their products.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to see considerable investment by the European Union in energy-saving projects. They should be based on several proposals: improving farming practices, by making them more autonomous, reducing transport between producers and consumers, by promoting the establishment of short marketing channels and the consumption of seasonal, local produce, strengthening autonomous energy production on farms, and restoring the balance between animal and plant production for coherent production areas, by encouraging agronomic practices such as crop rotation and grass-fed production.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the cost of fertiliser doubled in the same 10-year period, while the prices paid to farmers only rose by 25%. There are some efficient agronomic practices, however, notably crop rotation, which significantly reduce usage of these products and, in turn, result in a considerable reduction in both leaching, which pollutes groundwater, and nitrous oxide emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">Better crop techniques also lead to a decrease in the use of pesticides and herbicides by reducing the pressure from parasites and weeds. Wastewater and collected water are also a potential source of fertiliser, as long as adequate measures are taken to ensure the effective removal of potentially dangerous substances.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the dependence of the European Union and farmers is not limited to oil and phosphates. Every year, we import 50 million tonnes of animal feed. These purchases on the global markets amount to USD 20 billion and this has a serious impact on our trade balance. We need to reduce our dependence by 70% by launching a far-reaching European programme for the production of plant protein: soya, lupins, broad beans, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">The 30% average increase in seed prices since 2000 also affects farmers’ incomes. This increase is due to the rising cost of certified seeds, which are sold by an ever-smaller number of large multinationals. However, it is also linked to the measures taken by a number of Member States to restrict the use of farm-saved seeds, which cost 40% less and which are produced and used by the farmers themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Farmers are also affected by the cost of buying land and the cost of leasing land, which have soared in recent years. These phenomena are primarily due to urban sprawl, the monopolising of land for the production of biofuels and the race to expand, linked to the changes in the CAP.</p>
<p class="contents">The report calls for the introduction of a system to monitor land prices and appropriate measures to facilitate access to land for young people and those who wish to farm.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, irrigation is essential in many parts of the European Union where the effects of global warming are already being felt. Concrete measures must be put in place as soon as possible to save and preserve this resource.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is thus very clearly part of the Europe 2020 strategy drawn up at the start of the parliamentary term and aims to offer a positive perspective for the European project in the light of the crises we are facing.</p>
<p class="contents">Farming is the EU’s largest integrated policy. We must not let the farmers fall by the wayside now. There can be no Europe without farmers! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also thank all the political groups that have supported this oral question and worked determinedly on drafting the final text of this resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution is in response to the expectations of farmers, which have been put off for a long time, of reversing the growing imbalances in the food supply chain, in terms of both negotiating power between the parties and of income distribution. This has been provoked by the high concentration of Europe’s largest retailers and threatens the survival of farmers and suppliers in general, severely damaging the agricultural economy and rural societies.</p>
<p class="contents">The means proposed to this end are unequivocal identification of the bad practices in the food supply chain, support for its self-regulation through joint action by all stakeholders, demand for adequate legislation by the European Commission, not forgetting the commitment needed from Member States in this area, supervision and penalties. The Union legislation needed should take into account previous decisions of the European Parliament, both those that were implemented and those that have not been realised, to which will be added the responses considered here to be suited to the present situation as regards contractual relationships between producers, suppliers and retailers.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution is not being set up against any of the partners in the food supply chain, but to give them closer relations and implement dialogue, so everyone’s contribution is required. This resolution is being set up against the unfair and abusive practices that have started to become established and is intended to introduce appropriate EU and national legislation, where necessary, without distorting the smooth running of the markets. As such, it is hoped it will encourage producers to have greater capacity for organising amongst themselves, and retailers to abandon dominating practices, such as the unilateral imposition of contractual conditions or practices relating to discounts, without increasing the price to the consumer but rather contributing to their having a real choice that is wider and of higher quality.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now awaiting the required initiative from the European Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The figures speak for themselves. According to Eurostat, production costs have gone up 40% over the last decade, whilst prices have not increased by more than 25%.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is not just upstream that farmers are being completely squeezed. Farmers downstream are also obliged to accept unimaginable prices, payment times and other contractual conditions, because of the disproportionate correlation of forces existing in the marketing chain.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall give the example of my own country, where the cooperative sector has little importance. Around 65% of sales of food products are concentrated in the hands of the five largest companies, with the figures much higher for some sectors, such as milk. Just last week, in my country, the authorities learned that 400 000 litres of milk on the marketing chain were being sold at below cost price.</p>
<p class="contents">As political decision makers, we need to ensure that agriculture remains a viable activity in Europe, producing good-quality foodstuffs and raw materials at fair prices that provide a living for farmers. To this end, there is a need for a sound common agricultural policy, but also for fair competition, as mentioned in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to follow up urgently the recommendations and suggestions formulated in the resolutions we are discussing here today, and for concrete proposals to be tabled as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It raises some very topical issues. We are all well aware that the rising cost of inputs – most notably for feed, fuel and fertiliser – is putting major pressure on farmers and continues to squeeze their margins in an economic climate that is already difficult, especially for the intensive sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Specifically, the cost of feed has to be addressed; rising costs will force us to rethink our attitude, I believe, about soya imports from third countries and the problems associated with the protein deficit in the EU. I do not believe that domestic protein production can satisfy demand, especially if we wish to increase food production for reasons of food security. Moreover, rising food costs do not seem to result in higher farm gate prices and this has to be looked at for the benefit of both the consumer and the farmer. Large retailers must be prepared to cooperate with producers in order to ensure that the distribution of profits along the chain is equal and fair.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU imposes the strictest standards on animal welfare, environmental practices and food safety. I support the fact that the EU is the world leader in this regard, but I also think we have to find a balance between maintaining the highest standards and risking over-legislating our farmers out of business.</p>
<p class="contents">I fear the proposals from the Commission regarding the reform of the CAP go in that direction, especially in relation to greening and direct payments and the ridiculous set-aside proposal. With regard to the issue of imbalances in the food chain, it is clear that the power of retailers has grown to what some consider to be an unacceptable level. While there are some measures the EU can take, especially as regards transparency and profits in the chain, I think that farmers need to look at how they can organise themselves better and increase their bargaining power, whether through producer organisations or cooperatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have a further two minutes and I should like to use them all together now, if possible. I would therefore ask you to set the clock to zero.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, Commissioner, the problem of farmers’ incomes is getting more serious, particularly in the case of small and medium-sized farmers and family farms, of which there are significant numbers in many Member States. Consumer prices do not reflect the prices paid to farmers for their products. The unsustainable increase in the costs of factors of production – fuel, feed, fertilisers, plant-health products, etc. – is happening at the same time as a persistent decline in the prices of products.</p>
<p class="contents">The consequences are the abandonment of agriculture, the unstoppable closure of farms, the desertification of the countryside, the concentration of production in the hands of large producers, and production that is increasingly intensive and geared towards exports. Imbalances between the Member States are growing; the food deficits and food dependence of countries with weaker production systems are growing; the threats to food security and sovereignty are growing.</p>
<p class="contents">None of this is new. All this is well known, and the causes of this profoundly negative development are also well known: the lack of instruments for regulating agricultural production, of regulation of the markets; the immeasurably increasing power of the major retailers and their abuses; the deregulation and liberalisation of international trade; the application of World Trade Organisation rules to agriculture; and the entry of speculators into the foodstuffs market. In short, the agricultural and trade policies in force: the common agricultural policy, the common commercial policy, and the patterns on which the single market has been established and is being deepened in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Resolution of all these problems will not, therefore, be possible without profoundly changing these policies. There is a need for mechanisms regulating the food supply chain that defend producers – particularly small and medium-sized farmers, who promote employment in the countryside and bring it to life – and for reductions in food imports.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial to halt and reverse the present concentration of power in the hands of the major retailers and industry. There is a need for a decentralisation of the food supply chains, for support for and promotion of local production and consumption, for shorter food supply chains, and for local markets, including using innovative media like the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need for measures intended to put a stop to dumping between Member States, as is happening in the milk sector, for example. There is a need for fair distribution of value added throughout the food supply chain.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe consideration should be given to the establishment of ceilings for companies’ profit margins using the price paid to producers as a benchmark, particularly for large supermarkets and retailers, and to putting a permanent stop to self-regulation, which is nothing short of a myth. There is a need to create and operate national systems for monitoring and shaping prices and price changes in retailers and large supermarkets, whilst steadfastly combating the current practices of cartelisation and price manipulation.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need for a system of production quotas: a quota system adapted to the needs of each country and to its development in terms of production equipment, so as to enable the development of the Member States with higher deficits.</p>
<p class="contents">For reasons of environmental, economic and social sustainability, there is also a need to organise international trade in such a way that producers, products and countries complement each other, rather than competing, as currently happens. The vitality of the economic and social fabric in the primary sector is dependent on this, not just in Europe, but in other countries too, especially in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">These, amongst many others, were some of the proposals included in the resolution tabled by our group. Unfortunately, we cannot find many of them in the report or in the other resolutions. We therefore hope that some of these proposals may be adopted here today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Direct payments to farmers producing agricultural products in European Union Member States must not vary, with some being paid two, three or even four times as much as others, because it is precisely these differences that orchestrate the problems which will prevent us from ever achieving balance in the food supply chain. Food production and supply chain costs are increasing for various reasons, such as increasing plant health, animal welfare, environmental protection, hygiene and food safety requirements, which are all the same for all Member States. However, the different levels of payments in European Union Member States are marginalising food producers so much that fair competition is completely out of reach.</p>
<p class="contents">Attention must also be drawn to another important issue – large distribution companies currently dominate food markets, and prices paid to farmers in the food supply chain are constantly being cut. At the same time, production costs continue to rise. Farmers are not receiving sufficient income for their products, while big commercial monopolies are making huge profits at the farmers’ expense. Due to the significant variation between the price paid to farmers and the final price paid by consumers, as well as the lack of transparency, the difference in competitive conditions and, in some cases, abuse in the food supply chain, farming is becoming no longer viable and farmers’ survival is under threat. I believe that the primary task of the Commission and the Member States today is to guarantee that competition rules, which operate on principles of equality, are upheld throughout the upstream and downstream food market chain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The prices of the means of agricultural production, of input costs, have reached record levels in recent years, although they have not been matched by a corresponding rise in the output prices of agricultural products. Despite the fact that the real prices of inputs rose by almost 18% between 2005 and 2011, agricultural prices have risen more slowly. Farm revenues also fell by more than 10% in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis, and only returned to pre-crisis levels in 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">Volatility in basic agricultural commodity prices is also increasingly reflected in farm revenues, and has accentuated farmers’ loss of negotiating power in the food supply chain. Farmers therefore have to deal with a growing number of difficulties relating to the rise in input costs, as well as to improving their environmental and agronomic efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">What is AGRI doing to help farmers deal with these difficulties? Our work has concentrated on these problems, which are dealt with, on the one hand, within the framework of the proposals for reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP) presented in October, and, on the other, in the High-Level Forum for a better functioning of the food supply chain that we launched a year ago with Mr Cioloş, Mr Dalli and Mr Barnier.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent proposal for the CAP reform after 2013 introduces innovations aiming to increase cooperation between farmers and to clarify the scope of competition rules. The proposals also aim to facilitate the creation of producers’ organisations and associations, as well as of inter-professional organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The mandatory recognition of producer organisations is a key element of the European Union. The Commission’s proposals also include cofinancing for their creation in all Member States, regardless of the type of farming, through the second pillar of rural development.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, economies of scale will help sales by increasing the number of distribution channels and reducing risks and this, in turn, will also foster a better division of added value within the supply chain. Furthermore, our proposal with regard to contractual relations in the dairy industry aims to strengthen the position of dairy producers.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of crop diversity, which was raised in the report, is also dealt with in the proposal for reform of the CAP as part of the commitment to help the environment. The European Innovation Partnership for agricultural productivity and sustainability and awards for innovative local cooperation in rural areas will help to promote innovative measures throughout the food supply chain. The partnership could include projects for rationalising the use of resources, precision agriculture and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">The CAP reform will also involve boosting the agricultural consultancy system, which will bring about better exchange of good practices and information campaigns targeting farmers and consumers. Another important topic is seeds, and an action plan is currently being developed as a follow-up to the legislation assessment carried out in 2010-2011 on the sale of seeds and reproduction materials. Adoption of a Commission proposal is scheduled for the third quarter of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also refers to land prices and land rent as raised by Mr Bové in his speech. The writers of a study in 2010 attempted to identify the ratio between land prices and direct payments. The Commission is ready to carry out other studies that will give a better idea of the impact of farm rents and leases on agriculture input costs.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point I would like to discuss, also in response to the point raised by Mr Bové in his speech, before moving on to the other issues more closely linked to imbalances in the food supply chain, concerns energy and water. Improving the way enterprises use water is a win-win situation for all those involved. As well as allowing farmers to reduce their costs, it has a positive impact on the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The second pillar of the CAP includes mechanisms for promoting the production of renewable energies inside and outside farms located in rural areas, the transformation of agricultural and forest biomass, and investments in rationalising the use of resources also as a means of saving energy. The measures provided for in this second pillar also offer many possibilities for optimising the management of water resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, the imbalances and abuses in the food supply chain are currently further aggravated by price volatility, a problem raised by the three oral questions which are subjects the Commission is focusing on in particular. Unfair commercial practices between companies can take place at all levels of the food supply chain. They are a threat to farmers, to small and medium-sized enterprises and their employees, and often also to consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, what measures should we adopt? Until today, at European level, unfair commercial practices have mainly been tackled in the context of the relations between companies and consumers. As far as relations between companies are concerned, the EU has adopted measures against contractual terms and conditions and commercial practices that are clearly unfair due to delays in payments. The directive should become effective before the end of March 2013, but I recently wrote to all the ministers involved to invite them to anticipate the entry into force of this law, which is a practical application of the ‘Small Business Act’. We estimate, in fact, that this directive will help to inject around EUR 180 billion into the market.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a directive on misleading and comparative advertising, which aims to guarantee proper practices and sets rules for the authorisation of comparative advertising. Along with the communication ‘Towards a Single Market Act’, the report on monitoring distribution, and following on from this Parliament’s own-initiative report adopted last July on a more efficient, fairer retail market – the Corazza Bildt report – the Commission has also scheduled the adoption of a communication on unfair commercial practices this year.</p>
<p class="contents">This text should clearly define the scope and breadth of the problem in retail sales and underline the fragmentary nature of national rules and their application. Madam President, I am sorry if my speech has been longer than expected, but there have been so many questions and they have been so complex; I will be much briefer in my response.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also consulted the interested parties to find out what their perception is in the ‘European Business Test Panel’, and is currently analysing the responses it received. Once we have evaluated the data we have collected, we will look at possible spheres of action for remedying the various problems we found.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, this year, we plan to adopt a communication on the directive on misleading and comparative advertising. On a national level, some Member States have already adopted important tools to foster the management of commercial relations between companies, commercial law, policies for small and medium-sized enterprises, and laws and codes of conduct against unfair practices. The Commission has given the High-Level Forum for a better functioning of the food supply chain a mandate to work, among other things, on contractual relations between companies and on price transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">The representatives of the agricultural sector, industry, commerce and distribution recently came to an agreement about a document on vertical relations within the food supply chain and the principles of good practice, which proposes a common definition of fairness in relations between companies. The document also proposes guidelines for commercial relations between companies, accompanied by concrete examples of unfair and fair practices.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the measures for applying these principles have not yet been evaluated, and therefore there is still an additional, delicate task to carry out. Based on the progress over the next few months, the Commission will make a decision as to whether to continue to encourage this consensual approach or, in the absence of a satisfactory agreement between the parties, it reserves the right to weigh up possible legislative action. At the moment, the Commission does not have a preferred option, and considers all alternatives valid, including the one suggested in the report by Mr Bové.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as already announced in the communication ‘A Better Functioning Food Supply Chain in Europe’, the Commission has put forward legislative proposals to improve the transparency of the raw materials derivative markets, including agricultural commodities. These proposals specifically concern over-the-counter derivatives, financial instruments markets and market abuse.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are well aware, the proposals are currently being debated by Parliament and the Council. Thank you for your attention, and I apologise once more to the President if my speech has been longer than planned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was good to hear your fulsome response, Commissioner. I have less time but I will be quite blunt. I would like you to take the comments in this debate as armour and weapons into your struggles on this matter. This House is united about one issue, which is that there is a problem at both ends – and, indeed, in the centre – of the food supply chain. The Bové report, which was an initiative of mine in the EPP Group – and I thank Mr Bové for his work on it – deals with the farm input problem. It is serious, and you have acknowledged that. At the other end, we have had the excellent work of my colleague, Mrs Patrão Neves, on the imbalance of power and the need to look at this.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly pleased by your words, and I quote you here, that you will ‘reserve the right to legislate’. I think the stakeholders should listen with concern and be prepared to face legislation if there is no cooperation and effective change on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you mentioned the financial services sector. I think you were right to do that. There is a huge parallel between what has happened in financial services – to the discredit of the European Union – and what is happening in the food supply chain. My interest in this House is in the food supply chain. Food security is fundamental. Are you, as Commissioner, prepared to watch over the destruction of this if we do not take action now?</p>
<p class="contents">Let me warn you that, though we have been up early for this debate, there are others in the food chain who have been up much earlier and are taking from the pockets of producers, both their pockets, to cushion their own profits. Some of the practices that are going on you do not even know and we do not fully understand. There is something rotten in this system, and unless politicians have the bottle to call it rotten, there will be no change. Take this debate to the Commission and take action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I should like to emphasise that the smooth operation of the food market is inextricably bound up with the smooth operation of the farm input supply market and vice versa. Therefore, regulations are needed that will safeguard transparency in input pricing and the application of, and compliance with, competition rules both by the input supply chain and in the agri-food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to point out that the quality of traditional crop seeds should be linked to the cultural heritage of the Member States, in the same way as the agricultural product quality policy. I therefore think that it is important to create a European bank for seeds to store and maintain the genetic variety of traditional plants and combat the current loss of biodiversity in traditional varieties.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I should like to point out that rational use of inputs and resources requires far more than the application of rules. It requires a change of attitude, knowledge and skills on the part of farmers, so that they can adopt the most productive, viable and innovative cultivation systems under the circumstances. As we all understand, that depends on both innovative and institutional improvements and a high standard of training. I trust that the new common agricultural policy will take all this into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, I would like to talk in very simplified terms, that is to say, my message is perhaps not directed at my fellow Members, but at those who are currently buying their own food.</p>
<p class="contents">The big problem for the EU’s farmers, and perhaps their only economic problem, is that they are shamelessly poorly paid for their work. The input chain is extremely large and, I would like to point out, extremely profitable. The food industry is reasonably profitable, and in the trading chain, it is, in fact, quite easy these days to become a prosperous small business.</p>
<p class="contents">In the midst of this gigantic chain is the individual farmer, and even if we regard him or her as a large farmer, he or she is an almost invisible link in the large food supply chain, despite the fact that it is the farmer who is the really important converter of inputs into raw materials for the next link in the chain.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask you to imagine for a moment that if farmers were sufficiently well paid for what they sold on the market, then the EU’s income subsidies could, in fact, be converted into investment capital for rural development, the environment, climate change, animal care and infrastructure. Think what resources we would have available to us the day that farmers were paid a reasonable amount for the work they do! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It pulls together a number of the interlocking and mutually reinforcing factors which are impacting on our food supply chain and making the lives of European and global farmers more difficult. Indeed, there are times when the economics of farming are not so much a science as more of a voodoo cult. It is amazing that anybody is actually in farming at all and that we have any food to eat.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that the increased concentration of market power downstream of farming, in processing industries, trade companies and supermarkets, and upstream of farming, in terms of increasing costs for fertilisers, energy, feed, seed, water, loans and land rent, is undermining the proper functioning of the food supply chain in Europe. Farmers are facing a squeeze between rising costs for input and low farm gate prices.</p>
<p class="contents">For those colleagues – usually those not present in these debates – who have suggested that the free market is working, I have some statistics from the Scottish Agricultural College report on power in agriculture – actual statistics on market concentration – showing that four companies worldwide account for 75-90%, by some measures, of global grain trade, seven companies control all fertiliser supply, five companies share 68% of the global agrochemical market, and three companies control almost 50% of the proprietary seeds market. If you add to that the supermarkets’ and processors’ power, it really is surprising that our farmers are in business at all. So to those who would say that the free market in agriculture is working – well, prima facie, no it is not.</p>
<p class="contents">We saw what happened – as other colleagues have mentioned – with the breakdown of the interbank lending market earlier in this economic crisis. It is the poorest who are hit hardest, and our citizens are very much in the frame for this. So I was delighted, Commissioner, to hear your fulsome presentation this morning, and I hope you will gather from this debate that this House is looking for more action from the Commission, not less. We are your ally in this and, if anything, we want to see more urgent activity from the Commission on the many issues raised in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to see further action because this is not going to go away or get better. Quite the reverse – the market is concentrating further day by day in a world where we are increasingly seeing instability in energy prices, global instability and its political knock-on effects, and climate change making parts of the world wetter, parts of the world drier, and all of the world more climatically unstable. We are not going to see our food supply chain getting calmer.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to act on this urgently. CAP reform has never been more urgent and this report deserves to be absolutely fundamental in all our minds as we take forward the CAP reform project with you, Commissioner. We look forward to that effort. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was one of the co-authors of this document and I remember that while organising a press conference after its adoption, some of the agricultural organisations that had supported the collection of signatures for the declaration even asked not to be mentioned publicly, fearing potential reprisal from major retail chains. This illustrates the scale of the problem. Both in EU law as well as in the law of the Member States, legal instruments exist which allow us to deal with the situation effectively, and these legal instruments should be applied.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw attention to distortions in competition which result from the unequal rights of our farmers. This manifests itself both in external competition, in the area of unequal standards and the higher requirements that our farmers face in comparison to importers, as well as in internal competition, in the area of unequal subsidies. This is a very serious problem, which also distorts the agricultural market of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One can sense that it has been drawn up by a real farmer, who feels the pain of farmers. For my own part, I should like to say that a situation has arisen throughout the world where agricultural products are now used both in food and in energy production. Grain is used for bioethanol, rape for biodiesel, maize for biogas, and so on. As a result, financial resources that used to circulate on the fossil fuel market are now also flowing into the food production sector and are causing excessive price fluctuations. In my view, the European Commission should, as a matter of urgency, pay more attention to these issues, and should, as swiftly as possible, develop a mechanism to prevent financial speculation on the food market based on this factor. Too little thought is being devoted to questions of increasing soil fertility. I think that the European Commission should draw up and adopt a package of administrative measures to increase farmers’ economic autonomy and use of the required resources. Honest, fair and economically justified direct payments are one of the possibilities for farmers to reduce the negative effect of fluctuations in the supply of resources on stability in agricultural production. The utmost attention must therefore be paid to these matters, and we must demand accountability. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition to that, those sugar beet have gone from being randomly monogerm to consistently monogerm, and all that is down to the efforts of plant breeders. They have to be rewarded for the work that they do. They are in great competition with other plant breeders and the farmer, I can assure you, is the most brutal customer of the lot. If he does not like a variety, he will drop it like a stone. The price of failure for a plant breeder is very high indeed: it is 10 years’ work straight down the drain.</p>
<p class="contents">Somebody was talking about maintaining seed banks. I can assure you that the seed breeders themselves do that. Actually, seed is one of the farm inputs that farmers have a huge degree of control over, and in the UK, a farmer has three choices. He can either maintain an old variety on which no royalty is payable, or he can multiply up a new variety. He will then have to declare that he has done so and pay a modest acreage royalty. He can expect to be inspected, or he can simply buy a bag of seed where the royalty is part of the price. All of these things he can do. This works well in the UK. I do not see the necessity to call on the Commission to interfere in this in any way at all.</p>

Whilst the rapporteur highlights generally the problems in terms of cost of production versus farm gate prices, in Northern Ireland – despite these difficulties – agriculture continues to contribute to the economy. We have heard colleagues say today that this really is quite a miracle, given the problems that farmers face.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the agri-food sector in Northern Ireland has grown significantly, accounts for 20% of sales from the manufacturing industry and now, in a very small region, provides 50 000 direct jobs. We should recognise the absolute importance of this industry to our economy. It is an industry which has proved resilient in difficult economic conditions and should provide further private-sector growth if given the proper support and freedom from oppressive legislation. There is no doubt that many of the issues raised by the report are valuable, but I believe that the greatest contribution that we can make to a sustainable and competitive sector is in producing a common agricultural policy that sees food production and European food security as its aim and objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Over recent weeks, I have been talking to farmers in my own constituency and they see the proposals from the Commission as complex, overbearing in terms of environmental objectives and favouring landowners over active food-producing farmers. In our discussions on CAP reform, if we miss the opportunity to provide an environment for increased productivity and one which provides food and supply security, we will only continue to increase price volatility for farmers and consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, Commissioner, I was interested in your brief run-down on some of the common agricultural policy proposals. You mentioned specifically crop rotation, as has been envisaged in the Pillar One proposal. In Northern Ireland, this is seen as much too prescriptive and almost certainly will put small mixed farms out of work. It is simply not workable.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own country, can I urge the UK Government to get on with its plans for the supermarket ombudsman and to give that ombudsman a range of powers which will actually tackle the issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are two developments that are worrying me. The first of these, Commissioner, is the growing gap between input and farm gate prices. The second is the situation right throughout the supply chain.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I have just looked this up. On 27 July 1961, aged 14, I got my licence to drive a tractor, and my first job was to take grain to the brewery. At that time, 100 kg cost the equivalent of EUR 25. On my way home, I bought a newspaper, which cost me the equivalent of EUR 0.05. Today, cereal costs not EUR 25, but EUR 20, while the newspaper costs EUR 0.70 instead of EUR 0.05. If grain prices had followed the same trajectory as newspaper prices, consumers would now have to pay EUR 350 for 100 kg.</p>
<p class="contents">You can see from these figures what Europe’s farmers are providing and what contribution they have made to giving our consumers cheap prices for food.</p>
<p class="contents">What annoys me, and I am personally the chair of a farming cooperative, is the issue of terms of payment. Given the time constraints, I will limit myself to that. It has become a bad habit for the supermarket chains to saddle these farming cooperatives with ever longer payment terms. Once upon a time, it was 24 days. Now, even in Germany, it is often 60. In other words, if we deliver fresh milk, we make 30 deliveries before we get payment for the first one. Commissioner, there is an urgent need for action in this regard. We need to tackle these payment terms in the same way as we tackled roaming charges. That is the only way this situation will be rectified. I beg you to take action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this field, the ideas and requests approved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are very much to be welcomed. Higher levels of transparency in prices, the reduction of the costs of production inputs and more effective management of energy and natural resources within the industry are just a few of the most important points.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, on these grounds, and taking advantage of the presence of Vice-President Tajani, I think it appropriate to recall the central point of the joint resolution on the imbalances in the food supply chain, to which my fellow Members have also referred: a European system to harmonise the length of time taken for payments in commercial transactions between agri-food producers and the distribution system.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Tajani, we can no longer allow distortions of competition between European producers; it is no longer acceptable to have different national legal systems that regulate deadlines for payment, contractual agreements and discounting practices differently. There is a lack of territorial homogeneity exacerbating this phase of extreme market volatility where sharp price rises are not translating into higher margins for farmers; they, on the contrary, see their incomes dropping lower and lower.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Tajani, we in Parliament are ready to support a legislative proposal that goes in this direction and I know of the work that you are doing with the high-level group. I therefore sincerely hope that we may soon see a legislative proposal on harmonisation of the distribution systems in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The result, of course, is that farmers are squeezed from both sides by these huge and powerful companies.</p>
<p class="contents">This highlights the urgent need for action in the CAP reform and in other areas where the Commission is taking action to try and help this matter. We need to strengthen the hand of farmers when it comes to negotiating (a) with the retailers, and (b) with their input suppliers. If we can achieve that, what will then happen is a better return for farmers, a better margin, and less reliance on the need for taxpayers’ support in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one particular area that I think needs immediate action from the Commission, and that is in regard to the fertiliser market. If I could give you the example, Commissioner, of the UK fertiliser market, there is a monopoly manufacturer for nitrogen fertiliser called GrowHow. It is 50% owned by its largest competitor Yara, which is the largest fertiliser manufacturer in the world. The other half of GrowHow is owned by CF Industries, which is the largest manufacturer of nitrogen-based fertilisers in North America. Surely this level of consolidation means there is little real competition in the UK marketplace. I suspect this is replicated throughout the rest of Europe. The only competition they face is from the blenders, but they, unfortunately, have to buy their nitrogen from that same supplier.</p>
<p class="contents">So between 2003 and 2009, output prices for agricultural products increased by 35%, their inputs increased by 42%, but fertiliser increased by 173%. That is evidence that the market is failing. Commissioner, could you give me a guarantee that you will investigate this matter and ask the Competition Commissioner to look closely at how the fertiliser market is operating in the EU? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also a policy that is greener. A policy with an even greater concern for sustainable agricultural practices. A policy that also makes a concrete contribution to the fight against climate change. A policy that is also directed against the ruthless monopolies of seed and food giants.</p>
<p class="contents">This report forges a close alliance between this Parliament and active farmers, and defends the autonomy of farmers and consumers and, as such, it deserves our full support. Congratulations, José Bové! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Competition on the agricultural market has grown considerably, and all farmers in Europe are now feeling the competitive pressure. Many of them are coping well with this, but some are unable to face the pressure and are gradually leaving the sector. This is natural and proper, however, and any effort to prevent it would, in my view, be doomed to fail. We must, on the contrary, assist the agricultural sector by removing the unnecessary regulations and quotas which hinder agricultural development. Ending the quotas and ceilings on wine, milk, sugar and other items will also provide an opportunity for growth in the agricultural sector. It is these quotas that are a barrier to the growth of European agriculture, and it is also necessary to facilitate the operation of alternative distribution channels, such as farm sales or the farmers’ markets that have seen successfully rising sales in the Czech Republic and elsewhere.</p>

In so doing, I believe that we should pay particular attention to the reduction of input costs. It is a well-known fact that, over recent years, these have risen disproportionately in relation to agricultural earnings. Thus, for example, energy costs in agriculture rose by around 60% between 2000 and 2010, while farm gate prices only rose by 25%. The rapporteur’s suggestion of setting up a price monitoring agency is certainly the right way to go. We have to succeed in increasing competition in the input sector, thus bringing about more attractive prices for farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is well known that farmers, for their part, are already attempting to work together more closely in a number of areas and thus exploit their potential when it comes to efficiency savings. In the medium and the long term, however, it will be necessary to provide farmers – especially those who farm organically – with a better price environment for their products so that we can ensure their long-term survival, especially in outlying alpine regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ms Patrão Neves, with the support of the Group of the European People’s Party, has had to face many obstacles and I should like to congratulate her on the work which has brought us to this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, 50 years ago, farmers received 50% of the final price paid by consumers; but today, in many cases, they receive less than 10%. At the same time, in 20 years, the market share for distribution chains has risen from 21.7% to 70%. Something is going on, and it is quite obvious.</p>
<p class="contents">Measures must be adopted to ensure that food supply chains are more equitable, more equal and fairer.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the security networks provided by the common agricultural policy to ensure fair prices must be improved. We need an EU framework to guarantee fair relationships and avoid abuse. We must define and prohibit abusive practices within these margins. We must make production more concentrated, encouraging producers’, farmers’ and livestock breeders’ organisations. We must also ensure fair competition conditions for all producers with equal opportunities and equal responsibilities. I am referring to those producers outside of the European Union who do not meet the same standards in terms of quality, food security, animal welfare and all these issues which are so essential that we require our producers to meet such standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Where do we do all of this? Well, in the next CAP reform, of course. We must improve contractual relations in this CAP reform. The aim will be to improve the position of the primary sector within the chain, improve distribution trade policy, avoid the constant increase in food speculation, take into account and improve those margins which are causing a rise in non-agricultural costs, and, finally, assure producers that all products on the EU market meet the same quality standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We will only achieve this, however, when everyone has equal rights. The role of farmers in the market is that of relatively small sole traders. Upstream and downstream of them, by contrast, we often see quite large business structures. I therefore welcome the fact that the Commission is, for once, looking into the market not only from the consumer point of view, but also from that of producers. If we have imbalances, we need to find ways to tackle them without giving rise to excessive bureaucracy and without creating new imbalances elsewhere. We all know how sensitively markets react. In these times of the debt crisis, in particular, that is something we see day in, day out. It is therefore important to test the waters carefully if we intervene.</p>
<p class="contents">Markets need sensible frameworks in order to facilitate a minimum level of balance. However, they also need enough freedom to act and to be able to do so. Agriculture cannot be excepted from this principle. Only a balance of freedom and responsibility will enable all market participants to make the most of their advantages and thus help bring about long-term growth and prosperity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Faced with this problem, the Commission has two options. They should be reluctant to regulate markets – that is usually heavy-handed and rarely effective – but they should offer encouragement and support to the industry by indicating best practice on all sides.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three things you can do here, Commissioner. Firstly, you should encourage farmers to cooperate with one another: by working together, they can exploit their strengths to buy inputs better, process production better and thereby add value. You can empower farmers by ensuring that there is transparent market information always available; and you can enable farmers by amending competition law, promoting codes of conduct, illustrating best practice and simplifying the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am disappointed that the Commissioner’s proposals for CAP reform fail to recognise adequately the strategic importance of a viable, competitive agricultural sector.

We welcome the general consensus reached on this text. The topic warranted it.</p>
<p class="contents">For years, farmers’ share of revenue has been falling. As the statistics show, this decrease is not caused by one single entity, but by the producers’ lack of structural weight in the food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of us have repeated this time and time again, but I do not know if that is good or bad. It has been said time and time again: we must give producers their deserved role in the food chain, one that is, above all, proportionate to their importance. The rules of competition should be applied in the same way to everyone and should not lead to this serious imbalance that we have highlighted. However, the reality is clearly very different. This unfair treatment is largely due to the diverse way in which the national competition authorities apply the European rules.</p>
<p class="contents">As Members of the European Parliament, we see what is happening on the ground, we act as intermediaries and we can vouch for the difficulties encountered by many of our farmers or producers’ organisations when they want to unite in order to deal with processors, distributors and even their own competitors. As regards concentration, in particular, the definition of the relevant market varies from one country to another.</p>
<p class="contents">When producers want to come together and combine their weight, some national competition authorities prevent them from doing so. They believe that the national market could not cope with that concentration and the significant weight of that new organisation. On the contrary, in other Member States, the opposite happens. Such groupings are authorised because the market taken into consideration, the supposedly relevant market, is the European market. Their weight is thus proportionally smaller and their position is not considered to be dominant. This situation is clearly untenable.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and the Court of Justice, as guardians of the Community’s legislation and its uniform application, must ensure that the national authorities do not keep producer organisations in an inferior position that puts a strain on their negotiating capacity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The two other large sectors are concentrated, highly concentrated in fact. That is the case for the distribution sector. Producers, however, are relatively deprived and very dispersed.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore have to try to organise them as we have just done with the report on milk by Mr Nicholson. We tried to give them more power. I do not think that that is enough. In my view, there will be two important aspects. The first is that they will have to be organised but monitored by the public authority because – as one of my colleagues just said – we will need a body to monitor prices and margins as the public authority alone can ensure a balance between the various stakeholders. The second, in my opinion, is that we will have to stop treating competition as sacrosanct. What is important, above all, is the welfare of each of the stakeholders in the food chain, which ensures the welfare of all.

However, it is the experience of farmers in my own Member State, Ireland, that they are not getting fair play or a fair return in the food supply chain.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2010, average farm incomes in Ireland were EUR 17 700, or just over 50% of the average industrial wage. Since 2000, the cost of on-farm production has increased by over 37%, despite major efficiencies at farm level. At the same time, the price paid to farmers has increased by only 14%. I have no doubt that this imbalance is replicated for farmers right across the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that primary producers are being squeezed from both sides of the food supply chain. On the one side, they receive low-grade farm gate prices due to the strong position of processors and retailers, and, on the other side, they pay high input prices due to increased concentration of input companies. Total input costs for EU farmers rose by almost 40% between 2000 and 2010 and costs continue to increase for farmers year on year. The upper pressure on these prices will rise further as a result of resource scarcity and a growing demand for food. On the other side of the chain, retailers have used their powers over farmers to implement a number of methods such as ‘hello money’, ‘pay to play money’, payment delays, shelf space pricing and carrying the costs of discount campaigns, which cut away at the returns of farmers and buy their produce in unfair and unbalanced conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">This is about fair return for fair work, making a viable living from work that brings added value to the environment, delivers food security and puts food on the table of the European citizens. The retailers, processors, food suppliers and consumers are key stakeholders in the food supply chain, but so is the farmer. I think we should remember that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">From an economic and monetary affairs perspective, we will deal in detail with the issue of commodity derivatives, and agricultural markets in general, in the regulation on markets in financial instruments and the Market Abuse Regulation over the course of this year. We need, however, to ensure that our financial services legislation is joined up with our wider agricultural policies. The key will be transparency. Ultimately, we do not know what role financial market participants are playing in the world’s commodity markets because there is a lack of transparency in the trading process.</p>
<p class="contents">This report makes clear just how many factors influence the price of food, yet it is easy for politicians directly to blame banks and hedge funds for price volatility. This is not a two-dimensional discussion, and the Commission needs to look for more sophisticated tools to remove the opacity in commodity markets and give financial regulators a full toolbox. They really need to clamp down on any abusive behaviour as and when it may occur.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we need to proceed with caution, as food producers need to be able to continue to use agricultural commodity derivatives to hedge their business exposures. Financial participants should, however, reduce – not cause – volatility in our prices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Protecting the interests of farmers is therefore a matter which should be prioritised. We should focus, in particular, on small-scale family agricultural holdings as well as on holdings situated in Less Favoured Areas (LFA), especially mountainous or remote areas, where – due to the higher costs of production and energy used for transport or field work – the situation is particularly severe.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know, the current situation is influenced by an increase in the price of raw materials, energy, fertilisers and other means of production. We also need to consider, however, the exceptionally powerful monopolistic activities prevalent in the market for means of production, the processing market and in trade. Therefore, I share the opinion that this issue should be dealt with by European and national competition bodies. I also support the initiatives aimed at increasing the transparency of farm input prices, as well as the European Food Prices Monitoring Tool set up by Eurostat. What we need is a strong legal system that monitors and regulates similar practices.</p>
<p class="contents">The agricultural market requires a degree of intervention. Given the specific character of agricultural production, which depends on weather conditions and biology, full self-regulation of the agricultural market is not feasible. All the more so, since the agricultural market has been the subject of increased speculation, the results of which we have felt very strongly. We should also develop local markets, food fairs and other forms of trade, which will shorten the chain from food producers to food consumers. This will not only positively influence the quality of agricultural produce, but also contribute to reduced prices and increased benefits for consumers as well as for agricultural producers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, it is with regret that I have to say that many of the European Commission’s announcements heard in the last few years, also in this House, have not been put into effect to this day. Farmers were promised a long time ago that they would have special agreements, which would guarantee continuous collection of produce on the one hand, and suitable prices on the other. Equally, relations with suppliers are deteriorating continuously. The plight of farmers is truly tragic. Their attempts to achieve specialisation and higher productivity resulted in their becoming dependent on suppliers in recent years, with the latter dictating prices as well as payment and delivery deadlines. We have to change this situation. We hear words to this effect time and time again. I would like to put the following question to the European Commission: when exactly can we expect proper regulation with regard to agreements and contracts, on the one hand, and with regard to relations between farmers and suppliers, on the other? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, as the recent storms have demonstrated, these turbines are often subject to catastrophic failure, and even when they are working, they only produce a trickle of electricity. As a result, many farmers in Scotland have found that they have rusting hulks on their land which are earning nothing and costing them a fortune.

Agricultural inputs – meaning seeds, fertilisers and animal feed, but also machinery – are getting ever more expensive. One of the biggest factors behind the rising costs, however, is energy costs. There is an urgent need for an action plan in the energy sector, not only in order to get to grips with the costs, but also to reduce dependence, and this urgent need is a call to action for all areas of politics. There is a major potential in renewable energy sources such as wind, hydropower and biomass from sustainable raw materials. This renewable energy mix can fill the energy gap on a permanent basis.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to mobilise all available resources, while at the same time increasing efficiency. Improved resource management in respect of humus and water, energy and nutrients cannot remain just an empty slogan.</p>
<p class="contents">Another uncertainty factor for operators is the massive price fluctuations. Those running businesses need to be equipped to plan for the long term. A monitoring system for input prices could be helpful in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Excessive speculation on food commodities is an unacceptable factor. We cannot allow speculators to gamble on higher food prices. This problem is well enough known and it will not go away by itself. The effect of this can be felt by both agricultural producers, through low revenues, and consumers, through higher prices on the shop shelves. Higher food prices are not reflected in farming incomes. Instead, the beneficiaries are to be found at the end of the supply chain, which is to say, the processing industry and retailers. There needs to be a fair division of profits right along the production chain.</p>
<p class="contents">Another cause of high costs that needs to be combated is Europe’s enormous dependence on supplies of raw materials and input products imported from third countries. We can only master the economic and environmental challenges and the extreme cost pressure in agriculture through long-term investment in raw material production, farm development, research and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">These approaches must also be reflected in the reform of the common agricultural policy. The new common agricultural policy must enable farmers to achieve the full potential of their businesses.</p>

It really is a very important issue that we are debating today, be it for producers, processors, for trade or for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Production costs for farmers have risen sharply over recent years. Farmers can primarily feel the increasing overheads when it comes to energy bills and agricultural inputs. The heavy concentration of food retailing, above all, makes it more difficult for producers to obtain good prices for their products.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the mark-up between the primary and the end product is sometimes considerable, not much of that reaches producers, as some of the margin is lost to each of the various processing steps. Politicians can intervene in competition policy, but we must be careful when doing so, and, in certain areas, we have to trust to market forces.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider it important to let consumers know that buying regional products from their producers or makers supports both the farmers and the local economy. That is where I see our role. We should intervene in this connection, be it with money or with political instruments. I believe strengthening regionalism provides a tool to do this. In the reform of the common agricultural policy, we need to make other tools available.</p>
<p class="contents">For me as a Social Democrat, it is important that access to wholesome food at reasonable prices should be guaranteed for all, while, at the same time, farmers must be able to receive a fair and reasonable income for their work. This demand requires us not to shirk our responsibility, and indeed to live up to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Every time we act, we need to ask ourselves if we are living up to these demands. If not, the result will be social unrest in the long run. Farmers and consumers are in the same boat. Let us ensure that that boat never sinks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The problem of farmers’ incomes is becoming ever more severe and is affecting small and medium-sized enterprises, the family-run businesses which do not have the strength to fight the arrogance of large retailers. Today, with this resolution, we are clearly saying that Europe must take action to correct these distortions.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure transparent contractual relations between producers and distributors in order to guarantee a decent, adequate income for those who work the soil. We must also prevent price fluctuations creating advantages for just a few, because currently, when prices rise, it is large retailers that profit, and when they fall, it is the farm workers that grow poorer. In order to achieve this, we must ensure that the industry becomes smaller and that there is fair competition within it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not possible, as happens to me every Saturday, when I go shopping, to find extra virgin olive oil sold in the supermarket for EUR 2 per litre bottle when the price paid to producers by wholesale traders is EUR 2.35. Furthermore, we need transparency for consumers and clear information to guarantee quality against counterfeit products. Staying on the subject of extra virgin olive oil, we have asked, in a question that has received broad backing, for the level of alkyl esters and methyl esters to be reduced in order to prevent mixes of other oils, refined and deodorised, being added to oil sold as extra virgin. Placing these on the market contributes to driving down the price of high-quality oil.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I hope that in relation to these points and this request for an amendment to Regulation No 61/2011 to reduce the levels of alkyl esters and methyl esters, you will make a clear and precise commitment on behalf of the Commission to reduce the presence of these counterfeit oils in extra virgin oil on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we must ensure that production costs are driven down. I welcome your openness, but I call for the idea to be endorsed in the next CAP of ensuring that renewable energy generation facilities be installed in every farm. These would be intended to provide for the energy requirements of the farm itself, reducing costs and CO<span class="sub">2 </span>emissions, and providing support to producers and small farms. What could be greener than a provision like this?</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we must act quickly and take appropriate measures, because rural abandonment and soil desertification are no longer risks that need to be averted, but actual facts that need to be combated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I will start by discussing food prices. Over recent days, we have talked and talked about how a third of food in Europe finds its way, unused, into the rubbish. We have been discussing our failure to achieve the biodiversity targets. We have been talking about how we find ourselves in an energy crisis. We have been talking about the fact that many Europeans cannot afford food at the moment. We have also been talking – and quite rightly so – about how those who produce food can no longer make a living by doing so and how we can talk of a large-scale abandonment of farming in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have in its place is a concentration in production, in production facilities and, above all, in retail. If I take Austria as an example, we can see that 77% of the retail trade is in the hands of just three companies. What we do not want to see, on the other hand, is a concentration of this kind in agriculture. We want to retain the biodiversity here, too, in terms of types of business. We need these opportunities to produce healthy, safe, hygienically sound food.</p>
<p class="contents">There are suggestions in the Bové report, and the reform of the common agricultural policy provides further opportunities. Let us effect implementation at the same speed that Mr Silvestris spoke to the House today! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, the key elements in this draft are those which concern improving the farmers’ position in a better internal organisation. Providing support to producer organisations is the soundest way to enable producers to sell their produce under decent terms. At the same time, I do not believe that we need to be wary about legislating on the food supply chain relationship as long as future legislation is based on objective factors. It is not reasonable for us to continue to rely on self-regulation of this relationship between farmers and retailers, at least at the moment, as borne out by the experiences so far. Farmers need specific measures and cannot afford to idly wait to go bankrupt.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I am advocating the adoption of paragraph 4 of the motion for a resolution in its entirety, which is extremely reasonable and even envisages that future legislative measures have to be adopted only if they are absolutely necessary, and that these measures must not distort the smooth operation of the markets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report included an exhaustive series of recommendations to the European Commission with a view to a fair income for farmers and a better-functioning food supply chain.</p>

If we are honest, the European Commission has been insulting this Parliament for many years by ignoring our demands. Yes, there is a high-level group, yes, there have been reports, but there have been no concrete initiatives. I am therefore happy with the Commissioner’s minor undertaking.</p>
<p class="contents">However, who is it that is suffering because of that lack of action? It is the primary producer. On that score, it is rather telling that we have the Commissioner for Industry here with us. I have heard him speak about industry, about processing and about the competition between companies. However, where does the greatest unfairness in the production chain lie? Right there, in the relationship between the farmer, the primary producer, and the rest of the chain. He has not said anything about that. </p>
<p class="contents">And to Mr Agnew, who finds this debate so important that he has already left the room, and all his colleagues from the British Conservative Party, who put the interests of the City of London, with its warped financial products, above the producers of their daily bread, I will tell you how the market really works. When a Dutch tomato producer, during the EHEC crisis, is confronted with a price drop of more than 50% – not through any fault of his own, but just as the result of silly remarks made by a German Minister – he is happy that at least he has a contract with a supermarket for a fixed and agreed price. What happens in reality, however, is that this supermarket – which by the way is German – then returns his tomatoes because it knows that in this crisis, it can force the producer to agree to a lower price.</p>
<p class="contents">This, Commissioner, is the way the market works at the moment, and if you had done your job, this would not be possible in a European internal market. This House talks about fair trade with third world countries, but fair trade starts at home, with a fair price for European producers. That is your job, Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the situation has remained unchanged. Farmers continue to be the victims of illegal contracts and unfair competition. In my country, food producers need to pay a duty to be able to sell their products in supermarkets, not to mention an additional shelf charge to ensure their products a high profile in stores. In addition, farmers only receive a tiny percentage of the profits which the large stores make after selling this farm produce. In the overwhelming majority of cases, good-quality products from small and medium-sized farms find it very difficult to gain access to consumers as these producers cannot cope with the competition or the conditions imposed by supermarkets. In Romania, farmers are forced to throw away a good proportion of the fruit or vegetables they produce as they cannot gain any benefit from them under current market conditions.</p>

We cannot afford to price our farmers out of the market. Any such reduction in agricultural holdings would simply increase our dependency on external markets. This would be negative for Europe both in terms of the value of agriculture to the EU and in terms of the quality and safety of the food available to consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">The agri-food industry and distribution represent 7% of total employment within the EU, and are worth EUR 1 200 billion per year – more than any other manufacturing sector in the EU. There is the further problem that food produced in third countries may not be of the same quality, and may not adhere to the same standards and rigorous health and safety provisions, as food which is produced within the EU. Given the importance of the agri-food industry to Europe, it is therefore vital that we protect farmers and thoroughly examine the issue of increasing farm output prices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we now look at the results, what has happened? Of course, it is good that the matter is discussed, but I do hope that we will now really be able to get to grips with this problem, perhaps in connection with the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP).</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that in many countries of the European Union, trade is very centralised and that has contributed to the disparities in farmers’ income formation and also put them in a bad light in these price negotiations. We must strengthen the position of farmers in talks, but also ensure that they enjoy a more stable income arrangement as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bové’s report was also excellent. It is also evident that inputs have risen dramatically, and it should be possible for this to be reflected in prices. I hope that we will be able to address this issue in the context of the CAP reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Bové was quite right to encourage farmers to cultivate their own seeds rather than relying on seed monopolies, and also to recycle phosphates and nitrogen rather than relying on ever more expensive purchases, and, of course, to return to the production of traditional products. He has also shown himself to be aware of the burden of the cost of complying with legislation – much of it, of course, EU legislation. He might have mentioned the costs of the new enriched poultry cages that have to be borne by countries complying with this very welcome legislation but not, of course, by those countries that have studiously ignored it.</p>

It is precisely those fair conditions that we do not have. On the other hand, we do have a social market economy. In other words, politicians are obliged, where there is a will so to do, to intervene and regulate.</p>
<p class="contents">To do so, however, we would need a form of language that the market would understand. Poor prices for farmers must mean, quite simply, that we offer less in return. Then we have the problem of imbalance. Agriculture is made up of small actors – many operators – while the processing industry consists of medium-sized enterprises and the retail sector is highly concentrated. Put simply, things cannot work like that.</p>
<p class="contents">What we definitely need, in my view, is strong interest groups and trade associations for agriculture that could regulate the market. In addition, farmers need interest groups and market information. They must also be allowed to reach price agreements. Anti-trust law thus also needs to be amended in favour of our agricultural industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to tackle future challenges and ensure a degree of consistency with interventions carried out in a particular region, we must first of all establish close links between agricultural policy, rural development policy and regional policy. With regard to the uneven response by food prices to the fluctuations in commodity prices, I think that this is mainly linked to the number of intermediaries operating throughout the supply chain.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore in favour of adopting instruments which will be used to promote and support short supply chains and markets where farmers can sell their own produce directly. This will help establish a direct link between consumers and farmers in a particular region, enabling the latter to obtain a greater share of the value of the final price, while the general public will benefit from lower prices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">After this tribute to the President, I will speak in my language, Italian. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to make a few points concerning the issue of prices.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding unfair commercial practices, the Commission is seeking to promote a consensual approach between the parties, and let me say again that this approach corresponds to the principle of good legislation that we have already welcomed thanks to this Parliament’s work on the Corazza Bildt report. I believe that we achieved good concrete results in this area in 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and the high-level forum on the agri-food industry, as I have said, will need to analyse the possible instruments for applying the guidelines contained in the document that you will receive. The sector’s representatives have committed to participating in a further phase of dialogue to draw up a proposal by mid-2012. As I have said, the Commission will have to decide whether to continue with efforts to find a solution based on dialogue or to take action through legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the dialogue needs to be completed swiftly, and cannot be postponed indefinitely. That is why, if there is no reasonableness or a genuine wish to conclude the dialogue, we will be forced to take action. There will be no option, even though I always prefer an agreement rather than to take action through legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Late payment is another essential measure. I have said how strong my commitment is to ensuring that the directive on late payments be adopted swiftly, before the deadline set, which is the end of March 2013. I would like to say again that I have written to all the EU ministers of industry. Let me remind you that the directive sets deadlines not only between public authorities and enterprises, but also between large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, unless there are agreements between the parties, provided that these agreements are not harmful to the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises. I believe that this directive, which forms an important part of the ‘Small Business Act’, can truly provide a response to the problems of small entrepreneurs in the agri-food industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, to respond to your question on the need to move forward with an appropriate analysis of food prices in the EU, with a view to monitoring compliance with transparency, I would like to remind you of the important work done by Eurostat, the Commission’s statistical service, on the European food prices monitoring tool. This tool is based on the vital cooperation between Eurostat and the national statistical institutes within a specific working group in the high-level forum on the agri-food industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also working together with the other international organisations working on similar issues, such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. However, because of the diversity of Europe’s food markets and the complexity of the factors influencing the prices paid by consumers, a detailed Europe-wide analysis of prices and margins is not realistic.</p>
<p class="contents">This needs to be accomplished at national level, as is already happening in some Member States. That is why, through the forum that I have set up, we are trying to develop synergies between national price monitoring bodies, exchanging ideas and proposals, for instance, on the methodologies used.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue of competition, which was at the heart of several speeches during the debate, the Commission has put forward legislative proposals to improve the transparency of markets based on raw materials, including agricultural commodities. Specifically, these proposals concern over-the-counter derivatives, markets in financial instruments and market abuse, as I have said, and as you well know, these proposals are at the heart of the debate in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one thing that I would like to ask Parliament. The proposals on derivatives, markets in financial instruments and market abuse are currently at the codecision stage. I believe that this House could give a positive response and could play a role of great importance.</p>
<p class="contents">I was speaking about competition. The Directorate-General is working closely with the national authorities within the European competition network. These authorities are able to examine and impose penalties on anti-competitive activities in their national markets and, during recent years, many national authorities have carried out thorough investigations in the agriculture and food sector.</p>
<p class="contents">That has made it possible to adopt significant penalty measures, many of which have related to abuse affecting farmers. The Commission will, however, soon publish a report on this subject and the European Parliament will, of course, be informed of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that that is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that today, alongside my report on inputs, my colleagues wanted to raise once again, in a resolution, the issue of the food chain and the fact that farmers are not taken into account and still suffer at the hands of the processing and distribution industries, at a time when we are discussing inputs, shows that since September 2010, when we adopted the report on the food chain, things have not progressed quickly enough. This is indeed a fundamental issue that we are examining today, and that fundamental issue is that farmers are being strangled – as I said earlier – between the upstream and downstream parts of the chain.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, farmers have less and less autonomy when making choices – production choices, choices concerning their farming model – because they are completely stuck. What we now want to see is farmers being returned to the heart of the European agricultural policy, through the CAP, but also through very clear rules regarding the economic aspects, protection for farmers in relation to the distribution sector and their capacity to negotiate with the processing industry. I believe that such an agreement is crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, you will have seen that we have spoken with a single voice, regardless of our political group. Today, as far as we are concerned, agriculture is a priority. It is the EU’s largest integrated policy, as I said before. It is essential to ensure that, when resolving the crises, support for farmers is at the forefront of our mind, because when we talk about agriculture, we are talking about how to feed 500 million Europeans. If we cannot feed our fellow citizens, Europe will cease to make sense. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While the purchase costs of agricultural inputs such as energy, machinery, feed mixtures, fertilisers, pesticides, seed or water are rising sharply, farmers’ profits are stagnating. Agricultural activities consume large amounts of energy. Farmers are trying to maximise energy savings by insulating agricultural buildings, using alternative energy sources and so on. In view of the strategic position of agriculture for Europe, producing safe food and providing independent sustenance for the European population, I would like to ask the Commission and the Council to consider the options for setting maximum energy prices for primary agricultural production. The second financially burdensome input factor is the cost of fertilisers and soil improvers. There is room for improvement here on the part of farmers. Farmers have become accustomed to using large quantities of fertilisers. Restricting the massive use of chemicals will benefit soil ecosystems and help natural renewal. I would therefore like to urge greater use of natural fertilisers and the natural products that already exist in agriculture as by-products. I would also like to emphasise support for organic farming. The third fundamental problem for farmers is the rapidly rising cost of seed and planting stock. This worrying situation is caused by the massive purchasing of certified seed and the modest use of farm-saved seed. At the same time, farm-saved seed is economically advantageous and benefits the environment. I would like to call for the revision of all regulations restricting farmers in the use of their own seed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only 7% of Irish farmers are under 35 years old. We now have a world population of 7 billion; by 2027, it is projected that the world population will reach 8 billion and by 2046, 9 billion! This means that a decreasing number of farmers will have to double food production, while also battling climate change and maintaining food standards. The total input costs for EU farmers climbed by 40% between 2000 and 2010, while farm gate prices have increased by only 25%. Farmers are living on their overdrafts or savings and that cannot continue. We need to ensure that farming is a real career choice for our young people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Statistics explicitly point to the increase in the prices of animal feed, seeds, fertilisers and plant protection products. At this point, I would like to emphasise the significance of energy. According to Eurostat, the price of energy, including electricity, gas and fuel, has increased by approximately 60% over the last 10 years. The construction of biogas plants and infrastructure that use wind, solar and geothermal energy undoubtedly involves significant expense. However, in the long term, this expense is certainly beneficial, as it increases income and has a positive impact on environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Practices aimed at saving energy and increasing energy efficiency must be encouraged and implemented in all holdings at local levels, either individually or through cooperation between neighbouring farmers. Moreover, engaging in cooperation aimed at better resource management and good farming practices will increase the bargaining power and market stability of farmers, which will, in turn, translate directly into higher incomes. Collaboration with research centres, reduction in protein deficit, systems for monitoring land prices and access to land are, of course, the remaining challenges, which must be tackled by the future common agricultural policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Add to this the increase in operating costs for farms, which average 3.6% per year. The imbalance is aggravated further by the speculation on agricultural commodities. This situation, which affects both farmers and consumers, cannot continue. We must protect both producers and consumers by ensuring that the large-scale distribution sector does not take the lion’s share. I voted in favour of this resolution because it is our duty to bring stability to the European food chain and, with that in mind, to ensure a balanced distribution of profits as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
