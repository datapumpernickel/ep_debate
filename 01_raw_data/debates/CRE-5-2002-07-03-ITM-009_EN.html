<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Evans, Robert (PSE),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> deputizing for the rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, I wish to begin by apologising to Parliament, on behalf of Mr Ceyhun, who has been stranded in Germany and is unable to be here. So I have the pleasure of presenting his report on his behalf. Can I say through you, Mr President, to Mr Ceyhun that, as a non-German speaker, I am extremely grateful for the briefing notes that he has sent me in German, from which I will make my contribution this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome this report, which is both ambitious and particularly welcome: a report that Parliament has wanted for some time. I also welcome Commissioner Vitorino, because this report clearly shows the very high principles and commitment that he gives to this issue. We in Parliament – certainly on my committee -are very grateful to him for the amount of work that he does.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a very topical and timely report. We have seen right-wing extremism and populism on the rise. We saw a very high vote for Mr Le Pen in France and similar issues in other countries. Where right-wingers are, racism and xenophobia are not far behind and we have to be very wary of that. Colleagues will be aware that there is also a great deal of concern in Europe at the moment about asylum and immigration. There are lots of horror stories presented by the press to misinform people. This report attempts to clarify the definition of what is racism and what is xenophobia and to make the actions that should be punished much clearer. Our group and the committee welcomed the effort made by the Commission to try to harmonise this legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur also recognises the importance of protecting the right to free speech and, equally, the need to protect minorities and other groups. We must ensure that any new legislation does not stand in the way of these important European fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the penalties for transgressing these laws, individual governments must consider the recommendations that are made, and these vary from six months for some offences to two years for others. We must regard them as minimum points – as lowest common denominators – and we should be pressing countries to do more.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Ceyhun also refers in his report to the growing use of the Internet, which is not just European but global and knows no boundaries. There is a considerable level of responsibility here that must fall on the Internet service providers. They must be responsible for their sites, users and contents. That does not mean that they will always be responsible for everything that goes through their sites but they must be responsible for presenting racist and xenophobic material.</p>
<p class="contents">More complex is the question of whether a prosecution is possible – the Commissioner is a lawyer so he will know this – without the announcement of victims. Perhaps Member States should be responsible for this, since some of them are not happy about it.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the manufacture, distribution and the private possession of racist and xenophobic material. The rapporteur has looked very closely at the possibilities. We have to make absolutely clear that manufacture and production of such materials should be punishable. However, in many cases the private possession of such materials may not be punishable and it may not be desirable that it should be, because this would – if we took it to its logical consequence – prevent people from keeping, for example, old books, photos and other historical materials which would have to be destroyed <span class="italic">en masse</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur looks to Europol and Eurojust to enforce the existing structures across Europe, in cooperation with the judicial forces in each country. I am sure the exchange of data should help to improve the implementation of this framework decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the rapporteur has asked for periodic reports on the progress by the Commission, how it is getting on, and this is customary practice. There is good support for this legislation across Europe, across parties in the committee and from a whole range of NGOs across Europe. It is very timely legislation. I welcome the amount of work the Commissioner has put into this, and I hope very much that Parliament will give it its full support tomorrow and that we can press forward and make real progress on combating racist and xenophobic materials. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a timely proposal, Commissioner, given the political context with which we are familiar in a number of Member States. As a matter of fact, in its latest report, covering the year 2000, the European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia notes that a substantial rise in the level of racial violence and in the incidence of anti-Semitic attacks and racially motivated threats and intimidation was recorded in France, Germany, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. In Germany, the report says, the proportion of racist crimes increased by 33% from 1999 to 2000, while in the United Kingdom the number of racially motivated acts of violence and aggression doubled in the course of the same period. These figures should cause us concern, just as the recent election results in France have done.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it is to be feared that the international situation will lead to a resurgence of such acts. The European People’s Party therefore welcomes the proposal for a framework decision on the fight against racism and xenophobia while suggesting amendments which, we believe, will clarify the decision and make it easier to apply.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise the need to give the Member States a broad margin of discretion in the application and implementation of the decision, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, and in particular the need to specify that the decision does not prevent any Member State from adopting or maintaining provisions of national criminal law that prescribe a higher degree of protection against racism and xenophobia.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we support the amendments tabled on the initiative of my fellow Member, Klaus-Heiner Lehne, which define the scope of the decision, indicating clearly that it applies both to offences committed in a Member State and to those committed elsewhere if the offender is a national of a Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I also consider it important to point out that the aggravating circumstances in which maximum sentences may be increased ought to be extended to cases where the victim is a minor or where the offensive words or actions have been addressed to a minor or to a person who may be easily influenced. Let me add that my group will support Amendment No 12 but not Amendments Nos 24 and 25.</p>

This proliferation is encouraged by a sense of impunity deriving from the perception that such offences are merely virtual acts performed in cyberspace.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the Internet offers a public platform for everyone to express opinions. But some people, as they sit in front of their computers, seem to forget the public dimension of their words or actions and their necessary accountability for the material they communicate. The international dimension, the increasingly numerous intermediaries and the anonymity of the Internet have obviously encouraged and deepened the impression that cyberspace enjoys some sort of extraterritorial immunity from the law. While cyberspace is virtual, criminal liability for offences committed there is real.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that if the Internet is to be counted among the instruments of free expression, if it wants to enjoy corresponding rights, it must be accompanied by the fulfilment of all obligations. And if this tool, which transcends frontiers, is to contribute to the emancipation of societies, of its ‘cybercitizens’, it must not on any account be allowed to exploit the loopholes resulting from insufficient coordination of national policies to become a law unto itself or, to put it another way, to frustrate the efforts of the European Union to function as an area of peace, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you, Commissioner, for this proposal, which the report is intended to reaffirm. In short, it is not a matter of ordering action but of encouraging it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This depressing development goes against everything the EU stands for: freedom, democracy, respect for human rights, the Rule of Law. I feel that Mr Ceyhun deserves great praise for his excellent work.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital to work together within the EU to strengthen the protection available to victims of xenophobic and racist crimes and to ensure that those responsible are punished and that we remove the loopholes in the law. It must not be possible for differences in legislation in the various Member States to be exploited by those who commit crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">Racism and xenophobia must be tackled on a broad front, as happens in this report. Crimes must be punished and crimes involving xenophobia and racism must be punished even harder. Racism must be considered an aggravating factor when punishment is meted out. It is high time that we in this Parliament and the EU’s institutions sent out a clear and unambiguous message that we will never accept racist outrages occurring in our Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">With the help of democracy, we must combat those who stir up their citizens to commit crimes. Our Europe must be a safe place for everyone, regardless of ethnic identity, race, religion or sexual orientation. This is not the case today. We know that many people in Europe currently fear for their own lives and for the safety of their families. They are afraid to go out. They feel threatened. This is totally unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">This desire of ours to create a society for everyone, without racism and xenophobia – a desire which, while it may be a dream, is an important one to have – must not encroach upon the right of every individual, which is set out in the European Convention on Human Rights, also to be able to express himself freely in speech and writing. I therefore hope to see you support our Amendments Nos 24 and 25 which safeguard the freedom of expression of journalists, artists and others.</p>
<p class="contents">Freedom of expression is fundamental and in principle must never be curtailed. In certain Member States, including my own, freedom of expression and freedom of the press are enshrined in the constitution. Naturally, threatening or insulting other people, particularly for racist reasons, can never be allowed. Nor, however, is it clear that punishment is justified in all circumstances. It is a question of balance. I believe that it is important to bring the matter out into the open to be debated. Once the issue sees the light of day, we can put it to rest.</p>

Every report, whether it comes from the institutions, from NGOs or from the Monitoring Centre in Vienna, emphasises the persistence and indeed the escalation of racially-motivated violence.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I applaud the rapporteur’s clarification that racism is not an opinion. Insulting or humiliating someone is not a matter of exercising freedom of expression; it is nothing short of a criminal offence. Saying ‘I don’t like bread pudding’ is not the same as saying ‘I don’t like Arabs’. We know that these two statements have quite different consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">The important feature of this report is that, rather than merely dealing with the punishment of isolated individuals for isolated acts, it calls for the pursuit of those who supply the ideological weaponry that incites others to commit acts of violence. From this point of view, the comments that were read on the Internet are very interesting. We know that this marvellous communication medium, the Internet, can be used today to order revisionist magazines, buy tapes and CDs glorifying the Third Reich, preach anti-Semitism and, since 11 September, in the name of freedom of opinion, devote entire chat forums to outpourings of anti-Arab and Islamophobic invective. This is unacceptable. To my mind, we cannot plan to enlarge Europe and promote peaceful coexistence among the peoples of the Old World without raising awareness among our youngest citizens of the evil nature of racism.</p>

On numerous occasions, the debates in our Assembly have focused on combating racism. Today we have a European monitoring centre as well as Article 13 of the Treaty, which enshrines the power of the Union to take action to combat discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">The European countries also have national anti-racism legislation. In practice, however, racial discrimination has never before been such an acute problem. Let me cite in evidence the report produced by the European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia, which testifies to the upsurge in racism and xenophobia, including ‘Islamophobia’, a phenomenon reflected in the alarming rise of the extreme right.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council’s proposal on combating racism and xenophobia, which we are examining here, is designed to strengthen and supplement the existing legal framework. It is highly regrettable, however, to discover once again that Community responsibility for defining and penalising racist and xenophobic crimes is to be based on the lowest common denominator. If there is no common definition of the recognised offences, how will it be possible to guarantee that the same efforts will be made to combat racism and xenophobia in each of the Member States? One might well ask whether the aim of this proposal is really to combat racism or whether it is merely a way of salving our consciences. This reluctance to take the bull by the horns is tantamount to offering racists the right to continue serving the ends of the extreme right or engaging in populism and rabble-rousing sophistry for electoral purposes and to do so with impunity. Let us not forget that the purpose of combating racism is not only to protect foreigners but also to defend the values of our democracies, human rights and fundamental freedoms, which form the bedrock on which we are building the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides, why exclude the Member States from the implementation of this Decision when we know for a fact that institutional racism exists and that it must be combated with the utmost vigour? This institutional racism, which manifests itself in a whole host of social, economic, professional, cultural and political exclusion mechanisms, is based on ethnic or religious considerations or sometimes on a system of national preference, which is now giving way to European preference. If racism is to be combated more effectively on a day-to-day basis, it is not enough to adopt legislative acts. We are convinced that granting equal rights, including political rights, to all citizens of the Union, whatever their nationality, is the only way to combat every form of racism, because it establishes a balance of political power that is rooted in the exercise of citizenship. Unfortunately, the proposed framework decision does not go far enough in this direction. Nevertheless, we owe it to ourselves to support every initiative that puts human dignity at the heart of the process of building the Union, and combating racism is an integral part of that process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should, under the subsidiarity principle, approve the set of amendments by which the decision to take criminal action should remain with each Member State. There is a point of reference, indeed, that Parliament should never lose sight of, especially on such a sensitive matter, which is that the provisions under which action may be taken to combat racism must not overstep the limit marked by the right to freedom of expression, freedom of association and freedom of opinion, as laid down in Article 9 of the European Convention. That this concern of mine is well founded is shown by the current case of the proceedings brought before the French courts by a movement that considers itself anti-racist to have the book <span class="italic">La rabbia e l'orgoglio</span> (‘Rage and Pride’) by the Italian author Oriana Fallaci banned in France. Leaving aside any consideration of the book’s merits – in Italy, a non-racist country, it has been an enormous publishing success – the basic question remains open, which is the risk that so-called anti-racist rules can be used instrumentally for the purpose of political and ideological censorship and to curtail the freedom to express one’s opinions, as guaranteed by the founding principles of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the rapporteur, the Member States should punish crimes by their own citizens even if they were not committed within their own borders. It seems obvious to me, however, that this may lead to interference by one State in the legal arrangements of another State, unjustly restricting its sovereignty. Besides, in Europe there are entire peoples, groups and linguistic and religious minorities who, even within Member States that declare themselves protectors of the values of freedom, do not enjoy any protection at all as regards these fundamental rights. Is it not perhaps racism to prevent or hinder the use of their mother tongue in the courts, or to have road signs in the local language removed, as has recently happened in the town of Bergamo, or to stop the mother tongue and local history from being taught in schools, thus committing not only terrible discrimination on ethnic grounds but also real and actual cultural genocide? In some cases state racism, as now shown towards supporters of Breton independence, even denies fundamental rights of defence, such as the right enshrined in French law of free access without payment to court documents, as reported by me in a question to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The scope of offences involving discrimination should also be very clearly delineated; there must be racist or xenophobic intent and the offence must be threatening, abusive or insulting in nature. This will better safeguard the complete freedom to circulate historical texts and documents and especially to do scientific and historical research and process information. The difference between these activities and discriminatory acts may in some cases be very subtle, but it exists, and our liberal culture means we must guarantee total freedom for historical research and expression of one’s opinions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will, in any case, help us to take a step forwards in our efforts to discourage any discriminatory attitudes towards people because of their race, religion or different nationality.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose is to set up joint actions to be implemented by the Member States committed to facing the problem, in as coordinated a manner as possible. This is, first and foremost, to prevent offences committed in different countries of the Union from being tried and punished with measures that differ too widely, that are too incoherent. The first part of the report aims to define as precisely as possible what a racist or xenophobic offence consists of. In this respect, I should like to point out to the Commissioner the useful contribution made by Amendment No 12, which provides the means not only of preventing pointless witch hunts in this context, all too easy when talking of xenophobia and racism, but also of ensuring that we do not underestimate behaviour that may be genuinely racist or xenophobic.</p>
<p class="contents">The report then goes on to outline common minimum penalties for both natural and legal persons, but, most importantly, this report is up to date, because it does not just cover offences that occur in citizens’ everyday lives but also virtual offences, in other words those committed every day in the virtual world of the Internet. Of particular interest is the part which sees the racist component as exacerbating certain cases involving offences of other origins and types.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, what is really needed to achieve these objectives is a commitment to enhance cooperation among Member States in the field of justice. This is a new initiative following on from other actions taken in the past and based on a parent action in 1996. Let us hope that this parent will in future bear other children like this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This easy approach, which subliminally identifies immigration with violence in the citizens’ minds, opens the door to appalling racist and xenophobic behaviour and undermines the bases of civic coexistence in Europe today, catapulting the populists into the seats of power. Whereas this represents added value for Europe by helping to resolve a common problem, it loses effect as a result of coming up against the nationalist and police barriers that every Member State is now building for itself – simply sand castles that fall apart when the wind blows a little harder.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite all of this we must emphasise the genuinely European aim of this framework decision, which is intended to establish a European system of sanctions for crimes of racism and xenophobia, which have to date fallen under international law or under the national law of each Member State, a net with a very wide mesh through which the perpetrators of these crimes can slip.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe, Mr President, cannot protect itself by political inertia or by spouting fine words or by irresponsibly telling voters the easiest thing to say, which is that the fault is someone else’s. Europe can only protect itself through the law, using sanctions and prosecutions. This is why, Commissioner, we support this initiative and hope that the Council will not shirk from approving it quickly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet this is the very thing it does not do. Let me briefly explain why. The key word is the Internet. Already, everything that is illegal offline is also illegal on the Internet. That is a fact, but word does not seem to have got round this House yet. It is thanks to other groups that providers really can only be prosecuted if they are aware of the illegal content of their websites. The rapporteur has done everything he can to criminalise the Internet as a whole. This, in my view, wonderfully reflects the rapporteur's true intention.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point about the approach adopted in the report is that it is thoughts, above all, which are to be punished. There is far less focus on deeds. This takes us away from the principle of punishing hate crime – that is, acts that really are committed for racist motives – and moves us towards mind policing. This leads to more censorship and less freedom of the press and freedom of speech. That is something we cannot support.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that anti-racism as it is defined here would mean achieving tangible improvements in migrants' living conditions. What does the report do? The report does not tackle institutional racism, whereby Eurodac is just the tip of the iceberg, and nor does it address economic racism or the pure racism which was agreed on once again in precise terms at Seville, namely not only expanding Fortress EU but going as far as to keep third states in a direct stranglehold. This is why anti-racists cannot take this report at all seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, the year 2000 saw an increase in hostilities and attacks compared to the previous year, which were particularly serious in some countries of the Union. As a result of the tragic events of 11 September 2001, the situation has grown worse, and we have seen an increase in tensions and violence, particularly of an anti-Islamic nature. We must emphasise once again that racism and xenophobia constitute a clear violation of the principles of freedom, democracy, fundamental freedoms and respect for human rights as well as the Rule of Law – principles on which the European Union is founded and which are common to all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Discrimination on the grounds of race or ethnic origin is prohibited in all States, but there are considerable disparities in the scope, the wording and the implementation of this ban. The Member States must be able to introduce or uphold provisions that are more favourable to protecting the principle of equal treatment. It is crucial, however, that minimum standards exist at European level. Those who commit this type of offence must not be able to exploit these disparities and escape legal proceedings by moving from one country to another.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal for a framework decision must lead to the approximation of national criminal laws, providing a common approach, which will enable racist acts in the European Union to be effectively prosecuted.</p>
<p class="contents">It can never be emphasised too much, however, that there must be an equitable balance between combating the scourge of racism and xenophobia and safeguarding fundamental rights and freedoms, specifically the freedom of expression, the freedom of the press and freedom of association. For the sake of truth, however, it should also be pointed out that clamping down on racist acts, especially violent ones, is not the only way to fight racism. It must first of all be prevented, through education about equality and through the adoption of intelligent policies that do not provoke undesirable reactions. This is a highly topical example of the measures to be adopted in the field of asylum and immigration policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Immigrants who, at the end of the day, mostly come from countries which are the wretched victims of exploitation, including by countries in the European Union. At the same time, many countries, such as Greece, which perhaps has the highest percentage of immigrants, apply practices which are crude, barbaric infringements of immigrants' fundamental human rights. It was recently revealed that 2 700 immigrants were being held in such appalling conditions that they took to the streets in protest.</p>

As the rapporteur points out, freedom of expression under the democratic Rule of Law has limits and, therefore, cannot be used as a justification for breaching the rights of third parties or for committing criminal acts. Unfortunately, in various areas of Europe, we are still seeing expressions of racism and xenophobia, which are unacceptable in our democratic societies. An integrated approach that includes both preventive measures and measures involving criminal proceedings is crucial in order effectively to combat this phenomenon. Measures in the field of criminal law such as those laid down in the Commission proposal constitute one element of this approach. On the other hand, however, the Commission has always stressed that this must be a fight of a cultural nature and has for this reason already adopted various awareness-raising measures to combat racism and xenophobia in fields such as employment, immigration, asylum policy and the education system.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the amendments to the Commission proposal for a framework decision, the rapporteur argues that the fact that an offence concerning racism and xenophobia is committed<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>by means of mass communication should be considered as an aggravating circumstance. The Commission is flexible with regard to other aggravating circumstances. It might be more appropriate, however, in this House, to talk about material targeted at a large number of people, given that racist material distributed by one individual, for example, the manual distribution of racist propaganda, could also be intended for a large number of people.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 6 and 12(b) refer to the directive on electronic commerce concerning the responsibility of Internet service providers. Indeed, the provisions of the framework decision do not prejudice any instrument of the first pillar, specifically the "electronic commerce" directive. In this regard, it should be emphasised that, according to this directive, the Member States cannot impose the general obligation on service providers to monitor content, but can establish the obligation to inform the competent authorities about alleged illegal activities or information communicated by users. Consequently, providers’ responsibility can be established provided that Internet service providers are genuinely aware that they are harbouring racist material. In other words, that their attention has been drawn to this fact by a judicial authority by means of criminal proceedings, if these providers have not, in the meantime, adopted measures to remove this material. The Commission takes a slightly different view to that of the rapporteur on making the public condoning of crimes of genocide and of other extremely serious crimes illegal. The conditions imposed by Amendment No 12 on this section are more rigorous than those recommended in the joint action of 1996 because they require the words or behaviour in question to be threatening, abusive or insulting and motivated by racism or xenophobia. The joint action approved six years ago only required the public condoning to be undertaken with a racist or xenophobic objective. Consequently, the conditions imposed by Amendment No 12 would establish a higher threshold for criminal proceedings to be initiated, and so we requested that this issue be considered by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to emphasise that our proposal is clear on the matter of the definition and classification of the crime, because we always deal in practical actions and not in opinions. The proposal for a framework decision cannot be interpreted in a way that threatens fundamental rights, specifically the freedom of expression and the principles recognised in Articles 10 and 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In European law, however, as in the law of every Member State of the European Union, the appropriate balance must be guaranteed. As laid down in Article 10(2) of the European Convention, the exercise of these freedoms, specifically the freedom of expression, can and must be weighed up against protecting order, against crime prevention and against protecting the honour or the rights of third parties. In this context, we are not proposing to create some kind of thought police; we are simply calling for the Union as a whole to be faithful to the values of our common heritage as expressed in the European Convention on Human Rights. Hence the clear political message, in other words, that racists and xenophobic crimes are fought vigorously and in an equivalent way throughout the European Union.</p>
