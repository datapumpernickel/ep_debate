<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ries (ALDE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before I do anything else I should like to offer my warm thanks to all of the Members of this House who have shown great interest in this important subject. I shall first thank the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Trakatellis, Mrs Corbey, Mr Staes, Mrs de Brún. I should also like to thank, of course, all of the Members who provided invaluable help while I was drawing up this report. I appreciate their help.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate in all of the political groups has been heated and, I would say, in keeping with the challenges and expectations. 89% of European citizens have said that they are extremely concerned about the impact of the environment on their health, and with good reason. The figures are revealing and I shall just mention a few of them: one sixth of child deaths and diseases in Europe can be attributed to environmental causes; the incidence of respiratory allergic diseases has doubled over the last 20 years, today affecting one in seven children; almost 10% of workers are exposed to carcinogenic substances; 14% of couples seek help because of difficulty in conceiving. I could cite more figures and examples, and, indeed, the Members of this House have not hesitated to do this during the course of the debates.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission responded to these figures in June 2003 by launching the SCALE environment and health strategy, which stands for Science, Children, Awareness, Legal instruments, Evaluation. This initiative gave rise to much hope, which was well summed up by Commissioner Wallström’s statement during the debate in plenary in March of last year. She said, and I quote, ‘there are certain areas where we cannot risk waiting until our knowledge is complete, but need to act according to the precautionary principle, and we shall do so’.</p>
<p class="contents">This European strategy ought to act as a launch pad for the Action Plan before us, for which I am the rapporteur, but this is not this case. This action plan, as far as I am concerned, does not live up to its name. It would be more accurately described as a programme to assess the overall impact of the environment on health. It does, of course, raise a wide range of interesting points which are worth mentioning and I would highlight the following: raising awareness of the risks run by the citizens, training experts in health and the environment – of whom there are far too few – and the introduction of biomonitoring at European level. I feel that there are many interesting initiatives, but these do not dispel the sense of incompleteness that came through when I read the Commission’s communication.</p>
<p class="contents">It strikes me that an approach that takes the paradigm for the 21st century as absolute scientific evidence goes against the precautionary principle. The 52 European environment and health ministers who gathered in Budapest last June for a conference on the theme of ‘A future for our children’ took this on board when they placed emphasis on the delicate yet necessary balance between more research and the urgent need to take preventative action to protect people’s health. We should endeavour to strike that balance here.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we made exposure to dangerous chemical substances one of the priorities of this report. More specifically, in paragraph 6, we call for the precautionary principle to be applied to a range of substances that are damaging to health, particularly certain heavy metals, such as mercury and cadmium, six products from the phthalate family used in PVC plastics and four insecticides suspected of being, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, endocrine disruptors and at the root of serious malformations.</p>
<p class="contents">Reinforcing this European plan is also a matter of drawing inspiration from the ambitious actions already put in place by the Member States, and achieving success. I mention these in points 23 and 28 of the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also delighted that Members of this House support the approach that I have taken aimed at placing children at the heart of this Action Plan, including the request that the Commission should carry out an epidemiological study on children, from birth to 18 years of age.</p>
<p class="contents">A further crucial aspect is the fight against passive smoking. The Commission has taken this consideration on board, and this is something that we welcome. It is seeking to designate environmental tobacco smoke a class 1 carcinogen. Let us be clear on this issue: as far as I am concerned, the message that we send out to the public, covered in point 20 of the resolution, must not be watered down in any way. Tobacco smoke kills both smokers and non-smokers. In Belgium alone, 2 000 people a year die from the effects of passive smoking, which is as high as the number of victims of road accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I hope that the Commission proves to be ambitious in implementing this Action Plan for the next six years. I have no doubt, Mr Dimas, that you will work in tandem with your colleague, Mr Kyprianou, in order to ensure the necessary complementarity between the Action Plan and the European Public Health Programme. You can, of course, rely on our support in Parliament to obtain the appropriate financing to meet the challenges that I have just spoken about, under the seventh research framework programme and in chapter four of the financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I hope that you are predisposed towards your services drawing up a green paper on pollution inside buildings, from crèches to homes and schools, which remains the poor relation of environmental legislation. All of which is to say that Europe must learn the lessons from the scandals of smoking and asbestos, to name but two. Europe is involved in a race against time, and against all forms of pollution. Commissioner, we have a duty, both the Commission and Parliament, to ensure that the health of the citizens – all of the citizens – takes precedence over other considerations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dimas,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, I fully endorse what Mrs Ries said at the end, that the links between the environment and health are a particularly important priority for the European Commission and Europe. That is why I am grateful for your committee's help in drafting the report which we are debating today. I should particularly like to thank Mrs Ries for all her constructive efforts to improve the content of the report, so that the final text constitutes a substantive and useful basis for all further debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to start by reiterating the objective of the action plan adopted last June. We should not forget that we are not starting from scratch. Indeed, having recognised for some time that environmental protection helps to improve health, we have already done a great deal of work in this sector. The forthcoming environmental and other legislation, including the REACH proposals and measures which will be taken within the framework of thematic strategies, will be of even greater help in resolving the outstanding problems.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards current issues, numerous efforts are being made to reinforce European Union policies designed to improve health and environmental protection and this is something that will certainly continue.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of the action plan is to further promote this work and, at the same time, to determine the agenda for the future. Thus, possible weaknesses will be addressed and a future environmental policy will be laid down which is more efficient, more focused and more cost-effective.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the conclusions of the report, I should like to start by assuring you that the precautionary principle is an important essential element of our policy and we do, of course, intend to continue to apply it in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as biomonitoring is concerned, we agree. It can indeed be an essential element in our policy for risk evaluation, as the report suggests. We shall study this view in detail. Nonetheless, the Commission would like first to carefully examine all aspects of the problem, both technical and financial, in the light of experience gained from third countries, such as the United States. The cost, it should be noted, is very high.</p>
<p class="contents">We likewise agree on air inside buildings. The possibility of developing a strategy and research agenda on this subject will be examined, so that the relevant problems can be identified and proposals can be made for possible ways of addressing them.</p>
<p class="contents">If the measures in the action plan are to be implemented, the question of financing needs to be addressed, as Mrs Ries has quite rightly noted and emphasised. I agree that this is needed in order to safeguard efficient application of the plan. For the period up to 2007, the Commission will finance the budgets of the four Directorates-General involved, of the programme in the public health sector and of the Sixth Research Framework Programme. From 2007 onwards, new headings will be available within the framework of the new financial perspectives. The Commission is engaged in intensive consultations on the detailed arrangements for applying the various measures included in the action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">Another particularly important issue which is necessary for the application of the action plan is the regular submission of reports to the European Parliament. Of course, the Commission will report to the relevant parliamentary committee on progress with the action plan as regularly as possible. Of course, progress on certain issues, such as efficiency and the cost-benefit ratio may not be possible in the short term. Within this framework, all the data and information needed simply do not exist. Nonetheless, the possibility for more detailed reports will exist as soon as the integrated information system is up and running.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the ban on substances, an issue on which Mrs Ries spoke earlier, dangerous substances are an issue which particularly concerns the Commission. However, the action plan is not the most suitable framework for debating possible bans. We have already laid down procedures for evaluating and reducing the risk of many of these substances. These procedures which, as I said, already exist, will continue to progress alongside the action plan. The Commission is carefully examining the proposal in the report to increase the number of priorities in the action plan. However, increasing the number of priorities will weaken the focus and results of the action plan, which is why it would be preferable to limit the priorities to those proposed in the action plan, which have been defined in close cooperation with 300 experts and involved agencies. That is why, on the basis of the contribution of these 300 experts, we have not limited the focus to children alone, because there are directly related issues and we therefore also have to examine adults.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I should like to stress that, if the action plan is to be applied effectively, active and close cooperation is needed with all the agencies involved. That is why I should like once again to thank Mrs Ries and the European Parliament for their important contribution in this sector. Our common objective is to promote stronger European measures to improve health and environmental protection for all Europeans, for Europe and for the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schnellhardt (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Environment and Health Action Plan 2004-2010 before us today, combined with the proposals from our rapporteur, Mrs Ries, is equal to the heavy demands we are making of it. Its numerous projects are capable of significantly improving our knowledge about environmental impacts on health, and thus provide stronger scientific foundations for our legislative process. Furthermore, it could enable our legislation to become preventive, which is perhaps even more valuable. Maybe I am somewhat optimistic about that point, but we all need to have some dreams!</p>
<p class="contents">Some projects will certainly be completed by 2010. I have in mind, for example, improved coordination between the Member States in the field of environment and health, something that should have been sorted out long ago in the European Union. Most of the actions will, however, extend beyond 2010. The relationship between humankind and the environment is subject to constant change and often requires new actions and reactions. I believe that we should be taking steps now to ensure that this action plan does not come to an end in 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">The action plan will, however, be successful only if we do not implement it in isolation from the necessary economic processes and pressures and from people’s lifestyles. It will be successful only if we monitor research results as regards their general validity instead of treating the world like a laboratory. Our actions must be based on risk analysis and not on ideology.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 5 of the resolution contained in the report is doubtless well intentioned, but even the precautionary principle can only be applied if there is an appreciable risk and firm findings. Legislating on the basis of panic mongering is surely not the way to go and I cannot take this seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">Much the same applies to the substances listed in paragraph 6, which are to be replaced by other substances. I agree with the Commissioner on this: this would breach the principle of the action plan, because we should not be concentrating on things that are covered by EU regulations, such as the REACH programme. Apart from the fact that available substitutes are costly, we also know little about the risks of exposure to them. So things need to be weighed up carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards smoking, I am in total agreement with the Commissioner: it is not for us in the European Union to be enacting laws in this area; we should instead be encouraging the Member States to proceed in the right direction here.</p>

She has done important work in fleshing out the Environment and Health Action Plan more effectively. The action programme itself is disappointing. Whilst I do, of course, recognise the need for research, an action programme also requires strong measures to tackle health problems, and those measures are lacking. In recent weeks, our discussions have centred around dangerous substances and the conditions under which they can, or must, be removed from the market. Softening agents in toys are the most prominent, but there are also other substances at issue. Although our group accepted the text as approved in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we did actually want a stricter approach. If a substance is dangerous, it should be removed from the market without delay and without waiting for safe alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">A second subject of discussion was smoking. Tobacco smoke has a devastating effect on the health of passive smokers. We would therefore call for active policy to ban smoking in public places. We urge all Member States to draw inspiration from the Irish and Italian examples. The environment and health report is topical. Air pollution, in particular, is an important problem in Europe. According to calculations and studies commissioned by the Commission, every year, more than 300 000 people die prematurely in Europe as a result of air pollution. In the Netherlands, the figure is 13 000. Little imagination is required to assume that deaths occur more frequently among people living near motorways and industrial areas than in people living in leafy and exclusive residential areas. Over the past 20 years, Europe has, of course, taken measures that have brought about major reductions in emissions. The use of catalytic converters in cars has been successful, but too little effort has been made to date, and the statistics are alarming. What is to be done? First of all, we should, of course, better observe existing legislation, but more can, and must, be done. Where, for example, are the soot filters in cars? Also, we should question whether the limits and limit values in legislation are adequate. In the report ‘Signals 2004’, the European Environment Agency noted that there is increasing evidence to suggest that dust and ozone concentrations impact on health below current health protection values. A European approach is required to protect the environment, health and the consumer. In the framework of the Lisbon process, ambitious environmental policy is an incentive for technological development and for boosting European competitiveness. If we do not commit to environmental quality, then not only do we do public health, but also European industry, a huge disservice. At the Detroit car show last month, a zero-emission passenger car was launched, the like of which we have not seen at European car shows. Over here, we remain stuck in the question as to who should pay for soot filters. I prefer an ambitious Europe with adequate measures to protect public health, and we should make those soot filters compulsory without delay. That is vital. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Speakers deserve to be treated with a bit of respect in this Chamber!</p>
<p class="contents">This report on the European Environment and Health Action Plan concentrates too much on chemicals. Too little attention is paid to many other things that have an adverse affect on human health. It is clear that there are risks associated with chemicals, but there is little point in drawing up blacklists and thus stigmatising certain substances such as phthalates. The report is based on an exaggerated interpretation of the precautionary principle. It talks about direct and total bans on certain substances without basing them on scientific findings, or without taking account of known scientific findings, as is customary with the precautionary principle.</p>
<p class="contents">This report represents another attempt at a zero-risk policy, at what I call the ‘green disease’ prevalent in many western societies. We are trying to apply a comprehensive insurance mentality to environmental protection, forgetting that there are always risks associated with the development of an open society. The mere existence of a risk and widespread fear of chemicals are used to justify demands for total bans.</p>
<p class="contents">Fear is nothing more than uncertainty arising from ignorance. If you want to counter fear, you must combat ignorance. To do that you need to promote science and research, and to draw the correct conclusions from your findings. We should not confuse risks with dangers that are actually present. The priority objective of environmental policy should not be to exclude risks, but to identify and eliminate dangers.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also overshoots the mark when it comes to dealing with tobacco smoke. As long as tobacco is a legal product, we should hold back from demanding a total ban on smoking. It is not for Europe to determine where you can and cannot smoke. In the report we call for tobacco smoke to be designated a class 1 carcinogen, indicating that it has a proven and direct effect. I would like to remind you that there is as yet no scientific proof for that. I am not suggesting that the health dangers of tobacco smoke should be played down, but putting tobacco smoke in the same category as substances such as benzene or asbestos is nothing short of environmental populism.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that we should be holding this debate in Brussels, not in Strasbourg. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
