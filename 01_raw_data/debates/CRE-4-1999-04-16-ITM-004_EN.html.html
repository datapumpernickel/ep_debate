<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">McMahon </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span><span class="italic">rapporteur. ‐</span> Mr President, this is a joint report by my colleague, Mr Schiedermeier, and myself. Indeed, on the subject of Italy, which we will be discussing, I remember a few years ago we went to Italy with the Social Affairs Committee. The Secretariat did not know who was <span class="italic">doyen d'age</span> , the oldest Member. They thought it was Mr Schiedermeier because he had white hair. In actual fact, when they checked the records, I was a few weeks older than him, so it should have been me. So it was quite interesting that we were both approaching our 60th year.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is the result of the conference which we held on the elderly in October. It put forward the views of the elderly citizens of the Community, what they might like to see for the future, and what kind of recommendations we would make for the United Nations Year of the Elderly. The elderly – senior citizens, or ‘grey panthers", as they are called in the United States; ‘grey power" in the UK – represent a very important part of the Community. I see many of the ‘golden oldies" or ‘grey oldies" around me this morning: on my left, Mr Schiedermeier, on my right Mr Falconer. They have changed their usual political positions.</p>
<p class="contents">The conference came up with some recommendations which we have put to the Commission. The Commission is bringing forward a communication on problems of the elderly. We are not just talking about people beyond the age of retirement, we are talking about people from 60 years of age to 75. There are 75 million people over the age of 60 in the European Union. This will increase. Demographic trends are going to create a time‐bomb for the decision‐makers of the future. We must be able to respond to this. Ageing is high on the EU's political agenda. I am quite sure that in the next few weeks, when our colleagues go to the hustings, they will be besieged by many of the Community's senior citizens, asking what the European Parliament is going to do for them. Over 42 % of voters in the EU are over 50 years of age. So, if we have 75 million people over the age of 60 and 42 % of the voters are over 50 years of age, obviously the issues of senior citizens and the elderly are going to be important in campaigning.</p>
<p class="contents">The over−50s represent 33 % of the whole population of the EU; one‐third of the EU is over 50. Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty outlaws discrimination on the grounds of age, sex, gender, disability, sexual orientation, etc. It now gives the Commission a legal peg to introduce measures for the elderly and senior citizens. At the moment the Commission is constrained by the existing legal bases. But the Amsterdam Treaty now gives the Commission the opportunity to deal with discrimination on the grounds of race or age. We look forward to seeing what will come out of the employment guidelines which the Commission agreed at the conference in Luxembourg and some of the discussions about the European Social Fund and older workers. There are tremendous possibilities there. Fifty‐one percent of all men seeking work are in the 50‐64 age group. There will probably be some Members, like myself, who are in a similar position after 13 June. The percentage for women is the same: 51 % of women who are seeking work are in the 50‐64 age group.</p>
<p class="contents">Employment is a very serious issue for this age group. It is time that we, in the institutions, put our own house in order and deal with the ageism that we practice in some of our recruitment policies.</p>
<p class="contents">So what can we do about this, now having stated the problem? The Amsterdam Treaty is one area where we can do something. Health is another area. I would hope that the Commission will bring forward an action programme on health for elderly people and for the whole Community under Article 137.</p>
<p class="contents">The elderly are not a homogeneous group. We must not treat them just as elderly and lock them away in a cupboard or parcel them off and say ‘that is elderly". We must try to pull the Union and its citizens together and have genuine solidarity. We must not just limit our measures to older people themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">So these are some of the measures we are putting forward. I would like to thank Mr Schiedermeier for his cooperation. I thank the staff of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment. As this is my swan song as rapporteur for this mandate, I must say I have enjoyed my experience this year.</p>

On the one hand there is the catalogue – one and a half pages long – of previous findings, meetings, resolutions, petitions and reports, and on the other hand it took almost a year between the decision to hold a conference, which was adopted on 16 October 1997, and the conference itself on 1 and 2 October 1998. We rapporteurs faced many initial difficulties. The President of the European Parliament, for example, refused us the use of the plenary chamber, so that we had to squeeze into our group meeting rooms. Moreover, interpreting facilities were originally offered for only three target languages, to name only one of many other obstacles.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Senior Citizens' Parliament that was held in Luxembourg, Mrs Lulling, from 22 to 24 November 1993 was attended by 508 senior citizens as well as 50 Members of the European Parliament and 15 representatives of institutions. Our senior citizens' conference was authorised for 131 participants and two MEPs, namely the rapporteurs. The report is being presented and discussed here today – on a Friday, which is known to be the day with the lowest turnout of Members. In the face of all this evidence, who still dares to speak of the growing recognition accorded to senior citizens? Not I, to be sure! Everyone talks about demographic development. As Mr McMahon said, 75 million people in the European Union are over 60 years of age. That represents more than 20 % of the population, and this is tending to rise because of the steady increase in life expectancy.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, few observers are aware of the heterogeneous nature of the community of senior citizens. There are huge differences in terms of prosperity, social status and physical capacity. Many people, thank God, reach retirement age in full possession of their mental and physical faculties today and remain fit up to a ripe old age.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the obvious problems. Unemployment has already been mentioned. It affects a disproportionately large number of older people. What is more, the unemployment statistics do not include those who have taken early retirement or who, for some other reason, are not counted among the active population. In other words, unemployment among the older age groups is far higher than the figures would suggest. And then there is the ostracism and victimisation that occur in workplaces. Attempts are made to root out older colleagues from the group or company boardroom and the shop floor. Add to these the regular discrimination which is a fact of everyday life.</p>
<p class="contents">It is astonishing that society does not really recognise its own failure to harness the experience and potential of older generations. Far more importance should be attached to making room for senior citizens, especially in the voluntary sector but also in the workplace. On the basis of their own experience, they could impart a great deal of useful information and advice to junior staff. As far as material wealth is concerned, the fact that poverty is still rife among the elderly, and especially among elderly women, is undisputed. There is still a great deal to be done here.</p>
<p class="contents">But there are smart people out there, especially younger people, who are now saying that they want to terminate their social contract with the older generation. I asked some of them, 'So do you also want to renounce the benefits that the elderly have obtained for you? Do you intend never to use a motorway again? Are you willing to give up free university study? Do you intend to stop using the hospitals and clinics we have provided?' That silenced them. Additional voluntary pensions must not diminish the existing solidarity pact between the generations. That is very important to me.</p>
<p class="contents">Management and labour, government bodies, the Member States and the European Union must adopt the appropriate countermeasures in their respective areas of responsibility; in other words, they must not seek to centralise their responsibilities in this sector but must pursue a coordinated and, where appropriate, a cooperative policy on senior citizens in the EU. First and foremost, there is a need to initiate and encourage a new approach to the elderly within society, and I consider it very important that this approach should serve to prevent discrimination against older employees and the elderly in general. Unless society changes its thinking, not even legally enforceable rights will do any good. In our report we have presented a long list of instruments through which our aims for senior citizens can be achieved. A number of useful points emerged from the preparatory phase before the conference when the Group of the European People's Party, the Senior Citizens' Union and numerous experts in the field shared their experiences.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank my group, especially my colleagues Ria Oomen‐Ruijten and Bartho Pronk, my assistant Mrs Stein and the staff of the group delegation in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, as well as the group secretariat. All of their efforts in this matter went far beyond the call of duty.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me express my sincere thanks to Mr McMahon of the Group of the Party of European Socialists for our close and harmonious cooperation over the past year and a half, during which we became friends. A sorrow shared is a sorrow halved. The sad thing we both learned was that performance and experience in senior citizens count for nothing. Our parties, especially the heads of our parties, have blocked our bids to stand for re‐election, and so we share the same fate. For all that may be said to the contrary, fulsome praise and discrimination are never far apart for the elderly, in politics as elsewhere. There is still much to be done for senior citizens. Please let us set about it. This was also my last report to the House, Mr President, and I thank you for your patience.</p>

I shall not spend any time enumerating the really good initiatives and options it contains, because we can all read that for ourselves. The title ‘Senior citizens in the 21st century' strikes me as being very ambitious as well as presenting an obligation. It challenges us in Parliament, along with the Commission and the Council, to develop a far‐sighted policy for the over−60s in the European Union, of whom there are already 75 million. Most people over the age of 60 are in full possession of their mental and physical powers. I would go along with Mr Schiedermeier and Mr McMahon on that. There is still a huge amount of discrimination everywhere, and I believe these people have no desire to be treated as basket cases; all they rightly ask of policymakers and society is a level playing field and a social safety net.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that we have the Treaty of Amsterdam and its Article 13 on the suppression of discrimination, including age discrimination, we have a legal basis for common European action. We did adopt a senior citizens' programme a few years ago, but it was blocked in the Council by the Conservative Governments of Britain and Germany on the flimsy grounds that there was no reliable legal basis and that it was ultimately a matter for national governments to pursue such a policy. But this meant that there was no accompanying activity of any description at European level, and that the information links which were already established between senior citizens' organisations in the European Union were no longer financed, which resulted in some of them fading into oblivion.</p>
<p class="contents">We could truly have made more progress by now, and I hope that we shall advance in future on the basis of this report. My wish for all the people of Europe is that both the senior and the junior citizens of the Union will be able to live together in solidarity.</p>

<p class="contents">What our two rapporteurs have proposed in the 30 paragraphs of the resolution and in the introductory recitals is naturally music to our ears. It is sheer balm on the wounds of many elderly people, especially women, to discover that their special problems have not been forgotten, and my heartfelt thanks go to the rapporteurs for that. You are so right to emphasise that the older people in our countries possess a rich treasury of experience, knowledge, education and values that we cannot afford to cast aside, that a general rethinking of conventional attitudes and stereotypes is necessary, and that society must adopt a new approach with a view to combating the many different forms of discrimination and social exclusion to which older people are subjected both at work and in the social arena.</p>
<p class="contents">They call for research and better practice in the care of age‐related diseases. In this connection, I should not like to miss the opportunity to point out the urgent need for better information regarding the fact that moderate and regular consumption of wine is the best way of preventing age‐related diseases such as Alzheimer's, for which we now have scientific evidence.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">It would, however, be necessary for the northern Member States such as your own, Commissioner Liikanen, to reduce their unduly high excise duties on wine so as to enable all citizens of the Union, be they young or old, to enjoy that particular form of preventive medicine.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the pension rights of the elderly, and especially of women, I should like to refer to two initiatives I have taken here, both of which resulted in unanimously adopted parliamentary reports. The first relates to the splitting of pension rights acquired during married life in favour of women who have given up their careers to look after their families and who, in the event of divorce after 20 or more years of marriage, are particularly liable to fall below the poverty line. We also called for a Commission initiative in this area, but nothing has happened.</p>
<p class="contents">The second initiative related to the social security of those who assist their self‐employed spouses. Here too, we called for an improvement of the 1986 directive on the equal treatment of self‐employed persons and their assisting spouses. Once again, nothing has happened.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, allow me to say one more thing. I should like to refer to a paragraph in the resolution, the one concerning the participation of older people in decision‐making processes, including the political process, since there are naturally those elements who take pride in presenting the list of candidates with the lowest average age. It is surely ironic that our two rapporteurs have fallen victim to that very tendency and have not been selected as candidates in the forthcoming elections. What makes that all the more regrettable in my eyes is the high regard we have had for their work here, since it is undoubtedly discrimination against the ever‐increasing number of elderly people to omit such competent and sprightly colleagues from the party lists. That was just something I felt I had to say here, Mr President. Although I should be delighted if I were re‐elected to the European Parliament, I should find it most regrettable if I were to be returned as the oldest Member!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lindqvist (ELDR).</span>  – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, I too would like to thank the two rapporteurs, who have illustrated the point that ‘you are as young as you feel". The situation today is different from what it was 20 or 30 years ago, in that many older people in society are now in better health. We therefore need to galvanise public opinion so as to ensure that people"s later years are seen as a pleasant phase of life, and this means providing information and support, as well as consolidating national legislation. We see discrimination against senior citizens; older people have problems with their sight and hearing; they can find themselves more affected by unemployment than other groups; and they run the risk of social exclusion. All this illustrates the need to work ceaselessly to mobilise public awareness in a bid to prevent certain groups in society from being marginalised.</p>
<p class="contents">My view is that policy for senior citizens should be dealt with primarily at national level; it is to national legislation that we should turn. In Sweden, the Swedish Parliament sets the general parameters, but responsibility for social and health care for the elderly lies further down the line, with the regional and local bodies operating at the grass roots. We need to ensure that this continues to be the case. There is no need for actual legislation at EU level, although benefit could be drawn from information, consultation and exchanges of experience, as well as from practical work, research and the sharing of results into Alzheimer"s disease or other health problems which affect senior citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Social legislation is perhaps the most important instrument available to a country, since its effects are felt by people in their everyday lives. We cannot therefore afford to make concessions in this area; the whole issue must continue to be dealt with at regional and local level.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not too happy about the manner in which the report calls on the Member States to implement measures affecting areas such as pensions, health care, housing and jobs. The points made are not incorrect, but it is in reality up to the national authorities, not the EU, to take decisions on these matters. We in the European Parliament are quite entitled to our views, but rather than ‘calling" for action, we would perhaps be better advised to ‘recommend" or ‘suggest".</p>
<p class="contents">There is however one area where we do have considerable scope for improving the lives of senior citizens in very practical ways, and I am thinking here of how we can use the machinery of European cooperation to ensure mutual recognition of acquired social rights such as sickness pay and pensions. Senior citizens often have entitlements of this kind and we are in a position to exercise considerable influence here, given that there are major shortcomings in the system when people move from one country to another.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me end by reiterating my fundamental point. It is all very well to encourage public awareness, to hold conferences on issues affecting senior citizens and to run campaigns focusing on their concerns. When it comes to legislation and its implementation, however, action must be taken nationally, regionally and locally.</p>

Ladies and gentlemen, this is indeed the first speech I have made in Parliament, and I am very happy to have the opportunity to speak on such an important matter. The extent and seriousness of the problems facing older people have up till now been paid too little attention in the European Union. Our rapporteur, Hugh McMahon, and Edgar Schiedermeier have worked hard, not only in producing this report, but also in organising a conference on the elderly, the outcome of which forms the main basis for this report. I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their success in taking all the essential aspects of this matter into account: the status of older people on the labour market, their special training needs, and questions of income and services. In addition, I think their basic position is the right one. Senior citizens are to be seen as a resource that society should exploit more and not as a problem we have to solve at minimum expense.</p>
<p class="contents">As the average age of the European labour force rises all the time, it is vital that people should be able to work until they are of pensionable age. This will require changes at work both in attitudes and in the organisation of work. Work must adapt to people"s skills and abilities, rather than insisting that people adapt to the demands of work. Older people have much of the sort of knowledge and skill which could be put to better use, as long as they are willing to participate. However, it is more difficult for them than it is for young people to adapt to a very fast pace of working. In many workplaces problems have been caused by pressure, when an attempt is made to achieve the same results with a reduced workforce of lower‐paid employees. In my opinion, the public sector should set an example to employers and be capable of thinking in the longer term. It is of no benefit to society if older workers are forced into early retirement, when they might still be able to work if conditions were more suitable.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the greatest problems older people have on the labour market is their poor level of training. In all European countries those over the age of 45 have clearly received poorer levels of training than those below that age. The difference in my country, Finland, is the greatest among all the OECD countries. Unless older workers can be trained up for new jobs, we face the threat of age discrimination on the labour market while many sectors are suffering from labour shortages. Training for older people has to be tailored to their needs. It has to take account of their poor basic levels of training, which in turn often give rise to poor motivation when it comes to training. For that reason, training must be closely linked with practical work.</p>
<p class="contents">Ageing, as with many human phenomena, affects men and women in different ways: it is by no means a gender‐neutral phenomenon. I am very pleased that the rapporteur took account of the special problems of older women. Age discrimination on the labour market affects women quite a lot earlier than it does men. A woman of 40 is often too old, in the opinion of the employer.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial inequality that exists between men and women becomes even more noticeable when the age of retirement is reached. In all countries women"s pensions are substantially smaller than men"s. This is a result of both women"s lower rates of pay, which thus cause them to suffer doubly, and the fact that women"s careers are often short and fragmented as a result of family care obligations. For this reason, it is very important for women that all people of pensionable age be guaranteed an adequate basic pension, supplemented by an employer"s pension scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">Although retirement schemes naturally differ from country to country, I believe there should be a statutory minimum income at Union level, which Member States should guarantee citizens who are unable to work or for whom there is no work available. Numerous voluntary organisations have proposed that, next time the Treaty is revised, it should incorporate a list of citizens" basic rights, including their right to a basic income. Thank you for allowing me to speak here, and I can see that you have listened very attentively to me. I would like to thank you all for that too!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van Bladel </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the title of this report sounds very promising, but I think the biggest setback for senior citizens at the moment – and I count myself as one of them – has been the resignation of the Commission, which has meant that Commissioner Monti"s plans for a directive to liberalise the European market in pension funds has had to be shelved for the time being. Much as I admire the rapporteurs, in my view the report focuses too much on the idea of a dependent older generation, which I find a rather patronising attitude. I know people in their 80s and 90s who have lived through two world wars and are still completely independent.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course I also realise that there is a category of older people who are more needy, but they are a national responsibility. The rapporteurs refer three times in their report to discrimination against older women. This is rather too much, and is undoubtedly the result of pressure from Parliament"s Committee on Women"s Rights, as well as being a bit of a nod in the direction of the substantial numbers of women voters. I am a senior citizen, an older woman, and there are many like me who do not need patronising. We want to be free to take our pensions with us to other countries, and we want no age discrimination. We also want to be protected against tax disadvantages if we continue to work after our pension has started, both in our own countries and in all the Member States of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also fails to consider the potential wealth of knowledge that those over 65 possess and the trend on the labour market to keep more and more people in this category involved in the employment process. In some countries, the underlying aim is for these people to continue to pay contributions so that there is enough money to pay pensions to the growing numbers of older people. Seventy‐five million people over the age of 60 do not just want a sense of belonging to society, they also particularly want realistic legislation within the EU single market. I am not saying that this report is pointless, but it concentrates too much on the welfare side and certainly does not live up to the title of ‘Senior citizens in the 21st century: a new lease of life". That aspect is not covered at all.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Schörling </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, we have heard how the segment of society comprising senior citizens is growing fast in the EU and in Europe as a whole. Seventy‐five million people alive today are 60 years old or more, and that is one fifth of the total population. In the year 2000, over 20 million people will be in their eighties. That truly is a demographic revolution.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is therefore very timely and I would congratulate the two rapporteurs. I also very much appreciated the conference held in Brussels in October and entitled ‘Senior citizens in the 21st century – a new lease of life". I personally found this one of the most rewarding events I have attended during my time as a Member of the European Parliament. Some very exciting issues were raised. And – as one who has crossed the threshold into her fifties – it gave me fresh hope to meet all those stimulating and inspired older people. My guests from Sweden were also full of praise for the conference.</p>
<p class="contents">From my point of view, the most important elements in this text are contained in recitals D and E. Here the point is made that, just because a person has reached pensionable age, he or she does not have to stop leading an active life. On the contrary, many people take on new commitments and projects after retirement, not to mention all those who only manage to fulfil their working dreams after they stop work proper. We need to review our traditional attitudes towards senior citizens and rethink the roles we expect them to play in society. This applies particularly to the world of work.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 7 contains a series of ideas as to how our vision of the labour market and senior citizens can be rendered more flexible and up to date. There is a reference to promoting innovative forms of transition between work and retirement, for example a whole new model of part‐time working for older persons.</p>
<p class="contents">The notion of a flexible retirement age is fundamental. Senior citizens organisations in Sweden have been calling for this, as has my own party, the Greens. Many people simply cannot carry on working until they are 65, whilst others can continue until they are 70 or more, and are happy to do so. What is required, therefore, is a flexible retirement age and a new attitude towards older people.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Blot </span> <span class="bold">(NI).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, both rapporteurs are of course right to emphasise the importance of a policy for senior citizens in Europe, especially in view of the development of the population pyramid.</p>
<p class="contents">They address economic and social issues in their report and, in particular, the problem of access to the labour market. I believe that this particular issue could remain in the realms of wishful thinking: present growth rates will continue and the already high level of unemployment – which affects the younger generations in particular – will persist in the future. We would therefore require economic conditions that are very different from those that exist today to enable older people to have access to the labour market, in addition to abolishing discriminatory legislation in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The cultural issues were not neglected by the rapporteurs and rightly so. Paragraph 28, in particular, stresses the need to project a better image of the elderly in our society. In this connection, I must say that we have regressed somewhat in comparison with ancient societies. Ancient Greece, to which we owe the best part of our civilisation, rightly valued the experience and wisdom of the elderly. We therefore have to tackle a genuine ideology of underestimating the value of the past.</p>
<p class="contents">This ideology of underestimating the value of the past and thus the value of older people too, basically dates back to the Romanticism of the last century, and it is a cultural obstacle that we will have to overcome. Nowadays, we think that everything new is therefore better. This is of course perfectly true in terms of science and technology, where knowledge is cumulative. But it is not necessarily the case with regard to ethics, aesthetics, human beings, in general terms, and institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, Solon, the great Greek lawmaker, who did not hesitate to innovate in his field either, always used to say: ‘A man when he grows old may learn many things – for he can no more learn much than he can run much; youth is the time for extraordinary toil". There is no doubt that, depending on the areas we are dealing with, being new is not necessarily always best, and in that respect, there is probably a significant cultural change to be made within our ancient European societies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is unfortunate that the report makes no reference to the demographic aspects, despite the fact that the rapporteurs discuss this right at the start of their report. Nothing will be possible, particularly on a financial level, if we do not correct the population pyramid in Europe, which reveals a real tragedy. If we look at this pyramid and our low birth rate we can see that there are more deaths than births. If we want to guarantee pensions, it is particularly vital to implement a broad family policy, which is not an issue here. I would possibly go so far as to say that we should adopt a pro‐birth policy, even if this term is looked down on nowadays.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, and in spite of all these omissions, I support the analyses carried out by our two rapporteurs.</p>

I believe that sums up this issue very neatly. One in four of the European population is directly involved, and it is our concern to focus on the self‐esteem of this section of the population, so that they can assume their role and their responsibility in society as we would wish them to do.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the working world, I believe we must ensure that we find models of best practice, that we ask ourselves how we can help to integrate older people into the labour force and help them to feel comfortable in their working environment. There are many models in Europe that are worth considering. We also favour flexible working hours to take account of the needs of older employees in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Parliament have been staunch advocates of the European Bus and have expressed the view that getting on and off public transport must be made easier, or indeed possible, for elderly people. Too little attention is paid to that, and we shall press hard for this demand from Parliament to be met. One of our aims in the field of research policy is to ensure that increased biotechnological research is conducted with a view to improving the health of all people, including the very elderly. The European Parliament has managed to ensure that an extra billion euros will henceforth be earmarked for research. I believe that is something to be proud of, something that will benefit our older citizens too.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">It is from that perspective that I should like to say just a few words. There can be no doubt that far too little is said in our countries about the problem of older people and that there is sometimes an excessively strong inclination to indulge in a certain glorification of youth. That is certainly warranted as a means of helping younger people to break through into public life. But we build and maintain structures that make it well‐nigh impossible for youth to have its head. The electoral system in our democracies is organised in such a way that young people find it extremely difficult to assert themselves. If there were a system whereby we really voted for candidates in small constituencies rather than parties – and such a system, I regret to say, has even been abandoned in Britain now – young people, and old people too, could assert themselves. That would be real democracy. What is being established today is not genuine democracy but rather a ‘partiocracy', in which party officials, through their power of selection, effectively have the right to decide where democracy begins and ends. In this connection, I should like to point out that one of our key demands is that the elderly should finally be given the greater freedom to which they have long aspired.</p>
<p class="contents">In the economic sector we are always talking about the free market, and rightly so. But for the elderly there is no such thing. Although people's pension rights are recognised when they reach retirement age, at which point they are ‘brought down a peg' in terms of social status, there is no recognition of the other rights they have acquired at earlier points in their lives. Surely people cannot be compelled to consent to the loss of these rights in order to avoid having to give up what they want to do. There happen to be elderly people who are very glad that they can go on working. In such cases we hear talk of keeping young people out of a job. That is not true. In my opinion there is only one country where this has been properly understood, namely Switzerland, strange as it may seem. In Switzerland, in the Swiss Parliament for example, there are many pensioners who bring the benefits of a lifetime of experience to their work. That is something on which we should insist, namely genuine freedom of choice for the elderly. Such freedom of choice would also help us to achieve some degree of control over the demographic pyramid to which some speakers have rightly referred, for the pyramid needs a broader base, and the breadth of that base is also restricted in our part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The main thing is to safeguard the freedom of the elderly.</p>

While it was still commonplace a hundred years ago for people to die at the age of 40, we are now averaging a life span of 80 years. A child born today is likely to reach 100 or more. One of the dreams of mankind has thus been fulfilled. We can live a second life, as people have always wanted to do, and it fills me with anger and rage when I read or hear talk of the ageing or indeed the senilisation of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">To the honourable lady from the Green Group, may I say that you have cut me to the quick. You used that very word, or at least that is how it was translated. When it comes to people who grow old because God has given them the genes to do so, let us please beware of speaking in terms of the onset of European senility. And there is something else that angers me. There is such a thing as human rights, of which this House is a vigorous advocate. So how do we reconcile that stance with a situation in which people at the age of 60 or 65, and sometimes even 55, are forced to give up their occupations, to stop working. Work is a very, very important aspect of human existence. There will undoubtedly be people who are weary of their work or who have performed demanding and strenuous work over the years and want to retire, but surely the law cannot say to a person ‘Thou shalt not work' merely because he or she has reached the age of 60, 65 and sometimes only 55. I see that as a violation of human rights, and Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam will be a good basis for the discussion of this issue. I very much regret that Mr Schiedermeier and Mr McMahon have to leave us. Had they produced their report sooner, they would most probably have made it impossible for their parties to force them out.</p>

<p class="contents">I am pleased that the Commission was able to work with Parliament in arranging the conference and to participate in the debate that took place there. With this sort of cooperation it is not at all surprising that the ideas expressed in the report are very much in tune with those of the Commission. It is highly satisfactory that the report emphasises the enormous potential that older people offer and the need to put this potential to good use.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know, the citizens of Europe are now living long, healthy and active lives, which is of enormous benefit to European societies. We now face the challenge of adapting our society in such a way that, as our citizens age, we preserve a decent standard of living and quality of life for everyone in an active and healthy society. This can be achieved, but, as the report"s title suggests, we need to look at the issue from a new angle.</p>
<p class="contents">The report makes particular mention of the number of unemployed older people, and employment is a most important area to work on. I agree with the rapporteurs that the European Employment Strategy and the European Social Fund provide a great deal of scope. The report mentions the importance of continuing training, and greater attention must be paid to the needs of older workers in relation to the principle of lifelong training, as contained in the European Employment Strategy and set out in the Commission"s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with the points made in the report regarding equality. One deals with the question of guaranteeing an adequate level of income for elderly people. Older women are often considerably worse off than men. The Commission has started examining how social security systems can be adapted to demographic developments in European societies, and the income levels of older people are also being discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important subject relating to social security which is raised in the report is the effect of an ageing society on healthcare. On this point I can tell you that the Commission is already funding a study on this very issue, which we hope will be completed within the year.</p>
<p class="contents">I see the report calls for the Commission to present its Communication on Ageing in the first half of 1999. I can assure Parliament that the communication has already been drafted. We are doing our utmost, in the present circumstances, to ensure that it is presented as soon as possible. The report also proposes that the Commission should be called upon to submit proposals in connection with the new provisions in the Treaty of Amsterdam on combating discrimination and social marginalisation. The report also calls for improved health protection for older people, both in a general sense and with regard to Alzheimer"s disease. These are obviously important issues, and I am certain that the new Commission will take account of this report when drafting proposals in these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like once more to thank Parliament for this report. It is an import contribution from Parliament in 1999, the year that has been proclaimed the UN International Year of Older Persons. It will also help to preserve a model of European society for the current generation and for generations to come.</p>

<p class="contents">The report"s coordination proposals go much too far for our liking on several counts. However, we do believe that the EU has an important role to play in making it possible for pensions to be transferred and recognised across national borders.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
