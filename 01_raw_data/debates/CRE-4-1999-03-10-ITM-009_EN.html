<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Adam </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. ‐</span> Mr President, since 1990 nuclear power has been an important issue for the European Union's relations with the Central and Eastern European countries and the newly independent states. This importance is reinforced by the enlargement negotiations. The European Parliament has recognised the sovereign right of states to determine their own energy policies, including the nuclear option.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has a significant presence in the nuclear activities of the Central and Eastern European countries and the newly independent states. There has been undisputed progress in improving the operational safety of nuclear power stations, including the first generation reactors of the RBMK1000 and the VVER230 types. These improvements in safety have been achieved particularly by the use of on‐site assistance teams, supported by the PHARE and TACIS programmes. These have resulted in a radical change in safety culture. I would note that this change in safety culture and the increased operational safety cannot be measured in direct monetary terms. The fact that these benefits cannot be readily measured, however, does not make them any less real.</p>
<p class="contents">It is becoming increasingly obvious that despite the massive investment of the European Union in the nuclear activities of the Eastern European countries, the European Union cannot dictate policy to other states. This includes countries such as the newly independent states as well as those in the first and second wave applicant countries. In the case of the Russian Federation, the constant referral to unsafe reactors and the pressure to close these reactors down is somewhat resented. To the Russians there are no unsafe reactors; there are only first and second generation reactors. The pressure to close down is seen as an unwarranted interference in domestic affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">We should note that all the reactors in the European Union, in Central and Eastern Europe, in Russia and the newly independent states operate to the standards set by the International Atomic Energy Agency and the nuclear conventions which are currently in force. It is clear that the use of nuclear energy in these Eastern European countries will continue. Many of them have established policies which aim for maximum energy independence and security of supply. Many of them do not wish to be dependent on Russia for supplies of oil and gas. We must also remember that there are perceived economic advantages to continuing to use existing nuclear stations rather than building new alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">To add to the complications, some of these countries provide their neighbours with electricity. This is true of Lithuania and Bulgaria. Bulgaria exports to Turkey something like US $600 million of electricity every year – badly needed currency. To press for closure in those circumstances raises considerable resentment. Although the European Union has been very active in the nuclear sector, up to now there has been a clear failure of the European Union and G−7 policy. Not one unsafe or first generation reactor has been closed as a result of current policy. It is clear that the nuclear states of Eastern Europe will continue to pursue the nuclear option.</p>
<p class="contents">Two main factors are responsible for the failure of this policy: firstly, the ambiguity of the agreements and, secondly, the lack of provision for alternative electricity capacity. I should also add that there is a lack of consideration of the perceived national security and economic needs of many of these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Future activity must involve real cooperation and negotiation with the recipients of aid. The European Union cannot take a heavy‐handed, dictatorial position. We cannot impose our will upon those countries. We cannot tell them what they must do. We have tried this and, I have noted, it does not work. It is my profound belief that we can only advance through cooperation and negotiation. This negotiation must include an agreed energy strategy for each country in which provision for alternative electricity supply must be a fundamental component.</p>
<p class="contents">Another essential component will be the revision of regulatory standards by the Western European regulatory authorities with the involvement of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the European Commission. The ultimate aim of this increased cooperation will be the development of an <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> for the use of nuclear energy. Nuclear safety standards, applicable throughout the European Union, the Central and Eastern European countries and the newly independent states must be the goal.</p>
<p class="contents">We urge the Commission to coordinate its own services much more effectively than it has in the past. I hope it will accept that cooperation and not confrontation must underpin our relations with the applicant countries and the newly independent states in relation to nuclear activities.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van den Broek, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (NL)</span> First of all, my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Adam, for his first‐rate and above all constructive report. I would also like to express my appreciation of the intensive debate and positive exchanges of views held in the European Parliament on the difficult subject of nuclear safety. The report we are looking at today paints a realistic picture of the scope of the problems and of the difficult task facing anyone working to improve nuclear safety in Central and Eastern Europe. Unfortunately, as the report makes clear, change and improvement are not things which can be achieved in the very short term. And there are reasons for this.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, and I heard Mr Adam say the same, the partner countries with which we examine these problems are sovereign states. They set their own energy policy and their own nuclear policy as well. Some of them depend very heavily on nuclear energy for their electricity supplies and for export revenue too. Mr Adam has also made those points this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">A third obstacle is of course the extremely high cost of modernising, not to mention decommissioning, nuclear plants or individual reactors.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategy which has been much discussed, as it was in the report of the European Court of Auditors and the Commission, goes back to the G7 decision of 1992, which was really taken in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster. A strategy for nuclear energy was devised at that time to serve as a basis for the Commission"s activities in this field too. The short‐term imperatives were to find practical solutions to the most pressing safety problems which we had identified jointly with the IAEA, for example appointing independent and competent safety authorities and improving reactor safety in both Eastern Europe and the New Independent States. For the longer term, emphasis was placed on sustainable improvements to safety, on the one hand by encouraging the decommissioning of the less safe reactors, replacing them with alternative energy sources and improving energy efficiency, and on the other hand by helping to modernise those reactors which could be made safe by modernisation. As you know, that was not the case with all nuclear reactors. Some of them simply had to be closed down.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the most pressing safety problems, I am convinced that despite the criticisms which might be made and which have been made, the European Union"s efforts have borne fruit and that the money – 800 million or so – was well spent. A number of things have been achieved under the nuclear safety programmes. To mention just a few: the independent regulatory authorities have been set up or strengthened and the legal framework needed to operate a nuclear safety policy is in place, both in Central Europe and the New Independent States, though the quality of the regulatory authorities varies from country to country.</p>
<p class="contents">Technical solutions have been sought to the most important and most serious design faults in nuclear facilities. Exchange and transfer of know‐how has led to progress in fostering a culture of nuclear safety in the region. This has led to a more formal and regular dialogue between nuclear facility operators and the regulatory authorities, and also to an acceptance of the need to apply high safety standards to the building of new reactors.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also mention the substantial contribution which has been made towards improving operating practice in nuclear facilities and modernising them, in part by the supply of equipment and the promotion of greater awareness of the problem of waste management.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we have helped, and are still helping, to resolve the problems presented by the Chernobyl facility; in addition to the ‘shelter implementation plan", the Commission has helped significantly to implement the policy devised by the G7 to achieve closure of Chernobyl by the year 2000. In a nutshell, the cost of our work to improve nuclear safety has been between EUR 750 and 850 million. The mere cost of building the so‐called sarcophagus around the Chernobyl reactor IV, the site of the explosion, is put at between EUR 600 and 800 million. This shows the scale of the costs involved, and it has been calculated that the cost of all the modernising and decommissioning work required, just for the dangerous facilities in Central and Eastern Europe, is likely to be between four and five billion euros. These are very large sums, so of course the 100 million a year which the Commission has spent on its activities is a relatively small amount.</p>
<p class="contents">Building on the G7 strategy, the Commission will continue its policy of helping the partner countries to modernise those reactors which can be modernised, but it will also continue working towards decommissioning those reactors which cannot be modernised because of fundamental technical or design faults inherent in that reactor type.</p>
<p class="contents">I should stress here that there is a difference in implementation of the policy between the applicant countries and the New Independent States of the former Soviet Union. It is obvious that the prospect of Union membership gives us greater leverage over the nuclear policy of the applicant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to realise that closing down rectors is only realistic if broader energy strategies are developed at the same time. Mr Adam"s report makes that point as well. In line with the report"s recommendation, the Commission will foster efforts to secure a strategy of this kind as part of the pre‐accession strategy for the applicant countries, as well as under the partnership agreement with the countries of the former Soviet Union. That is not new. We have been working on this with these countries for quite some time now.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also holding talks with Lithuania, Bulgaria and shortly with Armenia. These are three countries in which we do not only want to implement these comprehensive energy strategies; they also have nuclear facilities which ought, on the basis of earlier agreements and notably the Nuclear Safety Account, to be closed down. We know that these facilities generate much of the electricity in these countries, and we are well aware of the major economic interests which are at stake here if facilities close down, of the loss of important energy export opportunities and of the sacrifices which these countries will be required to make in this area. This is why we are seeking, and have sought, to cooperate with the international financial organisations to draw up financing plans which can serve as a basis for international financial aid and the funding of alternative sources of energy.</p>
<p class="contents">And I should emphasis once again that I quite agree with Mr Adam that we must not seek to solve these problems with the countries concerned in a confrontational way. Nevertheless, and we are attempting to get this message across to Lithuania and Bulgaria, we are dealing here with earlier decommissioning undertakings which these countries gave in the context of the Nuclear Safety Account, and we are keen to help them face up to the consequences of decommissioning and also to absorb those consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has learned a great deal, not only from practical experience and internal audits, but also from the criticisms voiced in various reports of the European Parliament and the Court of Auditors. The problems which the programme experienced in the initial phase are now behind us. The Commission has drawn on its experience, and on your observations too, to make the necessary changes in the programme"s management.</p>
<p class="contents">A propos of that, I should like to offer the following examples. Much of the delay in carrying out the programmes was due to the fact that the instruments available were not sufficiently well tailored to the specific requirements of this sector. The new TACIS regulation should help to change this. It covers the period 2000 to 2006 and has three clear priorities for nuclear safety: to continue fostering the transfer of a culture of safety in the field of nuclear energy; to improve the management of spent fissile materials and nuclear waste, notably in the north‐west of Russia; and to contribute to international measures aimed at improving nuclear safety, which is a fairly broad description but naturally has everything to do with further efforts to close down a number of nuclear facilities which are deemed unsafe.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that Parliament will deliver its opinion on the new regulation in due course, so that it can indeed come into force on 1 January of next year. I am more than happy to assure Parliament that we shall report periodically on progress under the PHARE and TACIS programmes on nuclear safety. Lastly, it is our firm intention to improve the internal management of the aid programmes. The Commission is currently debating a proposal for a nuclear safety task force within the Commission, aimed at better coordination of the ten directorates‐general which are concerned to some extent with these issues within the Commission. In the light of the discussions during the last part‐session, and in order to give a clearer general and more detailed overview of what the Commission has done to date in the field of nuclear safety, we recently sent Parliament"s Energy Committee and a number of other committees an ‘aide‐mémoire" setting out in detail the work already done and further plans for the immediate future. I hope that this will in any event have helped to lay a strong foundation for further debate with the European Parliament on this important subject.</p>

The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, which unanimously adopted my opinion on this report on 27 October 1998, considers that nuclear safety is a crucial element of the pre‐accession strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission stated in Agenda 2000 that nuclear safety was a key objective, given the prospect of EU membership for a number of countries in Central and Eastern Europe. It subdivided nuclear installations into three categories: obsolete reactors of Soviet design which must be closed down definitively; ones which can be upgraded to acceptable levels of safety; and, lastly, the few reactors of Western design, which can remain in service provided that high safety standards are maintained in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">It emerges from the Court of Auditors' special report that only ECU 300 million of the 850 m made available for the period 1990‐1997 were spent by the CEECs on nuclear safety. Crucial upgrading and restructuring work must therefore be carried out under PHARE and TACIS. The safety standards of these power plants must be inspected by an independent authority recognised by the IAEA and the EU. In view of the recommissioning of one of the Chernobyl nuclear reactors, the countries applying for EU membership and the countries formed by the collapse of the Soviet Union must provide Europe as a whole with safety guarantees, in full awareness of the economic and social implications of such statements.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat that nuclear safety is a crucial element of the pre‐accession strategy. Unless guarantees are provided, accession could represent a risk to our collective safety. It is therefore the hope of the Foreign Affairs Committee that all available financial resources will be used to mount programmes aimed at solving the question of nuclear safety in Europe once and for all.</p>

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, my compliments to Mr Adam on his report. It is in a way his swan song, I would say. It is not easy to get everyone to adopt the same line on matters of nuclear energy, but I think in this case he has succeeded very well. The Union"s energy policy vis‐à‐vis the countries of Central and Eastern Europe is focused on the safe operation of the existing nuclear facilities. Under the objectives of Agenda 2000, Soviet‐designed reactors which cannot be modernised at reasonable cost must be decommissioned, because these reactors are unsafe. But in fact not one reactor in Eastern Europe has been closed down since 1992. Even the Chernobyl reactors I and II, although they have been inoperative for a number of years now, are still not regarded as having been decommissioned by the Ukrainian Government, despite all the resolutions passed by the European Parliament. Sovereign states are entitled to determine the main lines of their energy policy, says the rapporteur. But that does not mean that the Union has to stand quietly by and see our resolutions ignored. If the Union puts money into Eastern Europe through aid programmes and loans, then we may be able to influence the strategy followed and give an advantage to certain forms of energy over others.</p>
<p class="contents">That is one of the few instruments the Union has for forcing unsafe nuclear facilities to close, and we should make use of such instruments. The safety of existing facilities should also be used as an essential criterion for accession to the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the Court of Auditors" report on measures taken by the European Union in the field of nuclear safety in Eastern Europe. The Commissioner has outlined these for us in detail. The members of the REX Committee were shocked by the report"s conclusions. We have said as much previously. We appreciate that it is not easy for the Commission to operate in the former Eastern bloc, given the degree of red tape there and the complexity of the nuclear industry. But precisely because of that, the Commission should have shown greater care in implementing these programmes. Greater use should be made of the specialist know‐how available on the spot in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to my final point, and I have a question for Commissioner van den Broek. A few weeks ago, in response to a question of mine, your colleagues told the REX Committee and the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy that they were busy on an inventory of the millennium problem, checking the millennium compliance of the computers in the facilities in Central and Eastern Europe. So when, Commissioner, can we expect a report here in Parliament on the millennium compliance of the nuclear facilities in Central and Eastern Europe? I ask this because we are already almost a quarter of the way through 1999, and 1 January 2000 is the crucial date. I would be glad to hear your answer.</p>

You are actually asking the Commission to do something which we were unable to do in the past and will be unable to do in the future either. We simply do not have the know‐how or the people to prepare an inventory of this kind. That is why we said we would support the IAEA in all the relevant work it did here, and that is exactly what we are doing. I believe the IAEA is organising a forum on these issues, and I promise to report back to you on it.</p>
