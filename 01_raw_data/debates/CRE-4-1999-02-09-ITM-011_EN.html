<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lindeperg </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span><span class="italic"> rapporteur. – (FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, thegovernments of the Member States have now accepted the fact that asylum policy can no longer be dealt with at national level only.</p>
<p class="contents">The Amsterdam Treaty has confirmed this view by making it possible to eventually make asylum a Community policy with qualified majority voting in the Council. However, time is short and such an uncertain time‐limit for harmonising Member States" practice is not feasible. Several attempts have been made under the third pillar, and we must hope that these will be transposed promptly into Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">The Dublin Convention has entered into force, but several problems have been observed with its implementation. The Council resolution on minimum guarantees for asylum procedures comprises some positive developments, but we regret that its provisions are not binding. The Council"s Joint Position of March 1996 on the harmonised implementation of the definition of the term ‘refugee" endorses a restrictive interpretation of the Geneva Convention, which excludes persons persecuted by third parties from being granted refugee status, and creates situations which are difficult to manage and tragic in human terms. The successive proposals for a joint action on temporary protection which seek to provide a response in the event of massive inflows of displaced persons have met with difficulties in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an area where progress has not been made on harmonisation, and that is forms of protection complementary to the Geneva Convention, although it has been included as an item in the Council"s programme for several years. In fact, the Geneva Convention does not cover all situations involving persons who have fled their country of origin and cannot or do not wish to return because they have justified fears of being persecuted. Even if the Geneva Convention were interpreted in accordance with the UNHCR recommendations, which is what we are firmly calling for in this report, a legal vacuum would still continue to exist between the level of protection guaranteed by the Geneva Convention and the temporary protection currently under discussion, which is only applicable to massive influxes of refugees and therefore excludes individual cases.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, solutions, where they exist, are left to the discretion of the national authorities, and they differ widely, to say the least. What happens to nonsuited persons according to the terms of the Geneva Convention who would be in serious danger were they to return to their country of origin? Fortunately, the majority remain within the territory of the Union, and we will see under what conditions they do so. However, we must not forget that some are sent back, regardless of the danger and putting their lives at risk, as several tragic cases have demonstrated.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is becoming so worrying that for example, in my country – the situation in other Member States not being any better – NGOs which do not have a reputation for following hardline or irresponsible policies have set off alarm bells denouncing the ridiculous bureaucratic demands made on displaced persons reporting incidents of torture or degrading treatment. These organisations deplored the decline in recognition rates for the status afforded under the Convention and the tragic situation of nonsuited persons, some of whom were convinced that their applications would be rejected and no longer dared to request refugee status. They advocated a change in our way of thinking and a return to a code of ethics based on precautionary action.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards nonsuited persons who are not sent back to their country of origin, what conditions are they offered? They are subject to national provisions in the host country which vary extremely widely. These range from those who are fortunate enough to enjoy genuine protection complementing refugee status, to those who are merely tolerated and do not have refugee status or rights, and whose situation is totally unstable, precarious and constantly being called into question.</p>
<p class="contents">Current national provisions, where they exist, differ widely in the various Member States, and often even within a Member State. Who benefits from this kind of inextricable labyrinth? Evidently not the interested parties, but neither the Member States, which cannot expect asylum applications to be distributed in a coherent fashion and are faced with the problems that arise from the presence of less advantaged people in society.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of my report is to bring to the attention of the Commission and the Council the urgent need to make headway on the harmonisation of these complementary forms of protection and to define refugee status and rights, thereby making it possible for those persons who will remain on the territory of the Union in any case to extricate themselves from precarious and distressing circumstances. These forms of complementary protection must not call into question the full implementation of the Geneva Convention and must at the same time be clearly distinguished from temporary protection.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the amendments, the majority of those proposed aim to alter the meaning of the text considerably and in fact appear to conflict with the actual object of the report. Everyone will therefore understand why I am rejecting them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would have liked to agree to the ARE Group"s amendments concerning the persecution of homosexuals. However, I understood that agreeing to them could negate the lengthy consultation process with members of other groups and, when all is said and done, the final vote could be jeopardised. I will therefore be asking my group to reject them.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by thanking the many Members who have contributed to this report, which I hope will eventually establish a practice in the area of EU asylum policy that is more in keeping with the international undertakings to which the Member States have subscribed, and with the humanitarian principles on which our Union is based.</p>

<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lehne </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am presenting two reports here today. The first is about the Convention on third‐country nationals, and the second is about the harmonisation of visa law within the European Union. I would like to start with the Convention on third‐country nationals, which is certainly the more complex legislative project.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that within a functioning European Union internal market we need to have close cooperation on immigration and of course on the rights of third‐country nationals who are long‐term residents. It makes no sense using Schengen and other provisions to abolish borders if at the same time there are large numbers of third‐country nationals living here whose freedom of movement within the internal market is very limited, and if there are in any case different immigration regulations in the Member States. This can lead to cases where some Member States admit immigrants who then of course find their way onto the internal labour market as a whole, ultimately contributing to the impact – I do not want to say burden – on other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I very warmly welcome the fact that the European Commission has brought forward a proposal for a Convention on third‐country nationals. I think that this in itself is a step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the history of Parliament's consultation on the Convention on third‐country nationals is not a happy one. You will recall that we concluded our discussion of this Convention in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs last summer, and that the final debate on it was to take place in the plenary in September. At that point, the Socialist Group requested that the Convention on third‐country nationals be referred back to the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, and I supported this. The reason was quite simple: at that time a series of highly controversial changes had been made in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs and submitted to the plenary. These included an almost unlimited extension of the right to reunification to all members of the immediate family, including grandparents. The existence of a partner relationship was to be adequate justification for family reunification. Opportunities for seasonal workers to repeatedly enter into rolling contracts were extended. The mere offer of a job was to be sufficient to justify immigration rights. Expulsion for serious criminal offences was to be abolished. All this would have led to overloaded labour markets and social systems in the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Apparently the very people who supported the amendments got cold feet and then quite sensibly requested referral back to committee. At that point I attempted, as rapporteur, to find compromise solutions. I believe that the report before us today is a genuine compromise and that an attempt has been made to reconcile the various points of view within the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">On family reunification, we have gone no further than the Commission proposal. Regarding seasonal workers, we have given the principle of subsidiarity priority in the individual Member States. We have also been guided by the principle of subsidiarity in the case of making jobs available in Member States. At the same time, and I always thought this was correct, we have quite simply deleted Chapter 8 from the Convention entirely. This chapter refers to the rights of third‐country nationals who are long‐term residents of the European Union. We have done this because we believe that, as its name implies, the Convention should deal with immigration and not the rights of third‐country nationals who are long‐term residents.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we are at the same time calling on the Commission to submit a new proposal to Parliament dealing with the rights of third‐country nationals who are long‐term residents of the European Union in a separate draft, because that of course also needs to be legislated for.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we in the committee have gathered from preliminary discussions with Commission officials that in view of Parliament's opinion on the third‐country nationals convention and in view of the Council's reaction to it at first reading, the Commission in any case intends formally to withdraw this draft Convention and rework it, with a view to reviving it as a proposal for a directive once the Treaty of Amsterdam has entered into force. I welcome this and I am sure that it will also be welcomed by the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs. I believe that a revised Commission proposal would provide a more appropriate basis for discussion than has been the case up to now.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress that I intend to reject the amendments tabled by the ARE Group, the GUE Group and the Liberal Group, purely and simply because these amendments effectively resuscitate ideas from the first consultation in September, which I rejected for the reasons I have already stated and which I have no alternative but to reject again now. Let me make myself very clear: if these groups' amendments were to be adopted, I would be forced, after the votes had been taken, to ask the House to reject my own report. That is why I am asking you to reject these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Now for the second report, on what is known as the visa directive. This too has a rather unfortunate history. You will recall that the European Parliament gave its opinion on this directive years ago, and the Council subsequently reached a decision on it. We did not agree with the text adopted by the Council, for the very simple reason that although the Commission had submitted a mandatory proposal for a visa list which we in Parliament supported, the Council subsequently adopted a visa list which was effectively not mandatory at all, as each Member State was allowed to introduce additional visa requirements for other states, and was simply required to notify the Commission of this.</p>
<p class="contents">The result of this was that the European Parliament brought an action concerning the directive before the European Court of Justice, and ultimately won, because we had not been adequately consulted.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate in recent months, since this judgment was pronounced, has essentially revolved around procedural aspects, namely what we are actually being consulted on – the amended Council Regulation annulled by the European Court of Justice or the original Commission proposal? We subsequently reached a compromise by taking the Commission proposal as the basis for our consultation, but by also giving an opinion in our new report on the proposals mentioned in the Council decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw attention to a key political problem on which my position as rapporteur has always coincided with the majority view in Parliament in previous debates. This is the question of Bulgaria and Romania's inclusion in the list of states required to obtain a visa. In my opinion, Bulgaria and Romania should be deleted from the list, for two reasons: firstly because discussions with the relevant Commission officials, and in particular with Directorate‐General Ia, have shown that Romania and Bulgaria have already met some of the conditions imposed on them for the removal of the visa requirement. They have not all been met, but a great many have.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I believe that it is time for the European Parliament to set an example. You know that in the negotiations on eastward enlargement and in the run‐up to these, some states felt that they had done well, but there were also other Central and Eastern European countries which felt that they had come off badly. I believe that it would be good if Parliament set an example by lifting the visa requirement for Bulgarians and Romanians.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not intend to use all my speaking time. Thank you very much for your kind attention. That completes my comments on the two reports which I am presenting to Parliament here today.</p>

Following the approval of the Amsterdam Treaty, our committee received several documents detailing the progress made in the communitarisation of issues relating to immigration, asylum and refugees, in addition to all the other work being carried out within the framework of the third pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">This is something we welcome and look on as a step in the right direction. However, my attention would not have been drawn to this information quite as much had it not been so easy to see that the progress made is not always consistent in terms of content and strategy. Proof of this lies in both the proposal the Commission is putting forward with regard to the entry of citizens from third countries and the other documents Parliament has recently received, for example, on the strategy adopted by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, Parliament is not some machine designed to give out orders or amend each and every document we receive, but it does have to have an overall view of events and proposals put forward by institutions in relation to this matter. As a result, I should like to find out what strategy the Council and Commission intend to adopt, if indeed such a strategy exists, and what direction we are heading in.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the convention, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I should like to point out that we are aware of how important the way in which we deal with immigration is in terms of our relations with third countries. I should like to make three comments in this regard. The first relates to the fact that we cannot carry out border controls alone. We need the help of third countries, as has clearly been demonstrated by events at Mediterranean borders and the troubles experienced there. We also believe that immigration is an important factor in codevelopment and we should help, for example, to provide citizens from third countries with the opportunity to study in the European Union, and for account to be duly taken of this. It is also something we would like to see reflected in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">As this is closely linked to the content of the draft convention that has been proposed, I have to say straight away that I feel that the rapporteur"s reference to the previous debate was inappropriate. I am under the impression that the report had been referred back to committee with its support, and I also think that we have made an effort to continue with the debate because, as I said before, we think it is heading in the right direction. This is why the rapporteur"s comments seemed inappropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of things that we should like this report to avoid in particular. First, it must avoid generating a climate of legal insecurity for immigrants and those wishing to enter. Second, it must avoid the tendency for illegal immigration which occurs because of excessive bureaucracy or bureaucratic red tape. In other words, we must prevent people who could reside among us legally from being reduced to the status of <span class="italic">sans papiers</span> , as they are known in France. Nor must we be over stringent, because zero immigration does not and will never exist. And in my opinion, if we were to act in such a stringent manner, we would be forcing these people into the hands of people traffickers.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we have tabled a number of amendments and reached a compromise; these both represent positive steps forward on a number of important issues. As regards people who work for others, we believe that entry into a country should be linked to an offer of work, and, in turn, that the work contract should be linked to the opportunity to reside in that country or obtain a residency permit, as opposed to granting entry and residency solely on the basis of a contract. To me, this seems somewhat utopian. Certain countries, such as Italy, have already put forward imaginative proposals along these lines.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards temporary work, subsidiarity must be adhered to, as the rapporteur pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">And as regards entry granted to people wishing to undertake independent economic activities, I think it should be pointed out that countries that have quotas should be excluded from the rule provided for in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of points that I unfortunately do not have time to go into here, but I should like to mention the fact that through the issue of family reunification, we have introduced the question of exceptional cases. I should also like to stress that under no circumstances shall we accept the amendment tabled by the PPE Group which seeks to lower the age at which children have the right to family reunification to 16.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to mention section eight. We believe that the Commission should put forward a proposal detailing the rights of immigrants living here to give them a status and regulate their legal situation. These are rights that all European citizens living here enjoy. We do not wish to create a Community with two types of citizens, one with one set of rights and the other with a different set, but, in effect, the rights citizens possess in order to be classed as a citizen in a Member State – if you will excuse the repetition – do not apply to immigrants. We therefore believe that the Commission should put forward a proposal which includes these immigrants and resolves the issue of free movement for those legally residing here.</p>

This position was supported by the plenary and was adopted again in a second report in March 1998. So Parliament has always been consistent in its view that the visa requirement for those countries should be lifted. Of course, as everyone here this evening knows, the requirement causes a lot of problems for people in both countries, many of whom are increasingly seeking opportunities to come to the European Union for study meetings, seminars, exchanges of contacts and so on in the context of the enlargement process. This means that there are huge queues at the EU embassies and people face long waits, often after travelling considerable distances to get there. In short, it all takes a great deal of effort and is an obstacle to opportunities for direct contact. This is why we would strongly urge that the requirement should be abolished.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the countries in the leading group, in other words those which have made more progress in negotiations with the European Union, are now also planning to impose the same requirements as part of the adoption of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> , so instead of becoming more integrated, they are not only becoming more excluded from the Union, but it is also being made more difficult for them to have contact with former eastern bloc countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, which has the backing of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, I also draw attention to the fact that it is wrong to introduce a visa requirement for Hong Kong, given that it does not apply vice versa and EU citizens are free to visit Hong Kong without a visa. It is also sending an important political signal to let it be known that the Union still regards Hong Kong as an autonomous administrative region.</p>

This initiative, commendable in itself, must not of course result in the European Union leaving its borders wide open in order to grant asylum to almost all the inhabitants of most countries throughout the world. However, if we are limited to justified and necessary harmonisation, my aim is to draw attention to the specific problems experienced by certain categories of refugee women whose situation is a special one in some countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In the opinion of the Committee on Women"s Rights, the harmonisation recommended to complement the Geneva Convention should cover special situations, such as gender‐specific persecution, sexual violence and exploitation, and trafficking in women, where these put the lives and health of the women concerned at risk. Our intention is certainly not to grant asylum to all women in all countries because of women fearing sexual violence. Moreover, there are also cases of this in the Member States of the Community. However, where women can legitimately invoke the right to asylum in this type of special situation in their country of origin, we urge in particular that they are granted a status separate from that of their husband or relatives, and that they also receive special medical and psychological help. All of this is along the lines of the conclusions adopted in my opinion.</p>

This also accounts for why it has taken so long to reach the plenary, but now at last it has arrived.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights would like to see Parliament give its support, as it has recommended, to the amendments such as those calling for the criteria determining who should appear on the common list – black or grey or whatever you will – to be the same for all countries and accessible to the public. On the other hand, these initial criteria should also include provisions allowing for the list to be abolished. The list itself should be evaluated and updated on a regular basis. There is no need for it to be set in stone.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of compulsory visas for Bulgaria and Romania has already been mentioned and the Legal Affairs Committee has delivered its opinion. This concerns the applicant countries which are still in the process of membership negotiations, but which in the meantime are being discriminated against. Such a situation is unacceptable. We should also like to have sight of the reports that were compiled by the Committee of Experts who visited the respective countries and on which the visa requirement for Bulgaria and Romania has been based. We should like to see these reports laid before Parliament, since it would be interesting to see on what principles they are founded. Consequently, we shall give our support to Amendments Nos 28 and 29, amongst others.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the policy on refugees – which is the subject of this joint debate – on behalf of the Green Group, I should like to express concern over the EU's refugee policy, particularly in the light of the Schengen Agreement and the fact that each year fewer and fewer refugees believe that such a thing as asylum actually exists within the EU. Should we not be preventing the walls around the Union from becoming too high? The Green Group believes that a generous policy on refugees, in accordance with the UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, is an absolute requirement.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">d"Ancona </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, it is unfortunately the case that asylum and immigration are politically sensitive issues, particularly in the run‐up to elections. It is a great pity that they are increasingly being exploited for political reasons, despite the fact that many political parties have signed up to the charter against racism drawn up by the Monitoring Centre in Vienna. It is obviously very tempting to try to curry favour with the voters by exaggerating the risk that we will be overwhelmed by sweeping tides of asylum‐seekers and by playing on people"s fears that too many foreigners will threaten our prosperity or identity.</p>
<p class="contents">There is therefore every good reason to regulate asylum and immigration policy at European level, not just in order to prevent these sorts of abuses at national level, but also because of the cross‐border nature of the problem. Time and time again, however, the Council has disappointed us here. Of course, when it comes to restrictive measures, defending fortress Europe and passing the problem off onto neighbouring countries, it is only too happy to turn a blind eye and has no problem in finding agreement. But constructing and harmonising a humane and fair asylum and immigration policy seems to be well‐nigh impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I think it is good that the Commission and Parliament keep putting these issues back on the agenda. Mrs Lindeperg"s report on the harmonisation of forms of protection complementing refugee status is certainly needed now that it appears that many people are falling through the net, sometimes because the Geneva Convention is interpreted too narrowly and sometimes because people do not actually meet the criteria to be classified as genuine refugees but cannot return to their country of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">It is often claimed that the Geneva Convention is being abused, that the people asking us for asylum are not genuine refugees, and that the asylum problem is beset by liars and criminals. But we ourselves largely encourage this by making the Convention the only possible way of getting into Europe. This is why I particularly welcome the fact that the Commission has looked at this side of the problem and considered under what conditions the nationals of third countries can be admitted. We very much appreciate the fact that the Commission, and particularly Commissioner Gradin, have asked us for our opinion on this. However, in order to arrive at an opinion we have had to make a sacrifice, because we were only able to achieve a majority in the committee by deleting Chapter 8. We can well imagine that this will come as a disappointment to the Commission, as indeed it is to us, because it means that the basic objective, which is one that we value, has been nipped in the bud.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 49, which calls for a status to be introduced for third‐country nationals, is designed to counter this objection. I hope that the Commission realises that my group at least supports its idea of improving the position of illegal residents too. We are therefore hopeful that a status will be created which establishes the rights of fellow citizens from third countries.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pirker </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my own comments relate to the proposals, underlying trends and amendments emanating from the left of the House. They generally have one thing in common: they repeatedly support immigration from third countries and above all an extension of family immigration and reunification, with an overwhelming tendency to class all forms of partnership – regardless of gender – as a family, and at the same time adopting an increasingly wide definition of relatives. The result must be obvious.</p>
<p class="contents">These proposals also tend to facilitate access to the labour market of the European Union. For example, one amendment suggests that the mere offer of a work contract should be enough to qualify for a one‐ to four‐year stay in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The extension of refugee status is another issue exercising our minds. I am all for thought being given to this and for seeking solutions. However, we will not find any solutions based on the very vague definitions we have of the groups involved, for example, if when we talk about groups of people threatened with violations of fundamental human rights, we insist on categorising the right to health or the right to work as basic rights, or if we include groups who are threatened by major disruptions in public order, or people who give homosexuality as grounds for asylum. The net is being widened somewhat too far if all these groups are to be given the status of refugees wishing to enter the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">If you consider the extensive new appeal arrangements, which provide that an appeal always has suspensory effect for all these groups, even if there has been abuse of the system, then you end up with similar problems, as I have already mentioned. Regarding asylum, I would also like to mention that we must of course give positive signals to states such as Bulgaria or Romania who are making an effort. However, I know from my own experience of the Ministry of the Interior there that there are major problems with the justice system, the police and the development of border security. We know that there is a constant risk of illegal immigrants entering the Member States of the European Union via these countries. We must help them to improve their border security. However, we cannot remove the visa requirement whilst Europe has no guarantee of security.</p>
<p class="contents">The effect of all these demands tends to be an increase in immigration, an invitation to abuse asylum status and an impression that we are doing too little for refugees. This effect is unacceptable and that impression totally erroneous. What we need, and we in the PPE Group are arguing for this, is a comprehensive solution embracing asylum and refugee issues, which provides for burden sharing and for measures to counter abuse. The objective we should be setting ourselves is to help refugees, but to limit and regulate immigration and to combat abuse and illegal activity, so that in future we can guarantee a safe and stable Europe, in the interests of our all our citizens.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Goerens </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span><span class="italic"> – (FR) </span>Madam President, I should like to make four remarks in the joint debate on the Lindeperg and Lehne reports.</p>
<p class="contents">The first concerns the appropriateness of holding the debate on the Lehne report at this time. Mr Lehne himself said in his report that we can raise the question as soon as the Amsterdam Treaty – once it has entered into force – provides a more appropriate framework for dealing with problems connected with the admission of third country nationals. In this case, however, the Commission has exercised its right of initiative for the first time by formulating a position on the subject. Parliament has repeatedly called upon the Commission to give impetus to policies which come under the third pillar, and therefore cannot take a favourable decision on this. Moreover, the urgent need for harmonisation in this area no longer has to be demonstrated.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the admission of non‐Community nationals concerns issues as important as the labour market, vocational training, family reunification, all issues giving rise to controversy which is sometimes very acute. In short, we are dealing with an extremely sensitive issue here, which – if the case arises – provokes emotional and impassioned reactions and is also very often the cause of irrational thoughts and behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">Words are therefore important in themselves because of the ideas they express and the messages they convey, or rather suggest. Recent events remind us that regarding nationality as an ethnic concept, for example, would by its very nature wake evil spirits from the past and make it possible for parties pursuing this line of approach to win elections. It is the whole political class that is being questioned about the way in which it must take up these challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise my view regarding the admission of non‐Community nationals on the territory of the European Union, in particular, and general relations between European citizens and non‐Community nationals, I would say that there is reason more than ever before to consider how the debate should be organised, and how to encourage reflection and to convince the sceptics. We need to show ourselves to be understanding and sometimes patient, as well as imaginative and generous towards those concerned by the policies referred to in the Lehne and Lindeperg reports.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, two different approaches are possible. The first approach, which is based on populism and electioneering, tends to send out a strong message to the more fortunate members of society, and a weak one to disadvantaged social groups. The second approach, which consists in giving positive signals to the vulnerable groups in society, and less positive ones to those who are more fortunate, seems to me quite obviously to be more compatible with our duty to show solidarity, as is stipulated by the Geneva Convention with regard to asylum seekers.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, and I thank Mr Lehne particularly for having mentioned this aspect, we should welcome Parliament"s coherent attitude towards maintaining visa requirements for Romanian and Bulgarian nationals. Of course, the Member States will probably not follow the conclusions of Parliament, which calls upon them to remove Bulgaria and Romania from the famous common list.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be a real shame if the Council were to persevere in its attitude. However, without being particularly optiministic, I hope it will respond favourably to our demand. In doing so, it would merely be recognising the progress achieved by both these countries. What is more, it would merely be putting an end to a form of discrimination which affects two countries associated with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say that the policies at the centre of our debate are part of an overall picture. I am also the first person to regret that no progress was made on burden‐sharing, a subject to which a previous debate was devoted. This would allow us to progress more quickly in terms of the policies we are currently discussing.</p>

However, we must remind ourselves that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights – a declaration that is often cited and one that is presumably adopted by all – recognises the right of any person to protect themselves against persecution and to enjoy asylum in any country. We must also bear in mind that the Geneva Convention, without restrictive interpretations, must be the frame of reference for all national or Community regulations on the right to asylum and refugee status.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the content of these texts, we strongly criticise the ever more stringent conditions that Member States are imposing on persons seeking protection in countries of the Union. Entry, residence and the status of persons seeking international protection in the territory of Member States cannot, under any circumstances, be treated merely as issues relating to the internal security of those states. They must be considered with respect for international conventions and a supportive policy of aid for development and economic cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years we have noted with some concern that legislation on asylum has been tightened up. This has resulted in a downward trend in the number of applications for asylum in the European Union and stagnation in the rates of acknowledgement of refugee status in many countries, despite the fact that the human rights situation in the world has not considerably improved.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to protection complementary to refugee status, we support the measures put forward by the rapporteur. They focus on the protection of persons threatened by widespread violence, internal conflict or violations of human rights and lay particular emphasis on the international recognition of women who are subject to sexual violence. We also believe that it is essential to adopt measures to ensure the integration of refugees into society and to help them develop as residents.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to highlight the case of the Kurdish leader, Abdullah Ocalan, and call on the Council to make a determined effort to intervene in this situation.</p>

They must be applied constantly and coherently in all countries; there must be no exceptions and no grey areas. In this sense, Mrs Lindeperg"s report endeavours to increase throughout the European Union the level of protection for refugees and persons subjected to persecution. It proposes a useful complement to measures protecting human rights. With reservation, we approve the need to harmonise at EU level the rules applying to refugees who cannot claim the status afforded by the Geneva Convention but cannot return to their country of origin for fear of losing their lives or being subjected to degrading or humiliating treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">The definition of refugee status given in the Geneva Convention is interpreted in a narrow sense by a Council decision: refugee status is only granted where persecution is carried out or encouraged by the authorities. Where the authorities fail to act, the persons concerned are eligible for forms of protection under national law, and this is where the shoe pinches and the measure proves to be inadequate. Complementary protection can vary from one Member State to another, creating to all intents and purposes disparities with regard to opportunity of protection depending on the place where the individual being persecuted makes his application for asylum. This unequal treatment can have serious consequences, for example where a refugee"s life is at risk if he returns to his country of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">Harmonisation is therefore desirable. Moreover, it will make it possible to establish a set of rules which will provide a basis for examining the forms of protection taken from the European Convention on Human Rights. However, refugees benefiting from complementary protection must not be confused with immigrants. Poverty in a country may result in severe disruptions to public order or create internal conflict. Is a person fleeing this type of disorder a refugee with the right to complementary protection or an immigrant? This is where there is the risk of confusion. Harmonisation of these forms of complementary protection must not of course be an end in itself either. We must not only pursue a policy of education by constantly denouncing human rights violations, but we must also provide development aid for those countries and regions where human rights are flouted. Mrs Lindeperg"s report corresponds to the notion of generosity to which we are attached, and proposes solutions which seek to improve the rights of persons subjected to persecution by making progress in the area of the rule of law and in this case, accepted standards of behaviour in Europe. However, our final vote will of course take account of possible subsequent amendments which will be tabled and adopted in plenary.</p>

She is a Member of Parliament with the courage of her convictions. Migration is a social reality in the European Union. We are concerned about the tendency in some Member States to substitute temporary so‐called refuge for genuine recognition of refugee status under the Geneva Convention. The EU should not harmonise forms of protection supplementing the Geneva Convention without allowing for a liberal interpretation of the Convention on the status of refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason we welcome the debate needed on the Austrian strategy paper on migration and asylum policy. The report makes it clear that Austria's so‐called strategy paper is intended as a deterrent, and is not suitable as a basis for solving the problems of migration and asylum‐seekers, because it confuses not only the various issues surrounding their causes, but also the solutions to these problems. Of course there is an urgent need for coordinated action. The objective is to create approximately equivalent admission criteria for refugees by means of a common legal protection system, so that recognition criteria can be interpreted as uniformly as possible. Mrs Lindeperg's report makes a valuable contribution to this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say something about the two amendments tabled by my group. It is our view that Amendments Nos 16 and 17 are not relevant to this debate. A debate about the future or the fate of refugees in general is not the place for a discussion of what has happened to Mr Ocalan. That should be dealt with separately.</p>

The ARE Group has always supported her attempts to find a decent solution to the problems facing asylum‐seekers and many others in this world who feel oppressed and threatened. We share her concern and we will continue to support her. We are in favour of harmonising legislation at European level in principle, but we fear that it would be used as a way to consolidate fortress Europe, with the legislation and the Convention being applied increasingly strictly, whereas what we want is greater understanding for the huge numbers of refugees throughout the world and for all those under threat.</p>
<p class="contents">We regret the fact that the European Parliament has been reduced to an advisory body on this issue and that we are not able to make a more decisive contribution. In our experience the Member States are the only ones that take the decisions, and they are often very hypocritical about it. Very often they talk about solutions that need to be taken at European level, while at the same time rejecting existing European solutions and pursuing their own restrictive policies. We are extremely unhappy that various countries are pursuing this approach, and we think that the Convention should be updated to include a more modern definition of the term ‘political refugee". We want new categories to be admitted to allow people over this very difficult hurdle. We want people persecuted for their gender or sexual orientation to be included, and we want new rights for a new generation. We know that Europe cannot escape its responsibilities here, and we know that we are weak when it comes to protecting democracy in the world. On the other hand, we ourselves create illegality. It will always be more difficult – it already is – to enter Europe legally than illegally. And this causes distortions in our own society and condemns people to go through life ‘<span class="italic">sans papiers</span> ". We want nothing to do with such a short‐sighted policy. We want things to be regulated properly so that the problem can be brought under control. We do not want to be or to become a totalitarian state, but we want to adopt a pragmatic approach in order to deal with current problems realistically.</p>
<p class="contents">We have tabled two amendments which, from what I have heard, can count on considerable support. Mrs Van Lancker, I am sure that there are a lot of people as well as you who agree in their hearts, but we will have to wait and see if they actually vote for them. What is the point of going for a Conservative majority when we could win a more progressive majority here in the House, with various representatives of the Liberals and our two groups?</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I have decided. I have to point out that we agree with the first Lehne report, but we definitely cannot vote for the decisions in the second report, where we thought the Commission text was much better than what the report says.</p>

Two of them are the result of what is termed the intergovernmental method of negotiation: they concern the draft Convention on rules for the admission of third‐country nationals, and the proposal for a Council regulation which was also negotiated by consensus within the Council, which determines the list of countries whose nationals require a visa to enter the Union. The third text comes under a completely different category: it is an own‐initiative report produced by the European Parliament which proposes a wide interpretation of the refugee status laid down by the 1951 Geneva Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, just as the first two texts try to be strict on the subject of the crossing of external borders, the third text clearly adopts a more liberal attitude and is inspired by ideas which it would be difficult to claim are shared by the majority of our fellow citizens. I will come back to this point in my explanation of vote.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, it is as though this joint debate had a hidden agenda seeking to lead us to the following conclusion: the intergovernmental negotiations unanimously concluded in the Council are the ones that produce the texts which are the closest to what happens in the real world.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, for all crucial issues connected with the international movement of persons, my group hopes that we stay with this method and reject the possibility of switching over to majority voting and codecision with the European Parliament, as provided for by the Amsterdam Treaty.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Elliott </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Madam President, first of all, let me congratulate the rapporteurs of both reports for having grappled well with exceedingly complex issues. As far as the Lindeperg report is concerned, this is a very positive attempt to try to provide – and encourage the provision of – supplementary assistance to asylum‐seekers. There is a lot to be said for trying to harmonise the social provisions which the Member States make in varying degrees and indeed for endeavouring to have a harmonised and common approach. There are some amendments, which Mrs Lindeperg has already referred to, which I equally would not be happy to go along with. But we can end up, if we accept this report essentially as it has been drafted, with a very positive contribution to dealing with this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Lehne report is concerned, I must say that here again I have some concerns: it exposes the inadequacies of the convention proposals in that they are particularly restrictive in some respects but lacking in others. Not a happy set of proposals, as the Lehne report explains.</p>
<p class="contents">I basically want to talk about the report on visa requirements for third country nationals. Here I have a lot of problems and difficulties. I agree entirely with those speakers from my group who have highlighted the undesirability of introducing complex and difficult‐to‐operate rules relating to employment conditions, and also the reduction of the age at which family members would be allowed to enter the country. The reference in the Commission proposals to the age of majority is correct and we should not introduce some other factor.</p>
<p class="contents">But I must say – and here I think I speak for the majority of British Labour Members – that we really find it difficult to accept that the rights of Member States to respond to changed circumstances by introducing visa requirements should be removed. The difficult situation that we have encountered in Britain with people coming from Slovakia in the last year or so has led the British Government to introduce visa requirements, which were almost unavoidable. It is premature to talk about removing visa requirements for people from Romania and Bulgaria when a number of western European countries are already receiving considerable numbers of asylum‐seekers from those countries, some of them with very genuine complaints. Much more needs to be done in these countries in terms of ensuring proper protection for the rights of their minorities before we can think of removing these restrictions.</p>
<p class="contents">In all those respects I really could not accept the report as it stands and I shall be voting against those particular parts.</p>

That is enough said about the grand and noble principle. On no account should the right of asylum be changed in any way, either in the form of a restrictive interpretation of the Geneva Convention by the Member States, or through abuse of the system by interested parties. What we need, on the other hand, is an extension of the principles of the Geneva Convention by means of a regime providing complementary protection to deal with exceptional cases. However, such an extension must in no way aid the interests of those who try to misuse the right of asylum and wish to throw the door wide open to all forms of abuse.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to be effective, we need to find solutions which are pragmatic as well as humanitarian. We must firstly promote transparent solutions at European level and then – instead of pursuing a liberal line of action – seek sensible solutions which guarantee the right of asylum while preventing it from being misused.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that the Member States are closing their doors to asylum seekers, as is suggested in the Lindeperg report, but they are rightly closing them to illegal immigrants seeking to abuse the system on economic grounds rather than on political grounds. By combating illegal and uncontrolled immigration, the Member States guarantee the right of asylum and prevent our citizens from making asylum seekers outcasts.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes to the right of asylum and complementary protection! No to lax and ideological attitudes on this serious matter!</p>

<p class="contents">However, I am opposed to the Commission"s draft Convention on rules for the admission of third‐country nationals. In fact, it proposes an admission and residence policy which conforms with the Member States" most restrictive rules. This is particularly true in the case of employment since it makes national and Community preference one of the key principles of the admission policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Was the Commission never informed of the OECD study in which it is acknowledged that there is no close correlation between the influx of foreigners into a country and the increase in the unemployment rate? I nevertheless admit that the adoption of certain amendments has made a significant improvement to the draft. However, I am dismayed at the compromise amendment proposed by the PSE/PPE to Article 7(1) on employment. This amendment not only implies acceptance of the notion of national preference, but it clearly vindicates the system of quotas which would allow each Member State to take from poor countries the manpower and qualified workers it needs.</p>
<p class="contents">My group has therefore tabled an amendment to correct what I had hoped was only a mistake until I heard Mrs Terrón i Cusí"s speech. My group"s final vote will depend on acceptance of this amendment, and I will be requesting a roll‐call vote.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission"s draft convention does not augur well for the substance of future Community immigration and asylum policy, as provided for by the Amsterdam Treaty. We must warn the organisations of the dangers of this and take action with them to transform the present stumbling blocks into proper reception conditions. I am taking pains to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">I reject this notion of a fortress Europe which is inward‐looking. We must put an end to this scapegoat strategy which the Minister of the Interior, Mr Schily, also talked about a fortnight ago in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs. However, our French Minister is no better on this subject. He has never addressed the issue of immigrants in terms of the legal implications. He has consistently linked immigration with unemployment, insecurity and criminality, as if evil always comes from elsewhere. The danger of this type of xenophobia – it cannot be called anything other than this – is great, for as Gorki wrote, ‘it is preferable to expect the best of man; expecting the worst will only lead him astray".</p>

Not only is it one of the most important reports we have discussed for a long time, it is also one of the most outstanding. It demonstrates, with depressing sobriety and enormous clarity, that we find ourselves slipping into a human rights dilemma or even a human rights emergency. Many of the Members not here today would, if they were to study this report, very probably have to stop telling the public that asylum, in terms of human rights and international law, is not under attack. It is. Mr Pirker, on the other hand, is an example of someone quite capable of maintaining all his aggressive prejudices despite being in possession of the facts.</p>
<p class="contents">I would really like to know how you can escape into Europe. I think you would need to be the invisible man or jump down from a satellite. Otherwise, it will soon be impossible to penetrate this continent famed for its justice and human rights. We have abolished the right to asylum within the European Union, despite the Geneva Convention and current international law. We have simply taken matters into our own hands, and no one is doing anything about it. Outside the EU, we have created a cordon of states that we have lumped together as being safe third countries, thus flying in the face of the Geneva Convention and current international law.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the Geneva Convention, an applicant is only entitled to asylum if a justified fear of persecution can be demonstrated. We have changed the criterion to one of proving that persecution is a fact. We are constantly raising the hurdles, creating barriers and imposing new conditions, so that it has become virtually impossible to get into Europe. The end result is mass deportations, children held in pre‐expulsion detention centres, families torn apart, and refugees being repatriated to countries where they are in danger of life and limb. That is where we now stand in the European Union, which when it wants to implement something like the internal market, the euro or competition law, applies itself with great determination, but which is achieving less and less when it comes to human rights and democracy, the underlying principles of the Union.</p>

Immigration policy is and must remain the responsibility of each Member State. I reject the outright harmonisation of immigration policies, the right of asylum, and criminal and judicial procedures that is advocated by Brussels. A healthy state is first and foremost a state which controls its influx of immigrants and makes it possible for its nationals to work and go out in the evening in complete safety.</p>
<p class="contents">We will vote against this report which protects non‐Community nationals and damages the interests of European nationals, and which encourages family reunification even where a family unit is not legitimate or recognised as such in the eyes of the law, since it talks about partners. What is more, we want to offer jobs to foreigners when seven million people in our own country are unemployed or live below the poverty line. I would point out that according to this report, a contract of employment will be sufficient to obtain refugee status. If adopted, these various amendments will undoubtedly turn our Europe – which is already an open door when it comes to immigration – into a Europe where the floodgates are opened to what will become a spate of immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Members of Parliament talk to us about populism, electioneering and racism. But they do not live in the so‐called problem areas. It is the poorest and weakest people who put up with this type of situation, and this can no longer be tolerated. It is unthinkable that those who advocate jobs and security in Europe could support such initiatives which are destructive to our countries and people. I for my part will not do so. Allow me to remind you of the famous words of one of our colleagues, who said that we cannot take all the troubles of the world upon our shoulders.</p>

I confess that I am now finding it difficult to keep to the subject I had actually planned to speak about, that is Mr Lehne's report on visa policy. We have been discussing this subject ever since I have been in Parliament. Our discussions on how to formulate arrangements giving people from third countries legal access to the European Union spanned the whole of the previous legislature.</p>
<p class="contents">The judgment of the European Court of Justice – as Mr Lehne has already said, Parliament took this to court – still failed to clarify the degree of consistency we should apply to this question. My group has also taken the line that if we want to retain our credibility we should give our opinion on both the Council and Commission proposals. But as we have found ourselves in a state of deadlock with the forthcoming ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam, we expect that once it has been ratified and the Treaty has come into force, the Commission will submit the new proposal it has announced without delay, and that the amendments from Parliament that we are voting on tomorrow will appear in the new proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I agree with the rapporteur that the procedure for granting visas should comply with the same requirements and procedures in all the Members States. The fact that there is a visa requirement for certain third‐country nationals does not mean that the relevant procedures should be unjust or even discriminatory. Yet that is very often the case at present. People who need a visa for relatives or business visitors or for youth and student exchanges should be given clear information on the documents required and the time taken to issue a visa when they submit an application. We know all too well that waiting times of six months are frequent, with all the costs that implies.</p>
<p class="contents">The authorities in the Members States should have to observe clear guidelines in this area, to make the process both transparent and humane. Article 62 in fact requires uniform conditions and procedures in this field. We also hope that incorporating the Schengen Agreement into the Treaty will at last make it possible to draw up a single European list of third countries whose nationals require a visa for travel into the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Many members of my group also believe that both Romania and Bulgaria should be deleted from the list, something Parliament has indeed been advocating for the last four and a half years. It cannot be right that countries with whom we have association agreements are still at a disadvantage and are still on this list. I often go to Romania and Bulgaria myself. When you see how things are going there, you are bound to conclude that this needs to be changed, because both these countries have already made great efforts ...</p>

<p class="contents">I should firstly like to welcome and thank the rapporteur for demonstrating her ability for dialogue and for constantly seeking solutions. Of course, when such solutions have not been forthcoming, she has sought to point out discrepancies in a way that I consider to be very constructive.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur is aware that many of us, and in my view, a broad majority in the House, agree with her objectives. As she points out, these complementary schemes of protection must be harmonised so that those who genuinely merit a specific form of protection, but who do not meet the conditions laid down in the Geneva Convention, can receive it. Therefore, we must not lower ourselves to the level of popularity‐seeking, because this is ultimately the worst enemy of those who are or who should be allowed to enter under the terms of the Geneva Convention, and those for whom complementary forms of protection must be found.</p>
<p class="contents">The two amendments tabled by the ARE Group, which Mrs Lindeperg wanted to accept and which I hope she does not accept, are a clear example of this. I hope they will be rejected because they are really the epitome of what Parliament is not able to do. Whether we like it or not, the Geneva Convention says what it says and, Mrs Lindeperg, there are other people who are qualified to interpret it apart from the United Nations High Commissioner, including the Member States" high courts. However, this is something that appears to have been overlooked.</p>
<p class="contents">We obviously cannot try to change the Geneva Convention and say that it protects homosexuals. That would be impossible because in order to change the Geneva Convention, we must use all the traditional instruments of international law. And, were we to do this, in short, we would merely be prejudicing those groups – and potentially even homosexual groups – in need of adequate protection, protection that is not provided for in the Geneva Convention. Indeed, the complementary measures we are currently seeking are, in fact, aimed at those groups.</p>

Mr Lehne"s report and the Commission proposal are extremely important elements of what should become a common immigration policy. A European approach is particularly important here because the differences that currently exist between the Member States undermine not only the free movement of persons, as Mr Lehne said, but also, in my view, the rights that we grant to immigrants. This is why a European approach is so important.</p>
<p class="contents">I must admit that the view that Parliament is putting forward today does not exactly fill me with enthusiasm. Even here in the House there is not a majority in favour of opening the door a little wider for further immigration. Of course, I realise that this is a highly sensitive issue with its connotations of unemployment and social exclusion. But the main point is that there are still people, even here in the Chamber, who constantly manage to present immigration as a threat and as something that will inevitably bring an increase in crime, thus encouraging xenophobia and making the whole issue taboo. I hope that some day the majority will support the view that migrants not only need Europe, but also that Europe needs migrants, if only for the sake of our own labour market and demographic development.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to have this report, because these proposals ensure that European harmonisation will not be harmonisation downwards. The references to quotas and measures deliberately allow those Member States which have a broader policy the scope to implement it. We are not defending quotas as such, but as some countries already have them, it is important for us to support them. This also guarantees that families have the right to be reunited. We must learn to accept that people do not migrate temporarily – these are men, women and children who are entitled to a family life.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a few words about the report by Mrs Lindeperg, on which I congratulate her. I am particularly pleased that there is broad support for this report in the House at long last, as an additional status is absolutely necessary. Many countries such as Belgium only have a ‘tolerance status" with complementary forms of protection, and this has particularly damaging consequences. It causes uncertainty for the refugees in question, and uncertainty for society, because having residents with no rights in an insecure position is not good for any society. So we really need an additional status in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">All I would add is that in December 1998, the Council of Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs put these two important issues that we are discussing today on the agenda for the forthcoming legislative period, but with such an unreasonable deadline that there is a danger that it could become a long‐term project or even be shelved altogether. So I think it is particularly important that Parliament should today send a political signal to the Commission, and via the Commission to the Council, that we in the House want to tackle these two sensitive and difficult issues, and I hope that this will then lead to a clear signal being given not in five years, not in twenty years, but at the Tampere summit that we need solutions to them.</p>

We are being urged to drop the visa requirement for Romania and Bulgaria, yet any security specialist can show that this would promote organised crime, traffic in human beings and drug smuggling. Where does that leave our concern for our citizens' security?</p>
<p class="contents">Here in Europe, we quite rightly accept refugees and people facing political persecution. There is no dispute about that, as every right‐minded person knows. However, there are also numerous economic refugees who can neither come here nor remain here permanently, and now Mrs Lindeperg is proposing that we should accept everyone coming from countries where there is widespread violence, internal conflict, or other circumstances which have severely disrupted public order.</p>
<p class="contents">My dear Mrs Lindeperg, this definition applies to three quarters of Africa and half of Asia. So provision is to be made for measures to ensure that all these people are integrated into social and economic life – not forgetting that we have 20 million unemployed in Europe – and at the same time, if they are rejected, they can lodge an appeal with suspensory effect! Mrs Lindeperg, that may well earn our respect and you may deserve our sympathy, but it will not win our vote for your report. It is high time we limited immigration into Europe. Only then will we have a chance of integrating those who already live here, and that should be our priority.</p>

I can support Mrs Lindeperg's report without hesitation. It must be sensible when subsidiary protection issues will be an area of growing importance for the EU, for Member States to operate similar procedures and a similar level of social provision for all refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to Mr Lehne's report on the admission of third country nationals, one can only share the report's view that the draft convention is unbalanced with unnecessary rigidity in many areas and with unworkable elements in others. However, despite my acknowledgement of Mr Lehne's hard work, I have some problems with his report on visas for third country nationals. The main areas of difficulty are: firstly, the fact of his adding to the visa‐required list a visa‐exempt list; secondly, the ruling‐out of Member States' right to impose national visa regimes in certain circumstances like those we have experienced in the United Kingdom recently; thirdly, while I acknowledge the progress made by the Bulgarian and Romanian authorities in combating illegal immigration, the reality is that significant numbers of Romanian and Bulgarian nationals continue to make poorly‐founded claims for asylum in Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, however, I intend to support the report, primarily because I completely endorse the rapporteur's view that visas should be not be required for individuals who hold residence permits in any state in the Union. As long as he continues to press the point that residents of the European Union should have the same rights and same duties as citizens I have to be in favour of this report.</p>

<p class="contents">The first concerns family reunification, which is a fundamental right laid down in international law. The Member States of the Union, through international agreements, have established the importance of the family for the welfare and well‐being of the individual. This bodes well for agreement on a common line to be followed, but as ever, the question is how far should we go? The concept of family varies from one Member State to another, and the same applies to age limits. In both instances, my proposal means a step towards a closer approximation within the Union. The discussions in the Council of Ministers will show whether there is scope to advance our positions further, which the Commission naturally welcomes.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, integration requires stability and a long‐term perspective. The objective must be that immigrants are able to live under the same conditions as those enjoyed by European citizens, a vision that should run through all the policy initiatives on immigrants. Consequently, our proposal also addresses the question of the rights to be offered to Europe"s immigrants. In this respect, my first thoughts are focused on the nationals of third countries who have lived legally in Europe for many years. In the proposal, we have identified the following basic areas in which we think our citizens and immigrants should receive the same treatment: access to the labour market and freedom to pursue an activity as a self‐employed person, basic education, vocational training, trade union rights, freedom of association, and access to the housing market and social assistance. We have also taken up the question of freedom of movement for nationals of third countries. For example, it would be reasonable for permanently domiciled immigrants to apply for jobs that are not filled in other Member States. The alternative is a segregated Europe with all the attendant problems of discrimination, social tension and instability.</p>
<p class="contents">As one might expect, the views in the Council of Ministers differ widely on this issue. Consequently, I had hoped to be able to count on a clear expression of support from the European Parliament. Now it seems as though this is not to be, which is deeply disappointing. Nevertheless, I have no intention of withdrawing the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The underlying causes of current migration are largely unchanged. People are looking for a better life for themselves or their children. There are no longer any uninhabited continents, and migrants therefore look for places which they can physically reach. Europe will continue to be an attractive destination, a state of affairs we should accept as permanent and normal, instead of regarding it as a passing and somewhat dramatic occurrence.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, a strategy for a common policy on migration is a natural consequence of integration and the idea that similar social and economic conditions should prevail throughout Europe, with no one being left behind. I would assume that the ideas contained in the Lehne report will be taken into account in the forthcoming negotiations. Naturally the Commission will do its best to ensure that progress is made.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Lindeperg, in her report, addresses the issue of protection for people who flee their homes but do not fulfil the requirements laid down in the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees – what we sometimes call supplementary forms of international protection. The rapporteur urges the Commission to begin work at the earliest opportunity on harmonisation of the European Union's asylum policies. I am sure the House will be pleased to learn that this work is already in hand.</p>
<p class="contents">As a beginning, I have put forward a proposal for a directive on asylum procedures within the Union. At the request of the German Presidency, I will soon be submitting a working document on the subject. The aim is to begin discussions on the points at issue as early as the spring.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have now begun work on adapting the Commission's proposals on temporary protection and burden‐sharing to meet the requirements of the new Treaty. As you know, we have been putting in a great deal of hard work on this since the Commission submitted its original proposal in 1997. The issue will be discussed for the third time at ministerial level during the informal meeting of the Council in Berlin at the end of the week. But despite all this, the Member States are still a long way from reaching a decision. If there is no agreement by the time the new Treaty enters into force, we shall have no alternative but to submit entirely new instruments. In my view, this is what will happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the adaptation of the Eurodac Convention is another major task. Last December, the Council of Ministers decided to freeze work on Eurodac, wishing to wait until the Amsterdam Treaty had entered into force before further negotiations. During the meeting, the Commission was also asked to submit a new proposal in the form of a regulation. Such an adaptation of Eurodac will mean a great deal of work, and it goes without saying that it should begin immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">The work on this area alone will take up much of the time between now and next June. In the longer term, the new Treaty stipulates minimum standards for supplementary protection. This is in fact mentioned as a key point in the action plan on freedom, security and justice which the Council approved on 4 December.</p>
<p class="contents">Asylum policy in general and supplementary protection in particular will accordingly be the focus of considerable attention during the coming years. Consequently, the Lindeperg report makes a welcome and constructive contribution to the discussion on the future direction of asylum policy in Europe.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Monti, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (IT)</span> Madam President, my thanks to Mr Lehne for his excellent report. This consultation of the European Parliament completes the process that began with the annulment by the Court of Justice in June 1997 of Regulation No 2317/95 laying down the list of third countries whose citizens had to be in possession of a visa. We need first to put this into context.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation that was annulled was based on Article 100c of the Maastricht Treaty. According to that article, Community jurisdiction in relation to visas is limited, firstly, to determining the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders and, secondly, the introduction of a uniform format for visas.</p>
<p class="contents">If it has to be adopted before the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the new regulation will be adopted by the Council again on the basis on Article 100c. That circumstance, which cannot be avoided, makes matters still more complex. This tricky situation has been well depicted by Mr Lehne, and some of your amendments reflect this.</p>
<p class="contents">My view is dictated by the evolving legislative context. I wish also to draw attention to the prospect of incorporating into the Union the progress achieved through the Schengen Agreement and its consequences for visa policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn now to the amendments, which I shall separate into two categories: first of all, there are many amendments based on the evolving legislative framework that I have just described and which I would roughly classify as anticipatory amendments: Amendment No 1, concerning the title, describes the regulation as provisional; Amendments Nos 3, 7 and 11, relating to the recitals, include a number of references to changes that will be introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam. But when we look at the actual articles of the regulation, the amendments I have described as anticipatory are incompatible with the provisions of the current Article 100c. Let me cite to you, by way of example, Amendments Nos 18, 19, 20 and 21, concerning the various aspects of visa issue, an area that is not at the moment – and I stress for the moment – an area of Community responsibility. In these circumstances, it is not legally possible for the Commission to accept those amendments which anticipate an area of Community jurisdiction that will not exist until the Treaty of Amsterdam enters into force.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European Parliament is proposing a number of amendments that fall perfectly within the scope of Article 100c: these respect the parameters of that article, but we do have to consider them, paradoxical though this may seem, in the light of the forthcoming entry into force of Amsterdam. I can explain this better by taking as an example Amendment No 5 concerning the criteria for determining which countries will be subject to the visa requirement. The way in which this issue is dealt with, viewed in terms of the existing Article 100c, will be significantly different once Article 62(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam has given the Community the additional authority to draw up the list of countries whose citizens will not be required to be in possession of a visa. The prospects for achieving total harmonisation of visa policy, something which Parliament wants, moreover, therefore mean that we have to look again at the issue wearing our Amsterdam‐tinted spectacles, so to speak. I do not, however, wish to be absolutely negative about the possibility of accepting the amendments Parliament is proposing as part of the new consultation on the following regulation. The prospect of the now imminent entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty will bring about profound changes with regard to visas; new powers will be transferred to the Community in relation to the measures to be adopted in these sectors. The Treaty of Amsterdam has set definite time‐limits, while the recent Commission and Council action plan on the area of freedom, security and justice actually provides for more rapid adoption of some visa‐related measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community must shoulder the obligations its new powers bring with them, and the Commission will have to assume its own responsibilities without delay. I can assure you that the work Parliament has done as part of this new consultation will not have been in vain. I am also certain that some of the proposed amendments will be largely taken into consideration in the new proposal for a regulation that the Commission has included in its own programme of work, on which Parliament has recently delivered its opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude, Madam President, with a reference to the question that has been raised concerning Bulgaria and Romania. The inclusion of a third country on the common list of countries whose citizens have to have a visa is based on an assessment of the main criteria involving the risks to security and the threat of illegal immigration. Having said that, the assessment made at the time the regulation is adopted is not set in stone. And with that in mind, the Community and Bulgaria and Romania have on several occasions in recent months had the opportunity of discussing this problem, which has a variety of implications. From those various contacts, through the association councils at ministerial level and through correspondence, it has become apparent that Bulgaria and Romania are making considerable efforts, not least with the help of the Union and supported by the PHARE programme, in a whole range of important areas, with a view to the decision that will have to be taken on their inclusion in the common list. Without entering into detail, I would just mention the strengthening of controls at external frontiers, the conclusion of readmission agreements with other states, security of travel documents, the fight against crime and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">The progress that has been made is, I assure you, being closely monitored, thanks to the presence of experts in the field. The view of the European Parliament will probably be a decisive factor as far as the Commission is concerned, at the proper time, once the Amsterdam Treaty has entered into force.</p>
