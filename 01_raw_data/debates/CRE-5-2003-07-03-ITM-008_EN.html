Passengers in these vehicles will be informed of the obligation to use safety belts when the vehicle is moving.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States will adopt the legal, regulatory and administrative provisions necessary to ensure compliance with the directive by 9 May 2006. In order to extend the obligatory installation of belts to all vehicles, including coaches, the Commission has also recently proposed a modification of three directives in force relating to safety belts.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the issue of road infrastructure, the Commission intends to propose a directive on the guidelines to be adopted by the Member States in order to establish national systems for the identification and management of blackspots, safety audits and minimum rules on information for drivers for application within the trans-European road network. The point relating to rail crossings, which is one of those raised by Mr Caveri, will be included in the procedures for the management of blackspots and safety audits proposed in this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to point out that the Commission has recently adopted a new action programme on road safety which includes a specific chapter on the safe transport of goods and passengers. Apart from the directive approved recently on the training of professional drivers of goods and passengers by road, a legislative proposal is also being prepared, specifically a directive aimed at improving the application of the social provisions on driving and rest periods, as well as working hours. This directive will lead to a considerable increase in the number of controls for verifying compliance with driving and rest periods.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the action programme does not include any specific measure on the construction of coaches, the Commission will carefully study the recommendations of ECBOS research project, which is producing a final report. This project will make proposals aimed at improving the rules in force and will propose new regulations and standards for the construction of safer buses and coaches, in order, for example, to achieve better protection in the event of accidents involving overturning. Furthermore, the Commission plans, in the near future, to propose an obligatory system for the approval of vehicles, for coaches and lorries, similar to the one in force for private cars. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In so doing, they have shed light on the position as regards the law, organisational issues, and the technical state of the art. To sum all this up, there is a strong common interest in not damaging the buses’ image as a basically very safe means of transport, with buses and coaches accounting for only 0.2 deaths per thousand million passenger-kilometres, compared with 6.8 for private cars and 0.6 for railways. I would not want to let this opportunity go by without expressing my gratitude and appreciation to the many reputable bus companies and their drivers.</p>
<p class="contents">It would appear that the consensual view is that what is lacking is primarily attributable to the human factor on the one hand and to the way laws are implemented on the other. Does the Commission think it possible that the situation may be improved, above all by influencing how people behave in road traffic and within enterprises, but also by the exchange of information? Secondly, is it not the case that greater use should be made of the opportunities for monitoring vehicles and their drivers, in order to be able to identify those we call the black sheep and make them take responsibility for their actions? I take the view that, thirdly, checks should be carried out to see whether the standards for testing currently in force are sufficient to ensure that the main examinations and safety tests on buses are carried out to a qualitatively high standard. As the use of electronic components to ensure the stability and safety of vehicles increases, all the more necessary, I believe, does the regular inspection of this electronic equipment become. Fourthly, I expect the Commission to give priority to the safety of buses and coaches when it submits its proposal on the Third Action Programme on Road Safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This situation amounts to a war on Europe’s roads, and it cannot be allowed to continue like this. Over recent months, a series of accidents involving buses has occurred, in which people have died or been severely injured. I believe this to be an issue with which we should concern ourselves more and more. Buses and coaches – for which I, as a Green, have a particular fondness – are among the most environmentally friendly ways of travelling, but they must become even safer than they have been to date. Another reason why we have to give attention to this issue is the fact that we will see much more traffic on the roads in the coming years as a result of the eastward and southward enlargement of Europe. As shown by the people in the visitors’ galleries, bus and coach travel is on the increase, as people make more journeys with them, and so we have to do more to make it safer.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may say something about human error, we know that social dumping on the roads presents us with a major problem. Working times are not adhered to, which is another way of saying that legislation in this area is not stringent enough. Nor are there enough controls. I can do no other than appeal to the Italian Presidency of the Council to at last take the Markov report on working hours seriously and give it priority, rather than doing as the Greek Presidency did and putting it on ice for months on end. Only if we improve working hours will we have better-rested coach drivers on the roads and be able to do something about exhaustion. This will of course involve more controls, and I am glad that the Commission wants to do something about these.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect of safety that we have to get to grips with is the requirement to fit seatbelts, which at present applies only to new coaches. We cannot wait ten or 15 years for coaches to be replaced by new ones. We have to take action now and make use of all the technical possibilities offered by present-day coaches. Accidents over recent months have shown that many people have died because they were catapulted out of coaches that had been overturned. Safety belts will enable us to tackle this, and I hope that both the Commission and the Council of Governments will summon up the energy to do something about this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was an incident which shook all of us in Greece, it was widely reported in Europe and, together with the other tragic accidents, has brought us to today's debate.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, of course, the European Commission's ten-year programme, which we shall also be looking at and commenting on extensively within the framework of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport, and there are other ideas which are already referred to in our motion. It has rightly been stressed that we must look immediately at the question of safety belts. It has also rightly been stressed that we must look at the question of coach specifications and I welcome the European Commission's position on this point. However, we must, of course, also look at the question of driving times, because often drivers cannot do their job properly because they are exhausted. The European Parliament has made a proposal here, which I hope the Council will deal with positively.</p>
<p class="contents">I, for my part, want to comment on two individual issues. The first is the issue of speed limiters. I highlight this because I myself was rapporteur to the European Parliament. The legislation exists. And it is up to the governments to apply this specific legislation as quickly as possible. It has been proven that by limiting speed, especially in the case of large vehicles, we also limit the possibility of accidents and their consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing I want to say, and this concerns the European Commission, has to do with the projects funded under the Community Support Framework. We will need to pay particular attention to road projects in order to avoid poor workmanship. I have the particularly sad experience of my own country, where new projects have very serious levels of poor workmanship, which is why they are dangerous and cannot always be used safely. Consequently, the quality of works needs to be strictly controlled by the European Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
