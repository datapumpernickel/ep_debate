<p class="contents">Commissioner, the European textile and clothing industry has a future and trade interests to defend. Following the signing of the memorandum of understanding in Shanghai on 10 June between the European Commission and the Chinese Government, which has been ratified by the 25 Member States, the European Parliament today expresses its opinion on the future of the European textile and clothing industry, a future that we all hope is promising, and that despite the numerous upheavals that the sector has undergone in recent months.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this framework agreement, this free trade agreement, gives the European textile industries some breathing space. I nevertheless believe that the European Parliament is duty bound to monitor carefully the management and the follow-up of that agreement. Indeed, I believe that we should be able to keep certain safeguards in place and use the defensive trade instruments at our disposal within the context of the WTO when that proves necessary. Furthermore, in the long term, the European Union and the national authorities must contribute to developing measures that will make it possible to capitalise on the production and sales potential of European manufacturers, in addition to ensuring that fair trade rules are respected on the international textile and clothing market.</p>
<p class="contents">I will therefore remind you of the maxim that states that a trade policy with the rest of the world should be based on two principles: fairness and reciprocity. From that perspective, and with the aim of remaining competitive in this new trading environment, free access to third-country markets is a vital factor in the drive for growth.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Commission must encourage all of the WTO countries, apart from the most vulnerable developing countries, to use the Doha negotiations to secure reciprocal market access conditions, which are both fair and comparable, for large-scale textile and clothing producers<span class="bold"><span class="italic">. </span></span>A firm line must, moreover, be taken against those countries that are still closing their borders to European producers by raising non-tariff barriers to trade. These practices need to be combated using the legal instruments available to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">With six months to go until the Hong Kong Ministerial Meeting, Commissioner, I would stress the fact that removing barriers to market access for industrial products has to be a key objective of the Doha mandate. It is also crucial, and this motion says so, to protect our European know-how, our European added value. To do so, we must defend intellectual property rights and combat counterfeiting and piracy. The Commission must in fact go on the offensive to ensure that third countries comply with the TRIPS Agreement, particularly with regard to textile designs. Similarly, it is necessary to establish ethical trade based on production processes that respect the environment, health, and labour standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in order to respond to the slowdown in the European textile industry and to guarantee its future and its competitiveness against the US and Asian regional blocs, we have to support the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean production zone in the textile and clothing sector. To achieve this, goods must be allowed to move more freely by applying cumulation of origin across the Euro-Mediterranean zone as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel with these trade measures, the European Union should implement a transitional practical plan to assist restructuring and retraining for the entire sector, with a view to helping textile-producing regions and safeguarding the future and competitiveness of the sector on international markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the European Commission needs to study in detail the points made in this motion and develop the recommendations made therein by introducing practical measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, on behalf of the European Parliament, I call for the Commission to give a quarterly report, before the Members of this institution, on all of the recommendations issued in this resolution and on the actions that it has undertaken.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, for the future of this sector to be genuinely promising, constant attention must be paid to developing it. That is what I call for today for textiles and clothing, a key sector of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He was keen to take part in bilateral meetings in Great Britain, where he had the opportunity to meet a number of extremely important ministers, particularly in the context of the WTO negotiations that will be taking place in Hong Kong. His absence from these meetings would have deprived us of certain opportunities to defend the priorities that you outline here. As you know, these negotiations have a direct bearing on the textile sector. I would therefore earnestly request that you excuse his absence; it really is for urgent reasons. It was genuinely worthwhile for him to attend these meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, I would like to thank Mrs Saïfi for her excellent report and I welcome the draft resolution. It supports the efforts already made by the Commission to assist the European textile and clothing sector in also taking up the challenges set by the abolition of quotas since January 2005. Our objective is clearly to lessen the impact of a historic agreement on trade liberalisation, which was finalised exactly 10 years ago. We all recognise that the European Union’s trade policy should guarantee the best environment and the best possible conditions for the sector so as to enable it to face the competition on equal terms. The shake-up of the regulatory and trading environment ought to encourage us to turn to the future and go on the offensive, to find new commercial outlets and to create markets, rather than to seek only to protect ourselves from competition on the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">I am now going to address the principal trade issues raised in the draft resolution. Firstly, with regard to Chinese imports, I will speak about the EU-China agreement of 10 June 2005. Following months of negotiations, we are pleased to have reached an agreement with China, which guarantees a more moderate growth in imports in the main categories of products. This gives European industry an additional two and a half years in which to continue the process of reorganisation and adaptation.</p>
<p class="contents">The broad support given to the Commission’s approach by the Member States indicates that a negotiated agreement was certainly the best means of confronting the influx of Chinese imports, and this for various reasons. Firstly, most EU products are covered, that is to say around half of the imported products that were liberalised in January 2005. Secondly, there is only a slight difference between the quantities agreed and what would have resulted from the mechanical application of the safeguard clause if it had been implemented. It must be well understood that there was really no alternative solution. Implementing the safeguard measures on a case-by-case basis would have been economically destabilising and politically very difficult. The agreement will provide more clarity, certainty and credibility for businesses on both sides (producers, exporters, importers and retailers) and will promote textiles exports from developing countries and Mediterranean countries to Europe. This agreement is therefore in everyone’s interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of whether we will refrain from taking safeguard actions in the future and on other products remains. The European Union has not relinquished its legal rights, but it is clear that we have entered into a transaction. We do not rule out possible future actions if they are really justified. Careful monitoring will therefore continue. From now on, we have to focus our attention on the interests of the European Union, interests that we are going to defend forcefully, in the textile sector: market access; intellectual property, the Euro-Mediterranean zone, rules of origin and origin marking.</p>
<p class="contents">The action plan on market access, debated by the High-Level Group on 14 June 2005, should be officially adopted and implemented with the emphasis on intellectual property issues. Increased convergence of market access conditions in the textile and clothing sector is also required. It would be advisable to reduce customs duties within the context of the WTO. They should be set at the lowest possible level for LDCs and vulnerable developing countries. Non-tariff barriers need to be tackled effectively: that is a key objective of the WTO negotiations on market access for non-agricultural products<span class="bold">;</span> the tariff reductions envisaged by the European Union would be acceptable if a significant number of countries, in order ideally to attain a critical mass, made comparable offers in return in terms of market access. The Commission is considering putting forward proposals on origin marking and labelling. These proposals will enable both appropriate information and guarantees on the origin of clothing items to be provided, whilst avoiding placing an unnecessary burden on businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The new system of generalised preferences, which offers preferential access to developing countries, was adopted on 27 June and will enter into force on 1 January 2006. A specific safeguard clause for clothing products has been introduced. It excludes any country recording an annual growth in exports greater than 20%. That clause is the only concession in a global stability agreement that will remain in force until the end of 2008. China has been excluded from it and the status quo is maintained for India.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the reform of preferential rules of origin, the Commission is going to carry out an impact study in the most sensitive sectors, including the textile and clothing sector. We have to measure the effects of change on EU industry and on developing partner countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to the Euro-Mediterranean zone. We share your desire to establish a genuine Euro-Mediterranean zone in which goods can move freely and are exempt from customs duties. Since the 1970s, textile products have entered the EU market exempt from customs duties and, in parallel, the Mediterranean countries have progressively abolished customs duties on EU exports. The competitiveness of the Euromed textile industry depends less on customs duties than on competition from Asia, on the preferences granted by the European Union to Asian countries, through the GSP, on the relaxing of the preferential rules of origin and on unfair competition caused by China’s lax compliance with employment law. Although the cumulation of origin has been delayed at the Council, every effort is being made to speed up the procedure and to ensure its entry into force in autumn 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Conclusions: the Member States overwhelmingly supported the agreement reached with China; the industry obtained an additional transitional period to improve its competitiveness both at international level and within the Union, and the Commission is going to monitor the programme of positive actions regularly and thoroughly with a view to securing the future of the European textile and clothing sector.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to your request for regular updates, the Commission will keep Parliament regularly informed of the implementation of its initiatives. That said, I am not going to go so far as to promise you a report every three months, but I believe that it would indeed be quite reasonable for reports to be made to Parliament on a regular basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We cannot deny that Europe does not have any effective response to this new phenomenon, which is a consequence of globalisation. Let us be clear: Europe must compete with parts of the world where products are manufactured by workers earning the lowest salaries. Yet Europe cannot compete – indeed no region can compete – with parts of the world where the currency is kept artificially undervalued, where depreciation on investments is not paid, where energy costs are not paid, where environmental rules are not observed, where slave or child labour is used, and all of this with the collaboration of the national authorities of the country in question.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU needs to reconsider its approach to talks on international trade agreements, so as to increase pressure to strengthen corporate social responsibility and to encourage strict compliance with International Labour Organisation rules and conventions, and international conventions on the environment and human rights. These principles must form part of EU bilateral and multilateral trade agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">I also fear that textile imports are not being adequately monitored. Information passed on to me by organisations working in the sector indicates that in June 2005 the quantities recently agreed between the EU and China for this year have been far exceeded. I sincerely hope that the EU, in the guise of the Commission, demonstrates very quickly that it is capable of enforcing what has been agreed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we are proposing today to the House is an expression of concern about the difficult situation being experienced by the European textile sector and, furthermore, it proposes concrete measures for dealing with the enormous challenge facing it.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we believe that it is essential to demand reciprocity. In other words, we want equal ground rules for everybody, transparency in access to the markets and respect on everybody’s part for social and environmental laws. But, secondly, we are calling for practical support for speeding up the restructuring of companies in order to increase competitiveness and in order to guarantee their future within the new global framework.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a restructuring of the sector, which must be promoted at all levels, European, State and regional, and which must be based on social and institutional dialogue. We need to resolve the fundamental problems by means of a modern industrial policy.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution therefore requests from the Commission and the Member States a European strategy on textiles and clothing aimed at improving processes that add quality, at producing innovative and technologically advanced products, at attaching particular importance to trademarks, at increasing efforts in the commercial field, at including the techniques of the new economy and at ongoing professional training.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to fulfil these objectives, we will need a European textile plan that includes aid for restructuring and specific resources within the framework of the Union’s funds. Two instruments must make a decisive contribution to dealing with the future of the sector: the launch of the European technological platform, which will allow for the creation of a coordinated strategy in the field of research, and access by the sector to the Seventh Framework Programme, in accordance with the sector’s own specific characteristics, such as the high number of small- and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">European textiles are recognised throughout the world for their quality and their design, they have demonstrated their ability to adapt and now, if they receive the urgent support they need in view of the profound changes facing them, we can proclaim that they have a future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, the abolition of quotas in the textiles sector may have harmful consequences in the EU’s least favoured regions. This is a key sector for the EU with huge potential, a sector that is capable of helping to turn economic and social cohesion into reality. The EU must support this sector as an industry, both at national level and across the Community as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">A Community programme must be set up for the sector, and especially for the less favoured regions depending on it. Support for modernisation and promotion of the sector must be regarded as an objective cutting across EU policies. The safeguard clauses provided for in trade agreements need to be invoked as soon as possible, in order to protect the sector in the EU both at the present time and with an eye to the future. The 'emergency procedure' provided for in the guidelines for invoking the safeguard clause should now be launched, with all the categories affected being included.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to add a few additional points. The prime concern of the so-called memorandum of understanding concluded between the Commission and China on 10 June 2005 is to legitimise the current situation, with its devastating impact on the sector, especially in countries depending on it, and this is something that we find unacceptable. As organisations involved in the sector have said, on the basis of data provided by the Commission, what was agreed in the memorandum has led to exports increasing from 49% in 2004 to the 318% projected for 2005, a far cry from the 8, 10 12.5% figures announced.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, by 20 June, reported exports from China had already exceeded the 10 June agreement for almost all products. Inexplicably, the Commission forfeited the right to the safeguard clauses, thus restricting its implementation. The Commission and the Council have acted in a way that has clearly demonstrated their lack of commitment to defending this European industry. They are therefore the main culprits for the terrible situation of thousands of businesses and for the destruction of thousands of jobs, with devastating social consequences. Hence the proposals for amendments that we tabled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That is essential because millions of citizens have been turning to us in recent weeks and calling on us to act on these issues. We cannot ignore their impatience, and at times anger, which is linked to the feeling of living in an era in which the phenomena of globalisation are in the end governed by the United States, used by large countries such as India and China, and paid for, in various ways, by developing countries and by Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with this is mind that the report clarifies the fact that the policies and strategies for the textile industry do not amount to state aid or protectionism, but rather to full acceptance of the rules of trade. It demands, however, that everyone should respect the rules and it points out the path to be followed: the opening-up of markets and competition should be seen as an opportunity, but at the same time the European Union needs to enhance its actions for the textile industry, for its modernisation and restructuring, for innovation, for research and for employee training.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also calls upon the Commission to adopt a clear initiative on three points. Firstly, it calls for a policy guaranteeing that the rules of free trade are respected within all manufacturing countries, particularly China, and therefore that the state aid or hidden subsidies granted to businesses, which distort competition, are reduced. Secondly, it strongly calls for the recognition and implementation of ethical, social and environmental clauses, aimed at widening the scope of worker’s rights and improving working conditions. Finally, a more effective fight against counterfeiting, fraud and forgery is called for, which must be pursued by tightening up the penalties imposed on retailers and purchasers of counterfeit items and by adopting a traceability system.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by stating that we would have liked more clarity on other points, for instance the inclusion of an active strategy for consumer awareness and more precise words with regard to the immediate introduction – and I am pleased that the Commissioner said it – of a mark of origin for all textile and clothing goods, precisely in order to protect and revive one of the strengths of our production. Everything, however, now rests on the policy and on Europe’s ability to make itself heard and respected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is good and bad in this. It is good that it gives the textile industry in southern Europe some breathing space, but let us also consider the agreement’s negative aspects: by reintroducing quotas, we are establishing barriers to trade, and that is what we always criticise the Chinese for doing.</p>
<p class="contents">Who is to determine which importer is allocated which quota? Is it to be done on the basis of ‘first come, first served’, or is there to be preferential treatment for those who already have longer-standing contracts to supply? Are there perhaps other variations? If so, with what justification, and how does the Commission propose to determine that?</p>
<p class="contents">What about the supermarkets and traders who, in anticipation of the quotas expiring, have placed big orders in China? Will they get their goods? Will the shelves now remain unreplenished, or will someone pay them compensation if they have to buy their products less cheaply elsewhere in the world?</p>
<p class="contents">What about the European textile firms, who, in anticipation of the quotas expiring, have, on the one hand, relocated their production to China and, on the other, have further expanded their marketing and distribution in Europe? Can they get supplies from their own factories in China, or will the reintroduction of quotas be just tough luck on them for having lost their livelihood and been obliged to lay off their workers in Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">What about the textile manufacturers who have spent the last few years and their own money restructuring themselves? Will they now be penalised, while the companies that did not face up to the challenge get money from the Structural Funds?</p>
<p class="contents">To those businesses that have not so far come to terms with the new <span class="italic">status quo </span>on the global markets we are giving a final chance to make good their omission, but it is no part of any European protection and subsidy policy’s remit to be the textile industry’s permanent insurance against the future. We are talking here about what businesses, their managers and workers, are fundamentally for, and so I call on them to face up to this challenge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The issue before us is the need to draw up and implement a trade and industry strategy to ensure the viability of the European textiles and clothing industry in the context of the major opening up of the international markets.</p>
<p class="contents">For such a strategy to succeed, it will require both defensive and more proactive measures to be adopted. The defensive measures relate to the need to help to regulate international trade in the sector, and in this regard, we welcome all initiatives aimed at ensuring reciprocal conditions of access to markets and at invoking all ethical, social and environmental clauses guaranteeing such proper regulation of the international markets. This is not about protectionism. It is about ensuring that international trade in this sector can take place on the basis of justice and fair play.</p>
<p class="contents">Proactive measures must be adopted, because this is also about the worldwide competitiveness of this industrial sector. Such proactive measures entail the EU adopting a more aggressive industrial policy for this sector, which is a hugely important sector. In this context, we also welcome all initiatives aimed at fostering greater investment in research and development, at promoting innovation and at improving access to funding, which is one of the key problems that these businesses have to face.</p>
<p class="contents">Over 95% of this business landscape is made up of small- and medium-sized enterprises, and one of the most serious problems that they face is precisely that of access to funding. Against this backdrop, we feel that it is vitally important that steps are taken to invest in technological progress in manufacturing, to create mechanisms for fashion and new services, to invest in technical textiles and in non-technological innovation and to set up a technology platform with a view to strengthening this industrial area.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, there are, from our point of view, two components that should be brought to the fore: the trade component and the industry component. If the two go hand in hand, it may be possible to make the EU textiles and clothing sector viable. To conclude, I wish to repeat our call for the international markets in this sector to be regulated and the EU must table clear proposals in the context of the Doha Round, and when we say this we are not calling for protectionist measures to be adopted. This is a sector that must be opened up, and that must strengthen its capacity to compete in international markets. Yet we are only talking about regulation of international trade in this sector that has very specific characteristics. It is essential that this take place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This new era is one that belongs to the innovative, those with relevant knowledge and those who are able to recognise changing world climates and adapt accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many well-rehearsed arguments setting out the current difficulties that we are facing in the textiles sector here in the European Union. Whether they are that, as a continent, we simply were not prepared for 1 January 2005, or that the Chinese state involvement in the production processes of its manufacturers distorts true market competition, it is certain that the experience we are having today with textiles will, in time, prove not to be unique. Indeed, I just read a report in <span class="italic">The</span> <span class="italic">Guardian</span> newspaper this morning that sets out details of the first round of imports of 4x4 vehicles from China, at a price that I cannot see any current suppliers ever being able to match in the EU. That is the extent of the competition that we are now facing.</p>
<p class="contents">We must recognise that the economic world order is now changing at a pace as never seen before. That creates for us many managerial challenges at EU level and it is here that we, as an institution, must do all that we can to empower our entrepreneurs with knowledge so that they may continue to compete and lead the field in our areas of expertise.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not desirable that management of the sort that we have recently had to endure through negotiations with the Chinese should happen again with any of our competing partners. The Commission was right to take the steps that it did, but that is no long-term solution. Our experience should widen our vision, strengthen our position, so that we may seize the opportunities that lie within the management challenges that we face.</p>
<p class="contents">I represent a constituency with a long history of leading in the textiles trade. The cotton mills of Lancashire helped form the backbone of the industrial revolution in the United Kingdom. Much of that has changed over the years. Mills that once employed thousands now employ in the very low hundreds. That change started in the 1980s, when changing conditions demanded computer-generated production processes and the longer-term efficiencies that they produce.</p>
<p class="contents">It was unfortunate in Lancashire that the management of the process was not provided at a governmental level, and many valued and skilled people found themselves with redundant skills overnight. The vision, lack of provision of knowledge to empower and innovation was not catered for at a national level. The new changing circumstances that we face must not be allowed to be a repetition of that experience, but rather a window in which we evolve our industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The report, as finalised by the Committee on International Trade, is one that I am able to recommend to this House. I congratulate the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The World Bank and the World Trade Organization predict that as a result of the abolition of all quotas China’s share of world trade in textiles and clothing will rise from 17% in 2003 to over 50% by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">Some argue that to date China’s imports have mostly grown at the expense of imports from other third countries which have seen their share of the EU market decrease, but it is already very clear that the EU textile and clothing industry is experiencing significant pressure. According to the European apparel and textile organisation, Eurotex, the sector could risk losing 1 000 jobs a day and up to a million jobs before the end of 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the steps that the Commission has finally taken to address the problem but I wonder what makes them so confident that a few years’ breathing space will really make any long-term difference. Since the sector in the EU has already had ten years in which to make adaptations to this new reality, what more will they do in the next few years that they have not already done? My concern in saying that is that the Commission is underestimating the size of the challenge we face.</p>
<p class="contents">Its response has been to urge European manufacturers to produce higher-value products rather than competing with China on basics, yet China’s ability to climb rapidly the value-added ladder across so many sectors shows how unhelpful this advice is.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also failed to acknowledge that this challenge is a systemic one, not a one-off sectoral one. The textile sector is likely to be only the first sector among many. As Mr Karim has just said, we already know that there are many other sectors that are about to cause us concern in terms of Chinese competition. I am thinking of footwear, bicycles, machine components, and also high-tech goods. But if the impact in the EU will be severe, in many parts of the developing world it will be devastating, especially for women who are disproportionately represented in these sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2000 textiles and clothing accounted for 95% of all Bangladesh’s industrial goods exports. In Laos they accounted for 93%, Cambodia 83%, Pakistan 73%, the list goes on. The sector employed nearly 2 million workers in Bangladesh, 1.4 million workers in Pakistan. Little wonder, then, that several dozen countries led by Bangladesh and Mauritius made an eleventh hour appeal to the World Trade Organization to save their textile industries. It is very unfortunate that their appeal fell on deaf ears, because China’s deflationary pressures are already driving down wages, pushing global suppliers to reduce their workers’ rights and conditions in a bid to remain competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Philippines, for example, the government has ruled that its law on the minimum wage will no longer apply to the clothing industry. The Bangladeshi government has recently announced that it will increase the number of authorised overtime hours and reduce the restriction on women’s night work.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, part of the solution undoubtedly lies in pressure on China to meet social and environmental standards, so that its competitive advantage is not based on the appalling exploitation of workers or the environment. But that alone is not enough. The challenge posed by China raises some fundamental questions about the logic and direction of free trade itself and it demonstrates the destruction that happens when a country has not just a comparative advantage but a more or less absolute advantage in so many areas. The old theories about free trade always being a win-win arrangement are shown to be fundamentally flawed and therefore the Commission urgently needs to undertake more research in order to understand these new trends better and formulate appropriate policy approaches.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I just want to say that I regret that two of the amendments submitted today link textiles and REACH. I think those amendments are very misleading and unhelpful and unfortunately, largely because of those amendments, my Group will abstain on the final vote on this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If you open up and liberalise the markets without imposing conditions, you simply have to expect other producers to seize their opportunity and benefit from it by rushing headlong into the newly-open markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Just take a look at China’s main imports at present: aluminium smelters, casting machines, presses, moulding dies, and roller mills. What that tells you is that we will have enormous problems in five years’ time – in the footwear industry, in the bicycle industry, in the car industry and in iron- and steelmaking. Not even the stay of execution until 2008 provided for by special safeguard clauses will solve the problem; it will do no more than alleviate it. It is naive to demand the same conditions of competition for trade with China and with other countries. Does that mean that, from 2008 onwards, a worker in the European textile industry will have to take home the same pay as his Chinese counterpart in order to be able to compete? The idea is absurd.</p>
<p class="contents">It is both an absurdity and a scandal that the European Union, by going as far as to subsidise those companies that transfer production to third countries, is sawing through the branch on which it sits. The only chance of a solution lies in the complete recasting of the EU’s trade policies. The EU must commit itself to a system of fair trade, and that involves abandoning the unfettered opening-up of markets and liberalisation. A fair balance of interests implies the promotion of trade where it is rational and not an end in itself, alongside the maintenance and promotion of local production and regional economic cycles, not only in our own regions but also in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This also involves something for which my own group has called, namely a commitment on the part of the European Union to improved working conditions and workers’ social security entitlements, as also to high environmental standards both in our own industry and in the production systems of our trading partners. This means taking into account, as appropriate, developmental differences between our various trading partners. It has to be said, though, that it is urgently necessary that the Commission’s mandate for trade negotiations be redrafted once and for all. The old mandate, dating back to 1999, has failed twice, in Seattle and Cancún, and it will fail again in Hong Kong. I do not grasp how the Commission is meant – as this report itself puts it – to draw up its future mandate itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I endorse the rapporteur’s demand for targeted support for research and development in the textile sector, where priority should be given to the development of safe, chemical-free textiles by way of the consistent application of the principle of mutual recognition, wholly in the spirit of REACH. I believe that there is also a need to ensure that consumers do not become specimens for the testing of textile products derived from every variety of nanotechnology before the effects of this have been adequately researched. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Alongside spectacular growth in the Chinese textiles exports, there is a deep crisis in the textiles sector within the European Union and in the developing countries including Bangladesh, Cambodia and Laos. I share the rapporteur’s concerns about the considerable growth in the quantity of Chinese textiles on the European market, and call on the Commission to closely monitor the implementation of the bilateral agreement between the European Union and China between 2005 and 2008. Let me underline the fact that this agreement is just the first step in making the global textiles market fair and enabling it to function properly. The Commission must continue the dialogue with Beijing to make it clear that a liberalised world market is dependent on a level playing field if it is to function.</p>
<p class="contents">Under no circumstances is it compatible with the principles of the free market that illegal state support systematic export subsidies should be paid, that intellectual property rights should be violated and that a country’s own market should be insufficiently open. These things cannot be explained by ignorance, given the precision with which Beijing reminds the European Union of its WTO obligations. The rapporteur is right to ask that attention be paid to China’s compliance with labour guidelines. In many factories, the workers, including many children, are required to work under appalling conditions. The Commission must actively pursue a policy aimed at improving working conditions in China. That is not only vital for the Chinese workers, but also for textile workers in neighbouring countries. As a result of the Chinese expansion, textile companies in those countries are forced to reduce production costs still further in order to remain competitive internationally.</p>
<p class="contents">I do think, though, that it is disappointing that the rapporteur should take so narrow a view of the future of the European textile sector as lying in a Euro-Mediterranean zone. Within the complex global textiles market, the European Union should not primarily focus on cooperation with one region. Moreover, concluding a trade agreement with a country such as Syria is, given the current human rights situation, unthinkable.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must clearly map the opportunities and threats within the global textiles sector without import quotas and formulate clear policy for the European textiles sector after 2008. Only a commercial and innovative European textiles sector can retain a competitive position on the global market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Total liberalisation, however, will only come about in 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Mrs Saïfi, whom I truly thank for her excellent work, rightly insists that the utmost attention continue to be paid to verifying the good will of the Chinese authorities and to keeping a worsening situation under control.</p>
<p class="contents">By means of the amendments to the final text, I wished to emphasise a number of extremely important aspects for the European textile sector and for manufactured goods in general.</p>
<p class="contents">Suitable penalties today need to be laid down, such as putting a ban on trade with the European Union for a certain period of time for all of those found guilty of illegally importing goods or of importing counterfeit goods, and who are thus implicated in a crime, the severity of which must be judged in terms of its repercussions on European society as a whole, not only on producers, but above all on consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">I call for constant monitoring of the Chinese authorities’ commitment to combating piracy the counterfeiting of trademarks and products, and child exploitation, and to ensuring respect for workers’ rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important problem arises from the fact that the boom in textile exports from China has caused devastating effects in those developing countries whose principal and essential market for placing and selling their goods used to be the European Union, which is now overloaded with Chinese goods. The needs of those countries must also be taken into account as the sector finds a new equilibrium in the next few years, which will be marked by trade liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the Commission’s responsibility to implement strategies providing vital support for modernisation and enabling businesses to confront, in an informed way and with a clear outlook, a path that is still an uphill climb, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Liberalisation of the global market cannot occur if the parties involved do not all respect the same rules and the provisions resulting from the agreements. The absence of rules or the failure to respect them prevents fair competition, and, in actual fact, invalidates the very concept of the free market. We are not only protecting an important EU sector of production, but we are also protecting the right of consumers to have access to safe and quality products, and the right of workers to know the true prospects for their future and to have the social clauses implemented with respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has to forcefully say to the rest of the world that there can be no free market without fair competition, and that in order for competition to be fair, the common rules must be respected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to join, I am sure in the name of all in this House, in utterly condemning that terrorism and in expressing condolence and sympathy to those who have been injured and killed.</p>
<p class="contents">We live in an age where terror seems to know no bounds. Coming from Northern Ireland, where we alas have known much of that in our history, one’s heart goes out to the people affected by this morning’s terrible events.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to this subject, Northern Ireland, like many parts of Europe, once boasted a vibrant and large textile industry. Today it is reduced to all but nothing, with thousands upon thousands of job losses. Since trade policy was foolishly handed over to the exclusive competence of the EU, the plain truth is that Member States are powerless to act in the face of cheap imports ravaging their textile industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The plain truth is also that the EU has failed the textile industry. The abolition of import quotas on 1 January 2005 has, in the UK and elsewhere, caused soaring imports, especially from China. Whereas we are denied import quotas, China’s state owned factories benefit from export subsidies, state aid and even free electricity, as well as the benefits of its artificially undervalued currency. Little wonder that we cannot compete.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Mandelson’s decision to impose anti-dumping duties on certain synthetic fabrics is welcome so far as it goes, but often such fabrics are then further processed in China to give them added value, thereby avoiding the anti-dumping duties. For example, a synthetic fibre that might be subject to that duty is given added value by making it into a roller blind, whereby it escapes the anti-dumping duty and is dumped in the EU at ridiculous prices. That loophole must be closed.</p>
<p class="contents">Generally, the Commission needs to be much more robust with China than it has been hitherto. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since 1 January 2005, WTO members can no longer impose quotas on textile and clothing imports. The impact of this measure on the European market has proven to be enormous, both for importers and producers. It is a good thing that the Commission has engaged in dialogue as a means of finding a solution to this dilemma, for by doing so, it has given the European producers some breathing space – no more than that, and nor can it be more than that, for the WTO does not allow any more and is not expected to change its position.</p>
<p class="contents">European producers will now have to come up with a real response to the new situation. We need a strategic response to the problems in the long term, because the European textiles and clothing sector, and not that sector alone, has a structural problem. There are many products that are, or can be, produced more cheaply in China, or maybe in other countries too. It is also a fact that China fails to adhere to the WTO rules, and this is a major problem, particularly in the areas of intellectual property, working conditions, the environment and market access. It is because of this that it can produce more cheaply, and the resulting unfair competition is something that really should be addressed. Compliance with the existing rules must be ensured. Many poorer countries have, in recent years, become hugely dependent on the textiles and clothing sector, and they, too, are seeing jobs disappear as they struggle to compete with China. We must prevent the least developed countries from becoming the biggest losers.</p>
<p class="contents">Too little consideration, moreover, is being given to the interests of importers and producers who, in response to the post-2005 situation, have entered into financial commitments, sometimes major ones. They should not become the victim of a rescue operation in a section of the production industry. They are entitled to predictability and legal certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we can, of course, protect our trade position, but always in line with the WTO, and showing due responsibility towards poor countries, and in respect of fair trade, human rights, and the environment. I might add that all WTO members should, in fact, do likewise. My compliments to Mrs Saïfi. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What that means is that in China, every year, 20 billion articles of clothing are produced, equivalent to four items for every human being on this earth. That sums up its capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now pass on to the social aspect. Women working in China’s textiles industry have a place right at the bottom of the social scale, many earning less than a dollar a day and, moreover, without any rights. Even so, China’s share in global textile markets is soaring. The poorest states in the world are now losing even their textile industries. Africa, stricken with Aids, is losing thousands of jobs a day. The European Union is currently losing a thousand a day. Around the world, over 30 million jobs are under threat of relocation, not to mention the 30 million jobs accounted for by sub-contractors. This is more than just a fundamental change in the world of work; it is a catastrophe.</p>
<p class="contents">Things have come to such a pass in China that the country is competing with itself; social security rules are being cut back and businesses are being discharged from their social obligations.

New market participants have appeared on the textile market, above all China and India. It is sad to hear statements by European Union officials that when China's membership of the WTO was negotiated ten years ago, no one imagined such growth in China. Textiles and other sectors with problems show that this is not about a single European state's inability to manage its economy. It is a problem for the majority of industrial sectors in the whole of Europe. While having an industrial policy, the European Union only really predicts the general direction for growth and employment. The sectors recommended for expansion are not identified; this is a matter for the Member States. As a counterbalance to China, the rapporteur proposes to concentrate textile production in the Mediterranean region. However, this will definitely not stop China, and Europe will have new competitors. There is a need for an analysis and long-term development forecast of EU industrial sectors, taking into account the appearance of new market participants and the division of markets. I therefore invite the European Parliament to urge the European Commission to prepare proposals to amend industrial policy, to forecast long-term industrial development up to 2030-2050 and to submit recommendations to industry about sectors of the future that should begin to be invested in now. If we do not undertake such measures, a Chinese ‘tsunami’ will devastate industry in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
