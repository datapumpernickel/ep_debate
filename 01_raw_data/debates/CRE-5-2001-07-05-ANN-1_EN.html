The IMF, for example, forecasts that inflation in Greece in 2001 will reach 3.4%, and considers that there is no realistic prospect of the economy growing at the projected rate of 5%-5.5% from this year. Moreover, Commissioner Solbes Mira has stated that a 3% economic growth rate in the eurozone countries is very high.

<p>On 12 February 2001, the ECOFIN Council discussed Greece’s initial stability programme which relates to the 2000-2004 period. The Greek Government had submitted the stability programme within six months of the Council Decision of 19 June 2000 on the introduction of the single currency by Greece with effect from 1 January 2001.</p>
<p>The ECOFIN Council was of the opinion that, under normal circumstances, the budget estimates provide sufficient guarantees against exceeding the shortage threshold of 3% of the GDP and are in accordance with the requirements of the stability and growth pact. The Council praised the programme’s tax consolidation strategy that aims for high primary surpluses, which is essential for a swift reduction in the State’s debt quota, which is still very high, and for the preparation for future problems, particularly the pressure on the budget due to an ageing population. However, the Council was of the opinion that such a strategy should first and foremost focus on adequately containing the increase in primary expenditure by prescribing clear, binding standards in order to reduce the current level of expenditure.</p>
<p>On 15 June 2001, the Council adopted the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines for 2001 in Gothenburg. Part of the Greek section of these guidelines reads as follows:</p>
<p>In 2000, economic activity in Greece was high, and for 2001 and 2002, an acceleration in real growth of 4.8% is expected. […] … but there is a risk of overheating as a result of the high level of activity and more flexible monetary conditions. An acceleration of economic activity will contribute to the gradual improvement of the situation within the labour market, but unemployment is expected to remain high.</p>
<p>Inflation in December 2000 rose to 3.7% (HICP). It is expected that it will decrease in 2001 and 2002 following a drop in import prices […]. Despite this, the risk of inflation (…) could remain present in 2001, thus rendering appropriate stabilising measures necessary. In this connection, the budget policy will be an important economic instrument to curb the pressure of inflation. Progress on wages is also of the essence.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0568"></a>

<p>According to the 12 June 2001 edition of the Sydsvenskan newspaper, the Commission President said after the result of the Irish referendum on the Treaty of Nice was announced that, since the Treaty was both a good and important one, the voters must simply have misunderstood it, and that the referendum debate covered many issues that the Treaty did not address.</p>
<p>By using such a line of argument, many parties that lose votes at elections could also conclude that they did so because of misunderstandings and that, since their manifestos are both good and important, they might just as well continue in power regardless of whether they lose at the polls.</p>

<p>Under Community legislation, any amendment to the Treaties requires the unanimous agreement of all the Member States. On 7 June, the Irish people voted by referendum against the Treaty of Nice and, as a result, it cannot be adopted. It would, under the circumstances, appear logical to halt the ratification procedures in other countries, together with any further action on the provisions of the Treaty, for example, further militarisation and the European parties. However, the General Affairs Council and the European Council in Gothenburg appear to have paid scant regard to the verdict by the Irish people. In the very brief reference to the Irish 'No' in the conclusions of the Gothenburg Summit, it is indicated that ratification procedure will continue and that the Council will do all it can to help the Irish Government to find a solution.</p>
<p>How does the Council intend to assist the Irish Government? Does it intend perhaps to bring pressure to bear for the holding of further referendums until the desired result is obtained? Does this not denote disrespect and contempt for the electorate and does it not smack of an inquisition, as observed by the Irish Deputy Prime Minister?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>Is the Council aware that the Irish Finance Minister Charlie McGreevy described Ireland's rejection of the Nice Treaty as 'a remarkably healthy development'? Is the Council aware that Mr McGreevy's continued Eurosceptic approach is an indication of his intention to provoke another row with our EU partners over Ireland's budgetary policy in the run-up to an autumn general election?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>Concerning the questions of Mr Sjöstedt and Mr Alyssandrakis on the Irish referendum on the Treaty of Nice, the Council stresses that the Treaty was negotiated and concluded by a conference of representatives of governments of the Member States (cf. Article 48 of the TEU) and that the Council itself did not take part in that conference. The Treaty must, of course, be ratified by all the Member States in accordance with their constitutional rules if it is to come into force.</p>
<p>At the meeting of the General Affairs Council of 11 June 2000, the Foreign Ministers, while expressing their respect for the will of the Irish people, regretted the outcome of the referendum. The ministers noted that the Irish government was deeply and resolutely committed to the European Union and to seeing the Treaty of Nice ratified. They ruled out any reopening of the text signed in Nice and said they would help the Irish government to find a solution by all means possible, taking due account of the concerns reflected in the result. These conclusions were confirmed by the Gothenburg European Council.</p>
<p>The Presidency will, obviously, be willing to aid the Irish government as soon as it has told the Council how it views the situation.</p>
<p>The result of the Irish referendum is a wake-up call to all of us. It shows a lack of interest in the European Union on the part of some of our citizens. However, the Union cannot be built without its citizens' consent. The Presidency believes that one of the key issues in the debate on the future of Europe will be the need, in this connection, to bring the Union closer to its citizens.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>Dozens injured, three seriously wounded, hundreds arrested and a brutal police attack (including the use of ammunition) was the outcome of the Gothenburg summit. Thousands of police officers were mobilised, road blocks set up, and the city cut in two to keep the enemy – the people – away from the place where the fifteen EU leaders would take decisions, as always, unbeknown to the people. The Swedish Prime Minister described the demonstrators as a 'gang of criminals'. The Member States' Interior Ministers are preparing an emergency conference to come up with a 'concerted and tough response to this new form of extremism, cross-border criminality'.</p>
<p>Does the Council approve of this kind of approach to anyone who disagrees and demonstrates their disagreement with the EU? Do the events in Gothenburg form part of the 'social dialogue' which the Council claims to be promoting by all means? Does it endorse the descriptions 'criminals' and 'cross-border criminality' and, if so, will it take the measures adopted to deal with 'organised crime'? How does it plan to deal with the demonstrations announced for Genoa on 20-22 July? Does it intend to speed up the formation of a European army and other repressive forces in order to make use of them during the next summit meeting to be held in Belgium at the end of the Presidency ?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>1. The Council wishes to inform the honourable Member that, pursuant to Article 2(2) of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, ‘where public policy or national security so require’, a Member State can reintroduce national border checks for a limited period and ‘at the earliest opportunity shall inform the other [Member States] thereof.’</p>
<p>Consequently, the free movement of individuals laid down in the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC) and the exercise of fundamental human rights assured by the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) can be restricted by Member States carrying out their responsibility in such circumstances (see Article 64(1) of the TEC, and in Article 10(2) and Article 11(2) of the ECHR.</p>
<p>In these circumstances and in accordance with the procedure established by Decision of the Executive Committee of 20 December 1995 SCH/Com-ex (95)20 rev. 2, established by the Schengen Convention, a procedure which was included in the framework of the European Union, the Swedish government informed the Council of its decision to temporarily reintroduce checks between 5 p.m. on 16 June 2001 and midday on 17 June 2001, on individuals at the border between Frederikshavn, in Denmark, and the port of Gothenburg in Sweden, for public policy reasons. The Council took note of this information.</p>
<p>The Council did not find any reasons to question the decision of the Swedish government.</p>
<p>The Council would remind the honourable Member that responsibility for maintaining public policy on the territory of Member States of the European Union falls within the exclusive competence of the authorities of Member States. The Council does not have the jurisdiction to adopt a position on a matter that does not fall within the areas of competence that are bestowed upon it by the treaties.</p>
<p>2. Following the violence in Gothenburg, however, and in order to be prepared for the next European Council, the Swedish presidency proposed that we look at additional coordination measures which could be taken in order to pre-empt and avoid the acts of violence perpetrated during high-level gatherings and meetings. This proposal has been accepted and the Council will hold the first meeting on these issues on 13 July, during which all aspects related to public safety will be taken into account.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>1. The Council wishes to draw the attention of the honourable Member to the fact that, in the conclusions on a strategy for sustainable development, the Gothenburg European Council did not explicitly refer to the issue of sensible management of water resources, but only mentioned the ‘sustainable use of natural resources’.</p>
<p>With regard to the text on the Sixth Action Programme for the Environment (which was submitted to the Heads of State or Government at Gothenburg) on which the Environment Council gave its political agreement on 7 June 2001, there are several references to the ‘sustainable use of water’ without further clarification. The text of the future decision on the Sixth APE will be finalised and will be submitted to the European Parliament for second reading in September.</p>
<p>2. In any case, the Council would like to stress that it is up to the Commission to check whether the Spanish hydrological plan conforms to Community legislation. It is also the Commission’s responsibility to take any appropriate initiatives at the outcome of this investigation.</p>
<p>The Council is therefore unable to express an opinion on this matter.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0574"></a>

The terms 'sovereign equality' and 'reality of the situation on the island' are totally contrary to Articles 9a and 9b of the Helsinki Council conclusions and to Articles 3 and 4(1) of Council Decision 2001/235/EC<a href="#defann_8_1" name="refann_8_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>of 8 March 2001 on the EU-Turkey partnership agreement.

<p>The issues relating to Cyprus and the peaceful settlement of disputes were raised as part of the item entitled ‘Exchange of views on international questions of common interest’ which were on the agenda of the EU-Turkey Association Council of 26 June. These were discussed in detail at a meeting with the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs as part of the political dialogue consolidated at the Association Council meeting. The EU made its point of view clear with regard to the well-established positions of the European Union, as they appear, in particular, in the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council.</p>

<p>1. The UN General Assembly’s Special Session on the follow-up to the World Summit for Children will be held in New York between 19 and 21 September 2001. The European Union will be playing a key role, for it devotes a great deal of its attention to striking the right balance between professional and family life, preventing problems in good time and adopting a preventive policy in the social sphere and in health care.</p>
<p>2. The principal objective of the Special Session is for the world community once again to display its determination concerning children’s rights and welfare. For that purpose, a balance sheet will need to be drawn up for the past ten years in the light of the commitments and objectives which were stipulated during the World Summit in 1990. In addition, full consideration will need to be given to the commitments and timeframes which were included in the Millennium Declaration and which supplemented those of the World Summit. These commitments relate to access to education, a reduction in the mortality of mothers, babies and children and a fight against communicable diseases, especially HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>3. The rights of the child are already enshrined in the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child. The EU’s guiding principle is therefore an approach based on those rights. The Special Session must aim to implement these rights, especially the right to health, food and education. The development not only of young children, but also of adolescents must be central. Measures to combat discrimination, particularly against girls, and to reduce discrepancies are important. The EU wants the welfare of children to be made a priority in all strategies to combat poverty.</p>
<p>4. It is also necessary for the Special Session to take a clear stand against violence and abuse. Children must be respected, their involvement in society promoted and their opinions heard. We must put a stop to the recruitment of child soldiers and to sex tourism. Full implementation of the Treaty is therefore a primary aim. In this connection, the EU considers it important to increase the resources made available to the Committee on the Rights of the Child, thus enabling that committee to carry out its duty – monitoring the application of the Treaty – successfully.</p>
<p>5. In the final document, measures must also be taken to guarantee those rights, including the allocation of maximum resources to children, and international solidarity. In addition, indicators must be prescribed for the protection of children: Treaties 138 and 182 of the ILO against dangerous work for children are good examples. A national policy for children is needed, including coordination mechanisms and an efficient monitoring system, such as the setting up of an ombudsman for children. Finally, links must be established with mainstream society, including the NGOs, industry, the media and, obviously, children themselves.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0582"></a>

<p>The Council would remind Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou that, on 29 June 2000, on the basis of Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the European Union, the Council adopted Directive 2000/43/EC implementing the principle of equal treatment of persons, irrespective of racial or ethnic origin.</p>
<p>The Council is aware that some discrimination based on race and ethnic origin still exists in Member States and consequently adopted Directive 2000/43/EC less than six months after the Commission presented its proposal to the Council.</p>
<p>This Directive seeks to combat direct and indirect discrimination as well as harassment, which is considered to be a form of discrimination. The scope of the Directive is very wide since it includes conditions of access to employment and promotion, access to professional training, employment and working conditions, membership of and involvement in a workers’ or employers’ organisation, social protection, social advantages, education and access to goods and services, in both the public and private sectors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this Directive provides for the adaptation of the burden of proof when persons who consider themselves wronged, because the principle of equal treatment has not been applied to them establish, before a court or other competent authority, facts from which it may be presumed that there has been discrimination. The Directive encourages dialogue between Member States and the social partners, on the one hand, and with NGOs on the other, with a view to fostering the principle of equal treatment, and it imposes upon Member States the obligation to designate a body or bodies for the promotion of equal treatment of all persons without discrimination on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin. As a vital tool for combating discrimination, the Directive must be implemented by Member States by 19 July 2003 at the latest and Member States must communicate to the Commission by 19 July 2005 at the latest, and every five years thereafter, all the information necessary for the Commission to draw up a report to the European Parliament and the Council on the application of this Directive. The Commission’s report shall take into account the opinion of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, as well as the viewpoints of the social partners and relevant non-governmental organisations.</p>
<p>This Directive is backed up by a five-year Community action programme to combat discrimination, from 2001 to 2006, which was adopted by the Council on 27 November 2000.</p>
<p>The programme is open to all bodies and public and/or private institutions working to combat discrimination, and three action strands are planned:</p>
<p>- The first strand aims to develop and disseminate comparable statistical series on the scale of discrimination in the Community and indicators for evaluating the effectiveness of anti-discrimination policy and practice. This area also seeks to analyse anti-discrimination legislation and practice, and to draw up thematic studies comparing and contrasting approaches within and across the different bases for discrimination.</p>
<p> The second strand aims to improve the capacity and effectiveness of target actors by means of funding for transnational exchange actions and the costs of running European-level NGOs.</p>
<p>- The third strand lays down support for measures such as the organisation of conferences, seminars and events at European and national level and the publication of materials to disseminate the results of the programme, and, in particular, through the construction of an Internet Site providing examples of good practice, a forum for the exchange of ideas and a database of potential partners for transnational exchange actions.</p>
<p>Lastly, I would like to remind Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou that there is also a draft decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a programme of Community action to encourage cooperation between Member States in combating social exclusion, which has been submitted to the co-decision procedure and on which the European Parliament has recently issued an opinion at second reading.</p>
<p>The Council’s determination to equip itself with instruments designed to ensure effective prevention against the types of discrimination it has noted has therefore already been consolidated. The Council, in conjunction with the Commission, will ensure that all forms of discrimination are genuinely eradicated.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0590"></a>

<p>The Greek press has recently reported that a letter was sent by two diplomats from the Albanian Foreign Ministry to Mr J. Solana, asking the CFSP chief for assistance by the EU in securing a more comprehensive solution to the Albanian question in Kosovo, more precisely in western Kosovo (that is to say the Presevo Valley in southern Serbia), the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Greece and Montenegro. They also raise the question of changes to the border, arguing that along the entire Albanian border the neighbouring populace consists of Albanians speaking the same language and having culture and blood (!). They also refer to the question of Tsamouria, which they refer to as the 'north-western province of Greece', referring to the oppression of the Albanian populace (estimated at 150 000) and maintaining that they were the victims of genocide by the Greek authorities.</p>
<p>Is the Council aware of this letter? Has it given any reply and, if so, what?

<p>The Council would like to remind the honourable Member that the countries involved in the Stabilisation and Association process, of which Albania is one, gave the commitment at the Zagreb Summit last November to conduct a policy of good neighbourly relations, which is based, amongst other things, on the respect for the rights of minority peoples and respect for the States’ international borders. This policy has been confirmed on many different occasions, the last time being on 16 May, at the meeting of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs on the Process for Cooperation in South East Europe which took place in Tirana. The final statement of this meeting, which was, moreover, chaired by the Albanian Minister for Foreign Affairs, confirmed the commitment of the participating States to the concepts of sovereignty, territorial integrity and maintaining borders inviolate.</p>
<p>In the past, the Council has involved the political leaders in Albania in continuing to exert their influence in order to restore peace and stability, and acknowledged that Albania has played a constructive role in the latest regional crises, particularly in FYROM and in Kosovo.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0584"></a>

<p>It is important that businesses within the Community should compete on equal terms. In recent years a number of cases have been observed in which large businesses in small countries have found it harder to obtain permission to implement structural changes and mergers than comparable businesses in large countries. This is on account of the natural circumstance that these large businesses with transnational, not to say global, ramifications enjoy a strong position in their own countries. Two Swedish examples may be cited: the vehicle manufacturer Volvo and the paper manufacturer SCA.</p>

<p>The definition of a relevant geographic market under the competition rules has as its purpose to enable a first indication as to whether firms have market power or would gain market power following a certain transaction. Avoiding the creation of market power, in its turn, is about protecting the competitive process in the market and thereby to ensure consumers a sufficient choice of products at competitive prices. The Commission must fulfil its obligation under the EC Treaty without undue regard to non-competition based arguments. The purpose of merger control is to ascertain that dominant positions are not created or re-enforced on any relevant market - regardless of whether the market in question is small or large.</p>
<p>To allow mergers leading to dominant positions in even small home markets would, in addition to being unlawful under the Merger Regulation, lead to discrimination against customers and consumers in smaller Member States. Such customers would become exposed to the dominance without the protection of competition rules that apply to those who live in a large Member State. It would also lead to discrimination against companies from larger Member States, who would firstly be barred from entering the market - or markets - of the dominant firm, whereas the merged entity would be able to enter the larger and more open Member States. Secondly, companies from larger Member States would also be discriminated by not being able to claim this peculiar "small market defence".</p>
<p>It should also be remembered that firms based in smaller countries, which have high market shares in their home markets, such as Volvo, Scania and SCA, are certainly not precluded from expanding through mergers. In fact, both Volvo and Scania found alternative structural transactions within little more than one month of the Commission's prohibition decision last year. This clearly demonstrates that the decision did not block the only viable option for these two firms.</p>
<p>Last year the Commission launched a review of the Merger Regulation, based on a Report submitted to the Council in July 2000. This exercise will cover a large number of issues and will give the opportunity for anyone interested to suggest improvements to the current system. It will also provide an opportunity to review in more detail the decision-making practice and market definition issues. It is currently foreseen that a Green paper will be adopted before the end of this year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0517"></a>

The European Council has thus improperly and with absolute disregard for the principle of subsidiarity, ignored the contribution of the constitutionally established regions to democratic decision-making.

<p>Between 1975 and 1998 the Commission gave EUR 747.72 million in subsidies to European petroleum, gas and coal producers.

It is now apparent from the European Commission's first assessment report on its White Paper, 'Energy for the Future; Sustainable Energy Sources', that only those alternative energy sources for which the Member States adopt extra measures can increase their market share (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2001&amp;nu_doc=0069">COM(2001)0069</a>/final).

<p>The Commission agrees with the Honourable Member on the necessity of increasing the amount of funding for renewable energy sources. However, it should be pointed out that Community funding complements national funding. In that sense, Community funding would only be available for renewable energy sources if priority is given by Member States for renewable energy projects when submitting proposals for Community co-financing.</p>
<p>As highlighted in the first progress report on the White Paper "Energy for the future: Renewable Energy Sources", the achievement of the objective of 12% of renewable energy in the overall energy consumption in the Community by 2010, needs additional effort at both, Community and national level.</p>
<p>Community funding for renewable energy sources is awarded, mainly, from the structural funds, the research and technological development (RTD) framework programme and promotion programmes, as the Altener programme.</p>
<p>For the period 1994-1999, the European Regional Development Funds (ERDF) allocated EUR 300 M to projects in the field of renewable energy sources which represents 10.5% of the total energy-related funding (EUR 2900 million or the 1.5% of the total expenditures of the ERDF for the period, EUR 200 billion.</p>
<p>Concerning the 5<span class="sup">th</span> RTD framework programme (FP) covering the period 1998-2002, the amount devoted to renewable energy sources was about EUR 400 M. The promotional programme Altener has a budget of EUR 77 M for the period 1998-2002.</p>
<p>Budget allocated for renewable energy sources in both, the 6<span class="sup">th</span> RTD FP and Altener for the coming years, 2003-2007, is foreseen to growth.</p>
<p>As regards the structural funds it should be pointed out that renewable energy sources are considered as a priority in the new regulation for the period 2000-2006, and total renewable energy related funding is expected to increase. Nevertheless, the amount devoted to renewable energy projects in Member States will only be known after adoption of the national programmes submitted to the Commission. Funding for renewable energy installations is also foreseen within the European Agricultural guarantee and Guidance Fund (EAGGF), mainly, under rural development regulation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0528"></a>

<p>In the light of the Commission's answer to my previous question (<a href="/doceo/document/E-5-2001-0332_EN.html">E-0332/01</a>) that it was 'currently investigating the file, taking into account the conservation value of the site, and the elements supplied by the Greek authorities in their reply. A clear position on this issue is expected very soon', what position has the Commission reached which will avoid damage to the environment and the cultural heritage, and ensure that the site in question is not used for the construction of the Olympic Rowing and Canoeing Centre?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The question asked by the Honourable Member concerns the management of copyright and neighbouring rights regarding, in particular, satellite broadcasting and the redistribution of broadcasts by cable, and transfrontier reception of digital television services.</p>
<p>An operational management of rights is of particular importance for the functioning of the Internal Market, especially in the context of the new services of the Information Society. A study on certain aspects of collective management was carried out at the Commission’s request and completed in early 2000. Discussions gained momentum at a conference on collective management organised in March 2000 by the Portuguese Presidency in Evora and at the International Conference on ‘The Management and Legitimate Use of Intellectual Property’ organised by the Commission in Strasbourg in July 2000. As a follow-up to that conference, the Commission organised a public hearing on collective management in Brussels on 13 and 14 November 2000. This hearing raised several important issues concerning collective management, especially with regards to digital rights management.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently examining in detail all the aspects of the topic of collective management and intends to finalise its evaluation in the course of this year. The assessment will include the question of whether further legislation at Community level is needed and, if so, what sort of content it should have in order to avoid or eliminate potential obstacles within the Internal Market and to adapt this sector to the new technological environment.</p>
<p>As regards the specific issue of cable distributors’ access to the rights needed for cable distribution, Directive 93/83/EEC of 27 September 1993, on satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission has provided a legal framework for the acquisition of copyright and neighbouring rights. The implementation of this Directive by Member States and its functioning in practice will be assessed in a report, which the Commission intends to submit later this year. This report will also address copyright and neighbouring rights aspects relating to digital TV in Europe.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission proposal builds essentially on the successful language regime of the European Patent Convention. This regime provides three working languages for the European Patent Office (EN, FR, and DE). The system has been accepted by the Member States of the European Community - all Parties to the European Patent Convention.</p>
<p>By not proposing any further translations for the validity of the Community patent than those foreseen for the grant of a European Patent, the Commission has followed a pragmatic approach. It represents a balance between two interests: 1) the need to keep cost for a Community patent under control and 2) the access to patent information. This balance is all the more appropriate as translations are in practice only rarely consulted: practise has learnt that those who are interested in obtaining patent information seem to prefer to consult the patent in the language in which it has been granted</p>
<p>The Commission has nevertheless proposed to protect an alleged infringer who has his residence or principal place of business in a Member State whose official language, which is also an official language of the Community, is not the language in which the patent was granted or in which a voluntary translation has been made public. Such a person is presumed, until proven otherwise, not to have knowingly infringed the patent. He shall then be liable to pay for damages for infringement only from the time when he is notified of a translation in the official language of that Member State. If the Member State has two or more official languages which are also official languages of the Community, the person is entitled to a notification in one of those official languages that he knows.</p>

<p>As the honourable Member may know, the ANIMO information system which tracks the movement of live animals within the Community or those arriving from third countries does not belong to the Commission but to the Member States.</p>
<p>With this computerised system the local veterinary authority at the place of origin of an outbreak informs the local veterinary authority at the place of destination on a planned intra-Community movement of animals.</p>
<p>The USA, Canada and New Zealand were seriously concerned about the movement of animals from affected Member States to non affected Member States during the critical periods of the recent foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak.</p>
<p>During a technical meeting on April 23rd between representatives from these third countries and the Member States and the Commission, it was agreed that the Member States should forward the ANIMO information on these movements to the Commission. The Commission would then forward this information as a single package to the USA, Canada and New Zealand.</p>
<p>The Commission received this information and forwarded it to these third countries.</p>
<p>It was evident that there were a few minor mistakes in these records due to coding errors introduced by the Dutch local authorities when entering data into the system.</p>
<p>One of these mistakes did indeed concern Denmark, but it was very quickly discovered, corrected and a full written explanation was immediately given to the USA, Canada and New Zealand authorities.</p>
<p>Throughout the crisis the Commission, in very close cooperation with the Member States, met on several occasions with representatives of these third countries, including the USA.</p>
<p>During all of these contacts the Commission continued to press strongly for regionalisation of the Community; with Denmark being frequently mentioned.</p>
<p>The Danish situation was particularly emphasised during the meetings with the Americans, because of its FMD free status and the very significant Danish export trade, which was blocked by American safeguard measures.</p>
<p>From day one in mid-March, the Commission has worked closely with the representatives of the Member States. The Commission succeeded in ensuring virtually total agreement among Member States about a common strategy and objectives. The Commission was also able to achieve a very high degree of co-ordination, which greatly assisted all its representations vis-à-vis third countries.</p>
<p>There were regular contacts between the Commission and the Permanent Danish Representation from the moment that the crisis broke out in March.</p>
<p>In such situations, it is important that all Community forces are mobilised to obtain a common agreed objective.</p>
<p>In order to ensure a co-ordinated action of the Commission at international level, a Commission Task Force with Directorates General Health and Consumer Protection, Trade, Agriculture, External Relations, Enlargement, and Enterprise was established on 16 March, meeting after that on a weekly basis</p>
<p>The officials at the Permanent Representations, in the Commission, at the Delegations of the Commission and at the Embassies of the Member States in third countries worked intensively together to inform the Community's main trading partners on the evolution of the disease situation on a day to day basis and to discuss it with them. It also contacted key individuals, including the United States Secretary for Agriculture, to outline the Community measures in place to ensure the safety of exports.</p>
<p>It is therefore an example of how positively working together can help minimise the damage that can happen during such a widespread epidemic.</p>
<p>While the results of these efforts regrettably did not materialise in the case of the USA until mid May, The Commission is convinced that the gradual regionalisation by other key trading partners such as Russia, Japan and New Zealand is largely the result of our joint efforts.</p>
<p>The Commission has for several years been pressing as hard as possible to get the main trading partners to agree to regionalise in cases of outbreaks of diseases such as Foot and Mouth Disease or Classical Swine Fever.</p>
<p>Regionalisation is also a key element in the Community's import policy but the Community wants to be treated on a like for like basis.</p>
<p>The Commission has for instance repeatedly raised its concerns in this respect with its American counter parts, first Secretary Glickman and now Secretary Veneman.</p>
<p>It is the Commission belief that without a common recognition of this internationally accepted principle and its practical implementation, there is a recipe for disproportionate safeguard measures in cases of disease outbreaks.</p>
<p>Finally the Honourable Member is reminded that the Commission wishes to go further than just to advocate regionalisation of the Community into Member States.</p>
<p>As has been shown, the Community system of regionalisation can work successfully and efficiently with regions far smaller than a full Member State, if the outbreak is indeed geographically adequately isolated and controlled.</p>
<p>This was seen most recently in the cases of the Netherlands, Ireland and France during the FMD outbreak.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0538"></a>

<p>The two sides of industry play an important role within the European Union, both at national and Community level and at a sectoral as well as a multi-sectoral level. Dialogue between management and labour in the EU does not merely involve the exchange of views and ideas, but also negotiation, with agreements even being concluded which are subsequently translated into directives.

<p>The Commission shares the view of the Honourable Member that social dialogue is part of the Community acquis; it is part of the negotiations process and the pre-accession strategy with the candidate countries.</p>
<p>Applicant countries do not participate in social dialogue committees as they do not participate either in other committees. However, they may be invited exceptionally on an ad hoc basis as experts in sectorial social dialogue committees if a point of the agenda requires such an expertise.</p>
<p>In the framework of the pre-accession strategy, the Commission intensified its assistance and funding of social partners' initiatives in the Commission enlargement process. For instance, it supported a major joint Conference that European social partners organised in Bratislava last March. As a follow-up of a first conference organised in this field in Warsaw two years earlier, this Bratislava conference allowed to have a first assessment of social dialogue in candidate countries and to identify ways to help them to make some progress in this field.</p>
<p>A budget line on social dialogue is also aimed at helping the candidate countries to carry out activities for improving social dialogue and also to prepare themselves to their forthcoming participation in the European social dialogue.</p>
<p>It should also be emphasised that more than half of the candidate countries have a project on social dialogue within the PHARE programme underway, and this should also help candidate countries to create the necessary structures and practices in this important area.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0543"></a>

<p>During a discussion on the Future of Europe with MEPs on the Constitutional Affairs Committee on Monday 28 May, Commissioner Barnier gave his vision of how national MPs could become more involved in the Union’s legislative process.

<p>It is within the framework of this debate that Commissioner Barnier expressed his personal reticence regarding any development that would be likely to weaken the role of the European Parliament or make its institutional architecture more complex and less effective. This danger would arise particularly if it were decided to set up a new legislative chamber made up of the representatives of national parliaments, as already proposed in the public debate last year by Europe's political leaders. Commissioner Barnier also stressed that the proper provision of information and the association of national parliaments are essentially matters for national decisions, which each Member State should take in accordance with its own constitutional provisions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0549"></a>

<p>The Commission condemns acts of violent rioting such as those seen in the United Kingdom in recent weeks, whatever their cause. The events would be particularly worrying if it transpires that they were racially motivated.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member is aware that the Council has adopted a Community Action Programme against Discrimination which began on 1 January this year. The programme will enable the Community to analyse the effects of discrimination on a range of grounds, including racial and ethnic origin, to support the efforts of the Member States to combat such discrimination. To assist it in these efforts, the Commission intends to establish groups of independent experts from each of the Member States who will be responsible for evaluating the causes and effects of discrimination and the effectiveness of policies and practices to combat it.</p>
<p>This programme is only one part of the Union's action to combat racism and racial discrimination. The Commission adopted on 1 June a Communication as a contribution to the forthcoming World Conference Against Racism, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, which will take place in Durban, South Africa from 31 August to 7 September this year. This Communication sets out in one document the range of activities carried out by the Union and which together form an integrated strategy to combat racism.</p>
<p>In addition, the European Monitoring Centre on racism and xenophobia, established in Vienna, has the specific task of providing the Community and its Member States with objective, reliable and comparable data at European level on the phenomena of racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism. The Commission is sure that the Centre will wish to incorporate information on these events into its work.</p>
<p>In the field of criminal law, the Commission Working Programme for this year foresees the presentation of a proposal for a framework decision according to Article 34.2 (b) of the TEU. It would be aimed at approximation of the laws and regulations of the Member States regarding racist and xenophobic offences. Framework decisions are binding upon the Member States as to the result to be achieved but leave to the national authorities the choice of the form and methods.</p>
<p>Finally, while the Union can and must establish a framework within which the fight against racism can be taken forward at the level of the Union, the Commission emphasises that the main action to combat racism must take place at national, regional and local levels and that such action falls to the responsibility of the Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0552"></a>

<p>On 5 June 2001 Mr François Verstrynge, the Commission's Deputy Director-General for the environment, told various Spanish media organs that he supported Spain's National Hydrological Plan (NHP), claiming that this plan 'is not only commendable but also exportable to areas with water problems' and that it merits economic support from the EU.</p>

<p>The Commission has been following the elaboration of the Spanish National Hydrological Plan with great interest. At the initiative of the Spanish Environment Minister, Mr Matas, a presentation of the main elements of the plan was made by the Minister to the Member of the Commission responsible for the Environment, Mrs Margot Wallström. The Spanish authorities have also presented the Commission with extensive documentation concerning the plan. The Commission has consistently made very clear to the Spanish authorities the need to ensure, both during the formal adoption procedure of the plan and later on during the process of its implementation, that relevant European legislation is fully respected. In particular, the Commission has drawn the attention of the Spanish authorities to the requirements of the habitats directive (92/43/EEC), the environmental impact assessment directive (Directive 85/337/EEC as modified by 97/11/EC) and the water framework directive (Directive 2000/60/EC). The Commission is continuing technical exchanges with the Spanish authorities on this matter.</p>
<p>Concerning the comments made recently by a senior Commission official, it should be pointed out that the interview in question was recorded in April and broadcast in June. With regard to the observations made by the official, our understanding is that he said that “the project of the Spanish government is interesting” and “ that the Community Executive sees the Ebro transfer as a solution to the water shortage problem in Spain”.</p>
<p>The senior official also said that “ the results of a study done by the Commission in the Iberian peninsula, point out that there is enough water for the two countries (Portugal and Spain) but that the problem is that the water resources are not well distributed in space and time. Water is in the North in winter and it is needed in the South during summertime, so it can be said that this is a question of water system management.”</p>
<p>Referring to the Spanish-Portuguese agreement in relation to shared water management, he added that ” the Iberian peninsula could be an example to other parts of the world with water shortage problems”.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is paying particular attention to the protection of Europe's forests, half the total area of which is classified as an area at risk from fire. Council Regulation (EEC) No 2158/92<a href="#defann_41_1" name="refann_41_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on protection of the Community's forests against fire, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) 308/97<a href="#defann_41_2" name="refann_41_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, formalises the Commission's commitments in this field.</p>
<p>The global plan for the protection of forests developed by the Greek government lays down a raft of measures concerning, in particular, raising public awareness and equipment for the prevention of fire and the surveillance of forests. Under this plan, the Commission has cofinanced 79 Greek projects to the value of EUR 18 million under the different measures mentioned above, during the period 1992-1998.</p>
<p>The other principal financial aid (in million euro) granted during the period 1993-1999 is as follows:</p>
<p>Cohesion Fund equipment for fire services 7.1</p>
<p>Cohesion Fund equipment for fire services 31.5</p>
<p>Cohesion Fund prevention of forest fires, soil protection and reforestation 12.-</p>
<p>ERDF fire-fighting equipment 3.15</p>
<p>Environment OP equipment for fire services 2.25</p>
<p>Industry OP equipment for fire services 4.8</p>
<p>GI Interreg II purchase of fire-fighting vessels in the ports of Igoumenitsa and Patras 6.-</p>
<p>EAGGF – Guidance section reestablishment of burnt forests and protection of soil against erosion 176.-</p>
<p>During the current period, 2000-2006, it is likely that further cofinancing will be proposed by the Greek authorities in the field of the protection of forests but, at this stage in the planning, we do not yet know what all the projects will be. Under the Cohesion Fund, a request for aid to a value of EUR 50 million was made for the purchase of fire-fighting equipment; furthermore, the Road OP provides for a sum of EUR 24 million to be allocated to the protection of forests, 75% of which is to be in the form of aid.</p>
<p>The organisation of the fire services and the use made of their equipment are the responsibility of the Member States. Moreover, the Commission does not possess comparative evaluations of the effectiveness of the fire services in the different Member States. In any case, it can only regret the fact that forest fires continue to devastate the Greek countryside and citizens' properties every year, despite the endeavours of the fire services and the sums invested in equipment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission does not have Community cofinancing instruments for compensating farmers whose harvests and productions have suffered damage caused by drought. However, the Commission is prepared to examine proposals for State aid to such farmers which conform to the guidelines on State aid to agriculture – ref. 2000/C 28/02.</p>
<p>With regard to the structural measures for water management, the Commission favours projects which seek to improve water resource management in the agricultural and other sectors. Thus, it gives priority to surface water recovery operations such as the building of reservoirs, the replacement of systems which are in disrepair with closed irrigation networks in order to reduce leaks and to rationalise water usage, the replenishing of groundwater etc. One example of this new approach, which, moreover, is also supported by the Greek authorities, is the restoration of Lake Carla in Thessalia.</p>
<p>It is these types of operations which will be cofinanced under the Community support framework 2000-2006 for Greece and they should, amongst other things, make a positive contribution to the fight against desertification.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0566"></a>

<p>The Commission assesses the social and regional context related to the Community coal industry when it approves the aid granted annually to that industry. It is on this basis that much of the aid is granted. However, this aid must be gradually reduced while, at the same time, these regions must be given the time to carry out the structural changes necessary in order for them to diversify.</p>
<p>The Commission assists these regions through intensive Structural Fund measures with a view to creating the conditions for new initiatives adapted to the specific conditions of the different regions. Therefore, in the regions eligible for regional aid, the Commission authorises State aid to the value of a maximum of 50% of the cost of the initial investments. It should be noted that the choice of eligible regions within the framework of guidelines for regional aid for the period 2000-2006 is largely up to the Member States.</p>
<p>In the Green Paper 'Towards a European strategy for security of energy supply', the Commission proposed maintaining a subsidised coal production threshold in a framework which must be compatible with the objective of sustainable development. In effect, the Commission considers that reasons other than social and regional considerations can play a role in the debate on the appropriateness of maintaining a coal production in operation through State aid.</p>

<p>On an introductory note, it should be noted that the joint declaration on Mount Athos annexed to the Final Act of the Agreement on the Accession of the Republic of Greece to the European Communities (OJ L 291 of 19.11.1979, p. 186), recognises that the special statute is granted to Mount Athos solely on spiritual and religious grounds and that the Community will ensure that it takes account of this in the application and further development of provisions of Community law, particularly with regard to exemptions from customs and excise duties and the right of establishment.</p>
<p>This declaration was confirmed both by the Treaty of Amsterdam (Declarations of which the Conference took note – Declaration by Greece on the status of churches and non-confessional organisations OJ C 340 of 10.11.1997, p144) and by the Final Act of the Agreement on the Accession of the Republic of Greece to the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement (OJ L 239 of 22.09.2000, p. 83-89).</p>
<p>In consideration of these provisions and of the fact that the total ban on the access of women to Mount Athos is a tradition which has been practised for a millennium and is based on religious grounds, the European Commission does not intend to take any action to remove this ban.</p>

<p>Danish State Railways (DSB) is a government-owned limited company which receives considerable sums in government aid each year to meet its obligations as a public service provider of train travel, inter alia. As part of its overall operations, DSB runs a travel agency called DSB Rejsebureau, which in addition to selling its own products, also conducts general business as a travel agency. Aid granted lawfully to other activities in DSB may not, of course, be transferred to DSB Rejsebureau in the event of the travel agency having a deficit since DSB Rejsebureau operates on a free and deregulated market with numerous private competitors.</p>
<p>Since 1 January 1999, DSB Rejsebureau has been an integrated part of overall DSB operations and no longer reports its own accounts separately in the way all other travel agencies in Denmark are otherwise required to do under the law on annual accounts of public and private limited companies. The pre-1999 accounts show that DSB Rejsebureau was operating at a substantial deficit and there is concern that illegal cross-subsidisation is taking place.</p>
<p>Is the particular position of DSB Rejsebureau contrary to current EU legislation and, if so, what action does the Commission intend to take? In addition, how will the Commission ensure that illegal cross-subsidisation of DSB Rejsebureau does not occur?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Community legislation does not require that DSB Rejsebureau carries out its activity in a legal form independent from DSB as it is for any undertaking, public or private, to organise its structure as it see fit. Consequently, the fact that DSB Rejsebureau does not issue independent annual accounts does not infringe Community legislation.</p>
<p>However, the Commission acknowledges that when an undertaking such as DSB, which is entrusted with the provision of services in the general interest for which it is compensated, also is pursuing other commercial activities on an open and competitive market, competition issues and, in particular state aid issues may arise. Accordingly, the “Transparency Directive”1 obliges such undertakings to operate a system of separate accounts. Such accounts should show the distinction between different activities, the costs and revenues associated with each activity and the methods of costs and revenue assignment and allocation. They should be available in relation to (i) products and services in respect of which the Member State has entrusted the undertaking with the operation of a service in the general interest and (ii) for each other product or service in respect of which the undertaking is active.</p>
<p>In any event, the Commission will examine and analyse any information that suggests that DSB is cross subsidising its travel agency by way of public funds.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0576"></a>

In October the AMVTN will be changing its title to AMANET as it has been authorised by its coordinating committee also to test new medicines).</p>
<p>It will be recalled that Parliament has adopted budget lines B7-6211 and B7-6212 (now B7-6213) with the very aim of supporting EU efforts to develop medicines and vaccines and to support schemes for improving local health infrastructure and preventive programmes in developing countries to combat poverty-related diseases.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>A great deal of progress has been made in research on malaria vaccines, and, with Community support, about 14 possible candidates have been studied. These represent a very large share of the global effort, creating a specific responsibility for the Community to make products for malaria protection available.</p>
<p>EMVI, the European Malaria Vaccine Initiative, was created through a contract from the Commission (INCO-programme) to the University of Bergen (Norway), and became operational in 1999. Its main thrust is to identify promising malaria vaccine candidates and to bring them into early clinical (safety) testing, which is typically done in European volunteers. This highly specialised scope of EMVI is the response to a well-acknowledged bottleneck in publicly-funded vaccine research, where research and development (R&amp;D) efforts frequently stop at the late pre-clinical stage, and do not move into clinical validation, for reasons of lack of funds and technical know-how.</p>
<p>EMVI efforts correspond to those undertaken by similar private public partnerships while capitalising on European assets in malaria vaccine research and thus keeping a genuine European approach.</p>
<p>Support to the African Malaria Vaccine Testing Network (AMVTN) represents a critical opportunity to join forces between the Commission's services involved and herewith to capitalise on long-term and ongoing investments into malaria vaccine development and capacity building in developing countries.</p>
<p>The specific partnership between EMVI and AMVTN, which was conceived from the start in order to move promising vaccine candidates further along the development pipeline, adds a great deal of credibility to the whole endeavour.</p>
<p>Today, EMVI is operating on a fairly limited budget, with secretariat functions supported by the Commission (INCO programme), and experimental vaccine operations being financed through voluntary contributions from Member States. Nevertheless, EMVI has been able to establish a malaria vaccine R&amp;D portfolio that could be enlarged if more funds become available. Indeed, although malaria vaccine research is quite advanced, the definitive criteria of how to measure efficacy in humans are remain unknown, and can therefore only be addressed in field trials.</p>
<p>More recently, the "Quality of life programme" has also been able to support more advanced malaria vaccine R&amp;D projects, some of which also encompass early stage clinical testing in human subjects. Clearly, the time has come to get fully prepared to take up these vaccine candidates for efficacy assessment in disease-endemic regions, and in priority in Africa.</p>
<p>The AMVTN represents the major opportunity for the next years to further develop and assess efficacy and field effectiveness of malaria vaccines under the ownership of developing countries.</p>
<p>Apart from a core grant of the INCO programme, AMVTN has attracted funding from the World health organisation (WHO) and industry and has already received much credit for important training activities, mainly on scientific data management, health research ethics in Africa, or on good clinical practices for clinical trials, which are enabling African researchers to design, conduct and monitor large-scale vaccine studies among their populations while respecting highly sophisticated international obligations in terms of research subject protection and data quality.</p>
<p>Now, AMVTN is targeting trial site development based on earlier extensive epidemiological ground-work made by three African countries themselves, with support from Community/Member States programmes. Its current effort to establish itself as a legal body under Tanzanian law is an important prerequisite to play an active role in support of the much-needed expansion of clinical trials in the region.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
