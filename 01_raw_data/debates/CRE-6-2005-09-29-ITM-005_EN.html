<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Caroline Lucas (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, it is very timely that we are having this debate on my China report straight after the debate on textiles. The thrust of my report is that the textiles industry is really just the tip of the iceberg. We are talking about textiles today, but tomorrow it will be footwear, the day after that it will be bicycles, and then automobiles, machine components or high-tech goods. What we are facing here is not just a one-off issue limited to one sector, but a systemic issue, a challenge of much greater scope than I believe the Commission recognises.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have heard from Mr Kovács echoes what we hear all the time from Mr Mandelson too. To be honest, it is not very reassuring. What we are hearing from the Commission is an extraordinarily complacent and also rather patronising attitude that somehow, all we need to do in the European Union is to move a little bit further up the higher value-added chain and even perhaps to give up what is left of our old manufacturing base and concentrate instead on the knowledge-based industries. That kind of idea seems to be in complete denial of the fact that China is developing its own lower-cost but highly-skilled expertise in those areas too. Almost 20% of China's exports are now classified as high-tech. With over 2 million graduates every single year, there is every reason to believe that percentage will grow.</p>
<p class="contents">The traditional assumption that the EU and US will keep leading in knowledge-intensive industries, while developing countries will somehow just be left to focus on the lower-skilled areas, is rightly being seriously contested. This is a patronising and complacent attitude and one that is completely out of date and out of tune with where we are today.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why my report calls on the Commission to rethink its strategy, to wake up to the fact that old fashioned concepts of national comparative advantage simply no longer apply in a world where brain power can zip round the globe at the flick of a computer key.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of rethinking that old trade paradigm is crucial, not just for employment in the EU, but also for the survival of many developing countries' industries as well, including some of the poorest in the developing world. To take the example of textiles again, we have heard already in the debate how countries such as Bangladesh, Laos, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Nepal all depend on textile and clothing for the vast majority of their industrial exports. Many of them face devastation as a result of increasing volumes of cheap Chinese exports. Not only are they facing the closure of their own factories, but we are seeing Chinese competitive pressures forcing down social standards, This essentially savage free trade dogma means that some of the poorest countries in the world are being thrown into cut-throat competition with one another in a race to the bottom on wages, social standards and, basically, anything that can be made cheaper.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Philippines the government has ruled that the minimum wage will no longer apply in the textiles sector. In Bangladesh restrictions on night work and overtime are being lifted. We are seeing these key standards that have been fought over for very many years now being rolled back in the name of trying to be ever more competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as demanding a complete reassessment of the trade model, it is clear that we also urgently need to redouble our efforts to ensure that international trade is based on a platform of minimum social and environmental standards. It is clear, unfortunately, that China's competitiveness is built, at least in part, on its exploitation of its workers and on its externalisation of social and environmental costs.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, although in theory at least China has strict laws when it comes to what is in its rule books, in practice those laws are flouted time and again. It is a shocking fact that over 100 000 people per year are estimated to die in work-related accidents in China.</p>
<p class="contents">The report calls for minimum social standards, the ILO standards, trade union standards, and cooperation between European trade unions and those groups that are trying to set up similar bodies in China. It also looks at the environmental impact of the development model which we in the West have also followed. We need to change it, but what we see in China is the acceleration of that model. The impact is clearly a massive one on the resources of other nations. China is already the world's second largest consumer of oil and water and trails only the US in CO2 emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is only by challenging the key free trade model that we can really make sure that all workers in the world have the chance to earn a decent livelihood. I urge Members to support this report.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">László Kovács, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, firstly I would like to thank Parliament and the Committee on International Trade for putting this very timely and important issue on the agenda and I would also like to express my personal appreciation to the rapporteur, Ms Lucas, for the report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission highly appreciates this report and sees it as a very valuable contribution to its policy making. China's rise is a challenge, but it is also an opportunity. Both aspects are well reflected in this report. When the report says that Chinese expansion will bring enormous beneficial possibilities but also raises legislative concerns for European industry, I can only agree, and it is in precisely this balance that we have to act.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you a few facts regarding the latest strengths of our trade relations with China. It is clear that China is a big economy and will gradually become competitive in more and more industrial sectors. Just like the EU or the US, China is likely to produce a broad range of industrial products. The challenge for Europe is not only to trade Airbus planes for tee-shirts, but increasingly to trade similar products within the same sector, so that European firms prosper as a result of their products' distinctiveness and quality. For example, parts of Europe's textile industry remain very competitive. At present Europe's overall trading position remains strong due to its ability to sell upmarket products. The EU is the first exporter of goods and services and the first direct investor abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a key point for the linkage between competitiveness and the EU social model. The EU produces value-added upmarket products and can sell them abroad due to settled non-price factors such as innovative features, quality and reputation, continuity over time or related services. However, the EU position is under challenge. The European industry is losing ground in high-technology products. It is trailing behind in several high-tech products, whereas China is rapidly catching up.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU position is also at risk due to the geographical orientation of its exports which are strong in countries where demand is static, but less well-positioned in rapidly growing areas such as Asia. It is more a race to the top than a race to the bottom. EU companies cannot afford to miss market opportunities in these dynamic areas which already account for half of world import growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe's future is to focus on what we do well. The EU has a strong global export profile in high-quality and high-tech products and services which now account for about half of European exports and a third of world demand. However, continued innovation and investment in this comparative advantage is crucial. Better respect and enforcement of intellectual property rights at international level is therefore of the utmost importance.</p>
<p class="contents">Addressing barriers to EU exports in third countries also accounts for the bulk of the potential to improve the competitive position of EU industry. The EU stands to win from the further opening of markets worldwide. By negotiating the removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers and promoting regulatory dialogues with our trading partners where appropriate, the EU can open new markets for its exporters. Therefore the Commission's Lisbon Strategy, the strategy of growth, jobs and competitiveness set out last February, rests on three pillars: opening markets to drive productivity and innovation; investing in education and research to enable us to compete; and reforming labour markets and welfare states to get people into jobs, improve employability and skills and extend opportunities to those whom economic developments are leaving behind.</p>
<p class="contents">We acknowledge the efforts China has undertaken to implement its WTO commitments as it enters into its fifth and last year of transition after its accession. We also have to make clear that unsolved issues have to be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">In sectors such as automotives, telecom and banking there is a clear call for action on the Chinese side to get fully in line with its commitments. On our side we must use the whole range of instruments at hand to push these cases forward both bilaterally and multilaterally.</p>
<p class="contents">For good reason, this report gives special attention to lack of intellectual property rights implementation in China. This report and the public at large are right to say that while we acknowledge China's competitive advantage in particular in labour-intensive production, it is only just that our intellectual property is equally acknowledged and protected. We are not only speaking about CDs and handbags, but also machinery and hi-tech products. China has made progress in adopting adequate IPR laws; we now have to focus on issues of implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusion of a customs cooperation and mutual assistance agreement between the European Commission and China, which entered into force on 1 April 2005, is an important concrete development in this field. The fight against counterfeit and piracy, including the protection of intellectual property rights and security of the international supply chain, are the main EU priorities for closer cooperation in the customs area.</p>
<p class="contents">These issues, among others, will be discussed at the first meeting of the joint customs cooperation committee on 14 November 2005. Joint activities are already ongoing in the area of intellectual property rights where a working visit of a team of EU custom experts is scheduled at the invitation of the Chinese customs.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, the newly established EU-China working group on IPR will concentrate on concrete business issues. We stand ready to assist China on this way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Because, as the last OECD report has shown, it is very much in China's own interest, I am grateful that Parliament strongly backs our report on this issue. As an advocate of high social standards the Commission believes it is in the interest of all countries to ratify key ILO conventions and other relevant international agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that high social and environmental standards are fundamental for sustainable development and cooperate with our trading partners to this end in all relevant instances, be they bilateral or multilateral.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission supports China's recent efforts to take greater account of environmental considerations and is actively engaged with China on ways to develop further environmental cooperation including technical assistance in the area of trade and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe the carrot of cooperation to be much more effective than the stick of clauses and conditionality in trade agreements. On several occasions this report mentions the need for in-depth knowledge of opportunities to do business with China. The Commission has taken the initiative and launched a tender for a study and a seminar on the future opportunities and challenges of EU-China trade and investment relations, also comprising ten sectoral analyses.</p>
<p class="contents">The result will be presented during a conference in 2006 and will be yet another important input for our way ahead. I also want to mention the prospects of negotiating a new framework agreement with China, reflecting the full breadth and depth of the strategic partnership between China and the European Union. This framework agreement will of course have an important and forward-looking agenda on the trade and investment side. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In its opinion, the Foreign Affairs Committee focused on the issue of the arms embargo as well as the enforcement of human rights in the People’s Republic of China.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to some EU Member States’ intention to lift the arms embargo with Beijing, the Foreign Affairs Committee noted that such political action would be inappropriate at this time, mainly for three reasons. First of all, there has not been a significant improvement in the enforcement of human rights in China.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the adoption of the anti-secession law in March 2005 by the Chinese Parliament leaves the door open to Chinese military intervention in Taiwan.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Foreign Affairs Committee would stress that lifting the arms embargo could seriously undermine regional stability in East Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">In its opinion, the Foreign Affairs Committee does not mince its words where the protection of human rights in China is concerned. It is deeply worried about the persistent violations of such basic rights as freedom of opinion, assembly and religion. Not for nothing does the committee see a direct connection with the continuing Council debate on a possible lifting of the arms embargo. In the unlikely event of the Council deciding in favour of lifting it, then this would certainly not prompt the Chinese authorities into taking respect for human rights seriously at long last.</p>
<p class="contents">What remains is considerable loss of face for the European Union internationally with regard to its own basic values. I hope, as draftsman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, that its position with regard to the Lucas report will strike a sympathetic chord with the European institutions and will be considered worth following. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">China joined the WTO in 2001. That means new rights, but also new obligations. China is already claiming all those rights, but is failing to fulfil its obligations in many respects. It is far from allowing foreign firms free access to its markets. Requiring them to work with Chinese firms is clearly against the spirit of the WTO. The effects are particularly harmful because intellectual property, patents and copyrights are not protected in China today.</p>
<p class="contents">Illegal copying of technical products, counterfeit textiles and utter disregard for intellectual property are intolerable. The Commission will have to give a much higher priority to this in future. The Commission will have to speak to the Chinese much more plainly about this than it has so far. Things cannot go on as they are. Please tell that to Commissioner Mandelson.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a lot of other things that need to be put right. The currency is still not allowed to float, China is not a democratic market economy, its public contracting is totally opaque, and the state looks on approvingly as protective duties are circumvented. Social issues are still not being addressed, workers have almost no co-determination rights, there is no freedom to form strong trade unions, environmental pollution is unconscionable. It is in these areas that China must make improvements, and that is what our resolution calls on it to do. Only if China does that will proper world trade will be possible.</p>
<p class="contents">There are things we need to do too, however. We must work hard to ensure that Europe remains a strong economy in the future. We need more commercial freedom and more commercial responsibility. We need more training and research and a greater willingness to face up to challenges. The fact is that if China is a problem today, it will certainly be a major challenge in the future too. China also, however, offers a great opportunity for creating new jobs in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have very little disagreement with the contents of the report; we have more problems with the content of her speech, which seemed not entirely to reflect the report as it stands.</p>
<p class="contents">I have had the opportunity to visit China recently, at the invitation of the Chinese Government, to look at developments in the country that represents a fifth of the world's population. While man does not live by bread alone, the year-on-year growth rates of 10%-plus have transformed China from the country I first knew more than 20 years ago. Even the so-called depressed north-east of the country has a skyline littered with cranes that shows a level of economic activity that would be impressive anywhere in the world. Across the country, 300 million Chinese have been pulled out of poverty, even if more than 100 million remain in the more remote rural areas living on less than EUR 1 per day.</p>
<p class="contents">China is succeeding in manufacturing, not by a race to the bottom, as the flourishing department stores of Harbin and Chengde prove. The result of this economic boom has transformed China into the world's fourth-largest exporter and, as we have seen in today's earlier debate, has made it extremely competitive in a number of industrial sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to take care when dealing with those issues. As a Member of this House back in the mid-80s, when Japan played out the role that China is playing today, I saw the wrong steps being taken. The initial voluntary quotas on exports to the United States bought from the Japanese by President Nixon in exchange for the return of Okinawa to Japanese rule, later extended to Europe, led to a situation where unmet demand allowed Japanese corporations to make super-profits which, reinvested, exacerbated the problems in the long term. Instead, we need to match China's exports to Europe with our own to China.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to recognise that economics is starting to transform Chinese society. To echo Mr Caspary, there are a whole series of human rights and other problems. We are particularly concerned in relation to this report at the restrictions of the rights of labour activists to organise free trade unions. We hope the Commission will pressure European business operating in China to set an example by giving their own workers full trade union rights.</p>
<p class="contents">There are environmental problems in China, of course, and these should be addressed. We should avoid the hypocrisy of asking China to refrain from doing what we are not prepared to do ourselves in Europe. We cannot expect China to voluntarily restrict its use of energy below levels that we see in the European Union. We have to move away from crisis management of economic and trade issues as we threaten to cascade from textiles, to footwear, to bicycles and an endless sequence of other products. We need to build a serious partnership with China on economic and trade matters. If we do not, others will.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need a serious political dialogue with China. We have much to say to each other. This report is not the place to raise these issues, but the decision by the Foreign Affairs Committee to draft a report on EU-China political relations is to be welcomed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When discussing the condition of textiles post 2005, Commission member Louis Michel expressed his view that the cause of the decline and potential collapse of the textile sector, and, evidently, other European industrial sectors, is the inability of countries to run their economies. They were unable to transfer their manufacturing to countries with cheap labour.</p>
<p class="contents">No one, however, has discussed what we can offer the citizens of our own countries where we were elected. Where will they work when we transfer all industry out of Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">In the Lucas report the consequences trade with China has on the economies of EU Member States are hardly even considered.</p>
<p class="contents">The report gives great attention to developing countries, which suffer from China's expansion into the world's textile markets.</p>
<p class="contents">A whole chapter of the report is even devoted to China's social problems, wage increases, welfare, while this is essentially a domestic affair. Bear in mind that not even the EU itself has a common social policy, every State takes care of its employees' salaries, which in the EU vary from State to State, and are very low in some <span class="bold">–</span> there are citizens living below the poverty level.</p>
<p class="contents">What should we do in the European Union to find an adequate response to the challenges posed by the global economy?</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Commission to assess the impact of the application of the WTO rules on EU Member States, particularly the new ones, to review foreign trade policy, and to take steps and preventative action to eliminate negative consequences on EU textile, footwear, furniture, electronics, automobile and other industries.</p>
<p class="contents">However, once the condition of EU industry has been analysed, the most important thing is to prepare a long-term forecast for 2030-2050, establishing areas where EU manufacturers could be competitive and giving industry recommendations about sectors of the future, which ought to be invested in now.</p>
<p class="contents">I also call on you to take care of our own people, because, it seems, we cannot expect someone else to create jobs for us, to boost economic competitiveness, and maintain social welfare. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the one hand, it is because of the different production conditions, and hence prices, that international trade exists, but, on the other hand, completely free trade between economies operating with very different labour costs, as in the case of China and the European Union, involves several elements that distort the rules regulating competition.</p>
<p class="contents">What must we say in these circumstances? Firstly, as consumers of Chinese products, we in the European Union have a greater responsibility, since we are China’s main trading partner, above even the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, China’s development and its opening up to the world is good news that we must celebrate. Thirdly, however, that that opening up must be conducted within a framework of respect for certain minimum and common rules, which guarantee clean and fair commercial relations, and also that the benefits of that opening up and trade should be enjoyed by the weakest parts of the production system, that is to say, the workers, while at the same time guaranteeing respect for international environmental rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The key is therefore not to promote free trade, but rather to promote fair trade. This means establishing new rules in the trade between countries, which includes quotas based not on price but on production conditions, the establishment of traceability rules in order to guarantee respect for those conditions and, above all, regulation of the practices of large multinational companies, which are increasingly mobile and often indulge in a ‘race to the bottom’, seeking to produce in places with the fewest social, employment and environmental requirements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She will have mine. If we look at how things have developed, we find that both the European Union and China have become each other’s second biggest trading partner. What has changed?</p>
<p class="contents">A few years ago, the trade surplus was still on the European Union’s side and now it is on the Chinese side. I am convinced it will remain that way for the next few decades. There are a number of unusual things about China. It has an enormous internal market; at the same time, it has a great capacity for labour-intensive production and it is able to take full advantage of that because it has very low wage levels. It also has high-tech production. Labour-intensive production is increasingly moving away from many Member States of the European Union even though we have a very high level of productivity, which is a reason why we actually could keep it. At the same time, if we look at the volume of trade we can see that European industry has benefited tremendously from exporting to China.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we have been discussing the situation as regards textiles. The European Union used to earn billions from the export of textile machinery. If you look at today’s export statistics, you can see how many steel works are exported, how many pressing tools for the motor industry, how many aluminium smelters for making bicycles. It is perfectly clear that we will have the same problem in these industries in two or three years’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft Constitutional Treaty spoke of an open market economy with free competition. What we now have in the European Union in textiles is a result of that. It is the result of an open, unprotected market economy with free competition. That is why a majority of the French rejected it.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we need a social market economy with fair competition. That is something different. If we are constantly saying that production in China is not up to European standards, that is correct. It would be extremely easy, however, to get a rule laid down in the WTO to the effect that countries that fail to comply with ILO standards cannot export or that their goods will not be imported. If anyone fails to comply properly with ILO occupational safety standards, his goods cannot be exported. Anyone who uses chemicals that are banned worldwide or in most countries is not allowed to export. Then we would immediately have a competition that was driving things upwards because producers would be forced to bring in better social, environmental and industrial standards.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that is the right way forward. Anyone who believes the European Union can survive in the long term simply by always making the sweeping statement that we must make more high-tech products is failing to recognise that China produces far more highly qualified college and university graduates every year than the entire European Union. That cannot be the way either. We must not delay in doing what we are always talking about. We must invest much more in education. If you look at the Member States’ budgets, however, you will see that they are not doing that either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Chinese economy has been growing by 9% a year for the last 25 years. Beijing’s currency reserves currently stand at USD 700 billion, whereas the Union’s are a mere USD 179 billion. The second greatest power in the world is not a democracy, nor does it have a market economy. Together with the ASEAN countries, China is hoping to create a free trade area by 2010, and this would be the largest economic block in the world. China is moving to expand its trade at global level. The Chinese take-over of the US giant IBM is an example of this movement, as is the current Chinese attempt to take over Rover in the UK.</p>
<p class="contents">As we try to establish what all this means for us, we should consider the situation in the USA, where many jobs have been lost due to the disadvantageous balance of trade with China. Whole branches of US industry have relocated in China, which has become the largest factory in the world. Textiles aside, China is already producing two-thirds of all electronic goods. At present, China is the Union’s second largest trading partner. In 2004 the Union had a trade deficit with China in excess of EUR 78 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfair competition is possible because China has a Socialist market economy, a type of primitive capitalism that disregards human rights. In the interests of the future of our economy, we should adjust our relations with China. The latter should be deemed a strategic competitor rather than a strategic partner. Strict import quotas on Chinese goods should also be introduced, so as to protect jobs in our countries.</p>

<p class="contents">Hence the need for monitoring through ongoing negotiations between the Commission and the Chinese authorities, in order to guarantee the principles of freedom and democracy: respect for these must be a prerequisite in the development of China’s trade relations with other economic areas. In addition the latest news from China concerning the oppressive controls imposed on use of the Internet must be studied carefully. The decision by the government in Beijing, which has announced new laws for controlling information on the Internet so as to prohibit any conceivable criticism of its policies towards religion and in general of its widespread intolerance towards religious preaching, must inevitably increase our concern.</p>
<p class="contents">In China the degree of freedom and democracy is in inverse proportion to the economic and commercial power that it imposes upon world markets.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore call on the Commission, in the framework of the ongoing negotiations with the Chinese authorities that it proposes to institute to ensure equitable, shared management of trade relations with the Chinese continent, to think over and take due account of all the aspects that are linked to respect for the rights and freedoms of individuals and, by extension, the workforce.</p>
<p class="contents">We call for standards to ensure that goods originating in China conform to the security guarantees applied in Europe and that there are sanctions to prevent any trade with or within the Union for several years by those who illegally import goods or import illegal goods into Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the right moment to say that damage to fair competition is sometimes inflicted by unscrupulous European entrepreneurs who, thinking solely of their own short-term profit, infringe a rule by promoting the unlawful importation and distribution in Europe of counterfeit or dangerous goods. They should be treated with the utmost severity.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore we invite the Commission and the Council to call upon Member States to institute stricter checks on their territories concerning the presence of numerous illegal immigrants who are forced to work in unlawful premises to produce low-cost goods. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is certainly true, though – and we have to face up to this – that our consumers benefit to some extent from the price cuts and that European companies see opportunities for growth in the Chinese market.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem, however, has not gone away. China is a Communist dictatorship with a state economy that is unfamiliar with the game of fair competition. More than half of China’s industry is owned by the state and receives interest-free funding without any real obligation to pay the loans back. The value of the Chinese currency remains artificially low.</p>
<p class="contents">That, as well as many other unreasonable factors – forced labour springs to mind, as do inhumane working conditions – result in our markets being flooded by Chinese finished products at prices for which our own companies can sometimes hardly buy the raw materials.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make it clear once again that whilst this is not an argument against the free market, or indeed, against free competition, Europe has the duty to protect its companies and to guarantee fair competition, and this has, unfortunately, recently fallen by the wayside. Given the way in which the Commission has mismanaged the textiles issue, we, in fact, fear the worst for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Chinese statistics show that the EU is China’s number one trading partner, ahead of the United States. I believe the mutual opening of markets should be an absolute priority for us. We cannot have a situation where we open our markets while our firms are faced with problems over there. I believe the future opportunities for growth on the Chinese market are of the utmost importance for our manufacturing industry in particular and that much of the plant that has been supplied there came from Europe. European firms must of course also position themselves on that market in good time in order to safeguard jobs here at home.</p>
<p class="contents">Imports to Europe also increase our purchasing power. Many of our families save hundreds of euros a month because they can buy goods of very acceptable quality at a very reasonable price. The money they save can then be spent on other services or products, so the Chinese are actually increasing our purchasing power disproportionately.</p>
<p class="contents">It has already been mentioned that intellectual property is a tremendous problem and that our European firms need more protection. The Commission needs to enforce patent and trade mark rights. I call on it to use its influence, especially in the talks in Hong Kong and in the TRIPS too, to ensure that these international obligations are scrupulously observed. I believe this will strengthen our relations in future. I believe a communist country is on the way to becoming a market economy, which will also underpin democracy and human rights. We all ought to give this our backing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have to accept at times that jobs will disappear to developing economies. We have to show solidarity with fellow workers throughout the world, for they too are entitled to employment and growing prosperity, but the European social model means that we must offer people who lose their jobs here sufficient scope and assistance in finding new employment, as well as training and retraining. They should not be the victims of these rapid developments.</p>
<p class="contents">The European clothes shops and importers whose orders were stuck in warehouses for ages as a result of the temporary import ban also deserve compensation for their financial losses. Meanwhile, the European Union can, and indeed must, exploit the opportunities which prosperous economic growth in other parts of the world creates for us. These opportunities include new consumer markets and good prospects for the tourism industry, including for the less educated. European companies are entitled to have their intellectual property protected in law but certainly also in practice, and are also entitled to access to the Chinese markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather than putting protectionist measures in place to protect these jobs, the EU must promote the interests of its companies by reminding China of its WTO commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, the EU must come out of its shell and stand up for the standards and values we hold dear, including fair trade, trade union freedom and workers’ rights. Working conditions in China are abysmal; workers are not free to set up trade unions. Trade union activists are rounded up and locked up for years. Tens of thousands of fatal industrial accidents occur every year; they are no exception on the Chinese shop floor. Workers are forced to work many hours’ overtime and child labour is also not uncommon. As one of China’s largest trading partners, the European Union must take responsibility for putting these abuses on the agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner Mandelson admitted that this problem was taken off the agenda at the beginning of the latest EU/China trade talks in response to pressure from China. That is surprising, given that the European Union, in accordance with the WTO rules, is entitled to issue protectionist measures in the event of unfair competition or distortion of competition. That is clearly the case with regard to respect for intellectual property. Every year, increasing levels of counterfeiting and piracy cause the loss of between one and two hundred thousand jobs in Europe. One morning this summer, during a one-hour raid on the Belgian coast, more than 2 500 counterfeit pieces of clothing were seized, 70% of them originating from China.</p>
<p class="contents">Our creativity and innovation is just about the last asset we have in the unequal struggle against competition from the East.

At the same time, it is also important, however, to draw attention to the abominable conditions in the social and environmental spheres. Emphatically, something must be done about these. I hope that most of us can agree that it is not only the EU that has a big responsibility but that action should be taken within the system of international agreements. It is, then, the WTO and the rule of law principle that should govern development and not arbitrary quota arrangements, which too easily bind the poor countries into relations with their old colonial powers that are reminiscent of slavery. If we are to make our presence felt in the WTO, we need to be trustworthy, but people are only trustworthy if they are worth trusting. It is somewhat incriminating, moreover, that we only remember about all these rules when it is what we ourselves produce that is to be protected. If these rules really were to apply, we could not import a drop of oil from Saudi Arabia, which does not of course have even the first clue about human rights. However, there is never any talk about, for example, human rights and the environment to be heard in relation to Saudi Arabia. We need to strengthen our position within the WTO by opening up our markets rather than by coercing the poor countries. The rich countries need to have open markets, and we need to make demands: demands in terms of the ILO and demands that the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the other environmental conventions be observed. That is absolutely the only way that is practicable, and it is also the way that, in all conscience, we must keep to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Tendencies of recent years give us grave concern and do not bode well for the future. The trade deficit has been growing at a catastrophic rate, as has the assortment of goods from China, not to mention the transfer of manufacturing and the closure of companies in the European Union itself. And international companies play a large part in this. If we fail to establish the right mechanisms to control these processes, the consequences will be tragic.</p>
<p class="contents">Companies in all European Union states, including Lithuania, suffer from unfair competition from Chinese companies. Our business communities are forced to adhere to high EU labour, social insurance and environmental standards, and must compete with Chinese manufacturers, who do none of this. On the contrary, in fact – workers toil under horrendous conditions and are practically unpaid.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must ensure that compulsory adherence to labour, work safety, social insurance and environmental standards is set forth in international treaties. In addition intellectual property protection regulations and the certification of quality and origin must be tightened and the procedure for bringing anti-dumping cases to court must be simplified.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission must ensure that companies are only allowed to import goods into the EU when the European Commission confirms the companies' adherence to such standards. In fact, this is exactly what Russia does when allowing goods from the European Union to be imported into its territory. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, I want to deal with another issue. Trade cannot be viewed in isolation. It is not immune from ethical and moral considerations. China needs our trade. The price attached can properly be more than financial. We cannot ignore the widespread abuse of human rights in China, particularly with regard to a harmless but tiny minority – namely practicing Christians. It is wholly unacceptable to have Chinese Christians in prison for merely expressing their Christian beliefs or distributing copies of the Bible.</p>
<p class="contents">Freedom of worship is a fundamental right recognised by most of us in Europe. Its denial in China is not something we can ignore to facilitate trade with a state that persecutes Christian people, whatever the mutual economic benefits might be.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call for a linkage between ongoing EU-China bilateral dialogue on human rights and the negotiations on trade. We should make progress on trade conditional on progress in securing and improving human rights. Liberalisation of trade requires liberalisation of human rights in China.</p>

I propose that, while the rest of the debate takes place this afternoon, the actual vote be postponed until the Brussels part-session in two weeks' time. This is an important report and there should be a full House here to vote on it, not just the 40 or 50 Members who might still be here at 5 p.m. I am afraid that I myself will not be here at 5 p.m., as I have another engagement this evening. The change to the agenda that shifted my report from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. this morning was made only very recently. That is what caused this problem. I formally move that we postpone the vote until the Brussels part-session in two weeks' time.</p>
