<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not presented orally during Questions to the Council at the November part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>There was a high turnout for the Turkish parliamentary elections. The composition of the new Parliament is more representative of the Turkish population than the previous one and Prime Minister Erdogan’s government has an absolute majority. As the honourable Member states, the government has now had its legitimacy renewed and has a clear mandate, which will allow it to press on resolutely with the reform process.</p>
<p>The European Union has taken – and will continue to take – every opportunity, in particular within the framework of the different political dialogue meetings, to draw the Turkey’s attention to the EU’s expectations that the new government will give reforms a new impetus after the slowdown witnessed over the last year and in the run up to the elections. In that context we would draw attention to the parliamentary majority’s intention to draft a new Constitution – a process that we shall follow closely.</p>
<p>Progress in the reform process, both in terms of adopting new legislation and implementing it, is essential for accession negotiations to move forward and the Union remains ready to help Turkey along that path. Much work lies ahead, especially regarding political criteria. We have pointed out the need for significant progress in areas such as freedom of speech, religious freedom and civil-military relations. Obviously, we view the situation in the southeast of the country with great concern; we roundly condemn all acts of terrorism and we underscore the need for continuing respect for the primacy of law and maintaining regional stability.</p>
<p>In addition, we continue to encourage Turkey to move forward in normalising relations with the Republic of Cyprus and we call for full implementation of the Additional Protocol to the Ankara Agreement, as mentioned in the EU Declaration of 21 September 2005 in conjunction with the Council conclusions of 11 December 2006. We also urge Turkey to step up its efforts to ensure it fully and unequivocally meets its commitment to maintaining good-neighbourly relations and its commitment to solving any outstanding border disputes in accordance with the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes pursuant to the United Nations Charter, including, if necessary, the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice.</p>
<p>Economically, we hope that Turkey will continue on the path of sustainable economic growth whilst simultaneously implementing the structural reform programme.</p>
<p>Summing up, I should like to point out that the Union has drafted a pre-accession strategy providing Turkey with the framework to prepare for accession. The Association Agreement is an important instrument for cooperation between both parties. The Accession Partnership, which is soon to be reviewed, sets priorities for subsequent work and also serves as a reference for tailoring EU assistance to the applicant country’s specific needs. As regards financial assistance, under the new IPA financial instrument, the average annual allocations for Turkey will increase from EUR 497 million in 2007 to EUR 653 million in 2010.</p>
<p>Furthermore, accession negotiations themselves are the most valuable and powerful instrument for generating reform.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0795"></a>

<p>As the honourable Member quite rightly pointed out, the Council, at its 1 October 2007 meeting, reached a political agreement on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 97/67/EC concerning the full accomplishment of the internal market of Community postal services, which is due to be approved through co-decision and thus with Parliament’s full participation.</p>
<p>One of the key features of the agreement is the final deadline of 31 December 2010 for implementation of the amending directive. In this respect, certain Member States (listed in the new Article 3) may be able to extend this deadline to 31 December 2012 at the latest, with the proviso that they notify the Commission beforehand. Further points include clarification and important adjustments that have been made to the relevant definitions, as well as the safeguarding of the universal service, including funding for that service and the authorisation system.</p>
<p>Additionally, the agreement takes account of amendments to the Commission proposal by including a considerable number of amendments suggested in the European Parliament’s opinion in first reading.</p>
<p>Jurist/linguists are putting the final touches to the text of that agreement so that the Council is able to adopt a common position at a forthcoming meeting.</p>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not presented orally during Questions to the Council at the November part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The question raised by the honourable Member is an interesting one and mirrors one aspect of the broader subject of ‘repatriation of corpses between States’ currently governed by the Strasbourg Convention of 1973, which only some of the Member States have signed and which sets strict rules governing the transfer of corpses. This topic was dealt with in the Commission’s Green Paper on consular protection of European Union citizens, but only in terms of transferring corpses from States outside the European Union.</p>
<p>The question of repatriation of corpses is the responsibility the Member States, which vary in their positions on this issue. Most, if not all, do not have any obligation, or legal possibility for repatriating the corpses of their citizens. The Presidency therefore thinks it is unlikely that a decision will be taken on these matters in the short to medium term, namely in terms of setting up a fund to cover costs which most Member States at least regard as the responsibility of private individuals.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0799"></a>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding the Council or the Member States, was not presented orally during Questions to the Council at the November part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council is placing the emphasis on preventing CVD (cardiovascular disease) by dealing with specific health questions affecting the incidence of CVD.</p>
<p>– Nutrition and physical activity: in 2005 the Council approved Conclusions on promotion of healthy lifestyles and prevention of type 2 diabetes and also approved Conclusions on Health promotion by means of nutrition and physical activity at its meeting of 31 May 2007. It is currently drafting a new set of conclusions on the application of the EU strategy on nutrition, overweight and obesity-related health issues. The High Level Group set up to implement the strategy will discuss cutting the amount of salt in food products as a matter of priority, since salt is a key determining factor in CDV.</p>
<p>– Smoking: an exchange of opinions took place at the Council meeting of 31 May 2007 on strategic options for a ‘Smoke-free Europe’ policy. Reducing active and passive smoking may result in major progress as far as cardiovascular health is concerned.</p>
<p>– Alcohol: in November 2006, the Council approved its Conclusions on the EU strategy to reduce alcohol-related harm. Excessive alcohol consumption and the harmful effects which it causes are one of the main priorities of the German, Portuguese and Slovene Presidencies’ programme.</p>
<p>It is also worth mentioning the European Heart Health Charter, which was drawn up by the European Heart Network and the European Society of Cardiology, with the support of the European Commission and the WHO, and which aims to reduce the impact of cardiovascular disease in the EU and the WHO European Region, as well as decreasing disparities between countries in this area.</p>
<p>Those actions are helping to reduce the main risk factors for contracting CDV set out in the European Parliament’s Resolution of July 2007 and they highlight the importance of prevention through a healthy lifestyle.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0803"></a>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not presented orally during Questions to the Council at the November part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Responsibility for negotiating Economic Partnership Agreements on behalf of the EU lies with the Commission, based on the Guidelines approved by the Council in June 2002. Negotiations are normally conducted at regional level. At the level of all the ACP countries, the ACP-EC Council of Ministers is responsible for approving the political guidelines and for taking the necessary decisions to implement the provisions of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement, (Article 15 (2) (b)), including those related to the EPAs. In this context, the ACP-EC Council of Ministers of 25 May 2007 endorsed a review of the EPA negotiations, as required by Article 37 (4) of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement.</p>
<p>The ACP–EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly is not a formal negotiation forum for the EPAs, instead it plays a broader and extremely important role in the Cotonou system. Under the provisions of Article 17 (2) of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement, its role, as a consultative body, is namely to promote democratic processes through dialogue and consultation and to discuss issues pertaining to development and the ACP-EU Partnership.</p>
<p>The Council of the EU is strongly committed to providing political guidelines on behalf of the EU to the EPA-related process. The Council therefore approved Conclusions in April 2006 and May 2007 underscoring its commitment to the EPAs as development instruments which help to eradicate poverty in ACP States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0806"></a>

<p>As the honourable Member rightly points out, the European Union is a global economic leader in various aspects, in terms of the trade of goods and services, and in the area of internal and external investment. I cannot, however, agree with the honourable Member’s assessment of economic growth and domestic demand in the Union: if the available European Commission forecasts are proved correct, GDP will rise above potential both in 2007 and 2008 and domestic demand will increase even more this year (and will be above that of the United States).</p>
<p>If truth be told, the European Union takes its responsibilities very seriously in terms of solving imbalances in the world economy and hopes that the same is true of its world partners. The EU has been pushing through the economic reforms laid down in the Lisbon Agenda for seven years to try to solve a large number of questions related to both economic demand and the general programme for competitiveness in the global economy. The successful reforms that the Member States have introduced in the context of the Lisbon Agenda are now yielding results and the EU economy is at present in a stronger position to deal with the current period of global economic uncertainty. However, we are not complacent: our structural reform efforts must and will continue, in accordance with the Lisbon Agenda priorities.</p>
<p>As far as the specific question of the euro exchange rate is concerned, I can inform the honourable Member that the Council has not discussed trends in exchange rates as regards the euro or the currencies of Member States not using the euro as their national currency.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I can inform you that Eurogroup approved and decided to release a statement on exchange rate issues at its meeting on 8 October, reiterating that the ‘Euro area is playing its role for an orderly reduction of the imbalances by implementing structural reforms and contributing to a rebalancing of growth.’</p>
<p>The economic situation and exchange rate developments were also discussed at the G7 Finance Ministers meeting held in Washington on 19 October. The G7 Finance Ministers’ statement included the following paragraph: ‘We affirm that exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals. Excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth. We continue to monitor exchange markets closely, and cooperate as appropriate. We welcome China's decision to increase the flexibility of its currency, but in view of its rising current account surplus and domestic inflation, we stress its need to allow an accelerated appreciation of its effective exchange rate.’</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0811"></a>

<p>We are following the situation very carefully and are in close contact with the Turkish authorities. The Presidency strongly condemned the recent terrorist acts in southeastern Turkey and thus expressed our solidarity with the Turkish people. The international community and all the main stakeholders in the region in particular must support Turkey’s efforts to protect its population and combat terrorism, whilst at the same time respecting human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, maintaining international and regional peace and stability and refraining from taking any disproportionate military action. It is also worth mentioning that the Presidency took part in the Ministerial Conference of the Neighbouring Countries of Iraq, which took place in Istanbul on 2-3 November, where participants voiced their appreciation of the efforts undertaken by the Iraqi government to combat terrorism, including efforts to prevent Iraq from being used as a base for terrorist attacks on its neighbouring countries and recalled the bilateral agreements signed between Iraq and its neighbouring countries with respect to combating terrorism. Reinforcing dialogue and cooperation between the Turkish and Iraqi governments is of the utmost importance in trying to solve this problem.</p>

<p>The Portuguese Presidency has taken the view that fiscal policy needs to make a greater contribution towards improving environmental sustainability. The Presidency is therefore launching a debate on all the initiatives which might promote the efforts undertaken to fight climate change and reach the EU’s objectives for the overall reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, in the realisation that fiscal measures can have a positive impact on pollution and consumer behaviour.</p>
<p>With this backdrop in mind, the Portuguese Presidency has intensified discussion of the proposal for a Directive on passenger car related taxes [<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2005&amp;nu_doc=0261">COM(2005)0261</a>] in the Working Party on Tax Questions and has presented a compromise text that gives Member States more flexibility, namely in choosing the environmental performance criteria to be used as a basis for tax differentiation (grams of CO2 per kilometre, fuel consumption or other aspects that may help cut emissions). The Portuguese Presidency instigated a general discussion on this topic in the Council (ECOFIN) on 13 November, the goal being to adopt the proposal for a directive by the end of its mandate, if possible.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0823"></a>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not presented orally during Questions to the Council at the November part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Once the definitive results from the elections in Sierra Leone were announced on 17 September, the Presidency, on behalf of the EU, congratulated the new President, Ernest Bai Koroma. The Council is looking forward to an improved political dialogue with the new government.</p>
<p>The people of Sierra Leone have shown a laudable strong commitment to democracy throughout the entire electoral process. Sierra Leone’s fundamental institutions and the NEC (National Electoral Commission) in particular, played an important role in the success of the electoral process.</p>
<p>EU aid to Sierra Leone is essentially channelled through the European Development Fund (EDF). The amount allocated to Sierra Leone under the 10<span class="sup">th</span> EDF for programmable aid is EUR 242 million (as opposed to EUR 220 million under the 9<span class="sup">th</span> EDF), plus EUR 26.4 million in non-programmable aid (unforeseen situations). This amount may be reviewed under the mid-term review, based chiefly on the results which the country achieves as compared with the commitments undertaken by its leaders. This new feature of EU cooperation under the EDF will actually make it possible to provide appropriate support to those countries most committed to reforming their governance. We hope that the new leaders of Sierra Leone will help to give a new boost to the country’s development so that they can receive more support.</p>
<p>The EU and several of its Member States also generously support the Special Court for Sierra Leone. Heeding the recent calls of the Special Court on the need to cover its funding for 2008, the Council’s preparatory bodies recently discussed additional support that could be given resulting in new commitments for the 2008 budget.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0827"></a>

<p>The EU has decided to send out a clear signal to the international community on its determination to fight climate change and its commitment to starting negotiations on a global post-Kyoto agreement for the post 2012 period.</p>
<p>Climate change has systematically featured on the EU’s diplomatic agenda and last year it played a prominent role at various summits and meetings between the EU and third countries, including the USA.</p>
<p>The most recent EU-USA summit on 30 April 2007 approved a joint statement on energy security and climate change which underlines our mutual interest in ensuring secure, affordable, and clean supplies of energy and tackling climate change with the ultimate objective being to stabilise concentrations of greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>The EU and the USA held a High Level Dialogue on Climate Change, Clean Energy, and Sustainable Development in Helsinki on 24 and 25 October 2006 on using existing initiatives as a basis for progressing with the Gleneagles G8 Action Plan. The third ministerial meeting of the Gleneagles Dialogue on Climate Change, Clean Energy, and Sustainable Development took place in Berlin on 9-11 September 2007 and was attended by representatives from 20 countries with high energy needs, including the USA, to discuss innovative ideas so as to develop an integrated energy and climate change policy outlook.</p>
<p>The G8 process begun at Gleneagles yielded an important result in Heiligendamm this year: recognition by all G8 parties that the UN climate process is the appropriate body for negotiating global action on climate change. Also in the scope of the G8, it is worth mentioning the Special Meeting of Sherpas (technical advisors) on Climate Change (Berlin, 16 October 2007).</p>
<p>Another event which also offered an opportunity to move forward work in the area of cooperation in bilateral EU-USA meetings was the High Level Event on Climate Change hosted by the United Nations’ Secretary General (New York, 24 September 2007).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0829"></a>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not presented orally during Questions to the Council at the November part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The 7th RDT Framework Programme is anchored on the premise that regions are among the most important stakeholders in innovation and research policy.</p>
<p>Under the ‘Capacities’ Specific Programme, EUR 126 million is allocated specifically to the ‘Regions of Knowledge’ initiative, in addition to a further EUR 340 million earmarked for the ‘Research Potential’ initiative, which is specifically geared around the European Union’s convergence and outermost regions.</p>
<p>In theory, the aforementioned initiatives (which are targeted on the regions) are due to run throughout the entire Framework Programme. A mid-term review is planned for the 7<span class="sup">th</span> FP, which will be carried out during the programme. This might possibly then have some impact on certain aspects of the programme. Nevertheless, it is most likely that the initiatives aimed more specifically at the regions will continue.</p>
<p>Of further note are the ‘ERANet’ projects under the ‘Cooperation’ Specific Programme, which are worth mentioning with regard to the regional dimension, given that one of the priorities of the corresponding mechanism consists of supporting the creation of networks between regional (and national) public S&amp;T programmes.</p>
<p>Therefore, Europe’s regions in general (and the outermost regions in particular) should have the benefit of funding initiatives under the Seventh Research and Technological Development Framework Programme until 2013.</p>
<p>Moreover, it will probably be possible to achieve greater synergy between the RTD Framework Programme and Structural Fund-related programmes for European regions, chiefly by allowing the regional bodies to take part in the FP and making it possible forthe European regions to develop at local level the results obtained by participating in projects covered by the Programme.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0832"></a>

<p>Yang Chunlin, a Chinese activist campaigning for land rights, has been tortured in a Chinese prison. According to his sister, Yan Chunping, the activist spent days at the prison chained up in the same position and was forced to clear up other prisoners' excrement. The reason for his arrest was a petition which he had organised against the Olympic Games. He collected more than 10 000 signatures, mainly from expropriated farmers, under the slogan, 'We don't want the Olympic Games, we want human rights'. Illegal expropriation of land is commonplace in China. One and a half million people are said to have been forced to leave their homes to make way for the new sports complexes.</p>
<p>For a long time it was thought that holding the Olympic Games in China would have a positive effect, because the event would present an opportunity to expose China more to external influences. Now, however, it is felt that a boycott of the Olympic Games is the only remaining instrument available to Europe to bring pressure to bear on China. Is the Council considering boycotting the Games in order to make it clear to China that serious violations of human rights are unacceptable?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or on the Member States, was not presented orally during Questions to the Council at the November part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>In accordance with the EU guidelines on human rights defenders, the EU Heads of Mission in Beijing are following the situation of human rights defenders closely, including that of Yang Chunlin, and the Council regularly raises individual disturbing cases with the Chinese authorities through different channels.</p>
<p>The Chinese authorities were also given a list of individual cases before the last talks held in Beijing on 17 October. At that meeting, the EU voiced its concern at the harassment and ongoing imprisonment inflicted on human rights defenders. The EU regretted the increasing surveillance and control of the media, including via the Internet, and defended freedom of expression. It also raised the question of torture. As has happened in previous dialogues, the EU called on China to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which China signed nine years ago and which enshrines and protects citizens’ rights and offers them protection against abuse.</p>
<p>In its human rights dialogue with China, the EU regularly raises many of the claims set out in the open letter entitled: ‘Human rights wanted, not Olympic Games’ which formed the subject of Yang Chunlin’s campaign. During the last round of talks, the items broached included the following questions: giving national journalists the same access and independence as foreign journalists, protecting Chinese workers’ rights on construction sites and ending discrimination against migrant workers. The Council is also concerned with the removal and forced relocation of people due to urban development whether or not in relation to the Olympic Games.</p>
<p>To sum up, the Council agrees with the honourable Member that the human rights situation in China continues to give cause for concern. However, some modest progress has been seen in some areas, for example the reduction in the number of executions following the reviewing of death sentences by the Supreme People’s Court, fewer restrictions on the foreign media since 1 January 2007 and promulgation of the new labour contract law.</p>
<p>The Council therefore believes that it is worthwhile continuing the dialogue with China on these subjects, even if the results are not always quantifiable after each round of talks and do in fact move only gradually.</p>
<p>As regards human rights and the Olympic Games, China has undertaken a series of commitments in this area as part of its bid to host the Olympics in 2008. The Council will thus monitor the situation closely and raise any questions that cause concern. As for the possibility of boycotting the games, it is not up to the Council of the EU to take a decision (as this is a question for each IOC Member State to decide).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0836"></a>

<p>The Reform Treaty was adopted at the European Council meeting of 18-19 October, and it is to be signed on 13 December in Lisbon. The agreement that was reached will make it possible to put an end to six years of discussions on institutional reform and to concentrate on tackling the EU’s main tasks. As the experience with the EU Constitutional Treaty showed, however, the Reform Treaty still has to negotiate a difficult passage before it is ratified in the 27 Member States. According to sociological research, about 60% of the Constitutional Treaty’s opponents in France gave as one of their reasons that the text of the Treaty was very complicated and difficult to understand. In comparison with the Reform Treaty, the Constitutional Treaty was significantly shorter and easy to understand. This gives rise to doubts as to whether the Member States will be able sufficiently to explain the content and meaning of the new Treaty to their citizens.</p>

<p>The Commission recently presented its proposals on a future ‘integrated maritime policy’ at EU level.

<p>The Council looks forward to hearing any proposals on future maritime policy which the Commission might like to table under its right of initiative, and will analyse them in accordance with the relevant procedures and with full respect for Community rules.

Following the refusal of the party leadership to comply with the order to cancel the congress, the President of the Court indicated the party chairman Gyula Thurmer and six members of the executive for contempt with the possibility of a two-year prison sentence.

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or on the Member States, was not presented orally during Questions to the Council at the November part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The question of normalising bilateral relations between Turkey and the Republic of Cyprus is being followed closely and dealt with at the appropriate levels. Ratification and subsequent implementation of the Adaptation Protocol of the Ankara Agreement on the accession of the ten new Member States of the EU is an obligation which Turkey has undertaken but has still not fulfilled. Much attention has been given to that question, for instance at the meeting of the EU-Turkey Political Directors’ Troika held in Lisbon on 18 September. The question will also be dealt with at the next meeting of the Ministerial EU-Turkey meeting, which is being held in Brussels on 20 November. Moreover, the Council regularly asks Turkey to change its policy with regard to the Republic of Cyprus’ participation in international organisations and forums.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Council will analyse the situation on the basis of the progress report published by the Commission on 6 November. Pursuant to the Council conclusions of 11 December 2006, the Council will analyse the questions covered by the EU Declaration of 21 September 2005. Full implementation of the Protocol is also a short-term priority under the Accession Partnership, which will be reviewed over the course of this year. Turkey’s fulfilment of its obligations to the EU and the Accession Partnership priorities will affect the negotiating process.</p>
<p>As regards the situation in Cyprus, the Union is still committed to contributing towards a resolution of the Cyprus problem in the scope of the UN that is inclusive, viable and compatible with the principles upon which the EU is founded. In this regard, we support the rapid implementation of the agreement reached on 8 July 2006 under the aegis of the UN and we are still eagerly awaiting the start of the technical committees and expert groups’ work on the in-depth issues.</p>
<p>I can assure the honourable Member that the Presidency and the Union will continue to support the efforts made in this regard.</p>
<p>Let me also state that the Union is still committed to contributing towards a resolution of the Cyprus problem in the scope of the UN that is inclusive, viable and compatible with the principles upon which the EU is founded.

<p>The EU considers this question first and foremost as coming under the scope of bilateral relations between the USA and Cuba. Nevertheless, as was the case last year, the EU voted in favour of Resolution 61 of the United Nations’ General Assembly on the need to end the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed on Cuba by the USA. The Council adopted Regulation (EC) 2271 protecting against the effects of the extra-territorial application of legislation adopted by a third country and actions based thereon or resulting therefrom and joint action based on Articles J.3 and K.3 of the TEU on measures protecting against the effects of the extra-territorial application of legislation adopted by a third country and actions based thereon or resulting therefrom. The EU continues to call for the Helms-Burton legislation to be repealed.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Council conclusions on EU policy vis-à-vis Cuba, of 18 June 2007, state that: ‘the EU recognizes the right of the Cuban citizens to decide independently about their future and remains ready to contribute positively to the future development of all sectors of Cuban society, including through development cooperation instruments.’</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0828"></a>

<p>The Commission is contributing to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) of universal primary education, this through a mix of instruments. This is clearly upheld by the MDG focus of the European Consensus and the Africa Strategy.</p>
<p>In its bilateral cooperation, the European Commission currently supports developing countries' efforts in the field of education through over 400 bilateral and regional ongoing projects in almost 100 countries. In 2006, the EC allocated €517 million for the education component of its development policy and external assistance: 43% to basic education, 15% to secondary education, 24% to post secondary, and 18% specifically to institutional support.</p>
<p>In addition to support through projects, the Commission provides general budget support to 28 countries from the 9th European Development Fund. This instrument is important because it helps to pay for salaries and other running costs covered by the budgets of the governments of those countries. About 30% of the funds going to these 28 countries is planned to be provided in this way. The Commission gives crucial support to education through this instrument, which provides a strong financial incentive to implement sound policies in the social sectors since part of the disbursement of general budget support is linked to indicators that contribute to the achievements of the MDG.</p>
<p>In line with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and Harmonisation, the Commission intends to increase the share of its programmable bilateral development aid channelled through budget support –be it sector or general one– to 50% if possible.</p>
<p>A purely accounting approach to development aid based on sector allocations is not really complete. For example in Rwanda budget support is delivered by a coordinated group of donors engaged in a permanent sector dialogue with the authorities. The results are visible as public spending has successfully been reallocated to social sectors (while reducing military expenses). Between 1998 and 2004 social spending grew from 2.5% of Gross Domestic Product to 7.5%. Specific operations allowed school fees to be eliminated, with a corresponding upsurge in the primary enrolment ratio which rose to 93%.</p>
<p>As for the new programming cycle, an estimated €1.8 billion is programmed for education from the EC budget and the 10<span class="sup">th</span> European Development Fund (all regions). The Commission is improving the ways to link funding commitments to MDG progress. The MDG Contract is an enhanced form of General Budget Support with outcome indicators linked to education and other MDG relevant sectors. The aim is to have a longer term predictability where the support to education will not be undermined by the “stop and go” dynamics which have often characterised the disbursement of budget support.</p>
<p>Finally, the thematic programme "Investing in People" will also provide additional assistance to developing countries in cases where regular channels of financial support are not sufficient. Such additional support will be used to accelerate progress towards the core Education for All goal of Universal Primary School Completion (UPC) through a financial contribution to the Fast Track Initiative (FTI).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0845"></a>

<p>A number of reports have recently been coming in from NGOs operating in Myanmar concerning widespread poverty and warning that the situation is likely to get worse in view of the increase in oil prices, the lack of welfare services and public spending curbs in the health and education sectors. They also consider international aid programmes to be too limited and inadequate to the task. The meeting of the Council of Ministers for General Affairs and External Relations of 15 and 16 October 2007 concluded that a substantial programme of humanitarian aid for Myanmar was necessary and announced that the EU was ready to step up aid subject to an assessment of the humanitarian situation.</p>
<p>What is the level of European presence in the country and what action is it taking in cooperation with the populace, local organisations and international bodies? Has the Commission been given an appraisal of the current humanitarian situation and the possible impact of an international embargo? Does it intend to take further measures and initiatives on the humanitarian and diplomatic fronts?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission shares the concern of humanitarian organisations about the general vulnerability of the Burmese population, which has only deteriorated over the last few years. In view of this development, the Commission has responded by constantly increasing its humanitarian aid in the last few years. In 1997, less than EUR 4 million per year was dedicated to the Burmese crisis – this covered not only aid for the populations living inside the country but also aid for Burmese refugees housed in camps in neighbouring countries. In 2007, the programmes under way reached EUR 15.5 million.</p>
<p>The sectors for priority action in Burma are protection, basic healthcare, water and sanitation, food aid and nutrition for pregnant and breastfeeding women and children. In the refugee camps in Thailand – there are approximately 150 000 of these – the Commission’s support covers basic needs: food, healthcare, and access to drinking water and sanitation. These actions are implemented by the agencies of the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and partner non-governmental organisations (NGOs).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission can inform the honourable Member that further support of EUR 1 million for the World Food Programme (WFP) has just been approved, and that its services are currently preparing a new programme worth EUR 18 million covering the end of 2007 and the whole of 2008, to meet the need for protection, basic healthcare, water and sanitation of the most vulnerable Burmese populations, particularly ethnic minorities, and the needs of Burmese refugees in Thailand.</p>
<p>This humanitarian aid will be supplemented by the budget line on aid for uprooted people, providing EUR 16 million for the period 2007 to 2010 for Myanmar and Thailand, and from 2008 by the new Food Security Thematic Programme, which has been given EUR 16 million for Myanmar alone.</p>
<p>In addition to humanitarian aid in the strict sense, the Commission has also developed programmes to fight poverty. For the first time in 2007, a multiannual indicative programme (2007-2010) has been adopted for the benefit of the people of Burma. This programme is worth EUR 32 million and will be used to support the activities of the Three Disease Fund, which aims to fight the ravages of tuberculosis, malaria and HIV/AIDS<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> in Myanmar. The other sector of intervention of the programme will be basic education, through UNICEF’s Education For All programme<a href="#defann_29_2" name="refann_29_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, on several occasions the Commission has expressed its concern, both publicly and through discreet diplomacy, about the reduction of the humanitarian space in Myanmar – such as the ICRC’s difficulty with fulfilling its mandate in Myanmar, especially with visiting those in detention and visiting conflict areas in the east. The restrictions on work and conditions of access for humanitarian aid workers in Myanmar are also a major obstacle to increasing the aid programmes.</p>
<p>The Commission can assure the honourable Member that it will persist with its efforts at persuasion of the Burmese authorities and will continue its humanitarian aid.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In 2001 at the African Summit on HIV/AIDS<a href="#defann_30_1" name="refann_30_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, Tuberculosis and Other Related Infectious Diseases in Abuja, Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity pledged indeed to set a target of allocating at least 15% of their annual budget to the improvement of the health sector.</p>
<p>In his question the Honourable Member suggests that six years later, the vast majority of countries are investing a far smaller percentage of their budgets on health. However, the picture is not quite as black. The World Health Organisation Regional Committee for Africa reported in August 2007 that half of the countries of the region are now allocating between 10% and 15% of their national budget to health. Furthermore, ten countries of the Region have been able to raise their health spending to between 30 and 40 US dollars per capita.</p>
<p>The Commission supported the original Abuja Declaration and has continued to engage African governments – ministries of finance and health - through policy dialogue on various development issue including health and health expenditure. The Commission continues to pursue this dialogue but the decision about resource allocations must be made by the partner countries and cannot be made in Brussels.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago (24-26 October 2007) the Commission was involved in the first African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States' Health Ministers' Meeting that took place in Brussels and where over 40 ministers of health discussed the challenges of ACP progress towards the health Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The issues of financing and management of health systems have been key areas of concern and discussion. The declaration from this meeting has recommitted once again to progress on the Abuja Declaration.</p>
<p>The policy dialogue with partner countries in Africa is underpinned by the work on aid effectiveness and aid predictability. The Commission has been the driving force behind the adoption of EU's new development policy, which reflects European ambition to make a decisive contribution to the achievement of MDGs through delivery of better coordinated Official Development Assistance in a less volatile and unpredictable manner.</p>
<p>Performance based budget support, which strengthens the overall ability of partner countries to develop and execute their development plans, is an important step in this respect. Under the 9<span class="sup">th</span> European Development Fund (EDF) two thirds of the countries which received budget support had performance targets linked to health sector financing improvements. Under the 10<span class="sup">th</span> EDF, some 40% of programmable aid, at national level, will be through budget support, part of which will be linked to outcomes and budgetary performance in health sector.</p>
<p>But even budget support, does not always allow for substantial fiscal space that countries need to have to finance high recurrent costs in health. Unless the Commission provides long-term, predictable and coordinated support, it will not be able to give partner countries sufficient opportunity to strengthen their health systems, ensure predictable numbers of health workers and deliver health programmes that are key for the achievement of health MDGs.</p>
<p>This is the reason why under the 10<span class="sup">th</span> EDF a new modality of budget support – the MDG Contract – will also be introduced which will provide longer term (six years) and more predictable aid, with a focus on results as a mean to improve effectiveness of budget support in accelerating progress towards the MDGs.</p>
<p>The 20% benchmark that the Honourable Member refers to is an undertaking by the Commission to dedicate by 2009, 20% of spending under the Development Cooperation Instrument to "basic and secondary education and basic health, through project, programme or budget support linked to these sectors, taking an average across all geographical areas under this instrument."</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Manifestly, the Honourable Member’s question relates to the consequences of the closure, at the end of 2006, of units 3 and 4 of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant.</p>
<p>The Bulgarian government took the decision to close these units eight years ago, in 1999. This decision was based on the absolutely overriding consideration of nuclear safety, and is in line with Bulgaria's obligation under the Accession Treaty.</p>
<p>It was known that this would have consequences.</p>
<p>The EU has provided very substantial financial assistance not only for decommissioning, but also to mitigate the consequences of the closure. €550 million has been put in as grants, mainly via the Kozloduy Decommissioning Support Fund managed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). Half of this sum should finance projects leading to substantial energy savings, including the improvement of lignite-fired power plants such as Pernik. Moreover, there is a €212.5 million Euratom loan for the modernisation of units 5 and 6 of Kozloduy, which consequently operate at a higher utilisation rate of power capacity. According to conservative estimates provided by the EBRD, the combined effect of the energy savings the Commission is financing will exceed the loss of supply from Kozloduy units 3 and 4.</p>
<p>But the security of electricity supply also requires better interconnections between countries. This is primarily a matter of Transmission System Operators working together. In addition, in the Balkan region, there is a structural problem of underinvestment in generation capacity. Considering the importance of the needs it is necessary to attract private investment. For that reason, the Commission is strongly supporting the full implementation of the Energy Community Treaty providing a common legislative and regulatory framework in the region. Market integration and clear market rules are indeed a key precondition for investments in the region.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0819"></a>

<p>The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, as Western Balkan states participating in the Stabilisation and Association Process (SAP), have been given the perspective of eventual EU membership. Before joining the EU, the two countries will need to comply with the Copenhagen Criteria and the conditions established within the framework of the SAP.</p>
<p>In its 2005 Strategy Paper, the Commission outlined the consecutive steps for the Western Balkan countries on their way towards the EU. The Stabilisation and Association Agreements (SAAs) aiming to prepare the countries for the future EU membership mark an important point on this road. A satisfactory track record in implementing the SAA obligations will be an essential element for the EU to consider any membership application.</p>
<p>As regards the time frame of the integration process of the two countries with the EU, the European Council stated in December 2006 that the Union would refrain from setting any target dates for accession until the accession negotiations were close to completion.</p>
<p>The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia applied for membership in 2004 and was given status of the candidate country in December 2005. The Commission will be in a position to recommend the opening of accession negotiations once the country has met all the necessary conditions.</p>
<p>In particular, before accession negotiations can be opened, the country will need to achieve concrete progress in fulfilling the Copenhagen Criteria and in the effective implementation of the SAA. The political criteria must be met and significant progress towards meeting the economic criteria and the obligations of membership must have been achieved.</p>
<p>In the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the technical negotiations on the SAA were finalised in December 2006. In May 2007, the Member States endorsed the outcome of the negotiations, but reiterated that to conclude the SAA, Bosnia and Herzegovina will need to meet the four key conditions set out by the EU in October 2005: i) police reform; ii) full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia (ICTY); iii) reform of public broadcasting; and vi) public administration reform. The progress made by Bosnia and Herzegovina up to date has not allowed for concluding the SAA. The conclusion of the SAA is a prerequisite for further approximation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the EU.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0856"></a>

<p>The United Kingdom has recently signed an agreement with Turkey known as the 'Turkey United Kingdom Strategic Partnership for 2007/2008', which is distinctly dichotomous in nature, since it constantly refers to provisions and principles recognising as a fait accompli the occupation of 37% of the Cypriot Republic by the Turkish military, in flagrant violation of UN Security Council Resolutions 541/83 of 18 November 1983 and 550/84 of 11 May 1984, condemning the 'Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus' as illegal and secessionist and calling on all governments to refuse to recognise any Cypriot state other than the Republic of Cyprus. At the same time, it has been reported that this agreement effectively sacrifices the interest of Cyprus to those of Turkey and has been agreed by the United Kingdom in exchange for Turkey refraining from incursions into Iraq.</p>

Following the enlargement to incorporate the countries of Eastern Europe, public debates were instead dominated by warnings that labour markets would be overrun by migrant workers from the new Member States. As regards the EU membership prospects for the countries of the Western Balkans, the objectives of European enlargement have never been explained to the public, the result being a striking lack of awareness of the issues at stake and a dramatic loss of support for the EU's enlargement policy.

<p>The Commission regrets the negative attitude concerning the EU's Enlargement policy which seems to prevail in a number of Member States.</p>
<p>The Commission has repeatedly stressed the importance of better communication and the need to tackle myths with facts. It is essential to raise awareness about both, the challenges as well as benefits of Enlargement policy.</p>
<p>However, it is a fact that the Commission cannot on its own bring about a change of public perception, but that all institutions of the European Union have to play their part. Much more needs to be done in this respect by the Member States, themselves, be it at national, regional or local level.</p>
<p>The Commission is of course ready to support their efforts by making available factual information, and by creating synergies with the EU institutions and interested Member States. It has in this respect, increased its activities for which the following examples may offer an illustration:</p>
<p>On the occasion of the 3<span class="sup">rd</span> anniversary of the 2004 Enlargement, a number of specific web pages were published with illustrations of the positive impact of the last enlargement.</p>
<p>A brochure on Enlargement policy for the general public is about to be published in all official languages.</p>
<p>Organisation of a number of events involving in particular young people.</p>
<p>As regards the specific issue of free movement of workers from the new to old Member States (explicitly addressed in the question), the Commission has published a report on the issue.</p>
<p>Enlargement led to a gradual implementation of the free movement of workers within the EU. Those Member States which immediately opened their labour market to new ones benefited in various ways: migrants helped fill vacancies and jobs moved from the grey to the white sector. Building on this positive experience, a number of other Member States are moving towards the full free movement of workers. Fears of a tidal wave of labour migrants from the new Member States disturbing seriously the labour markets of old Member States have not materialized.</p>
<p>For 2008, projects informing on the impact of enlargement will be continued and complemented by communication activities aimed at providing a platform for networking between Civil Society actors in Member States and candidates and potential candidate countries.</p>
<p>Increasing public support for future enlargements to the countries in Southeast Europe will require a concerted effort. In the Commission's opinion, it will in particular be necessary to provide factual information about the considerable benefits of the 5<span class="sup">th</span> enlargement.</p>
<p>The Commission appeals to all actors to help provide information and support efforts to better communicate, not least does it welcome support from Members of the Parliament.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0810"></a>

<p>The Commission has taken note of the recommendations in the resolution adopted by Parliament on 21 June 2007, on the basis of the report by the honourable Member on juvenile delinquency.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that all the stakeholders – mainly those from civil society and the local and national authorities – need to step up their efforts to prevent and combat the causes that set young people on the road to delinquency and to reduce the effects of their social marginalisation.</p>
<p>The Commission fully supports the multidimensional approach to preventing and repressing juvenile delinquency. It is necessary to strengthen cooperation between all the public and private services with responsibilities in the field of training, education, employment and social integration, focusing particularly on preventive measures. Facilitating the exchange of information and best practices should be a cornerstone of the European Union’s action, possibly leading to the development of models for intervention or minimum guidelines.</p>
<p>The Commission continues to support cooperation between different local and national bodies through financial instruments with various different objectives. Given the cross-cutting nature of the causes of juvenile delinquency and its treatment, it does not seem appropriate to develop a single financial support programme. The diversity of public policies likely to prevent the desocialisation and marginalisation of young people demands different types of financial support from the Community.</p>
<p>A major study is currently being conducted on juvenile crime and statistical data will be collected on criminal justice, on the basis of reliable and comparable indicators.

<p>The process of the Schengen evaluation in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia before the lifting of controls at internal borders has been accomplished. Although experts of the Commission participate in the evaluation visits, it should be underlined that this evaluation process is carried out under the responsibility of the Council.</p>
<p>The evaluation process of the state of preparations in the Member States concerned started in 2006. Since then, a number of visits to verify the correct application of the Schengen acquis at external borders (but also to consulates, police stations and data protection authorities) of the concerned Member States took place.</p>
<p>As a result of this two-year long process of evaluations and verifications, it has become evident that the Member States concerned have proved to be sufficiently prepared to apply the whole Schengen acquis. There are no remaining difficulties or problems with the control of the land borders with Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Serbia and Croatia.</p>
<p>Parliament is consulted on the draft Council decision confirming this positive evaluation and determining the date for the lifting of border controls at the borders with and between these new Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0847"></a>

<p>The final draft framework decision by the EU Ministers for Home Affairs and Justice legally endorses a new era of 'biometric' monitoring of individual beliefs and convictions. This involves increased immunity for the secret services and facilitates on 'pre-emptive' grounds also, the more widespread processing and exchange of sensitive personal data with any interested third parties, be they governments, international organisations or private bodies, together with exchanges of information regarding suspects for the prevention, investigation or penalisation of criminal acts. Such information covers not only political and trade union activity but also extends to personal data concerning health, religious and philosophical beliefs and ethnicity for the ostensible purpose of averting a potential threat to public safety within a Member State but also for scientific and statistical purposes.</p>

<p>The Commission's proposal for a Council Framework Decision on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters has not yet been adopted by the Council.</p>
<p>The draft Council Framework Decision does not regulate the biometric monitoring of individual beliefs and convictions. Article 7 of the draft Council Framework Decision regulates the processing of special categories of data: sensitive personal data. Personal data reveiling racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religous or philosophical beliefs or trade-union membership and data concerning health or sex life are considered as special categories of data. The processing of special categories of data shall be permitted only when this is strictly necessary and when domestic law provides adequate safeguards. The Commission is of the opinion that this does not contribute to more widespread processing and exchange of sensitive personal data. The European Data Protection Supervisor has signalled that he is satisfied with the current wording of Article 7.</p>
<p>The draft Council Framework Decision provides a clear set of rules on the processing of personal data between Member States. In addition, it clearly regulates the transfer or making available of personal data received from another Member State to a third State or international body. Finally, the Framework Decision regulates the transmission of personal data received from or made available by the competent authority of another Member State to private parties in Member States.</p>
<p>The draft Council Framework Decision does not allow onward processing of personal data to any interested party. The purposes allowing onward processing of personal data for the purpose of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties are well set out in detail in the Framework Decision. Regarding the averting of a potential threat to public security, the draft Council Framework Decision does allow the onward processing of personal data in the interest of the prevention of an immediate and serious threat to public security insofar as this is not incompatible with the purpose for which the data were collected. The competent authorities are only authorised to process such data in accordance with the legal provisions applicable and the processing is necessary and proportionate to that purpose. As regards the processing of personal data for scientific and statistical purposes, the draft Council Framework Decision provides that the competent authorities may further process the transmitted data for historical, statistical or scientific purposes, provided that Member States provide appropriate safeguards, such as, for example, making the data anonymous.</p>
<p>To conclude, the Commission does not think that the draft Council Framework Decision infringes the protection of personal data or democratic rights. Since the Framework Decision only provides a minimum set of data protection requirements, the Commission is of the opinion that the evaluation of the national measures taken to ensure full compliance with the Framework Decision, which is foreseen in Article 27 of the draft Council Framework Decision should be used to examine whether the level of data protection could be increased.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0867"></a>

<p>The European Community has recently joined the Hague Conference on International Private Law. The Member States need Community authorisation to accede to a range of international civil-law arrangements. The European Commission has submitted a number of proposals to the Council for signature or ratification. In the case of some conventions, the decisions have been pending for several years. Some conventions are operational exclusively between those Member States that managed to ratify them prior to their accession to the Union.</p>
<p>Does the Commission consider it a good policy to refuse European citizens the benefits of modern conventions, frequently negotiated at the request of, and with active participation by, the Member States, as well as Commission, to distance Europe from global instruments of cooperation, and to delay such moves ad infinitum? Does the Commission consider Community accession to the Hague Conference compatible with the virtual standstill on accession to instruments developed by its members? Does the Commission believe that the EU can be viewed as a reliable partner by others in international negotiations if it is unable, for several years, to make up its mind and decide on a course of action? Is the Commission planning to take any steps to resolve this problem?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission understands that the Honorouble Member is referring to international conventions the ratification of which is pending for reasons relating to the dispute between the United Kingdom and Spain over Gibraltar and does not refer to the accession to the Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Certain Rights in Respect of Securities held with an Intermediary where the Council is substantially divided as to the desirability of a ratification, since the Parliament itself, in a resolution adopted on 14 December 2006, urged the Council not to sign this Convention until a comprehensive impact study had established that such accession would not create distortions in the internal market in financial services.</p>
<p>As already set out in reply to written question <a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2007-2576_EN.html">E-2576/07</a>, the Commission fully shares the concern that that the differences between Spain and the United Kingdom over Gibraltar are currently blocking the accession of the Community to several important conventions, namely:</p>
<p>- 1996 Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-operation in respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children (Hague Convention on child protection);</p>
<p>- 2001 Unidroit Cape Town Convention on international interests in mobile equipment and the Protocol thereto on Matters specific to Aircraft Equipment;</p>
<p>- 2002 International Maritime Organisation Protocol to the Athens Convention relating to the Transport of Passengers and their Luggage by Sea;</p>
<p>- 2003 United Nations Protocol on Civil liability for Damage and Compensation for Damage caused by Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents on Transboundary Waters;</p>
<p>- 2003 Council of Europe Convention on Contact with Children.</p>
<p>Since these Conventions fall, wholly or partly, under exclusive Community competence, Member States are not allowed to ratify them without having been authorised by the Community to do so. Consequently, the bilateral problem between Spain and the United Kingdom indeed prevents all other Member States from ratifying these Conventions.</p>
<p>As the list shows, this problem does not only concern conventions adopted in the framework of the Hague Conference on Private International Law but also other international organisations such as UNIDROIT and the Council of Europe.</p>
<p>The Commission has already undertaken considerable efforts to remedy that situation. Concerning, in particular, the Hague Convention on Child Protection, the Commission has written to the Member States concerned several times since 2005, urging them to unblock the situation which is becoming increasingly unacceptable for the other Member States keen on ratifying this valuable convention. The issue also was raised at a number of JHA<a href="#defann_43_1" name="refann_43_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> Councils directly with the Ministers concerned.</p>
<p>The Commission has been assured by the two Member States concerned that negotiations on this issue are ongoing and that a resolution of the problem is expected in the near future.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The purpose of the Strategic Guidelines is to provide guidelines for programming the EU funds in the Member States.

<p>As far as the allocations to the Member States for each of the four Funds are concerned, the Commission transmitted to the Member States, in July 2007, the final allocations on the budget year 2007 and the provisional ones for the budget year 2008.</p>
<p>90% to 93% of the amounts of the Funds must be implemented under shared management. Therefore, it is now up to the Member States to involve regional and local bodies, as well as non governmental organisations in the process of elaboration and implementation of their multi-annual and annual programmes.</p>
<p>En effet, les décisions créant les Fonds prévoient explicitement que les Etats membres sont responsables de la sélection et la mise en œuvre des projets cofinancés, dans le respect des grands objectifs européens de programmation.

<p>In its communication of 23 October 2007 on economic partnership agreements (EPAs), the Commission clearly states that if the economic partnership agreements are not signed within the agreed deadlines by the regions with which it is negotiating, it would be prepared to sign EPAs with just some of the countries. Up to now, however, the Commission has always stressed that EPAs were to be negotiated and concluded at regional level, emphasising that the signing of such agreements was only of value if it was done with a view to regional integration. In acting this way, the Commission would be responsible for the serious tensions which would certainly come about between countries of the same region that were treated differently, in a spirit which would be quite contrary to the objective of regional integration, depending on whether or not they had signed such agreements.</p>
<p>How does the Commission intend to prevent such agreements from being directly damaging to the countries that do not sign them? How can the Commission explain this new position, in view of the priority it has always given to regional integration as an argument for the signing of EPAs?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Based on the Cotonou Agreement and its objectives of sustainable development, regional integration and enhanced participation of African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries in the multilateral trading system, the EC has been conducting Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) negotiations with the ACP Group of States and ACP regions since 2002. These negotiations are now in their final phase ahead of the end of 2007 deadline when the current Cotonou preferences and the World Trade Organisation waiver protecting them expire. The 2007 joint ACP-EC review of EPA negotiations reaffirmed the parties' commitment to meeting the deadline.</p>
<p>The EC's objective remains to replace the current Cotonou trade regime by full, comprehensive EPAs covering issues relating to trade in goods as well as services, investment and trade-related areas important for ACP development with a view to establishing effective regional markets and special relationships between these regions and the EU. At the same time, progress across the EPA negotiations has been uneven. Where a full EPA cannot be completed on time, the parties have to capture those issues negotiated so far in an agreement with a good market access arrangement at its core and then move on to finalise negotiations in other areas in the early part of 2008. This will help avoid trade disruption without compromising the objective of negotiating comprehensive EPAs with a full development package.</p>
<p>Similarly, where only certain countries within a region wish to proceed with negotiations, the Commission is prepared to work on this basis, in order to reach agreements on market access as a step towards full EPAs. To maintain the momentum of ongoing regional integration plans any such agreement will be a stepping stone to a full EPA open to all countries of the region in question.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that at present there is no alternative to this pragmatic approach, set out in its Communication of 23 October 2007, and it will continue to pursue development objectives rather than EU offensive interests.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0785"></a>

<p>The European Security Strategy states that: ‘The post Cold War environment is one of increasingly open borders in which the internal and external aspects of security are indissolubly linked’. EU intervention has covered both the internal and external aspects of the threats identified by the European Security Strategy, particularly through the 2005 European Anti-Terrorism Strategy from an internal point of view and through international cooperation and assistance with strategic partners in third countries. As regards the fight against organised crime, the European Union is pushing for the ratification of the international agreements that constitute the frame of reference for our assistance in third countries. Europol is supplying annual reports and statistics that are helping to improve information and knowledge about the areas in question.</p>
<p>The implementation of the European Security Strategy is more effective when EU and Community instruments work towards the same objectives. The Commission has been trying to achieve this by taking account of the external aspects of internal policies as well. This will become easier with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, which removes the current division between the first and third pillars, introduces the codecision procedure and increases the role of Parliament.</p>
<p>Actions under the CFSP<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and the ESDP<a href="#defann_49_2" name="refann_49_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> will continue to take account of external threats in parallel with Community action outside the EU and internal measures in the area of freedom, justice and security.</p>
<p>More generally, the Commission believes its internal and external policy objectives are more than ever intertwined, demanding a renewed vision of the way in which the EU’s interests and values, obviously including the security of its citizens, are planned, promoted and protected.</p>
<p>All our instruments are working together to deal with the challenges highlighted in the European Security Strategy: our enlargement policy, which extends peace, stability, prosperity, democracy and the rule of law across Europe; our neighbourhood policy, which aims to build relations based on shared interests and values with neighbouring countries; our trade policy, our development and humanitarian aid policy, and our action on climate change and energy security.</p>
<p>Any revision of the European Security Strategy should take account of these new global challenges and incorporate all the responses to them at European level, regardless of institutional considerations, as the Commission stated in its 2006 Communication ‘Europe in the World – Some Practical Proposals for Greater Coherence, Effectiveness and Visibility’<a href="#defann_49_3" name="refann_49_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As set out in the explanatory memorandum to the Commission's internal market proposals adopted on 19 September 2007, the package and, more specifically, the proposal for more effective unbundling apply in the same manner to publicly and privately owned companies. This means that irrespective of its public or private nature, no person or group of persons would be able alone or jointly to influence the composition of the boards, the voting or decision making of transmission system operators and at the same time the supply or production companies. This ensures that where supply or production activities are in public ownership, the independence of a publicly owned transmission system operator is still guaranteed; but these proposals do not require state owned companies to sell their network to a privately owned company. For instance, to comply with this requirement, any public entity or the State could transfer the rights (which provide the “influence”) to another publicly or privately owned legal person.</p>
<p>The important issue is that in all cases where unbundling is carried out, the Member State in question must demonstrate that in practice, the results are truly effective and that the companies operate entirely separate from one another, providing a real level-playing field across the whole of the EU. Moreover, the Commission's proposals oblige Member States to guarantee the independence of the regulatory authority by ensuring that the regulatory authority is legally distinct and functionally independent from any other public or private entity.</p>
<p>These provisions should ensure that irrespective of the ownership of transmission system operators or supply companies, all market players should be faced with the same level playing field and should receive an equal treatment from the regulatory authorities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0812"></a>

<p>In Mexico 2004, Mr Ulises Ruiz Ortiz succeeded in becoming Governor of Oaxaca by means of electoral fraud.

<p>The Mexican Supreme Court decided in June 2007 that human rights violations under Ruiz Ortiz’s government should be investigated.</p>
<p>How does the Commission intend to exert its influence to insist that these human rights violations be investigated?</p>
<p>Given that this situation has been going on for over three years, and that in the EU-Mexico Association Agreement, there is a clause on respecting human rights and the rule of law, has the Commission considered the possibility of reviewing the Association Agreement itself?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The European Union and the Commission are particularly attentive to the development of the Oaxaca situation and have closely monitored the unfolding of events. The Commission has therefore been kept regularly informed about events in Oaxaca by its Delegation in the country, by organisations from civil society and by the Mexican authorities.</p>
<p>The Commission raises the issue of human rights whenever it has the opportunity, as it has done since the beginning and strengthening, since 2004, of exchanges with Mexico within the framework of the political dialogue. Obviously it will continue to do this within the framework of forthcoming high-level contacts provided for under the Global Agreement, and will continue to pay particular attention to the situation in Oaxaca.</p>
<p>In parallel with our various actions under the Agreement, the EU Delegation in Mexico assisted and accompanied Erika Mann, MEP and Chairwoman of the Delegation to the EU-Mexico Joint Parliamentary Committee, during the parliamentary mission to Oaxaca in September 2006. There, Mrs Mann met representatives from the Popular Assembly of the Peoples of Oaxaca (APPO), among others.</p>
<p>The Commission also keeps itself informed of reports and observations by various national and international human rights NGOs, including on the conflict in Oaxaca. The Commission also organises meetings with these organisations to find out the results of their research and analyses of the situation. MEPs who are members of the EU-Mexico interparliamentary delegation have been involved in these meetings. At the meeting of the interparliamentary delegation in Mexico at the end of February 2007, the Commission Delegation in Mexico organised a session on human rights, during which the problem of Oaxaca was discussed.</p>
<p>More recently, the EU Council requested information on the human rights situation in the State of Oaxaca. A mission of representatives from the embassies of the Member States and from the Commission Delegation in Mexico was therefore organised from 27 to 28 August 2007. This mission held meetings with the chairman of the State Human Rights Commission (CEDHO), human rights NGOs, the President of the Supreme Court, the Attorney General, the Secretary of the government, and the Under-Secretary for Human Rights of the State of Oaxaca. A representative from the Office of the Secretary for Public Security also spoke at the monthly political advisors’ meeting in September 2007, at which the situation in Oaxaca was examined.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that the Commission is cooperating actively with the United Nations High Commissioner on the subject of human rights in Mexico. It is engaged in two projects to support human rights, one of which concerns the situation of natives in the Oaxaca prison system. In this context, the issue of the conflict in Oaxaca is discussed during exchanges between the High Commissioner’s Office and the Commission, and forms part of our joint policy to defend human rights.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0816"></a>

<p>Since 1994, the Commission has adopted five decisions on State aid concerning Olympic Airways. The first three were ‘conditional’ decisions authorising aid to be used for restructuring the company before the end of the 1990s, subject to certain conditions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately these decisions were not complied with, and the restructuring did not produce the anticipated results. Therefore in December 2002, then in September 2005, the Commission had to adopt two ‘negative’ decisions stating that Greece had given Olympic Airways and Olympic Airlines illegal aid incompatible with the common market. The first of these decisions was substantially confirmed by the European Court of First Instance, apart from a few minor aspects. It should also be mentioned that the Court of Justice stated that Greece had failed to implement the first decision. Because the Court decision declaring this failure was not implemented, the Commission has brought a case under the terms of Article 228 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>As it has done for a number of years, the European Commission is continuing discussions with the Greek authorities in order to find a solution to the problems concerning the implementation of the 2002 and 2005 decisions. The Commission’s objective is to ensure that EU law is complied with, both as regards the implementation of the 2002 and 2005 decisions and as regards any other measures that may involve the use of public funds for the benefit of Olympic Airways/Airlines.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0820"></a>

<p>The Commission fully shares the two main starting points of the report: the importance and the success of Cohesion Policy in curbing disparities and thus in contributing to the EU's social, economic and territorial cohesion; and the fact that, as the result of recent enlargements, the range of such disparities are greater. The Commission is also very much aware of the pressure that globalisation poses on European economies in terms of relocations, demographic change, migration flows and other related issues. In response to these challenges, Cohesion Policy for 2007-2013 has been reformed and modernised while aligning it with the Lisbon and Gothenburg agenda.</p>
<p>The Commission also agrees that, if Croatia and the Western Balkans countries were to access the EU before the end of this programming period they could be accommodated into the current framework for Cohesion Policy without major disruption. The Honourable Member should note that eligibility rules for 2007-2013 for the EU-27 were fixed in 2006 and are being applied. As regards Turkey, the Commission agrees that a specific impact assessment needs to be conducted at the appropriate time from the point of view of its likely impact on EU Cohesion Policy. According to the Negotiating Framework, accessions negotiations with Turkey can only be concluded after the establishment of the Financial Framework for the period from 2014 together with possible consequential reforms.</p>
<p>The Commission will therefore assess, at the appropriate moment, the impact of all future enlargements on the EU Cohesion Policy and propose the corresponding modifications. Until this assessment has taken place, the Commission is not in a position to comment on any estimate of associated costs.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that a sufficient financial allocation is an essential pre-requisite for ensuring the success of the policy, in line with the Commission proposals for the 2007-2013 Financial Perspectives, and is very keen on taking on board proposals aiming at increasing the leverage effect of Cohesion Policy in the current Member States, like enhancing private capital participation or using innovative financial instruments beyond subsidies. However, at this point in time, the Commission is not in a position to comment on estimates of amounts needed for any specific policy in the future.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0831"></a>

<p>Formaldehyde is classified as a Category 3 carcinogenic since 1996 when the 22<span class="sup">nd</span> Adaptation to Technical Progress<a href="#defann_58_1" name="refann_58_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> of Directive 67/548/EEC<a href="#defann_58_2" name="refann_58_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances was adopted. Category 3 includes substances which cause concern for man owing to possible carcinogenic effects, but in respect of which the available information is not adequate for making a satisfactory assessment.</p>
<p>France, taking into account the recent decision of the International Agency for Research on Cancer, proposes to classify formaldehyde as Category 1 carcinogenic. Category 1 includes substances known to be carcinogenic to man. In fact, in September 2004, the International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded that formaldehyde is carcinogenic to humans and listed it in its Group 1. This is a higher classification than previous evaluations made by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.</p>
<p>The French proposal has been discussed in November 2005 by the Technical Committee of Classification &amp; Labelling under Directive 67/548/EEC<a href="#defann_58_3" name="refann_58_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> on the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances. The recommendations made by this Technical Committee are used by the Commission to elaborate a proposal for an Adaptation to Technical Progress to update the list of substances of the Directive on the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances by comitology. These substances are included in Annex I.</p>
<p>However, due to ongoing research on the carcinogenicity of formaldehyde, in particular an update of an epidemiology study of the United States National Cancer Institute, it was decided to postpone any decision to a future meeting. The results of the updated study of the National Cancer Institute should be available shortly.</p>
<p>Therefore, as the Technical Committee of Classification &amp; Labelling did not finalise its discussion on the carcinogenicity of formaldehyde, it was not possible to include it either in the draft proposal of the 30<span class="sup">th</span> Adaptation to Technical Progress voted in February 2007 or in the 31<span class="sup">st</span> Adaptation to Technical Progress, which will go through the comitology procedure by the end of 2007.</p>
<p>However, the French proposal will be dicussed again under the REACH<a href="#defann_58_4" name="refann_58_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> legislative framework by the Risk Assessment Committee, which should be established by June 2008. On the basis of the recomendation of this Risk Assessment Committee, the Commission could then elaborate a new proposal on the Adaptation to Technical Progress to modify the current classification of formaldehyde, if needed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The consequence is that, according to the customs services, more than 70% of all counterfeit products come from China.</p>
<p>The audiovisual sector is the biggest victim of this. What is particularly annoying about it is that it is not only the big American stars who have their products counterfeited in China but also less well known European artists.

<p>Effective protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights in China is an EU priority. The Commission is aware of piracy encountered by the audiovisual sector in China and regularly addresses this issue in its bilateral talks on intellectual property matters with the Chinese authorities. For example, this issue was on the agenda of the last EU-China Intellectual Property Working Group which took place in Beijing on 27 September 2007. The Chinese authorities have made efforts to tackle this issue but these efforts are insufficient. This issue will also be on the agenda of the EU-China Summit scheduled on 28 November 2007 in China.</p>
<p>The Commission has favoured dialogue and co-operation with China to tackle piracy. This co-operative approach has produced limited results. The Commission has made it clear to China that significant progress was needed. In this respect, the EU-China Summit will be crucial to measure China's determination to meet the EU concerns. If China continues to pay insufficient attention to EU concerns regarding intellectual property issues, the Commission will consider lodging a complaint with the World Trade Organisation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0838"></a>

<p>As stated by the Honourable Member, healthcare-associated infections constitute an important burden of disease and mortality in European societies.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently reflecting on a draft proposal for a Council Recommendation on the prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections.</p>
<p>This proposal is being prepared with the help of an international group of experts and incorporates comments from:</p>
<p>the surveillance authorities of the Community network on communicable disease, and</p>
<p>those which were made by stakeholders in the course of a public consultation in December 2005 to January 2006.</p>
<p>The principal recommendations will be establishing or strengthening:</p>
<p>Control and preventive measures to support containment of infections</p>
<p>Infection prevention and control programmes in healthcare institutions,</p>
<p>Surveillance systems according to commonly agreed standards,</p>
<p>Education, training, research and information exchange.</p>
<p>In the 2008 Commission Legislative and Work Programme, the proposal is identified as a strategic initiative, underlining the importance the Commission attaches to this proposal.</p>
<p>The objective is to put the proposal to the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs (EPSCO) Council during the French Presidency in 2008.</p>
<p>Given the time needed for the steps leading to adoption by the College and transmission to the Council, it is not realistic to bring the proposal forward half a year to the EPSCO Council during the Slovenian Presidency.</p>
<p>The Commission however wishes to assure the Honourable Member that it is determined to avoid any delay on this strategic initiative.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0841"></a>

The Directive includes many forest habitat types that specifically refer to characteristic tree species which are present and for which the designation of Natura 2000 sites is required. Furthermore, the protection of trees is also important for the conservation of species such as woodpeckers and beetles, which may be dependant on mature and old trees. Therefore, the Natura 2000 network may include ancient trees, where they contribute to the conservation objectives of these sites.</p>
<p>However, there is no specific reference to the inclusion of sites in Natura 2000 exclusively on the basis of the presence of small numbers of very old trees. While such trees may have an important ecological, cultural or historical importance they are not systematically considered to be the key determinants of overall biodiversity. For this reason, the Commission does not have any plans to amend the Directive to include consideration of ancient trees among the criteria for site designation. Member States are of course free to establish national measures for protecting such important living monuments.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Gas and electricity prices are continuing to rise excessively, partly because of a lack of competition, particularly in Belgium. This could lead national regulators and national authorities to impose price ceilings in order, at least somewhat, to reduce the prices paid by the final consumer.</p>
<p>Does the Commission agree that price ceilings (perhaps temporary) would be an acceptable and effective way of dealing with the lack of competition on the energy market for the benefit of consumers?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The EU legal framework, in particular Articles 3(3) of the Electricity<a href="#defann_62_1" name="refann_62_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and the Gas<a href="#defann_62_2" name="refann_62_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> Directive, allows price regulation in limited circumstances - namely, to ensure universal and public service obligations, i.e. the right for households and, if the Member State deems this appropriate, small enterprises, to be supplied with electricity of a specified quality within their territory at reasonable, easily and clearly comparable and transparent prices. However, such price regulations cannot impede the opening of the market.<a href="#defann_62_3" name="refann_62_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a></p>
<p>Indeed, in order for markets to work, it is essential that supply, production and investment decisions are made using the most relevant and undistorted information. Prices are the most important piece of that information.</p>
<p>Price ceilings outside the legitimate objective of ensuring universal service as set out in the Directives may pose a significant threat to the emergence of competitive energy markets. If price ceilings are set too low or, if costs increase while regulated prices remain unchanged, electricity and gas suppliers can easily be caught in a price squeeze in which retail prices no longer allow them to cover their costs. New entrants are essential for bringing competition into previously monopolised markets, and these new entrants are particularly vulnerable as they have to rely on energy wholesale markets for sourcing electricity and gas. This risk is not theoretical. It has already occurred in several Member States.</p>
<p>This is why the Commission has had to open several infringement proceedings against Member States who have introduced regulated prices or price caps beyond the legitimate universal service objective. The Commission has also had to launch proceedings under other legal instruments including the state aid rules.</p>
<p>It should be added that properly functioning markets and price signals are also a prerequisite for guiding investment decisions. Price caps may render a market unattractive for investment and stifle capacity increase as private operators can no longer recover their costs or, at least, cannot realise the returns possible in other markets. Investments, such as in generation capacity, are however important to secure the replacement of exisiting capacity. So properly functioning markets and price signals are not only important for realising an internal energy market, but are at least equally important to achieve other policy objectives, in particular, secure energy supplies, , reaching the Kyoto targets as agreed during the 2007 Spring European Council and targets for energy savings<a href="#defann_62_4" name="refann_62_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Commission therefore considers that action needs to be focussed on the core issue, namely, measures improving competitive conditions. The Third Liberalisation Package presented by the Commssion on 19 September 2007 as well as the increased enforcement action under the EC competition rules reflect the high priority the Commission attaches to bringing about truly competitive energy markets.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>With regard to the Augustow by-pass, which is a part of the ´Via Baltica´ project, the Commission decided on 21 March 2007 to refer the case to the Court of Justice. The decision of the Commission of 21 March 2007 also provided for interim measures on the basis of Articles 242 and 243 of the Treaty. The construction of the Augustow by-pass would lead to the destruction of a unique ecosystem and annihilation of rare Rospuda marshlands.

It must be noted that Poland confirmed later to the Court that the works in Rospuda Valley would not be initiated until the Court delivers its ruling. The Commission closely monitors the situation regarding the execution of the project. The information available shows that the works in Rospuda Valley have not been initiated.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Given the recent developments surrounding the expiry of the so-called ‘Memorandum of Understanding’ on Chinese exports of certain textile and clothing products to the countries of the European Union on 31 December 2007, and the pursuit of total liberalisation of trade in textiles and clothing,</p>
<p>how does the Commission assess the consequences of the liberalisation of trade in textiles and clothing as far as this strategic industry within the European Union, and particularly on the economic viability of the companies (and specifically the SMEs) concerned, and on employment?</p>
<p>What is the Commission’s assessment of the consequences of the liberalisation of trade in textiles and clothing on the major importers and distributors, specifically as regards their exponential increase of their profit margins by forcing lower prices on the producers, while maintaining or increasing their margins as far as consumers are concerned?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>After the expiry of the Agreement on Textile and Clothing (ATC) in 2005, to deal with the surging levels of textile imports from China, the Shanghai Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) provided for agreed levels for imports from China into the EU of ten product categories. The agreed levels apply to imports shipped from China by 31 December 2007. The MoU itself remains valid until the end of 2008.</p>
<p>That was a once and for all deal with China based on the provisions of their World Trade Organisation (WTO) entry and gave an extra breathing space to the EU industry to adapt to the new challenges posed by China as a major world player in the textile sector.</p>
<p>The Commission, fully aware that other countries have concluded MoUs with import limitations which will continue until the end of 2008 and that the textile sector needs a smooth transition towards full liberalization in 2008, has held discussions with China on the best way to achieve such transition. In this spirit the Commission and China have decided to put into place a joint monitoring mechanism for trade in eight textiles product categories for 2008 (cat 4 T-shirts, cat 5 pullovers, cat 6 trousers, cat 7 blouses, cat 20 bed linen, cat 26 dresses, cat 31 brassieres and cat 115 flax and ramie yarn). The surveillance covers the economically important categories and those with particular sensitivities. The two categories not covered are those where the utilization of the agreed levels has been and remains lowest in the period 2005 to 2007.</p>
<p>By this joint surveillance, China has de facto accepted that it shares with us the responsibility to ensure a smooth transition after the expiry at the end of this year of the MoU agreed levels.</p>
<p>Member States, the textile industry and the trade sector have welcomed this agreement as they all agreed that a repeat of the 2005 situation was in nobody's interest.</p>
<p>More generally, even if trade issues are very important with respect to the liberalisation of trade in textiles and clothing industry, this sector in EU is facing structural changes that go beyond trade issues.</p>
<p>In fact, structural adjustment process started years before the dismantling of quotas. This made clearer that the competitive advantages of EU textiles and clothing industry lies mainly in innovation, research, labour force skills and access to markets. In this industrial sector, the reinforcement of these competitiveness strengths represents a major contribution to our Lisbon strategy.</p>
<p>The textiles and clothing industry can maintain its strategic role in the EU economy. However, the sector could provide fewer but better jobs in future. There is therefore a need for initiatives related to innovation, research and skills as the main means for the increase of viability of the sector companies.</p>
<p>After the liberalisation of the textile sector in 2005, the Commission was interested in the liberalization impact on consumer prices and has commissioned a study on the subject.</p>
<p>The study showed clearly that consumers have benefited from the progressive liberalisation of textiles trade to a considerable extent. Across the EU, clothing prices fell by 16.2% relative to the overall price level over the ATC phase-out period. There is a direct link between the progressive liberalization under the ATC and the price reduction: in average, 60% of the drop in import prices has been passed through to consumers in terms of lower prices. Consumer price being a composite of service input prices and imported products prices the drop is less than perfect.</p>
<p>The study also found evidence of a partial capture of these benefits by the distribution chain, pointing out issues of dysfunction of the Internal Market and of competition in the distribution sector. Some Member States have experienced a great decrease in consumer prices (a 50% drop of clothing prices relative to the overall price level) while others have remained largely unchanged. This overall variation across Member States in terms of consumer price reductions is linked to the structure of national service sectors and in particular the retail sector.</p>
<p>The study is the beginning of a process whereby the Commission is considering the question of how to ensure a fair distribution of the benefits of trade opening and has to be seen in the wider context of our Global Europe strategy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0854"></a>

<p>The Commission has announced a proposal for the Emissions Trading Scheme after 2012.

The scheme has the potential strongly to influence the use of fuels in the EU and in the Member States, the security of EU energy supply and opportunities for investment, particularly in more efficient coal-fired power plants.</p>
<p>By what means does the Commission intend to ensure that the Member States’ decisions on the structure of their energy mix are respected?

<p>The structure of the energy mix remains a decision for Member States. The EU Emissions Trading Scheme only serves as an instrument to ensure that the price of carbon is taken into account in investment and production decisions. Investments in modern and more efficient power plants are thus incentivised under the Scheme, as such plants will have either spare allowances to sell, or will have to buy less allowances to cover their emissions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0857"></a>

<p>In its Communication "A new framework strategy for multilingualism"<a href="#defann_67_1" name="refann_67_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> adopted in 2005, the Commission reaffirms its commitment to multilingualism, underlining that respect for linguistic diversity is in fact a core value of the European Union. The Commission's multilingualism policy encourages the full expression of all languages, which have the same rights and an equal value.</p>
<p>The Action Plan "Promoting language learning and linguistic diversity" (2004-2006) was the first comprehensive policy statement on languages, setting out actions at European level to make further progress in this field. These actions address all languages present in the European Union, official languages as well as national, regional, minority and migrant languages.</p>
<p>Both the Action Plan and the Communication on Multilingualism stressed the need to consider linguistic aspects of other European policies and programmes, for example in the areas of culture, media and social inclusion. In order to define the contribution of multilingualism to the 2008 European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, the Commission set up a high level group of intellectuals that will produce its recommendations by the end of 2007.</p>
<p>One of the main objectives of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue 2008 is to provide means for intercultural dialogue and dialogue between citizens to strengthen respect for cultural and linguistic diversity. Its preparation has led to the development of a wider strategy to promote intercultural dialogue, involving EU programmes and instruments, as well as mobilizing Member States and all interested parties. Third countries will also be involved.</p>
<p>The school curricula for language learning fall under the responsibility of the EU Member States. Regional and minority languages are protected by the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages. Member States of the Council of Europe are signatories to this Charter.</p>
<p>The promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity is an objective of the programme Lifelong Learning 2007-2013. In the past Community support to organisations for the promotion of regional and minority languages was limited to the http://ec.europa.eu/education/policies/lang/languages/langmin/eblul_en.html" and the http://ec.europa.eu/education/policies/lang/languages/langmin/mercator_en.html" . Now the Lifelong Learning Programme has been opened to other such organisations. In 2008 the transversal activity for languages in the programme will give priority to projects that reinforce the acquisition of competence in languages in order to improve intercultural dialogue in Europe. It is open to practically all languages (official languages of Members States, regional, minority, migrant, "non-EU languages", etc.). Application for projects and organisations to support and promote Romanian also as a language of minority communities are eligible under this new programme.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>At a time when most Member States are being faced with a serious problem of low birth rates among working-class families, business associations are calling into question the maternity entitlements of young women and the rights of workers in general. A case in point is the unlawful measure being adopted by the 'Varvaresos' textile manufacturing company in Naousa, where an internal memorandum has been circulated to plant managers instructing them to single out workers 'due to give birth in 2007 or 2008', since the 'Varvaresos' plant, like other undertakings in general, is seeking to avoid the need to grant parental leave and pay prenatal and childbirth allowances, entitlements which workers have had to struggle to obtain. This is not unrelated to the company's plan to shut down one of its three plants, involving the immediate release of workers or the modification of employment contracts, of which the first victims are likely to be young women and women with children.

<p>The Danube Black Sea (DABLAS) initiative was launched following a 2001 Commission Communication<a href="#defann_70_1" name="refann_70_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> that highlighted the land based pollution problems faced by the Danube-Black Sea region and outlined the Commission approach to deal with it.</p>
<p>As tributaries to the Black Sea, the two rivers Dniester and Dnieper are already within the overall scope of the initiative, even though their river basins are not shared by any Member State of the EU.</p>
<p>The Communication underlined that the two relevant environmental conventions (Convention on Co-operation and Protection and Sustainable use of the Danube River and the Convention on the Protection of the Black Sea against Pollution or Black Sea Convention) should be the basis for regional cooperation. The Black Sea Convention has continued to be actively involved in DABLAS throughout its development.</p>
<p>The importance of the Black Sea Convention as the forum for regional environmental cooperation has also been acknowledged in the recent Black Sea Synergy Communication<a href="#defann_70_2" name="refann_70_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. Following this then Commission has been exploring the possibility for the European Community to become a Contracting Party to this Convention. This will require an amendment to the Convention to allow the possibility for regional economic integration organisations such as the European Community to become a Contracting Party.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the European Parliament and Council are currently negotiating the proposed Marine Strategy Directive, which will aim at ensuring good environmental status by 2021 in the seas surrounding the EU, including the Black Sea. To this end, the Directive will require an additional effort of cooperation at regional level to properly involve other concerned countries in its implementation, including for tackling land-based pollution. In this context, the Black Sea Convention appears a privileged forum upon which such cooperation could be built up in the region for the purpose of the Directive.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Innumerable animals are still being subjected to unspeakable suffering when being transported on European roads, e.g. watering times are not adhered to, calves injured during transport have to be put down. The EU Directive lays down a maximum journey time of 8 hours, yet a sheep transport from Spain to Greece is recorded as taking a full 96 hours. Austrian animal conservationists have now set up an internet site (http://www.gegentiertransporte.at" </p>
<p>) and have already collected over 60 000 signatures in support of their stand against these abuses.</p>
<p>How can these 60 000 and more signatures be used most effectively so as to ensure that Parliament and also the Commission and Council take firmer action on the issue of these abuses in the transportation of live animals? When can a report on animal transport be expected from the Commission?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission shares the views of the Honourable Member regarding the importance for EU institutions to take into account the concerns expressed by the EU citizens on animal welfare.</p>
<p>Among those issues the correct implementation of the Regulation on the protection of animals during transport is a top priority for the Commission.</p>
<p>But it is not an issue falling solely under the responsibilities of the Commission.</p>
<p>Member States have the full responsibility to find proper solutions to ensure rapidly adequate enforcement of the rules.</p>
<p>EU rules on animal transport foresee strict requirements for vehicles, drivers and loading/unloading conditions.</p>
<p>At the last October 2008 Council of Ministers of Agriculture the question of better enforcement of the EU animal transport legislation was discussed. Ministers called for stringent respect of EU legislation in all Member States.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Commission vigilantly monitors enforcement of the Regulation on transport in Member States.</p>
<p>Both missions of Commission veterinary experts and complaints from Non-Governmental Organisations are highlighting that there is an urgent demand for coordinated actions. At the same time the Commission is aware that corrective actions to remedy shortcomings have been undertaken in certain Member States.</p>
<p>The Commission is always ready to initiate action against Member States which do not implement measures to enforce EU rules on animal welfare.</p>
<p>The use of navigation systems for long distance transport will improve controls and make targeted actions possible. The establishing of national contact points for animal transport and the creation of networks of competent authorities in Member States will facilitate the prevention of such episodes of mistreatment of animals. It is however not only a matter of sanctions and controls. Strong political will is necessary to reinforce the importance of animal welfare in the operators in the food chain.</p>
<p>Concerning the future Commission proposal on the revision of travelling times and space allowances, a specific impact assessment will be carried out in 2008. This impact assessment will in particular include a comprehensive study on the current state of play of the implementation of the above mention aspects of the legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0870"></a>

<p>Various publications recently announced the market release of a product labelled ‘C-Ice Swiss Cannabis Ice Tea’ in a number of countries across Europe. Launched first in Switzerland, the beverage is now available in Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Romania and Bulgaria (non-exhaustive list). The producer explains that, to make it legal, the narcotic elements of the plant have been removed from the tea, and it is described as containing five per cent hemp flower syrup and a tiny (0.0015 per cent) quantity of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). However, this is not clear to consumers. There is a great concern that selling the product is dangerous and will lead to ‘normalisation of cannabis as an image in young people’s minds’. It even seems to be marketed as a health drink.</p>
<p>Does the Commission consider such marketing strategies appropriate at a time when the use of alcohol, drugs and tobacco, especially among young people, is turning into a serious problem for society?</p>
<p>Does the Commission envisage specific measures with regard to influencing control over advertising and marketing practices that could promote positive connotations of products or substances known in any other form or quantity to be of an illegal or harmful nature?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>A brand name or a name, under which a foodstuff is sold, that contains the word "Cannabis" is indeed of concern from a public health point of view.</p>
<p>Firstly, labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs sold to the ultimate consumer is regulated by the general food labelling directive 2000/13/EC. The general rules prohibit the use of information that would mislead the consumer.</p>
<p>Secondly, cannabis is classed as an illicit drug in all Member States and is scheduled as such in the relevant United Nations Conventions. To market a product that even claims to contain this substance is inconsistent with the fight against drug trafficking and consumption in the EU which is a priority for all Member States and is based on a number of legislative instruments at EU level as well as on the EU Drugs Strategy 2005-2012 and the EU Action Plan on Drugs 2005-2008.</p>
<p>In addition to existing efforts under the EU's Public Health Programme, considerable funding is moreover being released this year under the EU's Specific programme on Drug Prevention and Information, designed to support the Member States in their efforts to counter drug consumption. The marketing of products by appealing to an attraction for those drugs therefore runs counter to anti drug policies pursued by all Member States. It is also the reason, why some Member States have prohibited the placing of concerned foodstuffs on their market on the basis of Article 30 of the EC Treaty, which can justify a ban on grounds of public morality as well as public health.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
