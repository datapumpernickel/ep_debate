<p class="contents">As you know, in accordance with our mandate from the Brussels European Council, we have been consulting widely with our partners. The Taoiseach has already either spoken to or met most of his colleagues on the European Council and will have been in contact with all of them before long. Several more meetings are scheduled over the coming weeks. Foreign Minister Cowen and I have also talked to and met with as many of our counterparts as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We also discussed the IGC over lunch at last Monday’s meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council. Notwithstanding the importance of bilateral consultations, we felt that it was also important to recognise the collective nature of the IGC and to have an informal discussion of where we stand. I was very gratified that there was full support for our approach at the General Affairs Council. The discussion was a positive one – there is considerable common ground. We are all committed to taking the work of the IGC forward and to concluding it as soon as possible. However, we all also recognise that there are sensitive and complex issues which remain to be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">In these consultations with our partners and all those involved in the IGC, including of course the European Parliament, we are seeking to build a complete picture of the situation in the IGC. We want to ensure that we fully understand the views and concerns of all, to listen to what everyone has to say and, through active dialogue, tease out the exact nuances of their positions. This will help towards the second and more complex phase of our mandate to draw conclusions from our contacts and prepare a report for the March European Council. I do not wish at this stage to speculate about what that statement will contain.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not underestimate the complexity of our task. The issues to be resolved may be few in number, but they are highly sensitive and difficult. We will try to encourage progress, to build mutual understanding and to identify common ground. However, we cannot compel agreement in the absence of the shared political will to achieve it. There is an obligation on everyone to think not only of their own interests, but of the collective interest of the Union as a whole. In that context I want to reiterate the point made by the Taoiseach in Strasbourg, and also by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Cowen, before the Committee on Constitutional Affairs last week: 'If it emerges that there is a real prospect of achieving an agreement during our presidency, then we will not hesitate to seize that opportunity'. We intend to submit the fullest possible report to the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention opened up the process of Treaty change and brought fresh perspectives to bear. We all – parliaments and governments alike – are accountable to our people, and the democratic authority of the Convention was underscored by the breadth of its membership. I am pleased that the great bulk of what was proposed by the Convention has stood throughout the IGC and will continue to stand. For example, the text clearly sets out the allocation of competences between the Union and the Member States, and the principles governing their exercise. It simplifies legal procedures and instruments. It creates a single legal personality for the Union. It enhances the role of this Parliament, and it also gives national parliaments an important part in the overall architecture.</p>
<p class="contents">By incorporating the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the draft enhances the prominence of human rights in the work of the Union. The values and objectives of the Union are more clearly expressed. Its proposals on the creation of a single European Union Foreign Minister and External Action Service should make the Union’s external policies more effective and coherent.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention’s report remains and will remain at the heart of the IGC's work. But as a matter of both legal and political reality, governments are obliged to look very carefully at it, and in particular at those aspects which would affect them most directly. In due course it will be our duty to seek national ratification, in some cases through referenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The efforts of the Italian presidency ensured that considerable progress was made in resolving most of the points raised by governments. The work done in the run up to the Naples Conclave in late November 2003, and at Naples itself, was very productive. The paper prepared immediately in advance of the European Council was particularly valuable and struck a very careful balance. While, of course, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, and while there are aspects of the Italian presidency's good work which were not the subject of final consensus, we believe we must try, as far as possible, to maintain the excellent progress which has been made.</p>
<p class="contents">When Minister Cowen appeared before the Constitutional Affairs Committee, he gave an assurance that the Irish presidency would be open, fair and balanced, and that we would listen to all views and work to accommodate them. I want to repeat that message here today. We have no hidden agendas, no pet projects. We are determined that nobody will be able to question our even-handedness. We may, or may not, succeed. But this House can be absolutely assured that we will put every possible effort into this work.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barnier,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I recall quite a well-known proverb which says something like ‘Procrastination Road leads straight to Never-Never Land’. You, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, were there when, a few weeks ago, the European Council in Brussels decided to take ‘Procrastination Road’ towards a European constitution. At the moment, in line with the thinking in Brussels, many of us have concluded that this ‘procrastinating’ timescale was preferable to reaching a bad agreement immediately, which would have undermined the work of the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say, however, on behalf of the Commission and in particular on behalf of my fellow-Commissioner Mr Vitorino, that we will not resign ourselves to ‘Procrastination Road’ leading to ‘Never-Never Land’. The debate today, which this House wanted, is an opportunity for you to join with us in relaunching the constitutional process, and to preserve the European spirit that we have built up over eighteen months in the Convention. In order to achieve this, all our good will needs to be united: that of presidencies and Member States of the Council, that of Parliament, that of the Commission and of national elected representatives, with the support of the regions and organised civil society. In order to remobilise public opinion in general, we all need to work together to give this process hope again.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s contribution to this urgent task will be based on three convictions. The first is that we want a general agreement. A general agreement is not an agreement bit by bit or piece by piece, but an overall agreement, in which everyone can see a balance based on a text of which everyone is aware. This is why the Commission does not think that anything has been gained from the discussions in Brussels, as Mr Roche said earlier – particularly when the result would have been nothing more than a step backwards. Moreover, although there are tendencies that it is helpful to take into account when continuing a task that has been interrupted, these must be confronted in open, transparent debate and by the current situation. Naturally, we acknowledge the very useful work done under the impetus of the Italian Presidency, which was the subject of the preparatory document for the ministerial meeting in Naples.</p>
<p class="contents">The second conviction is that we want an agreement solely based on the draft constitution drawn up by the Convention. This is the only thing that should be taken as established because at best, we do not think that anything better or greater can ever be done than this collective, democratic effort, which took eighteen months. You are of course aware of our institution’s position regarding this result. We think that on a few points it could be clarified, adjusted and improved regarding the composition and operation of the Commission, in order to broaden the scope of qualified majority voting and of course to make the procedures for revising the Treaties more flexible. However, like you, we wish to preserve its general balance, in particular with regard to finance and budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">The third conviction is that we want an agreement as soon as possible. The Irish Presidency has, in a sense, started on what it has to do. It has restarted the work of listening and working between those involved in the Intergovernmental Conference. The Commission supports – and will continue to fully support – the efforts and the method that you, Mr President-in-Office, have chosen, and these efforts are essential.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be no easier to reach an agreement in November than in April or May 2004; in fact, I think that it will be much more difficult. If we allow the symbolic deadline of 1 May or 9 May, or the politically more significant one that is primarily your own, 13 June to pass by, the draft constitution will not be very far from what I called at the beginning of my speech ‘Never-Never Land’. In other words, the Commission supports all efforts, wherever they come from, to preserve this constitutional process.</p>
<p class="contents">As you said, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the next meeting will be that of the European Council in March, where the Presidency will evaluate the results of its bilateral consultations and where we will all be able to verify the state of mind of the Heads of Government. We will see whether that state of mind is, as we hope, different in March to what it was in December in Brussels. This is why, Mr President, the draft resolution prepared by this House has the Commission’s total approval and support.</p>

It has found new ways of structuring the way we talk to each other, and is applying the necessary sensitivity to getting us to do it. Taking all these things together, there is, in my judgment, a real chance of this House’s objective being approached even before 1 May or prior to the European elections, and of a result being achieved. I see this as important; we can all see that there is no desire to maintain the debate’s momentum until next December, nor to maintain the collective awareness of what was more or less already agreed under the Italian presidency, namely that we have to work to a tighter deadline in order to keep the two together. It is because this is generally known that there is ongoing discussion in the various Member States, and so I am aware of a general willingness to produce a result as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, let us bear in mind what this House would like to see: further democratisation of the European Union, of course, and the Budget issue, which we see as decisive and to which I would like to return. There is the issue of transparency, so that the public can know who in Europe is responsible for what, and also, of course, the issue of efficiency. That is what we have to get to grips with at the present moment, and it will be decisive.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it important that we should not explicitly specify certain models right down to the last millimetre. What has to be decisive is that the decision-making structure should be more efficient than that proposed in Nice, and should enable an enlarged Community to act; that has to be the crucial yardstick, and I believe that, if we take this as our basis and apply the requisite capacity for imagination, we will be able to find compromises that will enable this to be accepted by those countries that often have difficulties on this point, for it is connected – or can be – with other issues as a means towards reaching a compromise that, while being truly fair, does justice to the three goals of democratisation, transparency and efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now mention a final point. In the aftermath of Brussels, there has been so much discussion of a multiple-speed Europe, something we have always had within the Treaty, whether about the euro, Schengen or anything else. It was always the case, though, that everyone could talk to everyone else, in the same fora, and that all Members had the opportunity of joining in. What we are today describing as a necessity is a defence union. If we do not get the constitution, there will be irresistible pressure for a defence union to be established outside the framework of the European Union. We will then no longer be obliged to talk to each other every day in the same fora, things will fall apart, and then, rather than there being a multiple-speed Europe within the framework of the European Union, Europe will drift apart. The end result – not because anyone wants it, but because these things happen in the course of time – will be that, at some point in the next five or ten years, we will be where we were before 1914, in a Europe of alliances. I think we all should know how undesirable this would be, and so we should see it as our responsibility to get a result now.</p>

All this talk about ‘core Europe’, centres of gravity and multiple speeds is no substitute for the constitution; on the contrary, it leads us astray, into a patchwork Europe of plots and counter-plots, and that we must avoid above all else.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need the constitution before the elections, as we have to send out a signal to the voters throughout Europe, who are increasingly impatient for this constitution to be adopted, for we know that nothing will be any easier in the autumn or next year; indeed, everything to do with the constitution will become more difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we know perfectly well that we must not have another failed Intergovernmental Conference. It is vital that we succeed this time round, and I support the Irish presidency’s desire to clarify in advance whether we can achieve a positive outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us, fourthly, stop putting question marks against what came out of Naples. We have traded arguments; we are where we did not always want to be, but this is where we must start from if we are to progress further. I know that most of the Member States are willing to accept Naples in terms of the consensus that the Italian presidency presented. Apart from that, there is one point on which I differ slightly from Mr Brok. Although it is certain that effectiveness is the benchmark, the yardstick of democratic legitimacy must also be applied to the decision-making processes in the European Union. I do think, though, that we will draw a bit closer together on this point in the course of the coming weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">We will support the Irish presidency with all our might, not only as regards the methods by which it endeavours to achieve consensus, but also in terms of its goal of presenting, in March, a sketch of potential outcomes rather than merely a timetable. Let me conclude with words of hope. After this Monday’s informal meeting there is a little light peeping over the horizon; may it become, under this presidency, a European dawn!</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interjection by Mr Schulz: And it is deepest red!)</span> </p>
<p class="contents">That it may well be for you lot; red is a fine colour, but not only by its associations with the European Socialists ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause, laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... that is a misuse of the colour.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be serious; let us get back to 2004, which is, as we all know, a crucial year. On 1 May, ten countries will be acceding to the European Union, in which there will then be 450 million people – far more than in the USA and Russia combined, and that figure itself shows by its magnitude how necessary it is that we should have a basis on which these 25 States – and later more – with their 450 million inhabitants may be held together. It is important that we should be able, on 10 and 13 June, to present the voters with a constitution that will show us the way to get through this twenty-first century in peaceful cooperation, as our continent is peacefully integrated.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say, on behalf of the European People’s Party element in our shared group, that we see the constitution as the priority above all others. It was the experience of Nice that prompted us to set up the Convention. It was Parliament – I do not want to claim credit solely for our own group – that called for the Convention. I can tell you that if the Convention had been able to take decisions on its own, we would have a constitution today. What was proposed was, in principle, a right and proper project, and that is why we declare that the failure of the Brussels Summit must not mean the failure of the European Constitution and that everyone concerned should now learn from the Brussels experience. Apportioning blame will get us nowhere, and not only politics but also human experience teach us that blame is never, or almost never, to be attached to one person alone, but that it is always shared by many. We therefore urge everyone to seek out opportunities for compromise and to muster their capacity for it, for there is above all a psychological basis for success, namely that we should respect each other and that the small countries should be treated with the same respect as the large ones. A country may well be large, but that does not mean that it is on the right track.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">There are, then, no first and second-class Members of the European Union. One does hear some preposterous arguments used against the constitution; there are those who say that a constitution amounts to centralism and a European superstate, and the very same people who reject a constitution scorn Europe as being, in their eyes, nothing more than a bureaucracy. That is why we say that a constitution is our chosen means of making democracy and parliamentarianism realities in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interruption by Mr Schulz: Name names!)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, Mr Schulz, there are many that I have in mind, but I do not want to make you more famous than you already are.</p>
<p class="contents">The constitution will strengthen not only this House, but also the national parliaments, which will be able to appeal, on the grounds of subsidiarity, even against legislation planned by the European Union, and it needs to be pointed out to the constitution’s detractors that it, for the first time, puts local government on a legal footing. In the event of any dispute as to whether, in accordance with the allocation of European competences, it is Europe or the nation-states that are competent, or if regional and local self-government is impaired, it is not merely politically but also legally of vast significance that the European Court of Justice can refer to the article that lays down how local communities govern themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been talk of ‘core Europe’ and multiple speeds, and I want to say how much I agree with what both Mr Brok and Mr Hänsch have said. Both have been Members of this House for a long time, so the slight differences of opinion that remain between them despite their intensive cooperation in the Convention can be overcome, and, should they be in need of conciliation, they will find plenty of members of our group ready and available.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">There is one goal in Europe towards which we must strive. We have one goal in common, and we want to reach it together. Those who talk in terms of a ‘core Europe’ basically want to revert to intergovernmental cooperation, and I can tell you that our group will not stand for it; we will counter it with determined resistance. Where there is a will there is a way ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... and we need to respect each other; more than anything else, we need to trust each other. We have confidence in you, Mr President-in-Office, in your government, in your Taoiseach, in the President of the European Council, in your foreign minister, in you personally and in Commissioner Barnier too – that is all I want to say about the Commission today – and, if we take this path together ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... and with determination, defending the Community of Europe, then, I am convinced, we will eventually be successful.</p>

<p class="contents">The universal Spanish poet, Antonio Machado, said in a very famous poem: <span class="italic">‘Walker there is no path, you make the path as you go’;</span> and you have begun to walk, prudently but firmly, and I believe that Parliament should appreciate this.</p>
<p class="contents">You are opening up the path and overcoming a very dramatic situation of deadlock, of stagnation, in Europe. We have heard the report from our representatives in the IGC, Mr Hänsch and Mr Brok, and what both of them tell us is that it appears the atmosphere has changed. I believe that Irish hospitality is playing a positive role in this and it is very significant that the atmosphere has changed for the better; and I even welcome the very positive words of Mr Poettering, who I am sure has spoken on behalf of at least three-quarters of his group. I imagine that the British Conservatives will not be happy, but I believe that there is clear convergence between us ... Well, on behalf of 80%, I admit.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a first important question which has not yet been resolved – and I believe that the Italian Presidency has not communicated a single document in this respect – which is the status of the modifications to the text of the Convention at the Brussels Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Having heard the Irish Presidency and having studied these modifications in Parliament, I believe that further work has been done on the text of the Convention, that is to say, there has been no consolidation of these texts, and that is important in terms of assessing the backward movements which have taken place. We must, moreover, begin working in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe we must stress that a number of countries that were very critical at the Brussels Summit – and I include my own, Spain, together with Poland, Germany and France, amongst others – have publicly expressed by means of their ministers their will to reach an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the two-speed Europe, I am going to say something very fundamental: the problem is not so much that there are two speeds, but rather how to persuade those who are applying the brakes every day to stop doing so. I believe that that is the crux of the issue at the moment, that is to say, we cannot make progress if there are a number of countries which are applying the brakes entirely. I believe that would be a good start.</p>
<p class="contents">It is absolutely clear that we must try to prevent a second failure in the Intergovernmental Conference, but also, looking at it positively, it is very important that we are able to face our responsibilities. Why? Because the Convention, with the participation of the new Member States and with the participation of some countries still in negotiations, produced a text, and we must offer the electorate – whom we are going to consult very shortly – a result of our work which allows the Union to work and operate more democratically and more efficiently. That is the responsibility which we share and, therefore, with a view to the elections, we must be able to take that position.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, add further elements to this year’s timetable. Firstly, there will be a new Parliament and new Commission, and we cannot now deny them the right to propose the modifications they consider appropriate as well. The issue is not whether the next Presidency does it better, but that we may find ourselves in the situation of having to start from the beginning again, with the new Parliament and the new Commission. That is an important point.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also dealing with important international decisions which will affect the European Union over the coming months: the reform of the United Nations, to which we Europeans are directly committed – tomorrow we will receive its Secretary-General – the situation in Iraq, the situation in the Middle East, and the European Union's international policy and responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, while not making any threats or accusations, it is clear that we must tackle and debate, jointly and immediately, because they are in the timetable, the updating of the Lisbon strategy and of the financial perspectives, in other words, the economic dimension and solidarity within our Union, and we must try to do so constructively. It is unthinkable that we should make progress on the economic dimension and not do so on the political dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore extremely urgent – and I welcome the Irish Presidency’s will – that we act in a positive and proactive manner.</p>

I trust that it will be possible to reach agreement before 1 May. There are, however, three sets of problematical questions outstanding: the formula for qualified majority voting, the size and shape of the Commission and the scope of QMV. It would be unfortunate if our obsession with those first two great patriotic questions obscured the third – the scope of QMV – which is in some ways more important.</p>
<p class="contents">The Italian presidency, mainly under pressure from Prime Minister Blair, unfortunately retreated in several ways from the Convention's modest and balanced proposals to extend the scope of QMV and codecision with the Parliament. The Italian so-called 'final compromise package' is not acceptable to the Liberal Group – nor, I suspect, to a majority of this Parliament. Especially objectionable would be a flight from QMV concerning the provisions on social security for migrant workers; the suppression of codecision from the clauses on the framework programme for research and development; the re-insertion of the national veto and the suspension of the legislative rights of this Parliament in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters; and the unwelcome supplement to the progressive <span class="italic">passerelle</span> clauses of a right of veto for any single national parliament – a certain recipe for frustrating the decisions of the European Council and for bringing on the ultimate sclerosis of the European political system.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish presidency is quite correct in saying that all Member States must move for the IGC to be able to succeed and none more so than the British Prime Minister, whichever personality that might prove to be.</p>

We know how the will of states is measured: it is decided by parliaments. That is not necessarily the same thing as the will of the people. If the Constitution is to be decided upon nationally, the large majority of our group think the will of the people should be measured by means of a referendum in all Member States. Those countries which adopt the Constitution will establish a new Union. The intention is to continue the work of the old Union. Under the Constitution the present Union will be suspended. This must be a unanimous decision under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties between States. If a country is in disagreement, that is its legal right. If the Union that many countries joined after a referendum is suspended, a referendum will also have to be organised regarding accession to the new Union in as many Member States as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Constitution has been virtually finalised at an intergovernmental conference. The articles on military matters, among which there is a new model for structural cooperation, were agreed at Naples. These are not just about defence: a special additional protocol in it also provides for any demanding military operations that may be referred to as ‘peacemaking’, and which therefore also include invasion. In fact the EU is not now preparing for defence, but attack. Our group does not think this kind of militarisation of the EU is necessary. Neither should the involvement of NATO be written into the Constitution as has now been done. What still needs to be written into the Constitution is the rule that EU crisis management must be based on a mandate from the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group is prepared to participate in structural work in a social Europe. The draft Constitution, however, is not satisfactory in this area. We want to make changes to it to safeguard the provision of services to all EU citizens. We need social security and not European militarism. Our group thus wants a social Europe but there have not been any satisfactory decisions taken by the Convention or the IGC in that area as far as we are concerned. We do not think it appropriate that the Constitution was drafted in conjunction with talks on the EU’s new financial perspective. Member States cannot be forced to accept a constitution which their citizens cannot agree to. We need referenda. Ninety-six members of the Convention called for a referendum. They represented both the yes and the no vote in future referenda. Referenda are people’s democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Intergovernmental Conference has, however, stalled on this issue and it is clear that the decision-making method which allows the veto is the real cancer of the European Union, it is that which is killing Community solidarity of any kind.</p>
<p class="contents">For the majority of my group, the text adopted by the Convention represented – or represents – a step forward, but certainly not a revolution. I am sure that there is a substantially large majority on that point in Parliament, but it seems to me that, in the words of the Presidency and in our debate, there is a fundamental ambiguity. We are all optimistic and hopeful, we are encouraging the Irish Presidency to do its best, but what is it that we are encouraging it to do? We are even turning down any parliamentary initiative that might upset the Presidency, we are deciding not to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Spinelli, of the formal adoption of the Convention. I repeat, what is it we are encouraging it to do?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hänsch, if democratisation is a criterion of your assessment, then we cannot accept the results of Naples for the simple fact that the results of Naples represent, in the majority of their proposals, a backward step with regard to the Convention and, in certain cases, in particular where the budget is concerned and even as regards the current situation. How can you, as our representative, accept such a thing? It is not possible! It smacks of ambiguity, it is a contradiction in terms! In my view, therefore, we really cannot be content with talking about whether the glass is half empty or half full. With regard to the five or six points on which agreement was more or less reached in Naples, I should like to hear what the Irish Presidency has to say. I should like to know what it will do and on what it will try to reach an agreement: on the text of the Convention or on what, Mr President, you have today defined as a good basis? From what you said at the beginning of your Presidency, I gained the impression that the 82 points did not exist. So then: do they or do they not exist? Are they or are they not a basis? Frankly, I have not understood, and it seems dangerous to me that our two representatives take the view that this is a good basis for negotiation, because actually it is not, and this is not Parliament’s position.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a quick point: frankly, it seems to me, once again, that the ideal way that we can help the Irish Presidency is to mobilise Members and public opinion around a project for democracy. If we again decide to leave everything to the Intergovernmental Conference, in March and in May, we will end up with a project worse than that put forward in Naples. I therefore call on Members, on the various parliamentary groups, which are in the majority compared to my group, to insist on the idea of meetings, to insist on the idea of a major parliamentary initiative in the month of May, so as to stand by and assist the Irish Presidency, not leave it alone with its colleagues who, by themselves, will not make a better Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am glad to learn that at the meeting of the foreign ministers this week, there was a constructive exchange of views with regard to the need for the new treaty. Clearly the events of the Brussels summit of EU leaders last December are now well behind us. There is a strong, growing realisation that we must re-invigorate the process to put in place a new European Union treaty, and delay and prevarication, recrimination and confrontation do nothing whatsoever to move this political process forward.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I welcome the fact that the President-in-Office of the Council, our Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, is holding an extensive round of bilateral negotiations with European Union leaders at this particular time. This week already he has been in Madrid at a meeting with the Spanish Prime Minster. Towards the end of this week he is to meet the Polish Prime Minster. We will all be in a stronger position to make a judgment on the state of the negotiations to put in place a new European Union treaty when the Taoiseach gives a report of his bilateral discussions to the Council meeting of European Union leaders in March.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know what the bottom line issues are. They are not a secret. One of the clear benefits of the EU Convention process is that we have a draft treaty that forms a basis for the present discussions. However, we need some European Union governments to move away from seemingly entrenched political positions. That is essential. A new treaty cannot be agreed unless some political flexibility enters the political process. We should all remember that we have a lot to be proud of in Europe at the moment and that the impasse relating to the finalising of a new European Union treaty should not detract from that. We are all looking forward to ten countries acceding to the Union on 1 May 2004. This historic event will herald an end to the artificial divide that existed in Europe since the end of World War II.

Either Mr Miller is a follower of Father Ubu, which would not be at all surprising for a Pole, or, more probably, this statement indicated that Mr Miller had concluded that, as this text would not in fact get us anywhere, there was not any point in delaying its adoption for much longer. Because, my dear Commissioner Barnier, the debate is not between ‘procrastination’ and ‘Never-Never’, but between ‘somewhere’ and ‘nowhere’, and nowhere is exactly where this draft constitution is taking us.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, the European institutions, the Commission and Parliament combined, are clinging to this supposed constitution as if it is their last hope, while their policies, particularly this year, have clearly failed, and while public opinion is generally disenchanted, if we believe the latest Euro-barometer, which I think is enlightening on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, the only policies that are working at European level are those that are made outside of any institutional framework, as we saw with the joint approach by the French, German and British foreign ministers in Iran or as we are seeing with what we at least hope are the first steps of European defence, by the same three countries which have been able to break free of all institutional suggestions, all ministers and all commissioners wearing two or three hats.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be a constitution, because the European machine cannot be allowed to fail, as you have all said. There will therefore be a constitution or something of that name. However, if it is a democracy, and in my mind a constitution is the privilege of a democracy, as Mr Poettering often says, a European democracy can only be established in one way, perhaps with the risks that it carries: through a referendum. If a referendum is not announced – and I regret that Parliament’s text, as usual, avoids this issue – Mr Poettering and others can be sure that the electorate, in June, will show you what they think of your supposed democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We reject this idea for two reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the period gained through the deadlock in the negotiations would be better used for further discussion on this constitution. The deadlock point, which is the formula for the double majority vote, is not an insignificant one. In fact, it was crucial for national sovereignty, as were many other provisions of this draft. The chair of the delegation from the French National Assembly to the European Union, which supports this text, has acknowledged that, with regard to the double majority, and I quote: ‘from a national point of view, nevertheless our country had as much interest in the status quo as Spain and Poland ‘. I think that the negotiators should consider this admission as a warning.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are hearing statements here and there about the negotiations possibly coming to an end just before the European elections. In this respect, I would like to warn those who, once again, wish to catch the citizens off guard. It appears that some people would like there to be an agreement just before the elections in order to shorten the debate and then be able to cite the election result, if it is sufficiently in favour of the federalist parties, in order to avoid a referendum on the constitution. This would be an illegal manoeuvre, as the European elections are meant to elect representatives to the European Parliament to deal with a very wide range of subjects, but not the possible constitution, to which different methods of decision-making would apply.</p>
<p class="contents">We will fight any attempt to violate the law. I also hope, Mr President, that this debate will retain a minimum standard of honesty and dignity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is the aim of the resolution that we are putting forward, which should be seen as an extremely strong political signal. Imagine that in our respective national parliaments the four main parties in our countries tabled a joint resolution. That would cause a stir. Why is there this level of consensus? It is because we all agree that we need to bring the enlargement and the deepening of the Union into step with each other. The number of players is going to change, the playing field is changing, therefore the rules have to change.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this resolution should be seen as something helpful, an encouragement, a stimulus. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that it is extremely moderate. On the one hand, it proposes that you use the Convention draft as a basis – in this respect, we hope that you will not move too far away from it – and on the other hand, it proposes, significantly, the date of 1 May and not 9 May. After that we will have a last sitting in Parliament from 3 to 6 May.

I want to explain the reasons why: immediately afterwards the electoral campaign will begin and, before it begins, the Constitution must have been finalised, first and foremost so as to get the electors to go out and vote – otherwise they will be deluded and will not vote – and therefore submit it to their judgment, which is our democratic duty, our basic law. For the sake of clarity may I add, taking up the points made by Mr Duff and Mrs Frassoni, that for us the draft Constitution is the only thing on the table. The eighty-two points referred to by the former Italian President-in-Office of the Council, or the 45 amendments now being referred to, have been examined closely by us: they contain many points which are confusing and ambiguous and take many steps backwards. There is no consensus on them – at least not in the European Parliament – and I ask you, Mr President, to give that serious consideration.</p>

In particular, if this cannot be done, I would suggest, as an alternative, that more time be given to old people and pensioners. How? Given that the President of the Council, Mr Berlusconi, appears to have grown ten years younger – as a result of plastic surgery, it is said – I would ask that all pensioners and old people in Europe be allowed to go down the same route, at the State’s expense, so that they can also become ten years younger and have time to wait for the European Council to eventually give us the Constitution.</p>

That is worrying, not only in anticipation of the turn-out at the forthcoming parliamentary election, but also because there is a danger of confidence in the entire European project being undermined. 2004 will therefore need to be a very successful year, as it potentially can be, given the impending historic enlargement and unification of Europe. It is interesting to observe that the Norwegian Social Democratic politician, Thorbjørn Jagland, has nominated the EU for the Nobel Peace Prize. A Norwegian, please note.</p>
<p class="contents">If this enlarged Europe is to work, irrespective of whether or not we receive the Nobel Prize, there must be clear rules and an orderly way of doing things. That is why a Constitution needs to be adopted, and it is only fair that people also have their say about such a Constitution in conjunction with the parliamentary election. It is unacceptable for certain countries not to wish to accept these rules but, instead, to want to proceed off their own bat.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you can no doubt feel how much good will is directed towards you in this House.

These words do not apply in this case, however, because, although they tried, the matter has not been washed away.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of the Intergovernmental Conference, the draft Constitution produced by the Convention is still on the table, amongst other things because of the impetus given by this House and words such as those spoken by its President, Mr Cox, last Monday in Madrid, demanding that the IGC finish its work and finish it properly, in time – in other words – for the European elections and – why not? – before the end of this legislature. Well, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Irish Presidency to support, and place its confidence in, the process; but also to demand that work be done, – and, moreover, be done publicly and transparently – on the draft Convention and not on mysterious compromises and shady deals that are incomprehensible or that amount to retrograde steps. Bilateral contacts may be useful, but the IGC is a body which must act jointly, debate and reach agreements on a final consensus.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this particular case, where there is a political will, a way can be found. That is the reality as far as this constitutional treaty is concerned. Members are aware, as I am, that the prize to be won in this debate, a constitutional treaty which is lucid and clear, even visionary, involving all the people of Europe, is a formidable prize. The European people and the governments of the Member States in working together have indeed shown that Europe is capable of doing formidable things. A huge amount of work has already been done and the Irish presidency is fully aware of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Many Members have asked about the particular text and its starting point. The reality of all negotiations is that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. We are working day and night to bring about the political will.</p>
<p class="contents">On a humorous note, Mr Fatuzzo pointed out that we are all getting older. Indeed, he is quite right: none of us are getting any younger. He also suggested that we should offer plastic surgery to old-age pensioners. As you know Mr President, Ireland is very famous for non-cash benefits to our OAPs – free travel, free television, free phone, free electricity and so on. We have not yet given consideration to free plastic surgery, but Mr Fatuzzo's point is well taken.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very grateful to this House for its good wishes. They will be of great assistance to the presidency in encouraging the leaders of governments who have difficulties in this matter to take those few extra steps. The prize is a formidable one, it would be marvellous if we could attain it sooner rather than later. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But that is the price of collegiality.</p>
<p class="contents">I endorse everything that Mr Barnier said in his speech. I would just like to clarify the Commission’s position. We consider the basis on which to work to be the Convention text and we think that on certain points, the Naples text clarified the Convention text. While remaining faithful to the Convention’s proposals, we can draw out positive trends on which we need to work. However, certain aspects of the Naples text, and above all some of the bilateral negotiations that took place between Naples and the European Council in Brussels, reveal retrograde steps in very sensitive areas, such as budgetary powers or the scope of application of the qualified majority. These steps back do not deserve any support from the Commission and we do not in any way consider them to be a negotiable result. Indeed, as Mr Roche said, nothing is agreed until the whole thing has been agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also parallel initiatives, however, that have been taken following Naples that deserve our agreement. I will take the example of the agreement on defence. Defence is a fundamental point and one of the major areas of development for the future of the EU. The Commission welcomes the agreement that was achieved on defence at the Intergovernmental Conference, including the content of the protocol that was discussed following the conclave in Naples.</p>
<p class="contents">The example of defence is a very good one. It is not about building a two-speed Europe on the basis of the agreement on defence. The agreement reached in such a sensitive area as defence shows that we need to incorporate this agreement into the constitution as a whole and ensure an overall agreement on the constitution, including the defence dimension. This is why we will continue to support the efforts of the Irish Presidency to secure an agreement on the European Constitution as quickly as possible and with as little delay as possible.</p>
