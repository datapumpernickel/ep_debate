<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Haarder,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> I have the honour, on behalf of the Presidency of the Council, to present the 2003 draft budget of the European Communities, prepared by the Council on 22 July.</p>
<p class="contents">Both as Minister for European Affairs and former Member of the European Parliament, I am very pleased to note that the budget procedure for 2003 has so far been characterised by sound cooperation between the Council and the European Parliament. In the draft budget I am about to present, account has already been taken of a series of agreements and common understandings resulting from the consultation meeting between the Council and Parliament on 19 July 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">During the preparatory three-way discussion and consultation meeting in July, some single-minded work was done by the Danish Finance Minister, Thor Pedersen, Committee Chairman Terry Wynn and your fellow MEPs in the committee. I am certain that this work has created a sound basis for the budget authority’s two branches being able to reach agreement on a satisfactory budget for 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that some MEPs have previously been disappointed about the fact that the European Parliament and the Council have had difficulty reaching agreement, but that has not been the case this year, which is something I am very pleased about.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall presently touch upon a number of challenges which have already been debated by the European Parliament and the Council and in connection with which agreements and common understandings have been reached. I shall then provide a general survey of the main features of the draft budget prepared by the Council on 22 July.</p>
<p class="contents">I should first like, however, to refer to the debate we have just had in connection with the tragic floods. We are all agreed that this new challenge requires prompt action to be taken. It is heartening that the individual Member States have already, on their own initiative, been contributing to the reconstruction. At the same time, the Commission has implemented a series of initiatives, which have just been discussed, and the Council is now to debate what further measures can be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now return to the results of the meeting of Parliament and the Council on 19 July.</p>
<p class="contents">- A common understanding and agreement were reached to the effect that the administrative preparation for enlargement is a key priority which the institutions must be given the opportunity to discuss from now on and right through 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">- A common understanding was reached to the effect that work must be done on securing funding for the common foreign and security policy in the light of important new tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">- A common understanding was also reached to the effect that the restructuring of the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets should be financed and that the growth rate for the global appropriations for payments should be kept as low as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me firstly to say a few words about the administrative expenditure for 2003. The agreement reached by the two branches of the budget authority in July is a sound one.</p>
<p class="contents">- The Council and the European Parliament acknowledge that the institutions must prepare themselves for enlargement of the EU in 2003. This will involve additional administrative expenditure. For example, there will be need for more staff and more space. By means of the agreement entered into, we have attached importance to securing funding for the pre-enlargement measures that are necessary for the individual institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">- At the same time, there is agreement that the ceiling for the administrative expenditure in 2003 should be retained. The flexibility instrument must not be used.</p>
<p class="contents">- The two branches of the budget authority have agreed that, in particular, pre-enlargement expenditure intended to be applied in 2003 may, as far as is possible, be applied as early as this year. This will make it easier for the institutions to prepare for enlargement. For the moment, the purpose of this frontloading exercise is to finance the publication of the Community’s body of laws in the languages of the new Member States. In this connection, there will, among other things, be a need to adopt an additional supplementary and amending budget for 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">- By means of an agreement reached as early as in July, the institutions will acquire the best possible basis for planning as they prepare for enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement will secure a calmer atmosphere surrounding both the European Parliament’s and the Council’s budgets for 2003. Moreover, it is a good thing that we are agreed about following up the opportunities for increased interinstitutional cooperation indicated by the secretaries-general of the institutions in a series or reports. A solution has also been found to the issue of the early retirement of employees of the European Parliament’s political groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Both Parliament and the Council accord high priority to the EU’s participation in external actions, that is to say the common foreign and security policy. The European Union should have adequate resources for being able at any time to carry out the tasks consequent upon our position in the international community. As I am quite sure MEPs agree, it is a question of the EU’s credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">At the consultation meeting in July, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed that, when required by the circumstances, the emergency aid reserve for humanitarian aid may also be used for civil crisis management. It was also agreed that an attempt should be made to enter into an agreement concerning the appropriations to the common foreign and security policy. This must happen as part of an overall agreement concerning the 2003 budget. We must secure the appropriations to the CFSP in 2003 in the light of new and essential tasks. We also concur about seeking an agreement concerning how best to involve Parliament in CFSP arrangements within the framework of the Treaty. It is heartening that such good results have already been achieved in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">In its draft budget, the Commission has set aside an amount of EUR 40 million to the CFSP. In this way, preparation has been made for taking over the policing mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Council welcomes this appropriation but believes that the overall appropriations are inadequate. The Council therefore proposes a total appropriation for the common foreign and security policy of EUR 47.5 million for 2003. Above and beyond the policing mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Council foresees, for example, measures involving specialist assistance to third countries in the fight against terrorism. Moreover, there is a need for more appropriations for non-proliferation and disarmament measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope we can reach agreement on something corresponding to the Council’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall touch briefly upon the Commission’s proposal to use the flexibility instrument for providing funding to the tune of EUR 27 million for restructuring the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets. In this area, both the European Parliament and the Council have undertaken to find a solution before the close of the budget procedure. In the Council’s view, the flexibility instrument should only be used in extraordinary circumstances. On the issue of providing EUR 27 million by way of funding, the Council believes that all possible methods of funding should be investigated before consideration is given to the Commission’s proposal to use the flexibility instrument for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a couple of words about the growth rate for the global appropriations for payments. In this connection, I am pleased that Parliament agrees about the need to exercise budget discipline and sound financial management. During the consultation in July, Parliament declared that the growth rate for the global appropriations for payments should be kept as low as possible. At the same time, account must be taken of the Council’s first reading of the 2003 budget. As politicians, all of us in this Assembly are well aware that significant refunds to the Member States of unused EU funds present the public with a poor picture of the EU. We must show the surrounding world that we are in a position to engage in realistic budgeting.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council would like to request the Commission to state the anticipated surplus for 2002 so that this can be factored into the 2003 budget via a letter of amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to go on to mention a number of key features of the Council’s draft budget.</p>
<p class="contents">– The global appropriations for commitments amount to EUR 99 548 million, which constitutes an increase of scarcely 0.9% on the 2002 figure. Special account has been taken of the possibility of the appropriations in actual fact having been used up.</p>
<p class="contents">– The global appropriations for payments amount to EUR 96 992 million, which constitutes an increase of 1.4% on the 2002 figure. This low growth rate must be seen in the light of the limited use of appropriations for payments in preceding years.</p>
<p class="contents">The first reading of the 2003 draft budget took place:</p>
<p class="contents">– with due account being taken of the interinstitutional agreement of 6 May 1999 on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure</p>
<p class="contents">– within the framework of the Council’s conclusions of 5 March 2002 concerning the budgetary guidelines for 2003, and</p>
<p class="contents">– with account being taken of the conclusions from the consultation meeting of 19 July 2002 between Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Particular care was taken</p>
<p class="contents">– to maintain the annual expenditure ceilings established in the financial perspectives for 2000-2006</p>
<p class="contents">– if possible, to leave adequate margins below the ceilings for the various areas of expenditure, except in the case of the categories relating to Structural Funds and pre-accession aid, in which the ceilings include expenditure targets</p>
<p class="contents">– to set adequate funds aside for the EU’s various priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise a couple of the main points in the Council draft budget within the various areas of expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to agriculture, the Council proposes an adjustment downwards of EUR 288 million. Experience has shown that the appropriations for the common agricultural policy have often been set too high. The Commission is now being given the opportunity to re-evaluate its estimate in connection with the autumn letter of amendment. Due account can be taken in this context of the latest information concerning, for example, market conditions and the changing rate of exchange of the dollar. In this connection, the Council joins with Parliament in noting that the Commission will also look more closely into whether the amount it has proposed for eradicating animal diseases is adequate. When it comes to the appropriations for the development of rural districts, the Council has accepted the Commission’s preliminary draft budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Where structural arrangements are concerned, the appropriations for commitments have been fully charged to the budget. This has happened in accordance with the conclusions from the European Council meeting in March 1999 in Berlin. The Council has accepted the Commission’s proposals almost in their entirety. There has nonetheless been a downwards adjustment of EUR 525 million in the appropriations to the Structural Funds in the light of previous years’ underutilisation of the appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">Where the internal policies are concerned, the Council has accepted the amounts about which agreement was reached in connection with already adopted multiannual programmes. In the case of programmes under discussion, the Council has adjusted the appropriations so that they reflect the Council’s common position or the result of the discussions in the Council. These downward adjustments do not affect projects in connection with regions bordering on the candidate countries. Allow me also just to mention that the Council has slightly increased the appropriations for funding the special Olympic Games in Europe in 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">A margin of EUR 122 million has been left under the ceiling for expenditure area 3, enabling the European Parliament to fund various priorities, at the same time as making it possible to cover future needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Where expenditure area 4 – external policies – is concerned, the Council has accepted the appropriations in the Commission’s draft budget almost in their entirety. It is important, for example, to finance the efforts in Afghanistan. Under expenditure area 4, the Council has agreed to accept the appropriations to international fisheries agreements proposed by the Commission. I have already mentioned the Council decision concerning the budget for the CFSP.</p>
<p class="contents">A margin of EUR 80 million under the ceiling for expenditure area 4 has been left, enabling the European Parliament to fund various priorities, at the same time as making it possible also to cover future needs.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already mentioned the administrative expenditure under category 5.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude my report on the various expenditure areas with expenditure area 7, relating to pre-accession aid. The Council draft budget makes no changes to the Commission’s proposals concerning the appropriations for commitments. The appropriations for payments have, however, been adjusted downwards by EUR 300 million. This must be seen in the light of the preceding years’ underutilisation of the appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, I am pleased to be able to state that the Council draft budget for 2003 contains sufficient funds to cover the EU’s various priorities, as well as taking account of the agreements and common understandings we reached at the first consultation meeting in July.</p>
<p class="contents">You all know that this budget procedure is only just beginning and that there is still a way to go before the final adoption of the 2003 budget. The prior conditions are present for our being able to obtain a satisfactory budget by the end of the year. The draft budget prepared by the Council offers a sound basis for this. The agreements and common understandings we reached at the meeting on 19 July are a positive sign that we have the will to reach agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would point out that I am certain that all three institutions present here today will do their best to contribute to a careful prioritisation so that the challenges of next year can be met. I am also certain that we shall not forget that, in the last analysis, the EU budget is funded by the citizens of Europe. That is why budgeting must be realistic and responsible – for next year too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, honourable Members. The previous debate on aid in the event of natural disasters clearly demonstrated what people's expectations of the European budget are. But if we look at the real national quotas, i.e. the ratio between the European budget and the European national product, then the picture looks slightly different. It is almost the reverse, because the national quotas account for just over one per cent.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposed 1.03% of the European national product for the 2003 budget. The Council cut this back slightly. According to the financial perspective, i.e. the financial forecasts we have all agreed on, it should in fact be 1.08%. I think this should in fact be taken as a guideline, even though I am in favour of keeping certain reserves back for contingencies, just to be on the safe side.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has now made across-the-board reductions, for example in the agricultural sector, but has disregarded the fact that we need to revalue in order to take account of the current value of the dollar. But we are agreed that a new presentation of the necessary agricultural expenditure needs to be made in the autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has accepted a great many of the Commission's estimates for the draft 2003 budget. We welcome that. We also generally welcome the fact that a consensus has been reached in the foreign policy area and that the so-called emergency reserve can also be used to fund civil crisis management. I think that this should give us more chance to react quickly to crises and that this is an important step on the road towards a clear, efficient common foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I must also seriously criticise the outcome of the Council reading. For example, the question of how funds to restructure the fisheries fleet in Spain and Portugal or measures needed to support sustainable fisheries reforms shall be financed has still not been answered.</p>
<p class="contents">This question was broached but then put on the back burner. And the Council has reduced funds to cofinance the trans-European transport and energy network by 15 million. Member States already have high hopes in precisely this sector, which will now be discussed in connection with natural disasters. I think this reduction should also be reversed.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also heavily criticise the Council decision on personnel expenditure, i.e. its approach to the personnel costs of the individual institutions. The financial perspective allowed a 3.6% increase for all the institutions. And yet the Council has awarded itself a much higher increase. Taking personnel costs alone, the Council has awarded itself a twofold increase. And if you add in all the Council's administrative expenditure, the Council has awarded itself an 11% increase. I must state quite clearly here, to paraphrase the words used with such gusto by the Ecofin Council, the Council of Finance Ministers, on another occasion: this Council decision on its own administrative resources does not fit into the budgetary landscape. It has helped itself, at the cost of others, to be precise at the cost of the Commission, where the Council has suggested swingeing cuts. Obviously, the Commission's administrative expenses for the year 2003 will be very high, because this is the year we shall be preparing for the biggest enlargement in the history of the European Union and the Commission will need to start preparations in 2003 so that we can control new members right from the start. For example, we shall need to control how environmental laws are being transposed, if competition rules are being complied with, what the situation is in the food law sector or the veterinary sector and whether European Union legislation is also being implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">These are just some examples of the Commission's work. Obviously, there is no point in starting to negotiate structural assistance or agricultural aid programmes with new members once they have already joined. Preparations need to start now and that takes staff. The Council has allowed itself 236 new posts in order to prepare for enlargement. By contrast, it has questioned and reduced the funding of current posts at the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament drafted a model here which was then enshrined in an agreement. This model requires efforts to be made to frontload certain administrative expenses in 2002, so as to have funds available for Commission staff costs in order to prepare for enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">That only works, however, if all the institutions consider the model binding. I must therefore insist on the Commission's behalf that we take stock in October in order to ascertain whether this frontloading model is working or, if it is not, whether new decisions need to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement needs to be prepared so that it works right from the start. The Commission is counting on the European Parliament, it is confident that the European Parliament will not state that it is satisfied with the resolution passed in July alone and will check to ensure the Council is also making an effort to implement this frontloading model. I repeat, the Commission needs personnel resources in order to prepare for enlargement. Otherwise we cannot guarantee that the work needed to make a success of enlargement will be carried out from the start.</p>

He knows he is always welcome in this House. Please send our regards to Mr Pedersen; it was good working with him.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to go into detail on many of the issues because I will leave that to both rapporteurs, who have mentioned several items. I would like to concentrate on one or two specific political issues. One concerns the agreement that was reached at conciliation on Category 5. Whilst it left the Council very happy, we in Parliament realised that we had probably made an enemy of the Commission by agreeing to that deal. But let me reiterate why we did so. We were convinced that in no way, shape or form would the Council ever agree to the flexibility instrument being used for Category 5. Therefore we agreed to a deal that would bring benefits for Parliament and the other institutions and a sensible approach to Category 5, not as the Commission wanted.</p>
<p class="contents">The things we have proposed about frontloading, the use of <span class="italic">ramassage</span> and so on are there to ease the pain of the Commission. We know the Commission is going to suffer but we are trying to ease the situation slightly. If there are problems with enlargement because of what has occurred, then the Commission needs to convince the Council, not us, of its needs regarding staffing levels, because some of us are actually convinced.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, we cannot be criticised for the help we have given the Commission in its staffing needs over the last two years. Against the wishes of the Council, we have helped the Commission to increase its establishment plans by several hundred members of staff. So any criticism can only apply to next year. Please bear in mind that we have stood side by side with the Commission. This is an attempt to make the reform a success and to ensure that the Commission has the right people to do the jobs that we expect it to do. I say that because the deal was quite unique. However, Mr Stenmarck and Mr Färm on our committee now have to determine what will constitute the global <span class="italic">ramassage </span>for this year. That is the task of both our rapporteurs, certainly Mr Stenmarck, who will look at the other institutions to see what money there is left over in their budgets to be put into the pot to ensure that the Commission is not disadvantaged to any great extent. We are aware that what we can find this year will be acceptable, but this leaves the problem of staffing next year, so whatever we can save for next year's budget we will.</p>
<p class="contents">My other political point concerns the common foreign and security policy. The President-in-Office mentioned it in his speech. Let us be clear on our position. We did not make an agreement on what the amounts are for the CFSP. The amount in this year's budget was EUR 30 million; the amount in the PDB was EUR 40 million and the amount entered in the Council's first reading is EUR 47.5 million. We made no agreements on that and, as far as we are concerned, we stick by Article 39 of the Interinstitutional Agreement. That figure as it stands right now should be EUR 30 million. That is not to say that, come our second reading, the figure may well be EUR 47.5 million but, for the sake of this debate and to clarify issues, our argument is that the Council put the wrong figure in: it should be EUR 30 million. There may be a legal interpretation as to when that disagreement was confirmed but, as far as we are concerned, it was confirmed at the conciliation meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that there are problems in other categories also. In Category 2, the EUR 27 million entered for the restructuring of the fleet is not going to appear by magic. We must be serious when we say we must find a way of solving that. It would seem that the only way we can do so is by using the flexibility instrument. The Council may have to have a rethink on that unless it comes forward with a better idea which we have not yet thought of.</p>
<p class="contents">That is all I want to say on the political aspects. I will leave the rest to the rapporteurs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Just as Mr Wynn said, we really appreciated the constructive attitude we encountered at the July conciliation when, for the first time in many years, we in actual fact produced an agreement of genuine substance.</p>
<p class="contents">Why, then, did we come to this agreement where category 5 is concerned? Mr Wynn touched upon this. We were subjected to strong pressure from the Member States and the Council and finally decided to agree to the flexibility instrument’s not being used. There was one further reason, however, for we believe we must make the fullest possible use of all the available means for rationalising and prioritising what we do, moving resources about, increasing efficiency and creating modern management in the European Union too. We must use the opportunities to the full, especially when we face so incredibly important a task as enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">I nonetheless share the Commission’s view when it comes to a rather longer perspective. It would be difficult in the long term to impose a lot of major new tasks upon the Commission without also providing the necessary resources in terms of staff and administrative resources. This will probably become a source of conflict in the future, but I believe it was necessary this year to do things in the way we have.</p>
<p class="contents">How does the general budget situation look prior to the autumn budget procedure? Above all, we must discuss what Parliament has been calling attention to for quite a few years, namely the poor implementation in many areas. Every year, the budget allocates major resources which are subsequently not used. Mr Haarder drew attention to this July’s agreement to the effect that we must not increase the payments more than is necessary, and he even wants us to leave margins. The problem, however, is that, through the commitments made in the budget, we have also decided upon a certain level of ambition to which we must try to rise. That must also be a goal for the Member States and the Council. The finance ministers cannot just sit and applaud when they are given back money that has not been used. We have a political responsibility actually to realise the ambitions and implement the programmes we have decided upon in the European Union. That is why Parliament repeatedly increases the payments. We wish to signal that more must be done, and we must invest greater resources in order actually to fulfil the promises made.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we shall be conducting a debate along these lines in Parliament this year too. It is not, however, certain that it is enough just to increase the payments, and we have had certain examples of its not being so. Sometimes, increased payments do not after all lead to the Commission’s being able to use those resources. As I have already mentioned, we must therefore discuss the Commission’s staff resources in a slightly longer term perspective. We must also perhaps begin to discuss cutting back on our commitments. In certain areas, where we see the Commission not at all implementing what we have demanded, we must perhaps even begin to discuss whether we should cut down on staff or, at least, hold them in reserve. In the long run, staff resources intended for commitments of a certain level cannot be maintained when such commitments are not being met.</p>
<p class="contents">This problem of payments and implementation also looms very large when it comes to foreign policy and aid policy. Year after year, we have seen how the Council has acquired more ambitions. In 2000, Kosovo was added to the list, and there was subsequently a slight loss of interest in fulfilling the earlier promises concerning Africa and Latin America. In 2001, Serbia was the new concern, whereupon there was slightly less interest in the former priorities. New concerns for 2002 included the Global Health Fund. This year, we are discussing Afghanistan, the Middle East and the police force for Bosnia.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, we cannot add new tasks every year and simply forget the old ones. There is a limit beyond which further resources must be provided if all our priorities are to be met. This year, we shall have a lot of difficulty meeting our priorities where the Global Health Fund is concerned. There are already huge cut-backs in the budget in connection with Kosovo, humanitarian aid etc. That is unsustainable in the long term. If new priorities are to be added each year, further resources must also be provided.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me finally to say a few words about simplification. We have studied Structural Funds and a series of different political programmes. I have travelled around – most recently in Finland, for example – and learned that regional organisations and universities etc are giving up applying for funds from the EU budget because the process is so terribly involved. That, I believe, is one reason why EU money is not in actual fact being spent. It is time to take this state of affairs seriously. Within the EU, we must sit down and go through our methods, documents and bureaucracy so that the process is made a little simpler for all those who need to use EU resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I believe these are some of the most important aspects we shall be continuing to discuss in Parliament, in the Committee on Budgets and in future budget debates. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ever since early last winter, when we began work on the 2003 budget, my objective, as rapporteur and as a person responsible for next year’s budgets for eight of the EU institutions, has at any rate been to find a solution in which the EU’s administrative budget is balanced and in which we do not have to ask for extra money by making use of what is known as the flexibility instrument. That has not been an easy task because we had predicted a very large deficit in this budget at the beginning of the year. With the agreement made on 19 July by the EU’s two budget authorities – the Council and Parliament – it has nonetheless proved to be possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would maintain that our having now achieved this objective is a very great success for Parliament. We have obtained support for reforms that are necessary, especially in an enlarged EU. The flexibility instrument must not be used for the EU’s administrative budget. We must respect the ceiling for category 5. Following the conciliation, there is now a common commitment to solve the remaining problems in category 5 by means of what is known as frontloading. Doing so is important in that a number of problems remain to be solved during the last months of the year. I am nonetheless convinced that we shall also be able to solve them.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, it would be very easy to allow one’s vision to be clouded by all the details, and the budget work is certainly extremely detailed. Together, we have nonetheless created better basic conditions for proceeding further with the historic task of, in a few years’ time, welcoming MEPs from perhaps ten new Member States to this Parliament and to the EU’s other institutions. As I see it, that is absolutely the most important outcome of the conciliation. As early as the beginning of next year, these countries will be able to send observers to what will also become their own Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">With the result of the agreement, we are complying not only with our commitments but also with the priorities decided upon by the Committee on Budgets and Parliament at the beginning of this year. It is firstly a question of ensuring that the EU institutions are given the opportunity to prepare for enlargement. Secondly, it is a question of implementing the necessary reforms. Thirdly, the intention is that both objectives should be attained within the budgetary framework.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to direct my concluding comment concerning the agreement between Parliament and the Council to the Danish Presidency which, in my view, has worked in an extremely effective way and with the clearly defined objective of reaching an agreement. The Danish Presidency has focused upon this task and been constructive and ready to compromise in a way that has made an agreement possible. It has shown a readiness to listen that has not always been characteristic of the Council in this context. I, and no doubt many others too, are grateful for this. The Council has for a long time been criticised for not having always made the same demands of itself as of others. The Council has not itself been prepared to implement the reductions forced upon others. When the Council has cut back on jobs in other institutions, it has not cut back on jobs within the Council itself. A rather more humble attitude may in actual fact be necessary in the future. I hope and believe that, in this respect, the Danish Presidency has played a positive role which will have lasting effects in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
