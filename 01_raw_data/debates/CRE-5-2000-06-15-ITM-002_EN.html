<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gama,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council. – (PT)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for this opportunity. This is the third time I have appeared before you in the six months of our Presidency and once again this allows the Council to have a direct dialogue with this House. The Portuguese Presidency has always tried to maintain a frank, open and constructive relationship with the European Parliament, both with the plenary and its committees. It is in this spirit that I will present our preview of the Feira European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I will firstly refer to the timetable as it is fixed at the moment. On the morning of the 19th there will be the usual meeting with the President of the European Parliament. This will be followed by a session with the Chair of the Convention, Roman Herzog, who is responsible for drawing up the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. This will not be a deliberative meeting as the Charter is still being drawn up according to the chosen methodology. Instead this will be an exchange of information. This seems necessary at this point so that Mr Herzog can inform the Heads of State and Government about the progress of the Convention’s work in drawing up the Charter and also so that he can ensure that the various Heads of State and Government are up to speed on this issue. Clearly this cannot and will not be a deliberative meeting, but simply an exchange of information.</p>
<p class="contents">Immediately after there will be a working session involving the finance ministers. This will address the issues of the follow-up to the Lisbon Special European Council and economic and financial affairs. Lunch will be devoted to the Intergovernmental Conference and, in particular, closer cooperation. The Council will have to indicate whether or not the latter issue is to be added to the agenda of the IGC. The afternoon session will be devoted to the issues of enlargement of the Union, the common European security and defence policy and external relations. I would point out that the Presidency invited the President of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, to join us at this point so that we can also consider the issue of Africa-Europe relations and regional political issues. We are delighted that President Mbeki has accepted our invitation, particularly given the importance of South Africa in regional terms and for the European Union and its Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The next day, the 20th, will be devoted as usual to reviewing the draft presidency conclusions. The Council will provide an opportunity to assess the progress achieved during the term of the presidency in areas which we regard as particularly important. In doing this, we will try to show the ways in which European integration can continue to be developed, thus enabling to the greatest extent possible the resolution of the many issues which await us in the coming months on the European agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">As there is not enough time now to describe in depth the items to be considered at Feira, I will instead identify some of the issues which we regard as a priority and which deserve our attention.</p>
<p class="contents">The Intergovernmental Conference will come to the European Council through the presentation of a report by the Presidency. This report is ready now. It was formally delivered yesterday to the President of the European Parliament and will today be made available on the Internet in all languages for general consultation. As you know, this Parliament has followed the work of the Intergovernmental Conference with great interest and cooperation. I must point out that the participation of this House represents a step forward in qualitative terms with regard to all previous intergovernmental conferences on the reform of the institutions and treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency’s report basically consists of two parts. The first assesses the progress made by the IGC to date and describes the trends emerging from the discussions. The second part contains a series of proposals, lists and tables illustrating the options which the IGC will have in the next six months. Using the mandate conferred on us during the Helsinki European Council and after sounding out the Member States, we will be recommending that the issue of closer cooperation is included on the agenda of the IGC. I am convinced that based on the work carried out, we will be in a position, with the leadership of the French Presidency, to conclude the IGC before the end of this year as planned.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the development of the common European security and defence policy, again based on the report which we will present to the European Council, I believe that significant progress has been made. I would highlight the formation and entry into force of the new political and military bodies and civilian crisis management bodies for the first time in the history of the European Union and also the approval of the rules governing relations between the EU and NATO and between the EU and third countries. The decision taken on the location of all these bodies, in terms of buildings and installations, should also be stressed. We have tried to take advantage of our simultaneous presidencies of the European Union and the WEU which has resulted in a clarification of the WEU’s role and the use of its capacities and <span class="italic">acquis</span> by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now entering a vital phase of this project and we must therefore prepare for the Capability Commitment Conference which will take place in November of this year. Its aim is to create and commit assets and capabilities which will allow us, as planned, to achieve the headline goal. Yesterday, in the General Affairs Council, these documents were voted on and approved.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to enlargement, this presidency launched the negotiations with the Helsinki Group. As we reported yesterday at ministerial level, several chapters have already been concluded, even with this Helsinki Group which is the most recent group. We have also made decisive progress with the previous group, the Luxembourg Group, as all the chapters, with the obvious exception of the ‘Institutions’ chapter, were already open with this group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Feira European Council will indicate a renewed commitment not to slacken the negotiating pace, given the agreed principles, and to continue with enlargement as the main historic challenge of the European Union. To this end I must stress that we inherited 16 chapters from the Luxembourg group. We have closed 10 and opened 6. With the Helsinki group, we have opened 10 chapters and closed 8. We have also recognised full applicant status for Turkey, approved the framework regulation and accession partnership, and also a unique financial framework, and we have held the first Association Council with a view to adequately preparing for assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the state of enlargement negotiations, given that yesterday and the day before we held 12 consecutive Intergovernmental Accession Conferences with the 12 applicants, the following negotiating chapters are now closed: 16 with Cyprus, 13 with Estonia and the Czech Republic, 12 with Slovenia, 11 with Hungary and Poland, 7 with Malta, 6 with Slovakia, 5 with Romania, Latvia and Lithuania and 4 with Bulgaria. This is interesting not only in terms of the rate of development of these dossiers but also as an indication of the way in which the applicant countries are reacting to the negotiating process. This is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">During yesterday’s Intergovernmental Conferences, the future Presidency also announced its working timetables in this respect so that this historic challenge can very clearly be met, based on the agreed principles, and so that there is no frustration among the applicants with regard to our intentions.</p>
<p class="contents">Another item for the Feira European Council will be the follow-up to the Lisbon Special European Council. In this respect documents will be presented on the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines for the Member States, the <span class="italic">e</span>Europe 2002 Action Plan, or the Information Society for All, the progress in applying the Financial Services Action Plan and also the approval of the European Charter for Small Enterprises. Clearly, the whole area of social policy and employment continues to be a subject for analysis by the Heads of State and Government.</p>
<p class="contents">On economic and financial affairs, I must highlight the formalisation of Greece’s entry into the euro. Greece will now join the other 11 Member States which have already moved into the third phase of economic and monetary union. A report will be presented on the progress made on the tax issue. As you know, an intense series of contacts is occurring in this area. The Portuguese Finance Minister has established this information network and there will be a meeting of Ecofin on 18 and 19 June, separate from the European Council, at which it is hoped that positive work can be achieved to find a much sought-after solution to this issue and the credibility of Europe as a financial market.</p>
<p class="contents">Briefly on external relations, it must be emphasised that the Portuguese Presidency has been significant for having managed to administer the new institutions created by the Treaty of Amsterdam which has only just entered into force. I must thank the High Representative and Secretary-General, Xavier Solana, and also the Commissioner with responsibility in this area, Christopher Patten, for their open, careful and dedicated cooperation. The potential of this new model of external representation of the Union is considerable and it is fair to say that the next few months will demonstrate this.</p>
<p class="contents">A very important step forward at Feira would be the adoption of the Common Strategy on the Mediterranean. This strategy will allow not only the whole chapter on the traditional area of the Barcelona process to be harmonised but will also allow an open methodology to be defined which will ensure, at the due time, the transition to a situation of peace, with the Middle East also being fully incorporated within this strategy. I must also highlight the report by the Secretary-General of the Council and by the Commission on the Western Balkans. This is an area in which our joint commitment is producing encouraging results. The approval of the Action Plan for the Northern Dimension and the report on applying the Common Strategy for Russia should also be emphasised. We therefore have a series of important items on our external policy agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">I have tried in this presentation to give you a fairly comprehensive preview of the Feira European Council. I am, of course, prepared to continue this exchange of ideas through any questions or comments which you might have. I have highlighted the fact that this European Council has a fairly full agenda. This is because we have a variety of objectives which are both fundamental and decisive in the context of the European priorities. These objectives include institutional reform, enlargement, the extraction of appropriate conclusions from the Lisbon Special European Council, now with a more rigorous and considered action plan, and also, of course, the various external policy issues which are of concern to us.</p>
<p class="contents">We will have the opportunity at the Feira European Council to take some important decisions in the economic and financial area and to approve a series of discussions on external security and defence policy, involving both the military and civilian components. These discussions will be very significant not so much for the future of the European Union but more for the present as this is an area where progress has been made, is starting to be visible and will surely be significant not only within Europe but also internationally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The presidency has already drawn up and submitted the report on the Intergovernmental Conference. We hope that, when it presents this report at the Feira Council, it will take into account the questions tabled by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and, of course, the opinions which will be expressed this morning by the representatives of the political groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The main point raised by the questions of the Committee of which I am Chairman is that we should not just restrict ourselves to recording the agreements and disagreements expressed around the Intergovernmental Conference table, but familiarise ourselves with the extent of the challenges and risks facing the Conference. The future of the development of Europe and the validity and sustainability of the institutions of the Union is at stake, with the now sure and fast-approaching prospect of enlargement to include a further 12 countries, and our relations with the citizens and their approval and support are also at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">In our questions, we referred to Mr Fischer’s speech. His speech and others which preceded or followed it – and, of the most recent, I would cite Wolfgang Schäuble’s extremely dramatic speech – should have contributed to impressing upon everybody the current responsibility of the institutions and, in particular, the governments of the 15 Member States to bring the Intergovernmental Conference to a conclusion. </p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, all the questions regarding the future of the Union cannot be resolved here, of that we are aware, but in Nice we must create the institutional conditions necessary for a new stage in the life of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In the oral question to the Commission, we requested clarification regarding its undertaking to reorganise the Treaties and provide a fresh perspective on the problems of governance, points on which the Commission had already made its opinion clear. In our oral question to the Council, we requested clarification of the issue of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and its incorporation into the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would add that it is important to include the topic of closer cooperation on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference – and we greatly appreciate the efforts of the Portuguese Presidency in this area – but, in our opinion, the agenda cannot be extended to include this subject alone without serious consideration of all the other points put forward by Parliament in the resolution of 13 April. This is cause for serious concern, particularly for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and we are also very concerned by the serious difficulties encountered during these four months by the Portuguese Presidency in its endeavour to define satisfactory solutions for the three issues left unresolved after Amsterdam, particularly the issue of qualified majority voting. We await the responses with confidence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am speaking on his behalf.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of the Feira Summit has been rightly highlighted at this delicate stage in the process of European integration and I want to start by saying that the Commission expects this European Council to provide the political impetus for adapting the Union before the great enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">This Council has important decisions to take in several areas, which I would like to review with you, if I may, in particular to ensure follow-up to the Special European Council of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention three of the priorities the Commission is seeking to highlight at the European Council. Both Mr Napolitano and Mr Gama mentioned the first: genuine institutional reform right now. Next, of course, is the foreign policy we need to develop and, finally, the third priority is a real European security and defence policy. The Commission is committed to effective and rapid follow-up to the Lisbon European Council – that is the least that might be expected of it.</p>
<p class="contents">So the first priority is genuine institutional reform right now, driven forward by the Portuguese Presidency. There is now a dynamic to the IGC negotiations and the group of representatives led by Francesco Seixas da Costa has worked well. I would also like to testify here, if I may, Madam President – because I participate conscientiously in the work of the group – to the very active part taken in that work, under your authority, by your two representatives, Elmar Brok and Professor Tsatsos.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, with the Presidency report now available, the Feira European Council should give us a snapshot of the progress accomplished so far and I hope that snapshot will be ‘proactive’ – as we can expect after listening to Mr Gama. I am especially thinking of the progress on what I consider the most important item in the negotiations: the extension of qualified majority voting and, consequently, the extension of codecision. Of all the issues not dealt with in Amsterdam, for lack of courage or political will at the time, this is undoubtedly the key point, and it is indeed the only thing that can prevent and reduce the real risk of deadlock in the enlarged Union’s decision-making process.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<tr><td width="70" align="center" valign="top"> </td><td width="5"> </td><td align="left" valign="top">
<p class="contents">The Feira Council should also put ‘enhanced cooperations’ on the agenda of the Conference, as the Commission and Parliament have been taking turns to advocate, so that it is easier to use these ‘enhanced cooperations’ in the future. And yes, I did indeed say ‘these cooperations’, not reinforced cooperation. That is a crucial point for us as well.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to those comments, and in answer to Mr Napolitano’s questions, I would like to say this. Ladies and gentlemen, you need have no doubt that the Commission definitely intends to keep on working towards what must be our ambition for this Conference: success in Nice, not just reaching a conclusion in Nice, because succeeding and concluding are two different things.</p>
<p class="contents">In the debate now in progress about the future and purpose of the European Union, the essential first stage is definitely putting the Union into working order now to make the enlargement a success. And I want to reaffirm my conviction that this reform of the institutions is certainly not, in our view, a pretext for delaying enlargement. It is the condition for making it a success. So that reform is also the obligatory route for all future evolution in the construction of Europe. This first stage, this first step, must be respected, in the knowledge that there will be others.</p>
<p class="contents">From amongst the issues we, like you, are committed to, I would like to mention the reform of the Treaties. Although this is not – or not yet – on the agenda, it is something we are working on. The draft basic treaty, presented at our request by the Institute of Florence does, I think, demonstrate the legal feasibility of this exercise. The Commission will express its opinion on this study on 5 July, and adopt a communication on the reform of the Treaties. Personally, I think more time will definitely be needed than is available before the Nice deadline to deal with this issue seriously and in depth. But as you yourself have said, Madam President, we must at least make a start on it, at the latest in Nice. We think it will be useful to start discussing it now and finding a method of making progress in that direction. The European Council could express an opinion on undertaking this exercise immediately after Nice, possibly linking it to another difficult issue we still think ought to be dealt with in Nice, though we are not sure that it will be: incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Napolitano mentioned the report on governance announced by President Prodi. That is a second point. Before the end of this month, the Commission will specify the issues it wishes to look at with a view to improving the way decentralisation of responsibility within the Union is organised, strengthening coherence between its policies and achieving greater and fairer citizen participation. To be frank it is too early to tell you about the precise contents of this white paper, but quite clearly its drafting, between now and summer 2001, will take account of all proposals and views about the long term aims of European construction and their implications for organising European policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As I speak to you today, I am also hoping this white paper on governance will contribute to the exercise I was talking about a few minutes ago: a reform of the Treaties, that simplifies and clarifies them, producing in, I hope, the not too distant future a text or basic treaty that is easy to read, incorporating rights, values, institutions, the principles of our common policies, and finally clarifying the powers and objectives of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter of Fundamental Rights Mr Gama mentioned is a political challenge for all of us. The Commission hopes the work of the convention drafting this Charter will be completed before the end of the year. Your representatives, to whom I pay tribute, and my colleague, Antonio Vitorino, attach great importance to it. The Charter should create added value, without affecting the <span class="italic">acquis</span> in the Treaty, by codifying in a single text all the fundamental rights upheld by the Union and adding the fundamental economic and social rights which form a part of that <span class="italic">acquis</span>, plus some new limited rights. </p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the precise form and status of the Charter, and the relationship between the new text and the rights guaranteed by Member States and the Council of Europe, will continue to be discussed and I cannot anticipate the conclusions, at least, not before the Biarritz Summit. The convention chairman, Mr Herzog, will take stock of the convention’s work at the Feira European Council and we hope the debate that follows can provide fresh impetus to this crucial process for the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk about the Commission’s second great priority: the development of foreign policy and a genuine European security and defence policy. The political dimension of the European Union is also involved. First I want to talk about the enlargement. As the Council President mentioned, following Helsinki, negotiations are now in progress with all the candidate countries. During the Portuguese Presidency the negotiations with the Luxembourg Group entered their final chapters. In Feira, the European Council will be noting the progress achieved as set out in a Presidency report, and encouraging all the candidates to pursue their efforts to prepare themselves for accession with determination. We too have to prepare, by reforming the institutions, and there is a long way to go.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, from now on, we who are already in the Union must set out to explain the coming great enlargement better and give the citizens of our countries better information about it. We should debate the advantages and the changes involved in it with them. That is what the initiative taken with you by Günther Verheugen is about, and we attach great importance to this public debate he will be taking part in, because we are aware of a feeling of disquiet among citizens in all our countries, a need to understand, and a growing sensitivity to the issue of enlargement. It is better to prevent any damage that might be caused by lack of explanation or debate rather than have to repair it.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of European security and defence policy, the Commission is happy with the decisions taken since the Helsinki European Council. The temporary bodies are in place within the Council and the development of the overall capacity target is making encouraging progress. The defence ministers have been involved in that work and at Feira the European Council will be presented with a progress report measuring, as you said, Minister, what has been accomplished under the Portuguese Presidency, and it will draw up guidelines for the work ahead. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is contributing actively to these developments, in particular as regards civilian crisis management. On this point, Chris Patten recently submitted a proposal for a regulation to the Council, to create a rapid reaction force. The Commission has also undertaken an in-depth review of its own organisation and procedures in the area of foreign policy, in order to adapt them to these new challenges. I would like to stress that the Commission’s work is complementary to all the developments in European security and defence policy. Coherence is absolutely essential and the institutions must work together on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Under foreign policy, the European Council will in particular be debating the situation in the Western Balkans and the implementation of the common strategy towards Russia. The Council should also adopt the common strategy for the Mediterranean region. For the Western Balkans, the Commission will continue to work with the Member States and with the Secretary General, Javier Solana, to achieve a rapprochement, a real rapprochement, between the countries concerned and the European Union, through a stabilisation and association process. On Russia, the Feira Council will finalise the Union’s common strategy towards that country just a few months after the inauguration of President Putin’s new government and his declaration of intent to introduce economic and political reforms. Ladies and gentlemen, despite certain positive economic and political signals, the situation in Chechnya continues to call for prudence and vigilance at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Middle East, let me mention two major events which have changed the face of politics there in the last few weeks, so that, although the situation in the region is currently delicate, there are grounds for hope. First, the European Commission, along with the entire international community, was delighted at the Israeli Government’s decision of 24 May to withdraw from South Lebanon, in line with United Nations Security Council Resolutions 425 and 426. We should pay tribute to the Prime Minister of the State of Israel, Ehud Barak, for having taken this difficult decision after 22 years of occupation. In the immediate future, it is essential that all the parties concerned refrain from any act of violence, either inside or outside Lebanon, and cooperate with the United Nations forces. As for the Union, it will assist the reconstruction of South Lebanon as soon as conditions allow. The Commission has already sent a mission to evaluate reconstruction needs in situ.</p>
<p class="contents">Likewise, following the death of President Harez el Assad, the Union must also encourage a smooth political transition process in Syria, as well as continuing economic reform and modernisation in that country through a strengthening of the rule of law, through a strengthening of human rights and through political pluralism. Talks between Syria and Israel will be able to find fresh impetus in this new political context and could lead to a just and durable peace agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Feira European Council’s agenda will include the common Mediterranean strategy, which many of you, quite rightly, value highly. Not only will it contribute to strengthening the Barcelona process with a view to the forthcoming Euro-Mediterranean Summit in Marseilles, it will also help consolidate the European Union’s contribution to the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to talk about the effective and rapid follow-up to the Lisbon European Council, which the Commission is very committed to, just as it is committed to the proper preparation of this Council. At Lisbon, we set ourselves a very ambitious objective, complete with targets and a timetable: to promote the transformation of the European economy and European society over the next ten years. Since then, the European economy has shown continuous improvement. That is reflected in falling unemployment rates everywhere, even though there are still too many pockets of poverty within the Member States. In this improved context, the Commission, the Council and Parliament must act together to make the Lisbon objectives a reality, not contenting ourselves with words and hopes, but putting them into practice. Progress has already been made.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with the Council, we have presented a draft action plan to make the <span class="italic">e</span>Europe initiative a reality as from 2002. Feira should approve this plan and I want to underline two key factors in the programme presented by Erkki Liikanen: first the reform of the regulatory environment for communications and electronic commerce, then, access for all citizens, especially young people, to the resources and qualifications needed in the communication and information age. In particular, implementation of the <span class="italic">e</span>Learning initiative recently proposed by my colleague Viviane Reding will help achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">So, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission, its President and all the commissioners, are naturally determined to deliver what the Council and this House expects of them and to do so within the deadlines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have presented proposals on government contracts, postal services and enterprise policy. We will shortly be presenting guidelines relating to the new European Social Agenda, to deal with the problems of social exclusion, which I mentioned earlier and which persist. We have also contributed to the development of the Charter for small firms, which Mr Gama mentioned and which will be adopted at Feira. The high level working group on social protection is preparing its interim report on the modernisation and improvement of social protection.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to stress the major role played by this House in all these issues. We are particularly pleased that the new regulatory framework for electronic commerce has been rapidly adopted and we hope – we feel sure – that the same fruitful collaboration between Parliament, the Council and the Commission will be maintained throughout the legislative process so that progress can be made as rapidly as possible on each of the areas of interest defined in Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">We trust the Feira European Council will acknowledge all the progress made. But the European Council must also provide fresh impetus for intensifying these efforts, particularly in the areas where short term action is still necessary to achieve the Lisbon objectives. I am thinking of reducing Internet costs, implementing the action plan for financial services, creating a European research area and the ‘single sky’, and, finally, greater efforts to raise employment levels, fight exclusion and prepare the new Social Agenda. All this requires a commitment from all the operators involved and the political impetus to introduce the necessary measures, but in our turn we must convert this political will, ladies and gentlemen, when the time comes, into priority expenditure, both by the Union and by the Member States. There again, perhaps Feira can point us in that direction. </p>
<p class="contents">Just before I end, ladies and gentlemen, let me very briefly mention three important economic and financial points. </p>
<p class="contents">First, the one Pedro Solbes will report on: the main economic policy guidelines and the coordination that goes with them, essential for a better balance between the two pillars of economic and monetary union. We are persuaded that the guidelines thus defined are, with the Luxembourg, Cardiff and Cologne processes, essential for proper progress towards the Lisbon objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, Greece has made a marvellous effort to achieve convergence, and we are in a position to extend the euro zone to that country, as the Commission has proposed. We will be presenting recommendations to that effect to the Heads of State and Government at Feira and trust they will be followed. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the fiscal package. As you know, the Council has not reached agreement, but discussions continue. On 18 June there will be a special Ecofin Council, and we hope it will open the way to an agreement, provided all the parties demonstrate goodwill and a desire to reach a conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">The various speeches have reflected the abundance of important issues, even though we need to concentrate our political attention and energy on the three essential points I have raised: reform of the institutions, foreign policy and the CFSP, and the follow-up to Lisbon. </p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, a European Council is a result achieved by a presidency. I want to say, on behalf of the Commission, how very active the Portuguese Presidency really has been. But a European Council is also the result of the effort made by each institution. So I feel sure that the effort everyone has made will result in the Feira European Council making progress possible on all these fundamental issues, responding better to the challenges of the Union as a whole, responding better to the expectations of the citizens of our fifteen countries, but also to the expectations I mentioned just now, those of the citizens of the twelve countries of Central, Eastern, Baltic and Mediterranean Europe who are soon going to join us.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That had to be done, and it was likewise necessary for the report it has just drafted – in addition to being an objective and lucid snapshot of the strengths and weaknesses of the negotiations – to propose going further, without shutting any doors. It has done so, in particular, on a point Mr Gama mentioned, the fourth Amsterdam ‘leftover’, and I hope the ‘enhanced cooperations’ will allow us to move on. We hope all the Heads of State and Government, as well as the Portuguese Presidency, will take that snapshot as a model to set a ‘proactive’ seal on the remaining six months, so as to succeed – and I do mean succeed – in reforming the institutions at Nice.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe will not fall from the sky like a ripe fruit – it has to be shaped by working on it day in, day out. The procedures to be agreed in Feira for the future of the European Union represent a significant step along this path. I therefore hope that this will be a meaningful working summit. </p>
<p class="contents">We, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, have two fundamental objectives as this new millennium commences.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Intergovernmental Conference must be concluded in Nice this winter, but not just for the sake of completing it, but rather in order to achieve a satisfactory outcome. That is the first challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we witnessed major changes in Europe in 1989-90, not to mention before and since then. The peoples of Central Europe are anxious to join our Community of values. To achieve this, we and those countries need to fulfil our respective obligations. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, I ask you to give a signal in Feira so that the impetus of the accession process is not lost. We must not create the impression that these Central European peoples are not welcome in our Community of values. I would like to call on you personally to do everything in your power to make sure that we send a signal to the peoples of Central Europe that they are welcome to join us!</p>
<p class="contents">You have talked about extending the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference. I would like to offer you my emphatic support – be flexible! Do not just make a list of what needs to be added, but find a formula which allows additional topics to be included over the coming months. </p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Barnier has talked about majority voting. This is the key point – using majority voting in the EU Council of Ministers as a matter of course, and at the same time extending the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I am all in favour of introducing enhanced cooperation into the Treaty, but I must warn you, Mr President-in-Office, against introducing enhanced cooperation into the Treaty if this is ultimately just a token gesture and if we are not successful as far as majority voting is concerned. We need both majority voting and enhanced cooperation!</p>
<p class="contents">We firmly support your presidency’s desire to rationalise the Treaty, as will be apparent from the political groups’ motion for a resolution, so that the structure of the Treaty is revised. Commissioner Barnier talked about a basic treaty. It may not be possible to achieve all this in this six-month period, but we should adopt this approach of creating a basic treaty and a general treaty. We must have more respect for the principles of subsidiarity. My group is also in favour of our trying to clarify the respective roles of the European Union, the Member States and the regions. We can only maintain or even regain agreement to the process of European unification at various levels if people actually know what each level is responsible for doing! That is why it is key for us to establish our priorities here and to make a start on demarcating the various competences.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner also spoke about the Common Foreign and Security Policy. I support the endeavours to create a strong Europe, indeed we have always supported them, but in the framework of the Western Alliance, and not separately from our American friends, but complementing them and as partners with equal rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add one more thought. I should have mentioned it just now, but I forgot. Why do we need a flexible approach to the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference? Yesterday we spoke in this Chamber about a European Party Statute. You were not able to be present, and I do not intend that as a reproach. If we want to supplement Article 191 of the Treaty, and the Commission is to present a proposal to the IGC to that effect, then it must be possible to deal with this at the IGC and ultimately to supplement the Treaty if we are to make progress on the subject of European political parties.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one more observation, without any desire to be controversial, but quite calmly and objectively, and yet with a sense of great personal dismay. This is about paragraph 8 of the political groups’ motion for a resolution. We are calling on the Council presidency to assess relations between the 14 Member States and Austria, and we are also calling on the presidency to work out a procedure in conjunction with all the parties involved in the European Union with a view to finding an acceptable solution. Mr President-in-Office, everyone will probably see this differently, but this issue is casting a shadow over the European Union. We know that in Denmark, support for the euro in the run-up to the referendum in September is rapidly waning because of the Austrian issue, as in Denmark, this is viewed as interference in the internal affairs of the smaller states.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to address this comment to you personally, and I say this not because I wish to be controversial, but because I am firmly convinced that if we do not solve this issue it will lead to major problems. I therefore urge you to make this your business. And I also entreat you to take the position of the European Parliament into consideration at the IGC. We have faith in the Commission, but our faith in the presidency, in the Council, could be greater. But we nevertheless hope you will succeed. If you succeed, it will be a success for all of us, for the entire continent of Europe! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, it is no cliché to say that, on the eve of the European Council in Feira, this is a decisive moment for the European Union. The proof of this is the fact that in recent months there have been an increasing number of declarations, beginning with Heads of State such as President Campi of Italy, President Rau of Germany, prominent European politicians such as Helmut Schmidt, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, Jacques Delors and more recently, with great success, the German Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Fischer, all of whom have related the debate on the Intergovernmental Conference with a debate which is of importance to all of us, that is, ‘where is Europe heading?’. I think that this is healthy given that we are on the threshold of the greatest and most ambitious enlargement the European Union has ever known.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate reflects the political will of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and also Parliament as a whole, who wish to achieve an ambitious agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference. Since we have been talking about photographic technology, to use a cinematic analogy, I would say that we need to be involved in the writing of the script, we need a good ending, and we MEPs must not be cast as extras, but as lead actors. With regard to the Intergovernmental Conference, it is important that President Herzog appears before the European Council in Feira.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that, when we talk about the community of values, – and there have been recent opportunities to do so, such as the formation of the new Austrian Government – we must demand that the Charter of Fundamental Rights be clearly included in the Treaty in order to fulfil the purpose of Articles 6 and 7 of that Treaty. Furthermore, although the Treaty of the European Union recognises European citizenship, until now, economic and social, individual and collective rights have not been developed. It is completely contradictory to have citizenship without rights. It is therefore absolutely essential that the Charter of Fundamental Rights be incorporated into the Treaty. In this process, the status of political parties is a means for them also to be protagonists on the European stage.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the convention, I would add one more element, and that is that, in the drawing up of the Charter, the convention is turning out to be a more transparent, democratic and open formula than the classic procedure of the Intergovernmental Conferences. It is a formula for the future and I believe we should take it very seriously. In this regard, I will add two decisive points. One is, for Parliament, that decisions made by qualified majority should be accompanied by the codecision procedure, and the second point is that we must favour integration over closer cooperation, because what we are actually doing is integrating.</p>
<p class="contents">In the economic field, what we need is greater coordination of economic, social and employment policies. We must implement the conclusions of the European Council in Lisbon, which are positive and have achieved a broad consensus in this Parliament as well, but this requires that we increase our capacity for economic government. If we wish to create employment, if we wish to defend and fulfil the social agenda at a time when the European train is beginning to move faster and needs more steam, the last thing we need is for our work to be hindered by a strictly monetarist management with no economic counterbalance. That is an absolutely decisive point for the coming months.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Madam President, I would like to make a very brief comment: the report on the progress made with regard to enlargement has been important because it indicates how the problems are being overcome and how we have to maintain this will with the countries with whom we are negotiating. I believe that it is also important for the Commission, with regard to the Balkans, to take account of the fact that there is a country which could become a bridge – having before been a barrier – towards the Balkans, and that is Croatia. After the political change which has taken place, the Commission should intensify the negotiation of the association agreement with Croatia.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say a few words about the Middle East. I have just returned from a visit to Syria and Lebanon and I welcome the fact that the President of the Commission is there at the moment. I agree that the Israeli withdrawal from Southern Lebanon is very important and we must support Barak, but we should also intensify our partnership with Syria and Lebanon. We must have an active policy in order to contribute towards resolving the dramatic problem of the Palestinian refugees, and we can actively offer ideas and resources in order to ensure that the Middle East peace process will make decisive progress, which would also lead to a greater opening up and intensification of the Euro-Mediterranean process. All of these elements are on the agenda and I hope that the European Council in Feira will make progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cox (ELDR).</span></span>   – Madam President, I should like, on behalf of the Liberal Democrat Group, to begin by recording our thanks to the Portuguese presidency and our appreciation of its willingness to engage constantly with this Parliament, with its committees and with its groups. We deeply appreciate that. It has helped us to develop and evolve a considerable appreciation of the enormous work which this presidency has put into the task.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish also to record our view that, subject to consolidating the path set out at Lisbon, at Feira and subsequent Council meetings, European summits and various Council meetings and in this House, we believe that Lisbon marks a major change, a milestone, in terms of the evolution of socio-economic policy reform in Europe. It will stand the test of time as a testament to the work of this presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">You have remarked, Mr President-in-Office, that enlargement is the historic challenge. We in my group very much believe that. We believe that one of the measures of the consciousness of the depth of that historic challenge will be found in the reformist appetite of the states in the IGC. I say on behalf of my group – and this is not the responsibility of a hard-working Portuguese presidency, but a failure of a collective will – that we regret the failure to date to make more progress on some of the basic issues. I cite qualified majority voting as an example. I would insist, as other speakers have, on this Parliament's view that we also need to link changes in voting procedure to changes in legislative procedure. The codecision question is not simply a question of giving more power to this House. It is the question of recognising, as we step towards improving the efficiency of the institutions, especially decision-making in the Council, that it needs checks and balances, to add not just efficiency but also representative democracy. It is an appeal, therefore, for the quality of European democracy and not simply an appeal for the interests of Members of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">We are prepared to engage in the debate on closer cooperation and welcome the way it has been put to us by a number of important political personalities outside this House. But there are some caveats: we hope that speculation on long-term reform will not be the enemy of necessary radical reform in the immediate period ahead. We believe that the Monnet method has served the Union rather well. We would certainly wish to reflect on any attempt to radically change it. We believe it is important not to signal to existing Member States or to candidate states that any of us would contemplate a Europe of first- and second-class citizens in terms of statehood and membership.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to briefly mention the question of Austria. My group would appreciate it if the Council at Feira would try to make an evaluation of the quality of relations between the Fourteen and Austria. It is important that as Fifteen we find the accommodating political climate to make the necessary progress in the months ahead. We are not prescriptive in the manner of achieving this.</p>
<p class="contents">I add one footnote, but an important point of principle. President Klestil came to this House and I had the opportunity to talk with him briefly during his visit. I asked him to send to me a copy of the list that is available of persons and agencies in civil society in Austria who have become isolated from various educational, social or cultural events in Europe. That is intolerable. Regardless of intergovernmental diplomacy, it is intolerable that we should isolate the common citizens of a state. Lest this should get out of hand, my appeal would be for a calm assessment of the matter, to make an evaluation and find a way forward. If there is any way that we in Parliament and my group can assist, we are ready to try to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In our opinion, this is very welcome. We warmly welcome the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and we would like it to be vibrant in terms of its content, and to become a legally binding part of the Treaties and a vehicle for a constitutional process in which the people are a central factor. I also believe that the way in which the Charter of Fundamental Rights is being produced is radically new, and this could also be a way to amend agreements in the future to make them genuinely constitutional.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, public opinion is at its lowest ebb now when it comes to the formation of military institutions for the European Union. I would like, on behalf of my Group, to complain that barely any public debate is entered into in these matters, and that changes happen so fast that sometimes it feels as if not even all our governments can fully influence this process. Relations between the European Union and NATO are converging so quickly that the non-aligned countries are in a very precarious situation, although they want to make a full contribution to the promotion of national security.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that the Mediterranean strategy is a very important one. I was recently in New York at a conference on women’s issues. I appeal to the Commission and the Council that you make a serious bid to include the issues of women’s rights and human rights in the Mediterranean strategy. I also warmly welcome the concrete action programme concerning the northern dimension. It may at last help to make a serious attempt to resolve the immense socio-economic problem that exists, for example, in north-west Russia. In that process we have to remember the issue of nuclear safety, which is a problem that affects us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When you were preparing for the Portuguese Presidency, Mr President-in-Office, I presume you were determined to send a strong message to the public. It was undoubtedly in that spirit that you decided to make the Lisbon European Council a special employment summit. And you effectively relaunched the idea of full employment, emphasised the importance of lifelong training, and stressed the considerable challenge represented by the information revolution. But without specific job creation targets, verifiable timetable commitments, clear choices about finance and tangible progress on the right of the social operators to be involved, all public opinion will remember about that summit will be the Blair-Aznar trademark.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides, Commissioner Bolkestein, to take one example, has not hesitated to refer to what he called the ambition set at Lisbon to require postal services to be opened up to competition, even if it means a head-on clash with the unions, many Members of Parliament and several Member States. Under such circumstances, what is left of the social message you were hoping to send to the citizens of Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">I do not say that as an accusation against the Portuguese Presidency. I think it is up to all the Member States to take up the challenge. And what has happened to that other big idea intended to regain people’s confidence, the affirmation of a policy department for European business, faced with the influence of mega-firms and markets? There was a fascinating sight for all to see at the European Business Summit in Brussels last weekend, attended by the flower of European employers present and even the Microsoft management.</p>
<p class="contents">And as we know, the Commission did not content itself with sending eleven commissioners to it, which is unprecedented, apparently the Commission President also came out with some original principles there, to the effect that the law is the law, but in times of change excessively precise regulations should be avoided. What does the political authority, the Council, think of this laissez-faire philosophy? If voices are raised in Feira, as I hope they will be, to distance themselves from the whole engulfing tide of liberalism and advocate real social and democratic reform, then please, Mr President, open the windows and doors of your summit wide, let that dissent be heard in full transparency and clarity and let a real comparison of options, which is so lacking today, begin everywhere in the full light of day. I think that is the best favour Europe can be done today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to highlight four of these, not all of which were referred to by Mr Gama. Firstly, on Austria, clearly we do not harbour any sympathies for political extremism but we must condemn the ill-timed reaction of 14 Member States to the formation of a democratically elected government before this had even had the chance to start governing. This decision did not respect the sovereign choice of the Austrian people and has also been ineffective. The fight against racism and xenophobia must be conducted intelligently and forcefully, not with inflammatory measures which in the end simply produce the totally unwanted effect of promoting what they are trying to fight, in addition to spreading anti-European feeling.</p>
<p class="contents">The Portuguese Presidency was willing to take on the role of spokesperson for the Member States last February, wrongly in our opinion, despite the issue always having been a bilateral issue, as was clearly agreed between the 14 Member States. Although this Presidency is not formally required to solve the problem, each of the governments should be required to assume its responsibilities. In this way we would find out who wants to continue isolating Austria and who, recognising the error, wants to re-establish normal relations with this country, thus avoiding the ‘misunderstandings’ mentioned by the Secretary of State, Mr Seixas da Costa, between the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is the Intergovernmental Conference. The distinctive act of the Portuguese Presidency should be to recognise and defend political equality between the Member States as a corollary to maintaining the balance between the large and small countries and between these and the European Union itself. The participation of national parliaments in the institutional reform and in the conduct of European affairs should therefore be encouraged. In this way the people of each country can become involved more democratically and more directly in the process of building their Europe and in defining the Community decision-making methods.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to closer cooperation, it must be emphasised that the principle of flexibility on which this is based and which we support should not prevent the guarantee that no Member State can be excluded from participating in this cooperation, except on its own initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issues left unresolved by the Treaty of Amsterdam, the rule of one commissioner for each Member State should be enshrined, bearing in mind that the Commission has the monopoly on legislative initiative. It should be pointed out that codecision now involves a dual weighting of votes, one in the Council and the other in the European Parliament. Instead of the intended generalisation of qualified majority voting, the retention of the unanimity rule must be defended in order to preserve the factors of political balance between the Member States regardless of their population or economic weight. These factors have been the key to the success of the cooperative, peaceful and developed Europe which we have come to know in the last fifty years.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue is the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Its content is not in question. The point is that the European Union does not need a Charter of Fundamental Rights and this is for the simplest reason of all. The European Union does not have any significant problems with fundamental rights. As we have said before, if there is no problem, the Charter is not a solution and if it is not the solution, then the Charter is a problem. We hope that the Feira summit can come to the obvious conclusion. There are no differences of opinion about the definition or application of fundamental rights in the European Union which cannot be solved by the various Member States in their constitutions and in the Human Rights Convention to which all countries, and the European Union, both before and after enlargement, are bound.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth and final issue is enlargement. Despite the progress announced here today, we feel that more than ten years after the fall of the Berlin wall the European Union should be showing a more consistent political will in terms of welcoming into the European fold the people of Central and Eastern Europe who legitimately aspire to share a common future with us. This would prevent them from feeling any disappointment or even frustration. This will should be shown through three essential aspects: firstly the defence of the major European causes of peace, freedom and economic and social development which must underlie the negotiations with the applicant countries; secondly the promotion of the merit of each country as the only condition to be imposed on accession, and thirdly the maintenance of the economic and social cohesion of the current 15 Member States. Austria, the Intergovernmental Conference, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and enlargement are four issues requiring four different responses. This is what we expect from the meeting at Feira of the Heads of State and Government on the Portuguese Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Feira Summit will give the green light particularly to close cooperation between the most developed and the most federally minded nations. They will create a State within the State and make decisions on behalf of everyone else. The pattern is familiar from holding companies where a small majority runs a company which, in turn, runs another company. In the EU, there is a Franco-German axis which will set the pace for a core EU which, in turn, will make decisions in the EU as a whole, as well as dictating legislation to the candidate States and, moreover, adopting legislation right under the noses of all the other nations of Europe. Human rights, the arts, transport and foreign and security policy could also become areas for which European bodies such as the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe are responsible. The common market could also, of course, be opened up to all European countries. Nations such as the Baltic and Baltic Sea countries and the countries around the Mediterranean could also join together in different regional groups. It ought to be possible for countries to remain outside those aspects of European cooperation they are better off without, as long as they do not in that way arrogate particular economic advantages to themselves. It ought also to be possible for some countries to enter into especially close cooperation but, if this is to happen within the EU’s institutions, everyone must be asked. Otherwise, cooperation must take place elsewhere. My group rejects majority decision-making on enhanced cooperation. We are in favour of greater flexibility, but we have no use for a self-appointed <span class="italic">avant garde</span> to take the decisions on our behalf.

For one thing, it will determine whether the Portuguese Presidency will go down in history as the presidency which upheld the wrongful decision on the part of those 14 Member States against Austria, or, instead, as the presidency which found a way out of this unfortunate period of disregard for European solidarity and lack of respect for the democratic processes within Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Through the measures they have taken, the Heads of State and Government of the Fourteen have really burdened themselves with an enormous responsibility in relation both to Austria and to the Union as a whole. Over a year ago, it looked as if the disastrously low turnout in the European elections would at least have the helpful effect of initiating a fundamental debate about the structure of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, things have largely returned to the normal routine. If anything, European awareness has receded even further into the distance because of the arbitrary action taken by the Fourteen against Austria. Feira should therefore give us an opportunity to bring the EU closer to the public, either by giving the Charter of Fundamental Rights legal force, or, which would be even more meaningful, by then stating its intention to include a list of competences in the treaties. Instead, perhaps as a token gesture, and as a result of the difficulty of solving the core problems, it appears that the topic of “enhanced cooperation” is being given a higher profile. This is despite the feeling already prevailing in the last parliamentary term, and still prevalent in this Chamber now, that this could lead to a two-speed or even multi-speed Europe, so that “enhanced cooperation” will sound the death-knell of the classic European Union. In many respects, the Union is facing a parting of the ways, and the Feira Summit has a vital role to play here. The programme we have heard today does not give us cause for any great hope. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a Portuguese national and a European, no one more than I hopes that this summit will achieve positive results which can take Europe forward and show the merit of the rotating presidency, whatever the demographic and economic weight of each country. This is the very spirit of the European Union and it is only with this spirit that Europe will remain united. There cannot be first or second rate countries or people. Everyone is equal in the Union, in both their rights and duties.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, as a Portuguese national and a European, I am looking very expectantly to the Feira European Council to ensure that this summit is not just an obligation in the calendar or a transition point. I have two specific hopes, which are also requirements, obligations and duties, for the assessment to be made of the Portuguese Presidency. Firstly, we hope that the Feira European Council can definitively end the Austrian question otherwise this issue will remain a cloud over the Portuguese Presidency. We do not understand why the President-in-Office has allowed confusion to arise between his institutional position as President of the European Union and his role as spokesperson for the bilateral decisions of 14 Member States against one. If there is one person responsible for this issue it is the President of the European Union who must now correct his error. He must rectify what could have been avoided. The Portuguese Presidency assumed a special responsibility in this issue and we hope that it will solve the problem at the Feira European Council so that this does not become a sore point within the European Union. The longer it takes to resolve this issue, the more difficult it will become to resolve.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we hope that the Feira European Council can produce a plan, an idea or a project for Europe for the next Intergovernmental Conference. We also hope that the Portuguese Presidency will be seen to have made a significant mark in this respect. A report or document is not enough. It does not take ministers to produce reports and documents summarising positions. This only needs officials to attend the meetings. We know that the work of the IGC will be drawn to a close by the French Presidency at the end of this year but it would surely be justified for ideas and projects to already exist which had the mark of the current Presidency. The idea that everything will be decided at the last minute seems too much a justification of a <span class="italic">fait accompli </span>policy and must be rejected immediately. This is even more worrying when everything is being discussed in public, without it being apparent whether these discussions are forms of pressure or academic debate. We therefore hope that the Feira European Council will produce not just a statement of positions but also a plan, a project or an idea on the changes to the Intergovernmental Conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To a certain extent, this set out the points of the triangle which has formed and which continues to form the shape of the action and work of the Portuguese Presidency. The first point of this triangle is extension and enlargement. The second is cohesion and obtaining globalisation opportunities to strengthen the social fabric and modernise the economic fabric of the Union. The third relates to external policy and the common European security and defence policy. On this third point we had the opportunity yesterday to debate the proposals with the Presidency and in particular the issues which will be on the agenda at Feira. However, I cannot resist expressing our delight not only at the concrete steps taken in this area in terms of defence and security but also at the political visibility which this Presidency has had in cooperation with the Secretary-General of the Council and the Commission. It has achieved this by contributing to the resolution of regional conflicts and particularly by ensuring that there is not just one regional conflict mediator available in the world, namely the United States of America, but that Europe can also assume what is one of its main historic vocations and one of the decisive factors in the European project.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point of the triangle is social and economic cohesion. We frequently take fundamental issues for granted, such as full employment, modernisation of our economic fabric, the need to create a European research area to generate creativity and the need for this creativity to be at the service of businesses, particularly new businesses in the new economy. These points are too important to be glossed over and taken lightly. The contribution made in this respect, with a new method of coordination and a new strategy, by the Lisbon Special European Council cannot be a priority for just one presidency but must be continued. We are therefore reassured when we hear those who will mainly be responsible for the future French Presidency choosing the social agenda as one of the main priorities of their political action. We must stress the need for the creation of more jobs to be a priority and an objective of the European Union. With regard to the issues of racism and xenophobia, we must fight these at the roots and prevent them from gaining ground and being used in speeches of the extreme right which we all reject but which it seems that some only reject in speeches but not in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point concerns the compliments already made, of which there cannot be too many given the efforts of the Portuguese Presidency in respect of the Intergovernmental Conference. This Parliament contributed positively and constructively, as Commissioner Barnier witnessed, so that the work of the IGC could be started in February. We all knew that this IGC would be reduced in size and even minimalist. With the exception of closer cooperation, this IGC did not perhaps need to be given eleven months to be decided. The problem with the IGC, given the leftovers from Amsterdam, is not just in terms of the debate but also the decision. We demand and insist that the Feira European Council produces an extended agenda which will ensure that the European project does not mobilise just those who, like us, are committed to the institutional issues but can mobilise the real citizens of Europe who should be involved in the construction of a European project. In this respect, the inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Treaty is an example and especially an objective which must be pursued. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have so far tried to reach a consensus across the body. This is now proving an improbable task.</p>

This means voting, and voting by a qualified majority, as would be normal for the procedures within any modern European State.

However, the results which will be obtained from this summit are of doubtful and limited scope, or at least some of them are, as the respective debate has gone beyond the institutions and this presidency and all eyes are now turned to Nice. Even so, there is every reason for concern. The enlargement process is advancing and forms a specific argument for institutional change but its effects are being ignored and the measures needed in the various policies and in the budget are being swept under the carpet.</p>
<p class="contents">As the debate advances within the IGC, this is taking an unacceptable shape. In the name of efficiency, attempts are being made to impose the new model of internal power and a markedly federalist option. Due to the illusory danger of the small and medium-sized countries blocking decisions, the idea of giving the large countries a real and exclusive right of veto is gaining ground. In the meantime, the essential need to involve the people in these debates is being forgotten, particularly those people who are most disadvantaged and distant from the decision-making centres.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, closer cooperation is being gambled on heavily but it is being forgotten that this would require the establishment of a multi-speed Europe which would inevitably have a hard core and an unacceptable political directorate. In terms of security and defence, with the fallacious argument of autonomy constantly being used and based on an effective concept of a politico-military block, dangerous routes are being taken towards the militarisation and reinforcement of the European power of NATO when this should be the time to definitively dismantle these blocks, to disarm and to cooperate in achieving lasting peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Strangely, this Presidency, which has allowed itself to be overtaken by events, has ended up by accepting all these concepts and, even worse, has actually applauded some of their mentors, even in the knowledge that the acceptance of their proposals and discussion methods would, taken literally, lead to the inevitable closure of the IGC itself. The Presidency is insisting on the controversial Charter of Fundamental Rights, which it wants as a badge of achievement, but has forgotten the social issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this Conference is at least producing a positive result on Timor given that something clearly needs to be done to rebuild this territory and re-establish its independence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As representatives of the European peoples without their own state, we want the European Union to be a community of citizens, on the one hand, and correspond to the reality of peoples and regions and their political entities, on the other. This reality is not sufficiently recognised in the texts before us, if at all. Some Member States are struggling just as hard with granting autonomy to these various cultural and political entities as with relinquishing competences to create a federal Europe. In fact, this would mean a democratic U-turn which they do not seem to be prepared to make. This is once again evident from the way in which the IGC is going and from the expectations which are being expressed for Feira. In our opinion, the institutional reforms which it is hoped Feira will bring are sound but insufficient in our eyes. </p>
<p class="contents">We fear, for example, that the refusal to develop a true federal authority will result in a common foreign and security policy which cannot really function properly. The establishment of a rapid reaction military force, therefore, threatens to become an expensive alibi which could only lead to the rapid militarisation of conflicts. This would fit in perfectly with the new arms spiral which can be set in motion under the guise of the American rocket programme and with the backing of NATO and non-NATO countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Certainly, we expected more from this first stage of the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that the Portuguese Presidency has done everything in its power and that all thanks are due to it for the part it has played and for organising the Lisbon Summit last March. In any case, the Summit opened major avenues with regard to the new economy and in relation to the need to boost the European economy which is being held back by dirigisme and is still oppressed by statalism which is sending unemployment up to double the rates of other economies such as the United States. From the point of view of the institutions, the current impasse is certainly extremely serious.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the European Parliament is going to call strongly upon the Portuguese Presidency to uphold the need for integration, for political will, or the European Union crisis will become a general crisis, as Minister Joschka Fischer quite rightly pointed out yesterday. The warning signs are starting to become apparent in the paralysis which has affected us in recent months. Therefore: yes, we must extend the agenda of the Feira Council, and yes, we must make changes to the Conference’s tasks, otherwise we will not achieve our objective of enlargement and we will not reach any of the objectives which the French Presidency will be expecting to achieve in Nice.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The institutions of the European Union, and this House in particular, have still not grasped this very elementary insight. The Union train thunders off, taking no account of the terrain. The terrain is the people in the countries of Europe who have long since got off this Union train. We have no confidence in the Union project. We disassociate ourselves from the ideological agenda, which the motion for a resolution calls ambitious and which involves a disastrous undermining of democracy in the Member States. Deeper integration, the Treaty which is to become a constitution, the extension to the military, etc. But it does not pay to ignore the lie of the land. On 28 September of this year, the Danish people, who have the privilege of being able to vote in referenda, will send out a decisive signal when we vote against joining the euro. This ‘no’ vote will, first of all, mean that our friends and brethren in Sweden and Great Britain will also vote against and, secondly, it will send out a crucial signal to the summits in Feira and Nice to the effect that one ought to be guided by the terrain, which is more important than the ideological map. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Looking at the links between the various presidencies, that was an essential point, and the idea that ‘enhanced cooperations’ will henceforth be included on the agenda for that conference seems absolutely crucial to us.</p>
<p class="contents">We also think it is important to mention that the conference agenda is a full one, and we are expecting a positive result from it – a result which allows the European Union to operate in its present state. Some major issues have appeared on the scene since the conference was launched. They are essential, but they must not disrupt the conference agenda. We will debate those issues whatever happens. But these are two parallel exercises. Nothing should distract us from our real task at the Intergovernmental Conference, otherwise the Union will no longer be able to take decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">To be able to take decisions, we need significant progress on qualified majority voting. Enhanced cooperation cannot constitute an alternative. It is not a case of one or the other, we need both. The inclusion of enhanced cooperation on our Intergovernmental Conference agenda will force us to prolong the period of reflection. How are we going to organise democratic control of these ‘enhanced cooperations’? I also hope the Intergovernmental Conference agenda will be flexible enough for us to be in a position to add an item or two, here or there, depending on the progress of the work. I am thinking, of course, about the status of political parties. I am also thinking about the reform of Article 7.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, as you engage in this important debate in Feira, let me tell you how concerned we are about the drafting of the Charter. Our fellow citizens have high expectations of the content likely to emerge from the work of the convention. In the current state of affairs, I see great division in the interpretation of the mandate given to the members of the convention by the Cologne European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate initiated by President Herzog’s speech must clearly highlight the European Council’s commitment to the indivisibility of rights and the convention’s task of drafting a Charter rich in content, which respects the full Cologne mandate, civil and political rights, but also economic and social rights. Many of my colleagues say the Charter must be incorporated into the Treaty. Yes, but what use will it be to incorporate a Charter if the content is disappointing? First we must work on the content. That is our main task. But for that it seems to me we also need the debate at the Feira European Council to give us a political signal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, this is a very difficult subject, and one over which we will lament the passing of the Portuguese Presidency, for, at least on this point, it maintained a position which, if not crystal clear, was at least less negative.</p>
<p class="contents">The Feira Council will be a major Council if it is ambitious enough. The Presidency has just announced that closer cooperation will be discussed at the Intergovernmental Conference. However, there are many different ways of defining closer cooperation and, in our opinion, certain criteria must be respected. The first is total observance of the <span class="italic">acquis</span> <span class="italic">communautaire</span>; the second is the abolition of the right of veto for every Member State; the third is full respect of the roles of Parliament, the Commission and the Court of Justice in the decision-making procedures with regard to the initial introduction and implementation of closer cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Charter of Fundamental Rights should have been included in the subjects for debate, Minister. Let us hope that external pressure which will, I hope, increase, will be sufficient to bring it to your attention. This Charter will only be a success if it has binding legal status – its content must, of course, be sound, but it must also have legal status – or it will serve absolutely no purpose – and if it includes other new rights such as the right to a safe environment and a number of fundamental social rights such as the right to belong to a trade union and the right to strike.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you again, Portuguese Presidency. We urge you to be present, active and vigilant in the matters which are important to you: some of them are very important to us too.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would like to encourage you to do certain things in Feira.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of preparation for the decisions to be taken in December, it should once again be made clear in Feira that the enlargement process needs to be tailored to each individual country, so as to bring those countries which are best prepared into the European Union at an earlier stage.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to institutional issues, it should be made clear at the summit that enhanced cooperation cannot be used as an excuse for failing to introduce proper extension of qualified majority voting. As far as we are concerned, the extension of qualified majority voting will be a yardstick for the success of the Nice Summit, and it is linked with Parliament’s involvement through codecision. We need to achieve efficiency and legitimacy, that is very important. Furthermore, we urge you to extend the mandate of the Intergovernmental Conference such that it can be concluded in Nice but also so that certain important areas can be included.</p>
<p class="contents">An attempt must be made to make the Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding. It needs to be made clear that we need a voice in economic and monetary policy and democratic control of economic and monetary policy. Progress should at least be made with streamlining the treaties and demarcating competences. At this point I would particularly like to mention the common foreign and security policy, which follows on from the implementation of the conclusions of the Helsinki and Cologne Summits, and has made good progress under the Portuguese Presidency.</p>

Needless to say, we are addressing you personally in your role of Portuguese Presidency. We want at all costs to avoid this becoming an EU-wide issue or its becoming a formal item on the agenda. But we hope that you, in a creative manner and on an informal basis, will manage to find ways to talk about this at Feira. My group chairman has made reference to the situation in Denmark, namely the euro referendum. </p>
<p class="contents">Let us also look at the possible consequences if your efforts were not to lead to solutions. In my opinion, we will need to establish in time within the European Union that Feira has been a historic opportunity to solve this issue. I am therefore urging you to also assess the actions of the Austrian Government and to look for creative solutions in order to break the deadlock.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, many have already pointed to the need for enlargement and the fear that has swept countries in Central and Eastern Europe that, with regard to the IGC, too little progress is being made and that, along with this, the chance for rapid enlargement will pass. I would advise you to let the political will prevail in Feira too in order to let the enlargement go ahead. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, good governance is all well and good in theory, but let us also look at what is happening in practice. If the Kosovo agency in Thessaloniki is still caught up in so much red-tape that funding cannot be made available, then this is extremely serious. I would also call on the Portuguese Presidency to find a solution to this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

German Foreign Minister, Joschka Fischer, described the federation model which could be realised in approximately thirty-five years’ time, if such a thing is desired, but not the first steps that have to be taken in its construction. Tony Blair, whose government repeatedly prevents the taxation package from getting through, and José Maria Aznar, whose government blocks the notion of a European limited company, together declared that they approve of the economic structures of the European Union. Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schröder announced that their countries are prepared for deeper integration as a core group, failing, however, to illustrate its nature or extent. I wish to present my message clearly and to a purpose. It is: let us attend first – and also –to the basic and important matters.</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of the citizens of the Union the most important issue at the meeting in Feira, too, will be economic growth and employment in the EU area. That will best be dealt with by removing the remaining barriers to the real Internal Market and attending to the implementation of the Lisbon decisions, with state decisions and investment in infrastructure according to the Swedish model, without simply leaving everything to market forces and sighing with relief. We may well ask whether the new spectrum network auctions, worth hundreds of billions of euros, arranged by the states, are promoting a consumer-friendly future for networking. In the remote regions of the Union we are still wondering, after the Volvo-Scania episode, whether the Internal Market even exists, or is it so, in terms of competition legality, that only companies in the midst of the market may take advantage of the economics of corporate growth, and the sparsely populated remote regions are the markets for these privileged few. The candidate countries, on the other hand, must want to know what sort of Union they are joining in the ten or twenty year term. The big visions, on the one hand, and the Austrian boycott, on the other, cannot be creating a climate of any great confidence in these countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would urge you to see to it that the hearing you are to hold on the 19th with the President of the Convention, Mr Herzog, should not be a mere formality. It is not simply a question of listening to the President of the Convention, but also of listening to the actual problems which are being faced by the Convention at the moment, of asking what the final objective of the Charter is and of knowing how it is going to proceed.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it would be of great help to the Convention if, in its conclusions, the European Council could make a statement on the future of the Charter, because it appears at the moment that its formulation has demonstrated that the Charter is of interest to the people. The participation of the NGOs, the participation of ordinary people, clearly show that Europeans are interested in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The institutional questions of the Intergovernmental Conference are enormously important, but they do not reach the people. I believe that the Charter of Fundamental Rights does reach the people. The Charter must be the soul of the European Union and, therefore, at a time when we are discussing enlargement, I believe that the European Council – which has promoted the creation of the Charter – must send a clear political message: the Charter is going to be a very important element of the European Union. The Charter will be the soul of the European Union of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I pray that in the Feira conclusions, which we will all read with enormous interest, the Charter will receive the boost that it deserves, so that the Convention will be able to complete its work properly. In that way we will fulfil the mandate of Salvador de Madariaga, for whom Europe would become a reality only when it is a reality in the minds of the citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I congratulate the quality of the interventions of which the Presidency will take due note as it should. This European Council, as has been said, will have a very full agenda with the Intergovernmental Conference, the approval to include closer cooperation and other items. We must be aware that the whole Conference is set out according to the decisions taken in Amsterdam. This is not the definitive Intergovernmental Conference on the big reform of Europe. It is a Conference which has a specific mandate of technical refinement, particularly in terms of the decision-making systems, in order to allow enlargement. We also cannot allow third countries to believe that an excessive extension of the Conference is deliberately intended to guarantee an excessive delay in enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">The enlargement of the EU will be broadly consolidated at the European Council. This meeting will include a fairly positive progress report, a fundamental step forward for the Common European Security and Defence Policy, the application of the Information Technologies Programme for Europe, the adoption of the Action Plan for the Northern Dimension and the approval of the Common Strategy on the Mediterranean following the first two Association Councils with Palestine and Israel. It will also cover the definition of the external action programme in the area of justice and internal affairs, the White Paper on food safety, the European Charter for Small Enterprises, some important resolutions on economic and financial affairs, the entry of Greece into the euro and, as we would also want, a happy resolution of the problem of income taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a full agenda but one which shows how the European Union is advancing on all fronts. The EU has not been paralysed. On the contrary, it is advancing on both its internal fronts and also in external relations, which is extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of the Charter of Fundamental Rights has been raised here. I must stress that the European Union has adopted a methodology for drawing up this Charter which involves a convention. The work of this Convention has not yet been completed. The Convention will have to complete its work and decide on many aspects which have not yet been decided. These include determining whether the Charter is just a document setting out principles or whether it is to be incorporated in the Treaties, whether or not the Charter will be one of the primary examples of closer cooperation, how this will be applied to the citizens, whether just to native Europeans or to other residents in EU countries, or to foreigners or even illegal immigrants – this is a problem which has not yet been decided – how it will be linked to the European Convention on Human Rights and how it will be linked to the national courts and to the existing or remodelled European courts. All these points are extremely important. I understand the appeal made in this House but must point out that this is not a direct responsibility of this European Council. In order to take this issue forward, we have decided to invite the Chair of the Convention, Mr Herzog, to contribute to this high-level exchange of views which, I am sure, will stimulate the Convention’s work of drawing up the Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also say something on the Austria issue. As you know, this is a bilateral issue between 14 countries, which are also Member States, and one country which is a Member State too. However, this is not an EU issue or one for the EU bodies. No decision has been taken by any EU body although, naturally, we are all Member States. The Portuguese Presidency has always taken the precaution of making this distinction clear, that this was not an EU issue. On one hand this was to protect the normal operation of the European Union and the achievement of the EU agenda and on the other so as not to create any obstacle for Austria with regard to its full participation in the life of the EU and its bodies. Whenever any failure to abide by this principle has been pointed out to us, the Presidency has informed the bodies or institutions concerned to stop them acting in this way. This has been a constant concern. The Portuguese Prime Minister and I have been in contact with the other thirteen countries and with Austria and we are still doing this. I have asked the Members of this Parliament who raised the issue to be aware that it is very difficult to adopt a balanced approach to this problem if an immediate solution is demanded. I realise that the attitude adopted will have to include an element of phasing and that it is very difficult for a solution to this issue to be based on a diktat. A development may occur based on the maintenance of constant political attacks on people, political personalities and governments or even based on threats about stopping the operation and decisions of the European Union. In order to produce a window of opportunity in this issue, the political rhetoric that has surrounded it must be curbed, toned down or put on hold for the time being. Naturally, measures which were adopted in a diplomatic context through the consensus of the 14 Member States will only be able to change also through consensus between these 14 countries. The conditions for this consensus need to be created and we believe that, in this respect, Austria is creating conditions in order to solve this problem. Conditions also need to be created so that the 14 Member States can establish a new consensus. This must be borne in mind. I would call for your moderation and I very much respect the correct way, as Members of this Parliament, that you have raised this problem in this session and have considered it but it is also necessary to create the conditions so that there can be a window of opportunity. The following concept must be taken into account. The Feira European Council is an EU body and no window of opportunity can be opened at this meeting because we have to deal with the agenda and the areas of action of the EU. However, we can deal with this issue in a bilateral context before the European Council – and this is partly what we are trying to do – or after the European Council. But please do not expect the Feira European Council to deal with an item which is not on the agenda and which, if placed solely on the shoulders of the European Council, will end up prejudicing the arguments to which this problem has very rightly given rise here.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the assessment of our Presidency will be made here next week by the Portuguese Prime Minister. For my part I must also thank France and stress the way in which we have cooperated over the transition between presidencies. I especially thank the European Parliament, which has stimulated us in its role as a real parliamentary institution, throughout our Presidency, for all its cooperation on the European agenda and for the dynamic, lively, creative and constructive way in which, during these six months, it has carried out its duties as the parliamentary body of the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr President, the Commission is currently preparing for negotiations which should open before the end of the year for an association and stabilisation agreement with Croatia. In July we will have already drawn up the directives for undertaking these negotiations. Similarly, we have already begun to negotiate an agreement with Macedonia and we are thinking about negotiating another with Albania.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I cannot accept the suggestion from Mr Wurtz that the Commission is somehow being swept away by some kind of liberal tide. Mr President, the Commission is doing its duty and shouldering its responsibilities. This is particularly true when it is faithful to the guidelines and decisions of a European Council. That is what we are doing after Lisbon. But we are also doing so, Mr President, by remaining faithful to the letter and the spirit of the Treaties, and especially to one article in the Treaty which I have good reason to remember, the article guaranteeing the specific nature of public service missions.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the two requirements we are working to, and which we have worked to in particular in drafting the directive on postal services you alluded to, where I think a good balance has been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">It is more surprising that you criticised some commissioners for holding a dialogue with employers. It seems to me that we need to have such a dialogue with employers, and with trade unionists too, and non-governmental organisations, if we are to do our work properly. Mr Wurtz, you know very well that Brussels is not the only place, and I smile when I say this, where politicians of right or left meet employers. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I share the opinion expressed by Mr Cox and Mrs Berès on the deadlines that need to be respected in the great European debate. I am grateful to a number of major operators in the construction of Europe – Mr Fischer recently, and before him, Mr Delors and others – for opening up the debate. The worst things for the construction of Europe we are so committed to, ladies and gentlemen, are silence and secrecy, and in negotiating this reform with others, I have feared that silence. Mr Fischer and others have provided oxygen, a horizon. We need that oxygen, we need that horizon for the great European debate. But please, let us respect all the stages and work through them one by one. The first deadline to be met, as you said, Mr President, is the reform deadline so that we are in a good position to undertake enlargement and also so that other reforms can follow.</p>
<p class="contents">So let us keep to those deadlines and dedicate ourselves, in the few months that lie ahead, to success in the negotiations. I am not just saying complete them. I am talking about success. Success in Nice. And, as far as I am concerned, the quality of reform is more important than the timetable. Concluding successfully is more than simply concluding. With the Portuguese Presidency coming to an end and the French Presidency about to begin, we must now put all our energies into achieving real reform at Nice to make enlargement possible, as well as other reforms later, if need be.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should not allow this plenary session to pass without paying some attention to the fact that the Nobel laureate and Sakharov Prize winner, Aung San Suu Kyi, is still denied her freedom. It is exactly ten years since she and the National League for Democracy won that election which the dictators proceeded to completely ignore. There has been a whole decade of dictatorship in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Next Monday, Aung San Suu Kyi will be 55 years old. It is a very poignant birthday for her. In March, her husband died of cancer. He asked for permission to visit her to say goodbye to his dear wife. The military junta in Burma refused permission for him to see her.</p>
<p class="contents">These military dictators remain terrified of a small and gentle woman who has no malice, no uniforms or tanks to protect her. She and the people of Burma will not give up.</p>
<p class="contents">What I am asking today is for the European Parliament to do what she asks. She says: "Please use your liberty to support ours". I ask the President of this Parliament to write to the military junta in Burma to say: stop the human rights abuses, return to democracy and give freedom to Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>

It is fortunate that the directive which we voted on yesterday is so different in nature that we really do not need to expect a similar kind of judgement from the Advocate-General or from the Court.
