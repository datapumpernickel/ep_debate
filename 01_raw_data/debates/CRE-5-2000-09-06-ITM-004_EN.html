<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bouwman (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating a directive intended to fight marine pollution, and this will not be the only one this year. I am, of course, referring to the <span class="italic">Erika</span> directives which are due at a later stage. It would perhaps be a very nice start to the season and the French Presidency if this directive, along with the outcome of the conciliation between the Council and Parliament, in particular, were to be adopted today in Parliament. That is why I would like to say a word of thanks to the representatives of the Council, as well as to the Portuguese Presidency, which had a role to play, and also to the French Presidency, the Commission and the members of the conciliation committee, who were involved at the last stage.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have already discussed, at the heart of the proposal is, of course, the duty on the part of ships to report and to deliver waste. Ports are required to draw up waste-processing plans and to ensure that there are waste-processing plants or organisations that implement these plans. This is to prevent the problem of marine pollution from escalating to an even higher level than that at which it already stands. A recent study by KIMO Coast Watch has shown, for example, that there is still a growing volume of waste on beaches, that the sea is still being polluted and that state-of-the-art technology is being used to discharge sludge into the sea.</p>
<p class="contents">If we consider the waste processing plants which already exist in a number of ports, there is even a downward, rather than upward, trend in waste deliveries. Officially, according to MARPOL and other conventions, waste is required to be handed over. In practice, however, it appears that this does not happen. This was the reason why the Commission was right to come up with a directive which was the subject of conciliation not so long ago.</p>
<p class="contents">It might be useful, in this context, to highlight the outcome of the negotiations because, at the end of the day, we made a certain investment, and we must assess this investment jointly in order to be able subsequently to decide in this House whether or not we can go along with it. Eventually, what mattered most was the fee system, which is, in itself, not unimportant. It is important because we hope that by means of a fee system – leaving to one side the attendant obligations for a moment – ships will be coaxed into delivering waste. This is why we have had long debates with the Council, and the Commission was a great help in ensuring that the financial incentives were incorporated into this system in one way or another.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s suggestion was for a figure of 90%, which we would like to collect by means of port dues in one way or another. During committee discussions, we took a more lenient approach but, ultimately, decided to start the negotiations with this figure. For a long time, the Council had decided neither to incorporate the word “significant” in this sense, nor to include the percentage figure. However, certainly in the light of the review clause which has already been the subject of discussion, it is important ultimately to specify the amount.</p>
<p class="contents">You may well ask yourself why this percentage would be of any significance? For the simple reason that if we were to endorse and adopt the polluter-pays principle, each and every ship could then pay at the port but could also decide simply to dump the waste at sea. In other words, this principle is not very effective in this case. This is why we have abandoned it and believe that a fee system as explained should be introduced. We support the percentage which has now been agreed upon, or at least the interpretation laid down in the Commission statement, namely 30%, certainly in the light of the review clause which has been adopted. In this clause, it is agreed that, three years after the entry into force of the directive, it will be examined whether the volume of waste delivery has increased or whether a situation has been created which requires either a higher percentage level or a review of the system. We can go along with this.</p>
<p class="contents">It may be useful to indicate that we were able to reach agreement on the 25% of inspections to which we aspire, as well as a provision for delays which can arise when waste is being delivered. In the main, national legislation prevails in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">A few exceptions have been made for small ships, not so much on the basis of the length but on the basis of the number of passengers they carry i.e. twelve. This means that, although they do not have a notification duty, they must, of course, deliver waste. Small ports will need to make a considerable effort to accommodate this directive in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to note that, with regard to traditional sailing ships, whose exemption we initially secured by drafting a specific list, we have now decided to apply the Marpol convention to them with regard to sewage.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank everyone, and my fellow committee members, in particular. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The significance of the directive resides first and foremost in the fact that all Member States will be obliged to ensure that port reception facilities are set up, within the next two years, in all ports subject to this requirement. Captains will also be obliged to use these facilities. We hope that the rationale behind these two commitments will lead to a reduction in the amount of ship-generated waste deposited illegally in the sea, thus strengthening the marine environment and also improving competition between ports.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the conciliation procedure was successful in the end, for we did at least manage to secure our demand for ships to have to pay a significant contribution towards the costs of the facilities, irrespective of how much they make use of them. Parliament would rather have succeeded with its demand for ‘significant’ to represent at least 90%, as this would have satisfied us, and there would no longer be any financial interest whatsoever in simply dumping waste at sea. After all, if ships had to pay anyway, then they might as well use the facilities. Sadly, the Council could not bring itself to accept this logical, no special fee provision, hence our reservation against the directive. And we hope that if it becomes apparent that ships are continuing to discharge waste into the sea, the Commission will propose an amendment at the revision stage in three years’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, Madam Vice-President, we are grateful to you for the fact that your statement – which is, after all, of crucial importance – does at least, in effect, secure a bottom line of 30% as the amount agreed by the Council and Parliament, and we are relying on the Council to act on your statement accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as my honourable friend has already said, we have scored two other victories for marine protection and the citizens of the European Union. Firstly, we have stipulated that 25% of all commercial shipping will in fact be obliged to undergo inspection, in order to ensure that waste disposal is being carried out in accordance with the regulations. MARPOL is all well and good but not when it stays on the bookshelf! We will only be able to protect the sea if we actually monitor whether waste disposal has taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have put pressure on the Member States to meet their obligation to actually set up these port reception facilities. We have ensured that Member States will be required to introduce compensation measures, in case ships are forced to remain in ports unnecessarily, simply because there are no waste disposal facilities available, or they are inadequate. In this way, although the ships will have to pay, they will also be protected.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, on a final note, I would like, on behalf of my group, to thank the committee chairman, Mr Hatzidakis, and the rapporteur, Mr Bouwman, for their committed and successful handling of these negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, it is a good day for Europe’s seas, as it for you personally, Mr President, because I know you are a keen diver. We would all be delighted if you had even cleaner waters to dive in in Europe. But the sea is our primary concern.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we are in a position to congratulate each other today. We can congratulate both the rapporteur, Theo Bouwman, and the delegation, because we have succeeded in improving some crucial aspects of the directive, or should I say, the Council’s common position. It had been watered down, and I believe Parliament has secured coherent measures for all concerned</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, mention has been made of the fact that all ports will have to provide reception facilities for waste and cargo residues. This is an important step. Secondly, all ships will have to pay, irrespective of whether or not they use the facilities. That is the real principle that is being brought into play here for the first time. The sums involved will not be small; they will be considerable. It is true that we cannot be completely satisfied with 30%. That much is absolutely clear. Nevertheless, the 30% introduces and establishes the principle of a ‘no special fee system’. Naturally there is room for improvement, but with this principle in place, every one will have to pay their way.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, all Member States must carry out checks on at least 25% of shipping. I believe we should urge them to exceed the 25%. We should challenge them to increase the number of checks. After all, on so many occasions, we have been forced to recognise that, where ships docked at ports are concerned – take the ‘<span class="italic">Erika</span>’ for example, or other ships – monitoring is one of the crucial issues. If there is no monitoring, there is no point in having any regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">On balance, the point of this directive is that the criminal discharge of waste on the high seas will no longer be as profitable as it used to be. I also feel that marine pollution should no longer be treated as a trivial offence. Europe’s seas are becoming cleaner, which will benefit the flora and fauna, and not least, the fishing industry. This directive will also have a very positive effect on tourism, in the long run, for it will scarcely be possible to sustain tourism if there are no clean beaches. So it is a good day for Europe’s seas and also a good day for you, Mr President.</p>

In this way, differences of opinion between the Council and Parliament, which are a regular occurrence, need no longer be settled unilaterally. This procedure has proven to be worthwhile in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The conditions for the delivery of waste by ships at Community ports have been the topic of many a discussion. On previous occasions, Parliament had stressed the importance of including certain elements and, fortunately, the Council has, sometimes after pressure has been put upon it, taken on board the significance of these points.</p>
<p class="contents">Right until the very end, however, there has been one main contentious issue, namely the ships’ own contributions toward the cost of collecting waste. The European Parliament was of the opinion that the user should cover the lion’s share of the costs that he has given rise to but made provision for a scale of different charges and made every effort to discourage illegal dumping in the process. Accordingly, it came up with a percentage level for own contributions which far exceeded 50%.</p>
<p class="contents">The outcome of the negotiations is nowhere near the agreed percentage, which is regrettable. However, I do believe that simply quoting a percentage is a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I will be backing this report, albeit not with much enthusiasm. I would like to thank the rapporteur for having invested so much energy in this project. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am fully in agreement with the outcome of the conciliation procedure and I would like to commend both Mr Bouwman and the other Members who sat on the Conciliation Committee and Mrs de Palacio and her services for ensuring that we worked together to achieve this positive outcome. I think that the outcome of our work will finally help to improve the quality of our seas, tourism and the quality of life of the citizens of Europe. It is a step forward. I believe that we are now protecting the environment more effectively than hitherto, although I do admit this could have come about in a better way. But, here we are. If we see that the new system is not working as effectively as we believed it could work, we can review it.</p>
<p class="contents">Since we had to go to conciliation, as Chairman of the Conciliation Committee, I would like to take this opportunity to say that I would prefer to avoid such procedures as far as possible. But this requires the Council, which must abandon its tradition of secrecy, to cooperate better with the European Parliament and to speak more openly. Only in this way can the work of the Commission and our own work progress more quickly, especially in our own committee, where there are many issues that directly affect our citizens. I hope that this tradition will change under the French Presidency. In any event, we are all in favour of better cooperation and the speedier progress of the work of the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Especially with regard to fees, the important thing is that agreement was reached that the ships would pay part of the cost of waste disposal regardless of whether they use the port facilities or not. This will prevent difficulties arising for many ports and ships. It is clear that this substantially reduces the incentive to discharge at sea. It also leaves each port the option of having its own charging policy. Let us not forget that the European ports in the Mediterranean face competition from the ports of North Africa, whereas the Baltic or North Sea ports do not face any competition. What is more, the possibility of amending the system to cover additional costs, should this prove necessary during its implementation, is guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">The essential thing is that, by approving the joint text under debate, we will have a directive that will protect our seas and coastlines from pollution caused by ships, and we will also have enhanced the image of the European Union as a standard-bearer for environmental policy and as an example for the rest of the world to follow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is obviously an extraordinarily large step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it is worrying that, right up to the end, there have been those who have tried to thwart what is obviously the right step. This is shown by the fact that a third reading has been required and that a conciliation committee has had to be set up, as well as by the lack of commitment on the part of large sections of the Council of Ministers. It also has to be said that what we have achieved today is a compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">In the original proposal, almost all portions of the costs were covered by port fees in accordance with the system which has been in existence for a long time in parts of the Baltic. This means that there was an economic motive for a vessel to leave waste oil in a port rather than dump it in the sea. Now, only portions of the cost are to be covered in this way, while an extraordinarily large part of the cost is to become a further additional cost for the ship owner.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, it remains to be seen what effects this will have. I believe it is very important that we should be prepared to keep track of developments and make further decisions on this, if need be. The evaluation envisaged in the Conciliation Committee’s proposal and the monitoring of vessels which is to take place are therefore extraordinarily advantageous. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watts (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bouwman, for his efforts over quite a long period of time in negotiating this very satisfactory proposal which will – as all colleagues have said so far – significantly reduce the amount of pollution dumped illegally into the seas around Europe. Let us pause and reflect on the scale of the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bouwman quite rightly referred to <span class="italic">Erika</span>. This was indeed a tragedy of enormous proportions, with significant and perhaps enduring consequences, but the amount of deliberate spills from oil tankers along all our coasts dwarfs the amount of oil that was spilled from <span class="italic">Erika</span>. It is that problem that this particular proposal aims to tackle. I am delighted that it will, by ensuring that the Member States provide adequate facilities at all their ports, that their ships and masters are obliged to use them, that the fees system is fair and balanced and above all that 25% of ships are inspected to ensure these requirements are met.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcome the three-year review, because my only concern is that Member States should implement this legislation that they have now signed up to. As Mr Jarzembowski will know only too well, on port state control several Member States still do not inspect 25% of ships. If they cannot do it on that, what is to say they will do it on this? That is our challenge to them: to make sure they adhere to the very worthy agreement that we are hopefully going to be endorsing this week. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is indeed a very important date in maritime history. A number of our colleagues have said that this text is a precursor to the <span class="italic">Erika</span> package and, in many respects, it aims to solve a problem that is even more serious. This problem concerns acts of ecological piracy, when ships discharge waste at sea, discharging hydrocarbons and a huge amount of waste onto our shorelines. It is also a victory for Parliament over the Council’s reluctance to imposing a common-sense fee-paying system. The principle of polluter pays is not working in the case in point, because the polluter cannot be identified.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to settle this issue, we must move towards a universal fee system, which will be mandatory and not linked to the act of waste treatment. I am among those who, in their capacity as French Members of Parliament, have made every effort to ensure that this text is published, even acting against the sympathies of their government towards this text or against its reservations. I am among those who welcome this compromise. But this compromise cannot be allowed to become a let-out. It must be implemented and its implementation must be strictly monitored at the level of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I would like to give you the position of a Frenchman who has worked so hard, despite the reluctance of his government. It is clear that this text currently favours large ports and puts small ports, which are not equipped, at a disadvantage. I therefore call on the Council to help Member States equip small ports, possibly in the framework of the Structural Funds, or in the form of some kind of loan, because small ports are also important elements of national and regional development and of regional and local economies. And I believe that, if we provide small ports with waste treatment plants, we will secure the success of this directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not normally make a habit of doing this here in Parliament but, since there is good reason for doing so on this occasion, I would thank the rapporteur and the others who have worked on this report.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Stenmarck said, we are familiar with this system from the cooperation that has taken place in the Baltic. Since March 1998, the Baltic Recommendation has taken such a system for granted. I should like to say, however, that the agreement is in certain respects a disappointment in the perspective of what has happened in the Baltic. I should also like to refer to the law we have passed in Finland which stipulates that the fee ought not to depend upon how much waste the vessel leaves at the port. In Finland, we have had such a system for waste oil since 1 June. In that respect, the agreement is a disappointment.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last few days, we have learned that, even when it comes to grey water and pollution which is eutrophic in its effects, intentional and unintentional discharges from vessels are the main sources of pollution in the Baltic. We are used to the fact that the polluter-pays principle does not operate in the case of oil, but there are problems too when it comes to eutrophy caused in other ways.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware that everyone has been exposed to tough lobbying from the port organisation in Europe which has consistently set its face against this proposal. The outcome is, therefore, nonetheless a good one. However, it will be extremely important to follow up the proposal. The Commissioner is known to have a major interest in the sea and in obtaining a clean environment. It is important that the follow-up should be carried out seriously so that any supplementary measures can be taken, if need be. This is a first step, but I would observe that it is important that we should have stricter conditions for the Baltic, which is perhaps far and away the most sensitive inland sea in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This report goes some way to preventing marine pollution because it deals with ships that discharge waste at sea. These acts are not covered by the media in the same way as shipwrecks, but they nevertheless make up most of the pollution of our seas.</p>
<p class="contents">We must however recognise that Community legislation would not be necessary if the Member States of the European Union, who are all signatories to Marpol, the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, had taken the necessary steps. Nor is it enough to accuse unscrupulous shipowners or captains; we must bear in mind that it is often impossible to discharge waste inside the ports, due to the lack of appropriate facilities. The problem of waste storage is also extremely difficult to solve, as this in turn gives rise to the problem of waste treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, it is difficult to believe that, in an age when agricultural installations are monitored by satellite, it is so difficult to monitor a ship discharging waste at sea.</p>
<p class="contents">We will, however, vote for this report, because it seems to be moving towards better prevention of pollution and because, wishing to remain at a general level, it leaves Member States a certain latitude in their choice of implementation tools. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Like previous speakers, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Bouwman, on the excellent work he has done. During this time he has combined steadfastness with flexibility and intelligence to achieve a result which is acceptable to all the institutions and which will serve to make our seas cleaner.</p>
<p class="contents">I must tell you, for example, that this summer, one of the items in the news in the country I know best, Spain, involved the southern coastlines being affected by the pollution resulting from oil tankers cleaning our their holds in international waters. This is one of the 100 000 cases which occur throughout the year on Europe’s coastlines. What we have to do is find out how we can, if not end, then at least limit as far as possible, given the capacity we have, these harmful effects on our seas. In order to end it, we would have to reconsider Maritime Law which, to a large extent, originates from the maritime situation of the 17th and 18th Centuries, which bore no relation to the current situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we have made a great deal of progress which will noticeably improve the marine environment in the face of the deliberate contamination by certain ships – because not all of them do this sort of thing – of our coastlines.</p>
<p class="contents">The current version of this directive has the support of everybody. It has the support of the shipowners because it provides them with waste facilities, which already exist in some European ports but unfortunately not in all of them, particularly not in the smaller ports, where the Member States will have to make significant investments. This version of the directive has the support of the ports, because it means that their investments in this type of facility will not put them at a competitive disadvantage, which has unfortunately been the case at times, since some ports have made considerable efforts and others have not. It has the support of those sectors which are most sensitive to the problem of residues and the fight for sustainable development. I believe that the whole of this House and also the representatives of the Council and the Commission are included in this group, not only the ecologists, but all those who are concerned about this type of problem.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that issues such as the planning of residue management, the ships’ delivery obligations, prior notification, the controls – 25% of the controls –, fees which incentivise the use of port facilities for cleaning the holds of ships, will necessarily contribute to a reduction in marine pollution. This directive, of course, enjoys the support of the three institutions, the Commission, the Council and Parliament, because we know that it will mean something positive for our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It would have been very sad if we had been unable to reach this agreement, which was so longed-for by everyone. I would like to thank the Council for its flexibility and its constructive will, and Parliament also, especially the rapporteur, for the work carried out over this period and during the conciliation procedure. The Commission has obtained some commitments which have helped this agreement. These commitments enable us to specify that “significant” means that at least 30% of the costs of the cleaning of holds in ports must be covered in a general sense, whether or not these port facilities are used. If over the next three years we see that the Member States’ actions are not sufficient and the desired results are not obtained, the Commission reserves the right to present a new directive clearly establishing a minimum percentage which must be covered by the general fees or by an obligatory cleaning fee in the various European ports. It is also the Commission’s responsibility to verify that that control of 25%, another key element of this directive, is carried out by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like once again to thank Parliament for standing firm on the need for a strengthened mechanism for reviewing the fees system, which will undoubtedly allow us to move forward and make a detailed study of the current system which we have implemented and the consequences for the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it has already been said in the debates that we have suffered from the impact of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> tragedy, but the cleaning out of holds is equivalent to more than one <span class="italic">Erika </span>each year on Europe’s coastlines. We are, therefore, taking a great step forward today. This does not mean that we are not going to move forward on issues relating to oil tankers and safety in the transport of polluting materials, such as oil and its derivatives, issues which we hope will not only make progress in this House and the Council, but which will also be supplemented by means of additional initiatives which, as the Commission has stated, will be presented shortly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are in Parliament today and tomorrow to raise awareness of the former Soviet empire's nuclear testing programme which impacted not just severely but hugely on their country. They had 607 nuclear explosions in the atmosphere between 1949 and 1990. This has left part of their country completely devastated and I hope Parliament will give them a sympathetic hearing in the seminar they are holding here this afternoon. They have a huge problem in raising world awareness of this former Soviet problem. We shall also be discussing the problems of the submarine that sank, another part of the nuclear legacy that has been left by the Soviet Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
