<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Tindemans </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (NL)</span> Mr President, as the House will appreciate, we are dealing here with a very serious matter, namely KEDO and relations with North Korea, a country which is totally isolated at present and which is in the grip of acute food shortages. So this is a most serious debate. I shall confine myself to three points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, KEDO itself. We have already held one debate in Parliament to discuss an initial tranche of funding. KEDO came into being as a result of a project to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons in North Korea and draw North Korea more closely into the international community. In 1993, there was a fear that North Korea might obtain nuclear materials from its Soviet‐type nuclear facilities, graphite moderator reactors, with a view to putting them to military use. This fear was further intensified by the North Korean threat to leave the nuclear non‐proliferation treaty. An agreement was concluded with the United States whereby North Korea would freeze its nuclear programme and possibly close down its nuclear facilities, in exchange for the building of two light water reactors and in the meantime receiving supplies of heavy fuel oil.</p>
<p class="contents">So KEDO was a US initiative, although South Korea and Japan helped to carry it out. It may seem odd to seek non‐proliferation by building two new nuclear facilities. But these facilities, light water reactors, are not only safer to operate but also harder to use for military purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union was then launching its new strategy for Asia, to develop better relations between Europe and Asia. Membership of KEDO was therefore consistent with this policy and was intended to improve security in north‐east Asia. It would also show solidarity with our Asian allies and might also bring economic benefits to European industry through the US involvement, since European firms would be eligible for KEDO contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">The foreign policy aspects of joining KEDO are therefore significant. Parliament"s Foreign Affairs Committee devoted 18 months and lengthy discussions to preparing a report which was as complete and accurate as possible. It also worked with the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Research. The other committees directly concerned by this report favour joining KEDO and think that Parliament should do its job and make that accession possible, including in financial terms.</p>
<p class="contents">I must take this opportunity of saying straight away that we were able to work extremely well with the Committee on Research and Technology and the Committee on Budgets, with Mr Ford and Mr Brinkhorst. It was a delight, and often when the three of us consulted, we were all in agreement on the conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">There was one problem. The Council decided that the accession agreement would be concluded under Euratom. The treaty on which Euratom is based does not contain any obligation to inform or consult the European Parliament. The Council and Commission undertook to do that on a voluntary basis. But European membership of KEDO will mean expenditure using funds from the budget. The three committees and the House as a whole realised this, and so there was a chance that this spending might not be approved unless agreement could be reached to involve Parliament in future international agreements concluded under the Euratom Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, Mr President, thanks to contacts and an exchange of letters, we have already reached agreement on the first tranche which I mentioned. But now what do we find? We, the three rapporteurs plus an official, visited North Korea from 5 to 14 December. On 15 December a new agreement was signed by Euratom, that is to say with the involvement of the European institutions, an agreement with Canada. I am no troublemaker. I do not want to stir things up unnecessarily, but this is totally unacceptable for a directly elected Parliament which has responsibilities and which has to answer to its voters. We cannot agree to the conclusion of something like this, since we shall be required to pay for it, since we shall have to authorise the expenditure for it. We cannot accept that unless we are properly informed and consulted.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been a flurry of activity over this in the last few days, but I shall not dwell on that. In the Foreign Affairs Committee, Commissioner Brittan made a statement which gave us the impression that we were moving towards an agreement. We have now seen a letter this afternoon to the President of Parliament, signed by Sir Leon Brittan, telling us how the Commission plans to handle such matters in the future. I am pleased to say at this point that we are quite happy with this letter. We are also reassured by what Sir Leon said in the committee about how some paragraphs are to be interpreted, so we are able today to commend the entire KEDO dossier to the House.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is one more point I would like to make. When we were in North Korea we had some quite fascinating encounters, we three rapporteurs and the official accompanying us. Clearly we were going ask for meetings with the leading figures, and we got them. We talked, sometimes at considerable length, with the president of the National Assembly, the foreign minister, the deputy foreign minister, the energy minister, the spokesman‐general for the army, and so on. We got a fair impression of how things are. As I said, there are acute food shortages in this country. It is totally isolated. We came to the conclusion that humanitarian aid has to continue and that cooperation with the authorities there must improve, so that the help we offer can be more effective. We naturally came to the conclusion that we must do everything possible to prevent proliferation, to coax the country out of its isolation and into the family of nations, and that KEDO can help to achieve that. We think the Koreans would be prepared, if invited by the House, to meet with Members of Parliament here, and with the specialist committees. We advocate this in the motion for a resolution we have tabled. And we think that better diplomatic contacts may produce results. Of the 15 Member States of the European Union, only Sweden has an embassy – just Sweden, none of the others. Might the Koreans not open a liaison office here? Might we not strengthen our diplomatic presence there, with the European Union taking an initiative to that end? We advocate both these things. But I will say no more on that particular subject.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point concerns the two questions asked by Mr Spencer. Perhaps I can just quote them. They are as follows: in the light of the recent establishment of a political dialogue with North Korea, will the Council state its views on the possibility and desirability of further developing relations between the European Union and its Member States and North Korea? How does the Council assess the current security situation in north‐east Asia? What discussions on this situation have been held, or are likely to be held, with the Republic of Korea, Japan and the United States?</p>
<p class="contents">His second question was: ‘in the light of the recent establishment of a political dialogue with North Korea, will the Commission state its views on the possibility and desirability of further developing relations between the European Union and its Member States and North Korea? How does the Commission assess the current security situation in north‐east Asia? What discussions on this situation have been held, or are likely to be held, with the Republic of Korea, Japan and the United States?</p>

<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Brinkhorst </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR), </span><span class="italic">draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. ‐</span> Mr President, I am speaking in two capacities – for the Liberal Group and also for the Committee on Budgets. It is quite ironic that on the same day that we are debating the consequences of the resignation of the Commission, we should also be discussing the question of KEDO. The Committee on Budgets, in a sense, has been the auxiliary committee. For us it was very clear when the Council decided unilaterally at the end of February 1996 that KEDO would be supported by financial resources entered in the budget, that the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, which had not been not consulted, should give its opinion. That story has taken quite some time and still at the present time there is a reserve in the European Union budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The fundamental reason has to do with the debate which we had earlier today. It has to do with democracy and accountability. Therefore, it has to do with the question of whether in the future we will have the possibility in this Parliament of discussing the very fundamental question – as all normal national parliaments do. The Euratom Treaty is 40 years old. It provides very extensive powers to the Commission and the Council. It provides no powers to Parliament. So, when the Commission chose to enter into the agreement, it chose Article 101 of the Euratom Treaty and this Treaty does not provide even for consultation with or information to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">It is on those grounds – and I say this unabashedly – that the Committee on Budgets decided to put the resources in reserve until the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy were adequately involved. We have been acting on behalf of these two committees. In substance it is very clear that it is not the Committee on Budgets that will decide whether or not we should enter into an agreement on energy cooperation with North Korea. It is against that background that we are pleased to hear that the Commission recognises that the times are changing. We look forward to hearing Sir Leon Brittan, on behalf of the Commission, reading out the results of the discussions we have had and which I hope will lead to a situation where we will have more accountability on Euratom matters in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">It is again very ironic that on a day like this the Council is not even represented at political level and it shows that maybe the next battle for democracy will not be with the Commission but with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking on behalf of the Liberal Group, we welcome the fact that the European Union has a strategic energy and foreign policy involvement in North‐East Asia. We also welcome the very active involvement of Sir Leon Brittan on behalf of the Commission. It is against that background that we were deeply disappointed that it was not possible to find an adequate institutional arrangement for this particular point earlier. The Liberal Group fully supports Mr Tindemanns' view that it is not only with South Korea but also with North Korea that a new relationship should be developed.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask one question of Sir Leon. This morning in the <span class="italic">International Herald Tribune </span> there was a strong plea for a new approach to North Korea. Apparently the Japanese are more reserved than the South Koreans. We should strongly support the ‘sunshine" policy of President Kim Dae Jung who has suffered more than anyone in South Korea from the tensions which have existed for more than 40 years between South and North Korea. It is against that background that we would like to give our support to a KEDO agreement and also to new relations between Western Europe and North Korea.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Ford </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span><span class="italic">draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy. ‐</span> Mr President, like Mr Brinkhorst I am also speaking in two capacities, firstly on behalf of the committee, and secondly on behalf of the Socialist Group. Firstly, I should like to congratulate my two companions in this long endeavour: Mr Brinkhorst and Mr Tindemanns. We started this process on 21 November 1997. If I had known I was going to spend so long with them I would have checked with more care who they were going to be. However, I could not have picked two better companions. We spent a whole week together in North Korea and ten and a half hours in meetings with the deputy foreign minister. This would have produced any personality clashes there might have been.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, I should like to thank Sir Leon Brittan for all his efforts to try to reach an agreement between the Commission and the European Parliament. It has been a long, hard road. I will not go into the detail because the points have been raised by the two previous speakers. We now have an agreement that I think Parliament can accept on the basis of the letter which has been sent today. I am deeply disappointed that the Council of Ministers, which apparently accepted an oral question for debate on relations with the DPRK, has failed to send anybody to participate in the debate. Perhaps they have been delayed and I should be glad to hear from you, Mr President, if that is the case. I presume we are expected to work out the Council's view on these matters by some form of telepathy.</p>
<p class="contents">KEDO, as you have been told, is a project to build two light water reactors to substitute for Russian design Chernobyl‐style reactors that were under construction in the DPRK and which have the ability to produce weapons‐grade plutonium. To try and resolve that problem we have the US‐DPRK Framework Agreement of 1995. The European Union was asked to contribute to that and this is what this comes from. The Research Committee's view was one of critical support. We have a series of concerns. Firstly, a financial hole it still exists. Japan's contribution of US$1 billion and the Republic of Korea's 60 % and the European Union's US$85m do not make up the full cost of the project. It is unclear how the gap is going to be bridged.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are concerned about how the United States is delivering the promised heavy fuel oil which is meant to act as a bridge until these two nuclear reactors come on line. It is being fitfully delivered. North Korea is a deeply suspicious country. We in the European Union might understand that the checks and balances of the US constitution mean that President Clinton cannot always clearly deliver on his promises but we can hardly be surprised that the North Koreans take a different view when, in the coldest month of the year and when energy is most needed, there was a failure to deliver heavy fuel oil to the Sonbong oil‐fired power plant.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we are concerned about the fact that KEDO is a bat without a ball. There is no money being put forward to connect the two nuclear power stations into the North Korean grid system. This is only going to cost $100m or $200m, comparatively small beer compared to what is being spent on the KEDO project as a whole, but, clearly, if you do not have the bat and the ball, you cannot play the game. Fourthly, we are concerned about the lack of clarity on the allocation of these enormously large contracts and whether European industry is going to get a fair opportunity to bid. Despite these reservations the Research Committee voted in favour of the programme. We believe that, overall, it serves our best interests as a Parliament and as a European Union in demonstrating our role in East Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate is not only about Mr Tindemann's KEDO report. It also refers to two oral questions to the Council and the Commission with respect to future relations with the DPRK. We have been supplying humanitarian aid for some years following a series of natural disasters – flood, drought and tidal waves – that tipped what was a barely sufficient North Korea firmly into the red as far as food production was concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">There is severe malnutrition in North Korea. A recent World Food Programme report indicated that 16 % of children between the ages of 1 and 6 are so badly malnourished that they suffer from permanent brain damage; 45 % of children are so badly nourished that they will be permanently stunted. So, 300 000 to 400 000 0‐6‐year olds are permanently brain‐damaged and 1 000 000 0‐6‐year olds are permanently stunted. Therefore, I welcome the new agreement to supply further food aid of something over ECU 30m and to target children under 12 and lactating mothers.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the agreement by the North Koreans on monitoring. After the events of last week it is vital for us in Parliament to be assured that the Commission is spending the money in the appropriate ways. I welcome also the assistance on agriculture – new techniques and maybe even new crops. I am disappointed, however, that nothing is being done in the non‐nuclear energy sector. While I was there on the delegation I visited a coalmine and a thermal power station. Firstly, there was no power so the coalminers had to be evacuated. No coal would therefore be produced over an eight‐hour shift and the power station only had three days' supply. Both were extremely primitive and I speak as someone whose family were coalminers in the United Kingdom in the 1950s. Compared to the cost of KEDO, one‐tenth of 1 % of the KEDO project would boost productivity in the coalmining industry – it has been estimated – by something like 25 %, and modernise elements of coal‐fired power production.</p>
<p class="contents">On the political side I welcome the result of the Council's low level political dialogue with the DPRK and support the idea of a second meeting when the time is right. I welcome the Commission's communication on Korea calling for critical engagement. All I ask is that we move quickly. The situation is critical. We should not miss an opportunity. I know the North Koreans have asked for a liaison office to be opened in Brussels. I hope we can agree that can happen, subject to reciprocity in Pyongyang, and that subject to the necessary agreements we can move on to more developed relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I welcome the paragraph in the report that asks for a delegation to come here from the DPRK's Parliament. We will have hard and difficult negotiations with them but the dialogue has to start somewhere.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Brittan, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. ‐</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I say first of all that I am pleased that the general issue regarding Parliament's role in Euratom agreements has been settled and I can assure you that the Commission services will implement the practical arrangements we have arrived at. Before setting those out, I want to say that I very much agree with what Mr Tindemanns said about the role of KEDO as part of our Asian strategy and being an important contribution to it. We will come to North Korea in a moment but we have to look at our policy with regard to the region as one which has to be integrated, comprehensive and positive. As far as the problems we have had with Euratom agreements, I am grateful for what has been said about my own role in resolving them. I can assure you that I absolutely agree with Mr Brinkhorst that times have changed and we have to reflect that in what we are doing.</p>
<p class="contents">The measures the Commission intends to take are set out in a letter that I have sent to the President of the European Parliament today. That letter states first that at the beginning of each year, the Commission will provide a list of all the relevant Euratom agreements under Article 101(2) which are under negotiation or for which negotiations are to be launched in the coming year. This list will be regularly updated and forwarded to Parliament under the necessary conditions of confidentiality. Secondly, the Commission will provide oral information on request to the relevant parliamentary committee on the conduct of the negotiations under the necessary conditions of confidentiality.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Commission will forward the proposals for conclusion of the relevant Euratom agreements to the Parliament at the same time as they are forwarded to the Council for approval. That is a significant procedural innovation since it provides a guarantee to Parliament that it will be informed before the Council has taken a position on the conclusion of these agreements. Thus Parliament will have the opportunity to make its views known before a decision is taken to conclude the agreement in line with the commitments made in our earlier exchange of letters.</p>
<p class="contents">I should add that the time it takes for the Council to reach a decision on conclusion is generally fairly lengthy. That leaves ample time for Parliament to express its view if it so wishes. In those cases where the Council may wish to take a particularly rapid decision, the Commission will duly inform the Parliament of this possibility. Fourthly, by way of a letter, information will be provided on the relevant agreements under Article 101(2) Euratom which are currently either under negotiation or for which a decision or conclusion has not yet been taken. The agreements referred to represent all agreements covered by Article 101(2) Euratom which are under negotiation or for which negotiations are to be launched in the coming year.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in order to ensure that there is no further misunderstanding between the Commission and Parliament, the Commission will also convey separately to the Parliament all relevant texts and agreements which should have been covered by our understanding during the latter half of last year and the beginning of this year. That is what the letter says.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to the report on the KEDO Accession Agreement it is a well‐presented and interesting document which addresses the fundamental aspects of the KEDO initiative. The visit of the parliamentary delegation to North Korea was regarded in a very positive way by the international community and I am grateful for the degree of attention Parliament has given to KEDO. I particularly endorse the conclusion which states that Parliament considers that the European Union should play a role in reducing the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation, increasing nuclear safety and encouraging the development of better relations between the DPRK and its neighbours and that membership of KEDO will enable it the better to play that role.</p>
<p class="contents">We are fully playing that role in the implementation of the Accession Agreement. We attend all KEDO board meetings and negotiating meetings with North Korea. The EU has staff in KEDO, including at director level, is following the procurement aspects – and here I can assure Mr Ford that we have every intention of ensuring that Europe gets a fair crack of the whip – and Europe has the chairmanship of the important International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group. We are paying our financial contribution which helps to ensure that the DPRK respects its non‐proliferation pledges and we were pleased to note that the DPRK is now going to allow access to the so‐called underground facility so as to allay international concerns. Security aspects are fundamental to peace and stability on the peninsular and the KEDO project is contributing to reconciliation between the two Korean governments. Indeed, it is a unique example of South and North Koreans working together.</p>
<p class="contents">KEDO itself is a special organisation where we are cooperating actively with our American, Japanese and South Korean partners to help improve security in North‐East Asia. North Korea is also aware of our involvement not only through KEDO but also via the political dialogue which I shall refer to in answer to the question and by the European Union food aid programme. Indeed, it is the case that the Commission negotiators have recently reached an <span class="italic">ad referendum</span> agreement with their DPRK counterparts on conditions for a new EUR30m aid programme for 1999. So we are contributing to a process of engagement with North Korea, seeking to encourage it to become a more responsible member of the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to be realistic. There is an important, difficult and ongoing task to ensure security in North‐East Asia and underpin the global non‐proliferation regime. KEDO is a key part of that task and we will continue to remain in close contact with Parliament in the implementation of our participation in it. We will have to start preparing soon for the future of our participation in KEDO because the current agreement expires at the end of the year 2000 and we will be in close contact with Parliament following the procedures I referred to earlier. So I am very gratified to see that Parliament's opinion records approval of the Accession Agreement which will allow the release of the funds for the 1999 financial contribution. It is true that broader financial problems remain but the first thing we have to do is to play our part.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the question from Mr Spencer on the broader issue of relations with North Korea, I welcome the visit that was paid by the Members of the European Parliament to North Korea and I am glad that it was a successful bonding exercise. The negotiations I have had with the Members of the Parliament to deal with the KEDO problem have been a similar bonding exercise and I thank all concerned. There is no doubt at all, as far as relations with North Korea are concerned, that a crisis in the Korean Peninsular would have far‐reaching consequences in North‐East Asia and beyond and we have a responsibility, commensurate with our new role in seeking to be involved politically in that part of Asia, to do what we can to avoid it.</p>
<p class="contents">President Kim Dae Jung has strongly advocated greater international engagement as a way of handling the problem and I can certainly assure you that we fully support, as Mr Brinkhorst has urged us to do, President Kim's ‘sunshine" policy. America too is conducting a wide‐ranging review of its policy under former Defense Secretary Perry. We have been pursuing a policy of limited engagement illustrated by the food aid and other assistance programmes, as well as by KEDO. We are currently discussing how that policy may now be taken further forward. An important factor will of course be the policies which the DPRK itself pursues in key areas such as security issues, relations with neighbouring countries, human rights and so on. We also have to take account of the need to support our key partners in their dealings with the DPRK. The EU regularly exchanges views with our dialogue partners, including the United States, the Republic of Korea and Japan with regard to the situation on the Korean Peninsular. The idea that was put forward for further development in the energy sector is certainly one that we want to consider. Possibilities are being considered, including a study into alternative energy sources and/or the coal sector rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="contents">On the political side we obviously have to tread warily but not so warily that we do not make progress. That is the course we shall pursue and I am grateful to Parliament for its support for it.</p>

We are grateful to you, Commissioner, for your letter, which – at the last minute, if I may say so – enabled us to reach our decision on the KEDO project. It might have come a little earlier, but we are pleased that you found the right approach along with our Three Musketeers. These really are three committed Musketeers, who care about the interests of the people in North Korea and about this issue. On behalf of my group I should like to offer my sincere thanks to Mr Tindemans, to Mr Brinkhorst and also to Glyn Ford.</p>
<p class="contents">Although you, as a practised diplomat, tread warily but with undoubted success along the path of rapprochement and cooperation with other countries, you will permit me, as a Member of Parliament who need not be quite so diplomatic, to point out that the KEDO project, like others, must ultimately be judged by the conduct of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in terms of its military activities and its humanitarian inactivity. I do believe that the North Korean Government must finally provide conclusive evidence that its military activities do not pose a threat, particularly to its neighbouring states, and that they are not designed to pose a threat.</p>
<p class="contents">We call for access by independent inspectors to nuclear facilities, especially the underground facilities. We also really ought to expect the North Korean Government to declare at long last that it will not undertake any more test launches without giving prior notice. After all, Japan could not fail to perceive the totally unexpected test launch of a missile over Japanese territory as a threat. I believe we must surely agree that a country such as North Korea which is looking for support from the international community must naturally conduct itself in such a way that it is not seen to threaten or act in a hostile manner towards other states. So much for the military aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the humanitarian side is concerned, we are pleased to note, Sir Leon, that you have made progress on the question of providing food supplies for the population. But to be honest, I distrust any statistics released by the North Korean Government on the extent of the famine in North Korea. I certainly believe it to be essential that we keep in touch with the aid agencies on the ground, because I do not think that even this project can come anywhere near providing the volume of aid that is needed – and Mr Ford has given us some figures. The fact that North Korea has money for military actions but no money to buy food for its people is a contradiction that we cannot tolerate if we care at all for the people of North Korea. In that respect, I believe we should keep a very watchful eye on that situation, and we should expect the North Koreans to tell us the truth here and to assist us in ferrying supplies to the population, especially in the remote parts of the country.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Kreissl‐Dörfler </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you may not be surprised to learn that I cannot see this whole situation in such a rosy glow as it has been presented here, especially by Sir Leon Brittan. We know each other only too well, of course, from the Committee on External Economic Relations. The few good points to be found in the KEDO programme, namely the desire to arrive at an alternative form of energy and to make a contribution to North Korea in terms of promoting reconciliation or improving people's living standards, are swamped by a whole series of points which Mr Tindemans presents in detail in his explanatory statement. Mr Ford has also told us what is really happening over there in North Korea. I cannot help wondering whether we should not be trying to solve quite different problems there at the present time, rather than helping to build two light water reactors. How is North Korea ever supposed to repay the debts it is incurring in this domain?</p>
<p class="contents">If we reply to this question by claiming that we need to have a foot in the door, economically speaking, and to profit from projects and contracts, then I have to say that this is surely a very mercenary approach; to put it more bluntly, we have taken a policy that is supposed to provide a country with a helping hand in its pursuit of development and have succeeded once again in turning such a policy on its head in spectacular fashion. We are building a new white elephant under the guise of development aid. That is surely not designed to provide long‐term assistance. Reactors are to be sited somewhere in the landscape, and there is not even any certainty as to how the energy is to be transmitted from there. And what about the disposal of the nuclear waste? That, of course, is another question you have yet to resolve.</p>
<p class="contents">You may find that amusing, Sir Leon. But as an aid worker who has worked long enough in the shanty towns of this world, I have to tell you that this sort of solution is certainly not one that springs to my mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by stating the obvious, namely that the way Parliament has been treated throughout the period of the KEDO negotiations has been anything but brilliant. If you are now presenting us with a letter, Sir Leon, the content of which I can certainly endorse – well, I have to say that it may have come late, but at least it has come. However, we are being given sight of this at a very, very late stage in the proceedings. I know that you are always keen to inform Parliament and that you do that and come to our meetings. But in terms of substance – and let me make this very clear – we are usually sold short, because our questions often receive extremely flowery answers. That is something we very often experience in the Committee on External Economic Relations. Be that as it may, I have some different ideas of what would help these countries. For that reason, even though much of the content of the report may be right and proper, I regret that we shall have to vote against it.</p>

It would be a better idea to announce when the Council is present rather than when it is absent, since this is becoming the exception rather than the rule. It is also going to make it difficult for Mr Brinkhorst to cross swords with the Council if it is never here. It is a little late to be realising that instead of crossing swords with the Commission, we should have focused our energies on trying to get the Council out. But it is too late now, the damage is done.</p>
<p class="contents">Another thing: regarding the procedures for the vote tomorrow, I regret that we were not able to table amendments in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy and had to table them directly in the plenary. It is going to add to our workload today, and it is also not in accordance with the Rules.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the substance of what has been said, I am absolutely dumbstruck. This will come as no surprise to someone like Sir Leon Brittan, who is more of a dreamer than a realist. When I hear people talking here this evening about crises and food shortages, I honestly wonder whether they really appreciate the scale of what is happening in North Korea. And yet the figures speak for themselves: two to three million people have died over the last four years. This has nothing to do with food shortages – it is a genuine famine, an out‐and‐out disaster, and it is not a natural disaster but a structural one caused by an insane, criminal and psychopathic regime which is worse than the worst regime in the Soviet Union or Ceaucescu"s Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking here very earnestly about a nuclear programme, and our Green colleagues are right on this, in part: should we really be allocating hundreds of millions of euros to build nuclear power stations over there, even if they are less likely to be used for military purposes, when other solutions could easily be found? We are not asking for anything in return. We are providing food aid, and we are not asking for any reforms, although we know perfectly well that the agricultural production system is structurally quite incapable of meeting North Korea"s needs. I find this totally incomprehensible. This agreement will be supporting a regime that is completely and utterly insane.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly we will be voting against this report, but that is not enough. Perhaps when Sir Leon Brittan stops being such a dreamer and becomes more realistic he might think about the possibility of investing a few million euros in providing the North Koreans with information, instead of letting them starve to death without any knowledge of what is happening in the rest of the world. I think there are some fairly obvious things we could be doing instead of sitting back and watching Pyongyang fire off missiles and waste what little energy the country has left on totally insane plans. It is a mad regime and it must be brought down.</p>

<p class="contents">I entirely agree with Mr Jarzembowski that it is essential that North Korean military activity must not present a threat. He has spoken in a very clear way. I would agree with and endorse it, and what we are doing is designed to deal with the security issue as much as anything else. It is indeed put forward explicitly as a way to engage the North Koreans and discourage them from the worst form of military threat that there could be – namely, a nuclear threat. It has to be seen in that context.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Kreissl‐Dörfler suggest that we really should be focussing on other problems. All I can say is that you have to ask yourself – and I would address this to Mr Dupuis as well – the extent to which we are able to do so with a country like North Korea. The fact of the matter is that the gravest threat that it presents to its neighbours is a security one and that in preventing that by the KEDO Programme or diminishing the risk of it in the KEDO Programme, we are actually making a contribution without which it would not be possible to think about any other sort of measures; and I would say to Mr Dupuis that the idea that a regime which has the horrific characteristics that he has described is one that is going allow our propaganda to enter, is frankly an unrealistic one.</p>
<p class="contents">I will say however to him that the new aid programme, in fact, is conditional. We have paid particular attention to securing adequate commitments from the DPRK on the monitoring procedures and on a reform policy for agricultural rehabilitation products with increased incentives for farmers, devolution of decision‐making, revolving credit facilities and so on. In those circumstances, I really do think that, faced by what was hitherto regarded as an impenetrable regime, we have made substantial efforts both to engage them in the process of the reform and to reduce the security threat that they would otherwise present to their neighbours and the rest of the world.</p>
