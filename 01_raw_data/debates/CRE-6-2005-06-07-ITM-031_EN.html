<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">John Bowis (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, it has been a delight to listen to ‘Commissioner’ Karas! I am sure it is only a matter of time before we see him in that role.</p>
<p class="contents">Often colleagues are faced with the question on the doorstep of ‘what does Europe do for me?’. This debate will help them to answer that question, at least in one respect: that this report and this measure are all about giving patients more rights and power over their own health and the right to go to another Member State for treatment if they face undue delay in their own country. That gives great opportunities for patients; it also brings new headaches for the managers of health budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank my colleagues who have contributed to the debates we have had on this issue, not least in a hearing that we held in Parliament. I should also like to thank the Commission. I sympathise with the Commissioner who tonight is not too well, but I am sure that this measure will help to find a solution even to that and we will be able to find somewhere for him to travel to in order to find succour! I thank him and his staff for the help they have given as we have discussed this issue. I thank the many people outside Parliament and the Commission who have given their ideas, as we have sought them, on how we should proceed.</p>
<p class="contents">This measure starts from people. It does not start from the Commission, Parliament or governments. It starts from people who look to Europe for a solution to their problem. They took the issue to the European Court of Justice. They challenged that court to give them mobility rights and the court did so. It gave them the right, if they faced undue delay in their own country, to go to another country with certain criteria: that the cost was comparable to what they would have paid in their own country and that the treatment was common in their own country. There were one or two other criteria as well. However, the judgment was made. A new opportunity had arisen.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many ways in which people who face delays in their own country can be helped. Part of the solution has been the bilateral contracts that we have had between governments and health services. Part of it has been the Interreg system bringing together hospitals across the European Union. I have seen this here in Strasbourg, which, as a city, is working with Lille and Luxembourg.</p>
<p class="contents">We have the E-111 and the new Euro-health card behind us. However, the E-112 has not been part of the solution. That form that was supposed to give people the opportunity to go for planned treatment abroad. That has been bureaucratic and obstructive and has to be changed.</p>
<p class="contents">We had the high-level reflection group, which looked at the issues, came up with some recommendations, but has gone for the long grass in terms of some of the issues. We now need action, we need guidelines. The patient who wants to use this opportunity needs to know whether his condition qualifies; he needs to know what forms to fill in; he needs to know where he can go; to which doctors and how he can check up on those doctors; if they are OK; can I get help with travel; can my family come and support me, particularly if there is a child involved; and what happens if something goes wrong. Guidance for patients is fundamental and guidance is urgently needed. Just as fundamental is guidance to doctors who will refer patients abroad, as is guidance to the health services and the insurance companies who will have unplanned expenditure and want to know how they will be reimbursed.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many issues that we need to look at: information to patients, the transfer of information on patients between countries, checks on doctors, the disciplinary procedures, the complaints procedures that will need to be behind all this, what happens to people who retire abroad to the sun, etc. Now we need certainty. If we do nothing then the courts will go deciding. The Watts case will be next. But I believe that Parliaments, not lawyers, should decide policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by sharing with you the words of Louis Pasteur, that I quoted in my explanatory statement: <span class="italic">‘La science ne connaît pas de frontière parce que la connaissance appartient à l’humanité et que c’est la flamme qui illumine le monde’ </span>(Science recognises no borders because knowledge belongs to humanity and is the torch which illuminates the world.)</p>
<p class="contents">Let those words be our guide as we give clarity and confidence to our citizens who urgently need both from us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is right: I am a mobile patient myself. I am very interested in following the debate. I wanted to be here personally because I consider this to be a very important issue, something that we all have to work on in the next few years. The rapporteur is right that people are ahead of us in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though I am not feeling well today, I cannot think of a better place to be, with so many doctors around this evening for this discussion! I feel confident enough in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I will listen very carefully to the debate and the comments that will be made by the honourable Members. I am very happy that, based on the report, we are thinking along the same lines. I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bowis, for his work on, and the effort he has put into, this report. I welcome it and the support it offers to the Commission for the work that we are trying to do on this issue. There are some issues that we need to take further. Judging by what we have included in our proposal for the new health programme, the terms of reference and the work done by the high-level group on health show that this is along the same lines as the proposal of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">The target has to be that a citizen can get the highest level of healthcare in his or her own country. That should be the rule. Nevertheless, things change. People such as myself travel because of business or because they have to wait a long time in their own country or because the specific treatment required is not offered in their country, or even more so, because they feel that they can get better care elsewhere. That is a reality and something that we have to deal with. It is not always possible, and that is why there is a need for legal certainty. That is the very first requirement, with which I agree. However, the reality is that people travel and we have to travel for health.</p>
<p class="contents">I heard about an interesting report today, which says that the Polish medical healthcare system has started receiving patients from Germany and the UK. That is welcome in the sense that it will boost the budget of the healthcare system in Poland, provided that it is not at the cost of Polish patients. That is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">We will work on final solutions: we take on board that message from the report, but this must always be done in conformity with the principle of subsidiarity and the principle that healthcare services are in the competence of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Four important points in the report are: the centres of reference; professional mobility, which already causes problems in some of the new Member States because of doctors or healthcare workers moving to other Member States for higher pay; patient safety; and dealing with inequalities. We all have to work in that direction, both within the high-level group and the Commission itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I thank Mr Bowis for his excellent report. We expected nothing less from him. This is a first step on that road and is a response to the impressive communication from the High Level Reflection Group, which was set up in response to the ECJ judgments. However, I agree with our rapporteur’s view that a sense of urgency is missing from the communication in relation to policy and spending priorities. We are also at risk of being driven by the courts rather than the statute in this most important of areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I would favour the minimum legal framework necessary for both providers and purchasers of cross-border healthcare, but we should not underestimate the complexity of the task. As we know, health policy and health budgets are competences of the individual Member States: this is strictly subsidiarity. So the financial implications of these new patient rights need structuring, not least at the level of health insurance cover, which varies greatly throughout the 25 Member States from demand control to supply control systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The attempt to deal with this issue in the General Services Directive is ill-advised and I welcome the Commission’s change of mind. That directive is about service mobility in the EU, not customer or patient mobility. It is particularly not about customers who will not be paying their own bills, customers who may need aftercare and follow-up treatments when they return home.</p>
<p class="contents">Our public likes the option of travelling to another EU country if treatment is not available at home: the obvious first choice. Treatment may not be available for certain specialities, or there could be an unacceptable delay in accessing the required treatment. Large-scale patient mobility should be unnecessary if a Member State discharges its responsibilities with a well-run, efficient health service.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2002 Ireland was forced to set up the National Treatment Purchase Fund to reduce its ever-lengthening waiting list. In that year alone, almost 2 000 Irish patients were sent to the UK for treatment. We are adept at exporting our patients. Another 650 opted to go to Member States on E112 forms that same year – difficult as those forms are. But only one patient opted to travel to Ireland for elective treatment. By comparison, 137 000 opted to travel to Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">These figures highlight the urgent need to manage this right to access treatment throughout the EU. Our patients, doctors and taxpayers deserve to have it managed properly. They want and expect to be offered sound guidance on policy and procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask the Commissioner what the next move will be and when. Does he accept that a properly structured service is urgently needed in this area? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Anywhere in Europe, anyone can have an accident, become ill and need medical help and treatment, and so it cannot be acceptable that only two thirds of Member States should have their own legislation on the protection of patients in place. In my own country, for example, 90% of what patients are entitled to is founded upon widely-dispersed case law, none of which is summarised in a single, comprehensive and binding document. It is past high time for current patients’ rights and minimum standards to be brought into line across the EU. Everyone – irrespective of whether it is in Spain, Latvia or Poland that they fall ill – must have the same rights as they do in France, Finland or the Czech Republic, for example the right to expert advice that they can understand, the right to documentation relating to treatment and the right to see their patient records.</p>
<p class="contents">What we also need, though, is greater transparency in the reimbursement of costs. Even though the ECJ has shed light on which of the costs incurred abroad are reimbursed, Regulation 1408/71 is still unequally applied. The existing legislation on reimbursement of costs needs to be approximated, and there is an urgent need for a single legal framework on patient mobility. The Internet health portal announced by the Commission also needs to be put in place as soon as possible to carry all the important information that is needed not only by patients and their families, but also by professionals – including such things as data on the fields in which hospitals and doctors specialise, as well as data enabling doctors’ performances to be evaluated and data on patient safety. One might say that what we need is a Europe-wide ranking of the kind that exists here and there at national level. If people are to make sound decisions on where and how they want to be treated, they have to be well informed, and one in every four Europeans already uses the Internet as a source of health information.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by pointing out that we must not limit Centres of Reference to the treatment of rare illnesses; they are also needed to deal with all the other conditions that require a particular combination of resources and expertise, such as cancer, epilepsy and multiple sclerosis. In a Europe in which patients are mobile, there will be a need for more legal certainty, transparency and even greater quality. Subsidiarity notwithstanding, this gives us our great opportunity to enable Europe itself to do much, much more for its citizens. Let us follow where Mr Bowis’ report leads in working towards this end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Health is of course very important to everyone and is essential to our quality of life. This excellent report by Mr Bowis – and I have to say that the original report, that is to say the one before it was approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, was actually far better than what is before us now – is in any case a step in the right direction in promoting public health.</p>
<p class="contents">The report contains a lot of sensible ideas, and I dare say that it is perhaps left up to others, including myself, to say the injudicious things, because the language in the report could have been more forceful, of course. The version after it passed the Committee contains many ‘would it not be nice if’ and ‘this and that would need to be promoted’ and the conclusion is yet again that the responsibility for health and health care really lies with the Member States. I already knew that. That is how it is provided for in the Treaty, but the question is, of course, whether that is tenable in the long term. How do we really help sick people, for example in the case of long waiting lists in my own country or the lack of specialist knowledge?</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to seize the opportunity of arguing in favour of the European Union adopting a bigger role in health and health care. If somebody is ill, they should be given the possibility of receiving medical care abroad. Keeping the borders closed for medical care for all kinds of administrative, procedural or financial reasons is ultimately not in the interest of the consumer, and that is what we are here for, after all. The right to see a doctor abroad has already been recognised by the Court of Justice, and, as Mr Bowis rightly suggests, why not enshrine it in European legislation?</p>
<p class="contents">We live in a modern society peopled by well-educated, mobile and responsible citizens, and they should be able to decide where they want to be treated and how. Opening up borders for patients also encourages health care in our own countries to achieve better quality, cutting waiting lists and making specialist knowledge available.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I should like to underline the EU’s positive role in health care, and the presence of the Commission at this ungodly hour is appreciated all the more. This health care in the European Union is an exception to the rule that the European Union is often associated with the negative image of bureaucracy and drafting senseless and unnecessary rules. We do good work here, and it goes without saying that we will be voting for Mr Bowis’ report with great enthusiasm. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I only regret that my main committee, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, did not get its act together to draw up an opinion on this subject. As the committee responsible for Regulation (EC) No 1408/71, we have an interest in it, as do I as Parliament’s rapporteur during the previous term.</p>
<p class="contents">I am rather concerned about the tone of some of the comments that I have just been hearing. Let us be clear: patients have the right to move under certain circumstances. It is not a free-for-all, and I do not think Parliament should be giving that impression. Not least because some colleagues who sit in Member State parliaments would be a little upset to see us moving their budgets as a matter of course because we choose to. It is right that we need greater clarity around the rules on this, but I welcome the recognition in this report that healthcare is a service to people in need, it is not an ordinary consumer product. Therefore, it should not be in the services directive. That is not the appropriate place either to deal with questions of reimbursement. We will have a real mess unless we do this properly and in a considered manner, as has been proposed in this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The opinion of the European Parliament on the serious issue of patient mobility is important as a lever for exerting pressure on the European Commission to take clearer measures on this issue. European patients have rights which must also be protected by law, so that they can have the corresponding social cover wherever they may be in the Europe of free movement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important, I believe, to promote simple, daily information for patients as regards their rights and to recognise the peculiarities of groups of patients such as the elderly, the illiterate and pensioners, as Amendment 37 also emphasises.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the protection of patients' personal data is important. Provision is made for the creation of a database of medical information on patients; however, as provided for in Amendments 48, 49, 50, 67 and 68, certain protective measures must be taken to prevent abuse.</p>
<p class="contents">I also consider it necessary to clarify the situation in cross-border areas. In other words, patients must be treated in hospitals as close to their place of residence as possible. Numerous European countries which border each other, such as France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany, have developed close cooperation mechanisms, mechanisms which start with road transport and extend to health issues. It is only natural that certain citizens resident in cross-border areas should be able to go for treatment to hospitals in neighbouring countries which are closer to home than treatment centres in their own country. I call on you, therefore, to support Amendment 41, paragraph 8.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to stress that health services cannot be compared with goods offered for sale. I therefore consider that the question of patient mobility and of services in general should not be included in a general services directive. Nonetheless, we do need a proposal for action on mobility, with a specific timetable, which takes account of the conclusions of the High Level Group on Health Services and Medical Care. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Cooperation in this field, particularly at Member State level, should in theory increase the treatment options available, not only by making it possible to receive treatment after having moved to another EU Member State, but also by allowing patients to travel to other facilities if appropriate medical care is unavailable in their home country.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem of mobility poses a multitude of risks, however. These are primarily due to the economic and political differences that exist between the old and rich EU Member States and the new Member States, whose development has been held back until today as a result of the Soviet totalitarian rule to which they were previously subjected. Whereas citizens of the 15 old Member States mainly move around the EU in order to avoid waiting lists or in search of cheaper treatment, the majority of citizens in the new Member States are denied medical care. The main reason for this is the mass exodus of skilled workers, or in other words highly-educated doctors and nurses, to rich countries. Mr Bowis was right to highlight this ‘brain drain’ in his report, as it poses an enormous threat to the health of less wealthy citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, the various liberal ideas that are currently in vogue, which include viewing health care as a service and a market commodity and making it more difficult to acquire specialist qualifications, as well as the various economic programmes that advocate job cuts at the expense of health-care systems and that merely improve the economic situation of private medical centres, will not solve the growing number of problems we face in the health-care sector or create new jobs. The end result of this will be an increase in the cost of medical care and a deterioration of public health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I support the Commission's action plan for healthcare in Europe, which would genuinely guarantee people's safe freedom of movement.</p>
<p class="contents">Particularly at a time when Europe is much troubled by the question of 'European solidarity versus national identity', it is important to demonstrate to citizens that the European institutions are preparing simplified mechanisms and improved healthcare for their citizens. The fact that, on the basis of the principle of Subsidiarity, Member States and their politicians are responsible for providing healthcare is one of the serious obstacles to the free movement of people. </p>
<p class="contents">Patients face no waiting list when it comes to paying for health insurance, which they do loyally, promptly and regularly, yet when they urgently need a service in return for their money, healthcare is denied them or delayed. Patient mobility could help to improve the currently inadequate healthcare in some Member States. Effectively, waiting lists cause patient's treatment to be postponed, something that may even, from a medical point of view, might be seen as a threat to their health and their lives. Waiting lists can be for plastic surgery. Patients having to wait for, say, a hip replacement, are ruining their health in the meantime with painkillers, long-term use of which can cause dependence, bone marrow decay and stomach ulcers.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, some Member States are at present remedying their healthcare deficiencies to their advantage; I use the word 'advantage' to refer to purchasing the services of cheap labour in the form of doctors and nurses from Eastern Europe. As far as Europe's future is concerned, I therefore consider patient mobility to be far preferable to health worker mobility. When doctors and nurses leave Eastern European States, healthcare suffers there. According to Slovak Medical Association statistics, more doctors left Slovakia than graduated from the country's three medical faculties. It is therefore clear that, in the future, gaps will appear on the map of Europe, a state of affairs that, again, is no solution.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Bowis on the clarity of his report and of his stance on something that is a live issue.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an unfortunate fact that health care is far from ideal in many countries. What is worse, in many countries, questions are being asked about quality and accessibility at a time when waiting lists and waiting times are getting longer. Under normal circumstances, patients benefit from care close to home, in their own countries at any rate. In the situation of reduced quality, it becomes appealing for patients to look across the border.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent court judgments have encouraged patients to look elsewhere for an answer to their health problems. I totally agree with the rapporteur’s giving first place to the improvement of quality in health care; shopping across the border does not solve anything. It is, of course, practical to make joint arrangements about transnational treatments in border regions, and the departure of patients to other countries can be an incentive to invest more in national health care, although that is an unwieldy way of stimulating quality. It is therefore unacceptable for patient mobility to be regulated in the Services Directive by way of afterthought, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was right to delete patient mobility from that directive.</p>
<p class="contents">We are faced, however, with an urgent problem. There is a considerable difference in quality between the Member States. The varying chances of survival for, for example, bladder cancer are shocking. In Austria and Iceland, the chance of surviving bladder cancer is twice that in Poland. Instead of dreaming up procedures, laws and regulations which should guide the free movement of patients, the Commission would be wiser to invest in the exchange of knowledge in the most dynamic way possible. Patients with bladder cancer in Poland deserve high-quality treatment too. All bladder cancer patients want to benefit from Austrian knowledge and expertise. Let us therefore take this step forward and not invest unnecessarily in mobility that patients do not want anyway. Nobody enjoys waking up from a general anaesthetic in a strange environment. I would therefore speak for quality rather than mobility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Around Europe, there are many patients and people who are in need of care who have a lot to gain from the vision we are presenting in this House of increased opportunities to move across borders.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, unfortunately, politicians and bureaucrats in Europe who frown upon increased mobility and freedom of choice. They regard freedom of choice as a threat to their own ability to plan and regulate, in other words as a threat to their own power. That is why, in so many Member States including Sweden, it may be impossible for patients even to seek care in another part of the country. With this report, we clearly show that we are not on the side of the bureaucrats in this conflict, but on that of the patients.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish, however, to emphasise that I too think that health care is a national matter. Our task is to tear down borders and ensure that patients can seek care wherever they need to. Freedom of movement provides, firstly, competition between health care systems that drives development forward and, secondly, a more efficient use of health services’ scarce resources. In Sweden, patients may need to queue up for years, waiting for treatment for which there is overcapacity in other countries. By tearing down the borders, we create the preconditions for both development and efficiency. This means an improvement in healthcare in our Member States, with more people’s needs being met.</p>
<p class="contents">I would call upon my fellow MEPs to vote in favour of Amendment 5, tabled by Mr Bowis, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and myself on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. The amendment entails adding a new paragraph, 4a, about not stating in the resolution that we are to remove health services and medical care from the Services Directive. If there are any service companies operating in an environment characterised by regulations and monopolies that prevent mobility and competition, it is specifically companies providing medical treatment and healthcare. To crown it all, the removal of healthcare services from the directive is not a subject that even belongs within this debate, in which we are discussing the mobility of patients, not that of healthcare providers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to emphasise people’s knowledge of healthcare in different countries. We need informed patients who are able to benefit from the opportunities we are opening up to them. I therefore want to conclude by inviting you all to a seminar on 15 June in Brussels where we shall, for the first time, present a proper factual comparison from the patient’s perspective of Europe’s healthcare systems. You are all sincerely welcome to attend. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If implemented, every single thing that the report demands and proposes would add value to the European citizen’s participation in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say, then, that, second only to growth and employment policy, it is social and health policy to which demographic change presents the greatest challenge of all, not only in view of the ballooning costs in that area, but also in terms of the realisation of our four freedoms, of the expanding internal market and of the public’s greater mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">European citizenship is something that we all want. Europe’s citizens have fundamental rights; medical care and help in an emergency are, within the European Union, among them, and they cannot be restricted to a citizen’s own country. As a community founded upon solidarity, we have to be there for each other, above all when we need each other. That is why I am very much in favour of the suggestions that there should be a Commission proposal specifically dealing with the issue of patient mobility. I am very keen that patient mobility should not be subject to the Services Directive, and social and health services should be treated separately rather than now being thrown in the same pot as the Services Directive. This is not solely about them as a commodity, but also about quality and clear definitions, about a legal framework and the clarification of who pays and who gets what.</p>
<p class="contents">My view is that the report has come at the right time, for these are issues that we are currently discussing at so many different levels. We should take the report as the starting point for a wide-ranging debate on health and social provision and for a debate on how to achieve a better balance of national competence in relation to European responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me begin by reassuring Mrs Doyle that I share her concern about the urgency of this whole issue. I am really concerned about every single aspect of this complex issue which we call patient mobility, because it is not just about moving patients from one country to another. Members have mentioned the problems with professional mobility and the burden on healthcare systems. But we cannot do everything at once. One complication is that most of this lies within the competence of the Member States. The processes in the Union are rather slower than in the Member States, but when it comes to coordination or whatever method we choose, it takes even longer.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I shall tell you what I plan to do in the near future. Everything has to be done, but it is a matter of choosing priorities. Some things are easier or more urgent. The first one you have all mentioned: legal certainty. This has to be dealt with. I will not take a position on the Services Directive. I am waiting for the conclusion of the discussions. I can assure you that if eventually it is decided not to include health in the Services Directive - I am speaking hypothetically here - we will bring forward a different proposal.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interjection from Mrs Doyle: ‘When?’)</span></p>
<p class="contents">As soon as you decide what to do with the Services Directive!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interjection from Mrs Doyle: ‘Commissioner McCreevy has told us health will not be in it ...’ (rest inaudible))</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is not final yet, but let me put it like this: no time will be wasted. That is the first priority.</p>
<p class="contents">We will have our health portal by the end of the year. This is moving forward, as you know, the provision of information about access to healthcare is more an issue for the Member States, but we shall, nevertheless, include it in our health portal.</p>
<p class="contents">I will speed up the progress of the High Level Group, so that they can deal with the various issues they are working on. I shall give priority to a health programme for the gathering of data information, because it seems that this might not be progressing as well as we think, but because of faults in the system we are not receiving the right information. So it might be progressing better than we think. So I shall give priority to gathering data information.</p>
<p class="contents">Centres of reference are very important and are included in the report. In 2006 there will be at least a pilot project. However, we also encourage them within Member States, because they is needed there as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Patient safety is important. The Luxembourg presidency and the UK presidency are giving it priority. I hope that by the end of the UK presidency we will have some more concrete conclusions on that.</p>
<p class="contents">The use of information technology for facilitating payments, records and so on and the use of e-Health information technology have been mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Patients’ rights are important. I am proud to say that the country I know best has already adopted legislation in this respect. It is a question of subsidiarity, but we will encourage the Member States to adopt some kind of charter of patients’ rights, which may or may not be binding depending on the legal system of each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, another project which is important and which we will finance through the new health programme – provided it survives the Financial Perspectives debate – will be the financing of a new strand in health cooperation between Member States. This will provide vital resources at European level to turn the discussions on cooperation into practical reality, including the other information and the centres of reference mentioned earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I apologise again for taking so much time, but I wish to thank everybody for this debate. I will keep Parliament informed on the progress of the High Level Group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
