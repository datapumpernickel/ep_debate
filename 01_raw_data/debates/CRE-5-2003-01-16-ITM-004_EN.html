<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Miguélez Ramos (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, you must all be aware that a year ago, at the suggestion of the Socialist Group, the European Parliament decided to prepare an own-initiative report on the external impact of the common fisheries policy. The report was to cover the European Union’s involvement in RFOs and also in international agreements on fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">In the intervening time and after the report was adopted in committee, the communication from the European Commission on the same subject was presented, in the context of reform of the CFP. Clearly, the Committee on Fisheries will need to draw up a second report. It is my belief that such a report will be in line with the resolution adopted here today.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Fisheries trusts that this report will serve to focus the attention of the House on issues related to fisheries. We hope that it will lead to a call for closer links and improved cooperation between the external dimension of the CFP and other Community policies. I am thinking here about policies on trade, on development aid and on foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, when the relevant Directorate-General negotiates within multilateral organisations, or when it negotiates international agreements on fisheries, it does not appear to enjoy the support of the world’s largest trading and economic power. Conversely, when the European Union negotiates association agreements or trading agreements, or when it is involved in decision-making within the WTO, insufficient account is taken of the interests of fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is abundantly clear that our own market in fish and similar products is supplied thanks to the activities of the Community’s fleet in non-Community fishing grounds. As you must know, there is a shortage of such products on our market. In addition, the presence of our fleet helps to bolster activity in areas dependent on fishing. These areas are generally underdeveloped and no other economic activity is viable there.</p>
<p class="contents">Pursuant to the Council of Ministers’ Resolution of 3 November 1976, the European Union supports such activity. This resolution also covers additional requirements consequent on other fundamental pillars of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union undoubtedly has a very competitive fleet, notably the tuna, longline and trawl fleets. These operate outside Community waters and are deemed the most advanced in the world. They also pioneer the search for new fishing grounds and species. As a whole, the Community fleet has the technical capacity and processing and sales facilities to allow it to supply a market of 350 million consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike their competitors at global level, European fishermen are no pirates. They do not fish illegally, they do not destroy local fisheries and they do not engage in social dumping. Their activities are in fact tightly controlled by the European Union through the Member States and the range of control mechanisms in place. European fishermen also comply with the requirements of fishing agreements, the national regulations of coastal states and the regulations of the relevant RFOs.</p>
<p class="contents">Approximately 3 000 European vessels fish on the high seas or in the exclusive economic zones of other states. Of these, 2 100 operate to the north of the Union and some 900 to the south. This represents 41 000 jobs for the Union. Eighty-three per cent of these come under the Southern Agreements. The yearly catch amounts to 2.7 million tonnes, which represents 40% of the annual catch by the Community’s fleet. You may be surprised to learn that the total value of the catch is put at EUR 614 billion. This sum is multiplied further if account is taken of the processing industry and of economic activity in related sectors such as shipbuilding and marine engineering.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial cost of the CFP’s external dimension is very small. It was EUR 276 million in 2000. This equalled 28% of the total CFP budget. There is ample proof of the profitability of Community intervention in favour of this fleet. For every euro we invest as a Community in this fishery we get three back in business terms.</p>
<p class="contents">To reiterate my earlier statement, the European Union does have the economic, legal, legislative and political potential to take the lead in responsible fishing beyond the Union and promote the principles involved. Nonetheless, those concerned feel they do not receive adequate support from the Union. The underlying reason may be that the funds allocated to these activities by the European Commission are insufficient. A political strategy is lacking too. It is also unfortunate that this external dimension of the CFP is not properly covered by the CFSP and does not come within the general scope of the international trading relations of the fisheries Union. The European Parliament is on record as having repeatedly criticised this state of affairs. The House has urged the Commission to remedy the situation. In particular, it has recommended that the Directorate-General adjust its organisational chart to enable it to fulfil its role adequately.</p>
<p class="contents">The sea is the neglected half of our planet, ladies and gentlemen. However, to date it has not yet been proven that sustainable management of ocean fisheries is anything but possible. What is needed is an approach focused on ecosystems and involving the reinforcement not only of scientific research but also of monitoring and surveillance measures. By-catch must be reduced too and a determined effort made to combat illegal fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, a legal framework for protected areas must be developed. In addition, a broader view should be taken of the reasons for the depletion of resources. Fishing is not entirely to blame. Spillage from oil tankers also plays a part. We have the consequences of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster very much in the forefront of our minds at present. The <span class="italic">Prestige</span> is but one example of a tanker going down in our richest and most biodiverse coastal waters. Then there is the discharge from vessels cleaning their tanks out at sea with impunity. No effective action has yet been taken against them. Global climate change is another contributory factor. Resources are also affected by the extensive use of substances such as fertilisers or pesticides in agriculture. These inevitably end up in the sea.</p>
<p class="contents">It remains for me to highlight the social aspects of this type of fishing. We believe all fishermen should be guaranteed fundamental labour rights. In our view, it is for the Union to take appropriate action, such as the inclusion of a social clause in international agreements. Another approach would be for socio–economic partners to promote social dialogue, so that all fishermen benefit from the protection of their rights, and to ensure that the European social model becomes a permanent feature of the fishing industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with her that this fortunate coincidence creates the need for Parliament to give further consideration to the Commission’s proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">This communication addresses all the issues relating to the bilateral aspect of the Commission’s relations with third countries as far as fisheries are concerned, especially in the case of developing coastal states. We believe the communication constitutes a good basis on which to launch a debate on the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">We are fully aware of the importance of this chapter of the common fisheries policy, especially for certain regions of the European Union. Accordingly, the Commission proposes that the Council should draw up appropriate political guidelines enshrining the Community’s desire to work to promote responsible fishing in the interests of all concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Miguélez Ramos rightly points out in her report, the development of the external dimension of the common fisheries policy must take account of the European Union’s international commitments. Some of these fall within the scope of the CFSP and others relate to trade agreements. I would even venture to include agreements on sustainable development, notably those with developing countries. Our ongoing efforts to improve political and economic governance at a global level should not be overlooked either.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking to the future, the Commission believes that its action should be seen as an investment in responsible fishing, and not simply as a mechanism for compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the multilateral aspect, I have noted comments in the House on the lack of human and material resources. I do not however agree with the rapporteur’s assessment of the need to revise voting arrangements within the RFOs. The European Union’s influence within these organisations is far greater than the number of votes at its disposal would suggest.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of sanctions and the RFOs, however, we believe more control is required to ensure that fisheries products from vessels flouting international regulations cannot be traded within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission recently presented an action plan to combat illegal, uncontrolled and unregulated fishing. The proposed initiatives, particularly measures 5 to 10, seek to harmonise the control mechanisms of the RFOs. They also seek to make these systems more effective and to ensure they are in line with the principle of a multilateral approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I was delighted that Parliament welcomed this plan so warmly. Further, the Busk report supporting this approach was adopted unopposed at last November’s sitting.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has committed itself to complying with all international agreements it is party to, and to ratifying the agreement reached in New York. Currently, 14 Member States are in a position to proceed to ratification. I hope everything will be in place to allow ratification to go ahead before these six months have elapsed.</p>
<p class="contents">As you will be aware, Mr President, we have also addressed the question of the Mediterranean. The communication explains how we have taken the initiative. We plan to organise an international conference on the subject in conjunction with the incoming Italian Presidency. In principle, this will be held in Venice in December 2003. The Commission is also concerned about the reduction of the time allowed for transposition. I am referring to Community legislation and the recommendations by RFOs. The Commission is not responsible for the unfortunate situation that no progress has been possible on this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the social aspects, these are included in the Commission’s proposed objectives. They should have greater weight in future cooperative ventures. Concerning the need to increase scientific research, I would like to reiterate the Commission’s desire to implement an action plan on this. Although it has been somewhat delayed, it ought to be successfully accomplished before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, there is the question of encouraging the establishment of joint ventures. The Council has retained the possibility of providing financial support through the FIFG for the establishment of such ventures until 2004. Support will only be available however if there is a fisheries agreement in place to lend consistency to the arrangement.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also draw your attention to the fact that the communication on association agreements in the fisheries sector adopted by the Commission does not exclude recourse to such an instrument in order to promote future associations. On the contrary, we advocate its use, together with that of other financial instruments, in order to promote their development.</p>
<p class="contents">I am confident that the communication on association agreements in the fisheries sector adopted by the Commission will provide a basis on which we can achieve significant and ground-breaking progress concerning the external dimension of the common fisheries policy. I trust that together we will be able to create the motivation to guarantee the sustainability of deep-sea fishing for the benefit of all.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that no political initiatives are being taken at Community level, the Commission is convinced that the size of the deep-sea fishing fleet will gradually decrease. This will probably not result in vessels being scrapped. Rather, the vessels are likely to operate under other flags, or the number of private fishing agreements will rise.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust the House will endorse this assessment of the situation. I very much hope that, as a result, Parliament will agree it is essential we do not create a situation in which the role of Community policy in external fisheries would be significantly reduced. This would run counter to our desire to establish a policy aimed at promoting sustainable fishing the world over. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stevenson (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I thank the Commissioner and congratulate Mrs Miguélez Ramos on her first-class report. Mrs Miguélez Ramos is, as you know, the senior vice-chairman of the Committee on Fisheries and is one of the most dedicated and hard-working members of that committee. Indeed I think it can be said that all the Spanish members of the fisheries committee are dedicated and hardworking; this is perhaps not surprising because the fishing industry is of such key importance to Spain, and the subject of this report is of such importance to the Spanish fleet in particular that this report was very appropriately awarded to Mrs Miguélez Ramos.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is worth noting that the Spanish fleet has a historic tradition of distant water fishing. For over a thousand years Spanish fishermen have been fishing off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador, hundreds of years before Christopher Columbus was alleged to have discovered America, and it is this distant water fleet that we now regard as an important contribution to the overall fisheries strategy within the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">In our debate this morning many speakers noted how important the aquaculture industry has become in meeting consumer demand for fish products against a background of collapsing fish stocks within our own EU waters. The involvement of European fishermen in international fisheries is of equal importance. The Community is only around 60% self–sufficient in fish and yet there is a rising demand for fish products in the wake of BSE and foot–and–mouth disease, and a gradual shift in consumer preference away from red meat. If we are to satisfy this consumer demand and endeavour to maintain as many jobs as possible in the fisheries sector, then the role of the international fisheries is of paramount importance. Mrs Miguélez Ramos has adequately demonstrated in her report, and said again in her introductory remarks, that for every euro we invest as a Community in this fishery we get 3 euros back in business terms.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is not only a good way of maintaining jobs in the sector, it is a good, profitable business for the Community economy. I also think it is worth saying here that agreements with countries outside the EU (third–country agreements) have attracted a bad press in the past and in some cases that bad press may have been merited. However, it is for this very reason that Mrs Miguélez Ramos calls in her report for better inspection, better monitoring and better policing of the international fisheries, and in particular for increased action against illegal fishing. If we are to ensure that such agreements are properly policed and that a substantial proportion of the finances are directed towards conservation and development, we will be in a better position to respond to our critics' legitimate concerns.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lage (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mrs Miguélez Ramos outlines a complete, lucid and intelligent framework for EU fishing in international waters. It leads us, with irrefutable logic, to the conclusion that the European Union must have an increasingly active fisheries policy in this field, to the contrary of what many critics or sceptics have said. This policy must even be brought to bear on the European Union’s diplomatic efforts, particularly where its trade policy is concerned. The European Union cannot do without international fishing grounds and the agreements negotiated with third countries, in the exclusive economic zones of these same countries. Those who are sceptical and critical of this policy seem to be ignoring the evidence provided by the report. This evidence states that fishing on the high seas by the European Union fleet provides work for 40 650 workers and that the catches total 2.7 million tonnes per year.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial effort from the budget of the European Union is, nevertheless, modest, since it only came to EUR 276.1 million in 2001. If EU vessels stop fishing in international waters, others would definitely take their place, without the ecological or social concerns that boats from the European Union have.</p>
<p class="contents">It is nevertheless crucial that, in exploiting international waters and the exclusive economic zones of other countries, European Union boats meet high ecological and social criteria and conditions, not least with regard to conserving fish resources. The European Union must set an example in complying with international agreements and must give a decisive boost to the regulation of international fishing. Secondly and lastly, the European Union must concentrate its efforts on research and on monitoring international waters, because unless the European Union or the international bodies in which it participates do not do so, illegal fishing will always take place in these waters place and they will always contain a no man's land, or in this case, no man's waters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We in Scotland know how painful it is for the fishing industry when crisis conditions are reached, but we cannot solve problems in the EU by exporting them. We must seek responsible and sustainable fisheries everywhere. The ELDR would like to thank Mrs Miguélez Ramos for her hard work on the dossier; we find particularly valuable the stress that is placed on the need to secure greater compliance with international law and for improved measures against illegal and unreported fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context we agree that the Commission must be resourced in a way that allows it to play a fuller role in regional fisheries organisation. We have, however, regularly expressed our concern on two issues. First, our fisheries activity at international level, and in particular any agreements reached directly with third countries, must be made compatible with our development policy. Secondly, the cost of the external dimension of the CFP is already approaching a third of its total budget. This cost is likely to increase if we are serious about fuller participation in regional fisheries organisations and about securing greater compliance with international law.</p>
<p class="contents">It has already been said that each euro invested from public funds generates another three in business terms. In these circumstances it seems only appropriate that those vessel owners who benefit from third–country agreements should take on a fairer share of the financial burden involved. The ELDR amendments address these developmental and financial concerns. We hope that the House will support them and that such issues will be given much fuller consideration in the debate on the recent Commission communication on fisheries agreements with third countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot continue to export our problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like this House to support Mrs Attwooll's amendments, which go some way towards improving the report, and my group will definitely be voting for these amendments. However, we cannot vote for the report itself, even if – as we hope – those amendments are adopted, because of the underlying policy and belief that we in the European Union can export our over–capacity, and that we have some historic right to exploit developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that down the centuries many Member States have colonised other countries and unjustly exploited the weaker and poorer countries of the world, but in the 21st century we should realise that the imperialist approach is wrong. We need to look at the social and economic contribution we make to developing countries, and in relation to fishing agreements this leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not just a Spanish problem. To my own shame my own country, Ireland, has the <span class="italic">Atlantic Dawn</span>, which is an exploitative vessel. Like many other huge vessels – in fact it is worse than other vessels because it is one of the largest there is – it goes to developing countries, acting as if it had some right to exploit the resources of other countries without any checks. Despite what has been said about European Union agreements, at least there is a certain amount of control, though they leave a lot to be desired. However, when it comes to private agreements, there is no control whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to look at our position as regards developing countries. I support what Mrs Attwooll has said. We cannot say one thing, and then do another. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not least, the World Wildlife Fund has been very vocal in its condemnation of these deals. I am encouraged that even in this Parliament, just one month ago, over 100 Members voted against the Senegal deal. To my astonishment I even agree with my own Foreign Office, for the first time ever. Even they recognise that these deals are just not working.</p>
<p class="contents">The report is very defensive in tone. It claims that EU fishermen 'are not pirates'. As to compliance with all the rules, that claim is distinctly at variance with the current report from the Court of Auditors. What is most disturbing is that the rapporteur and the Commissioner seem to be arguing that if we did not take up these fishing rights some other nation would and that somehow that might be even worse. Even if that were true – and I would not expect to see such a puerile argument – the fact must be that two wrongs do not make a right. Let us remind ourselves of what those wrongs are.</p>
<p class="contents">These deals are causing environmental devastation to less developed countries which, in biological terms, is like setting fire to the Serengeti. This is a form of European Union imperialism and it is denying development to these third world countries which otherwise could benefit their own economies. Furthermore these deals are morally repugnant, in that they directly and indirectly cause the deaths of hundreds of indigenous black African fishermen every year.</p>
<p class="contents">What this report asks us to do is to close our eyes, when in fact people are increasingly beginning to open their eyes. That is why we should reject this report. I suspect that there will still be a majority in favour, but be aware that people are waking up and will not tolerate these deals for very much longer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have made one thing clear today: we do not want fish out of a test–tube. We do not want fish only from aquaculture or a standardised packet off a supermarket shelf. We want more, even though the facts about our seas are bleak.</p>
<p class="contents">The fish on our plates comes more and more rarely from European Union waters. The indigenous supply cannot meet European demand. This indigenous supply does not offer an adequate prospect for the future. We are therefore reliant on fishing in foreign waters, both in international waters and in the coastal zones of other states. I would like to thank you, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, as rapporteur, for taking up this issue in a detailed own–initiative report and clearly identifying the key problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union's fisheries agreements are an important factor both for supply and employment, especially in the regions which depend on fishing. Simply rejecting a report, as has just been demanded, cannot be our objective, for we must examine these issues seriously despite all the potential contradictions.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor must we lose sight of the fact that we have exploited our own waters to the point where the stocks are exhausted. We need only think of the reform of the common fisheries policy. It would be fatal – as one of the previous speakers has said – simply to export these problems elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">I call for a sustainable approach to the fisheries agreements and a balanced distribution of use, but naturally also for an economically profitable approach, for I do not want to lose sight of reality. However, long–term public subsidies conflict with this goal. It is absurd to justify the irresponsible exploitation of stocks in other waters with arguments based on fleet reductions and market supply in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, our key goal must be to safeguard the sustainability of resources, both in European and foreign waters. However, in this context, we must genuinely accept responsibility, rather than simply seeking plaudits in the short term. This applies especially to international waters. Here, prompt action is needed to combat illegal fishing effectively. Controls alone are not sufficient. What we need is harmonisation of sanctions at international level. This can only take place jointly and in a global framework. The sanctions must not simply be tokenist. I know that the international community's mills – and our mills too – grind slowly, but we will continue to give them grist, and we will keep the wheels turning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission services even lack the necessary human, budgetary and material resources. Even fishing on the continental shelf and aquaculture are today, as always, seriously damaged, affected by disasters occurring on Galicia’s coasts, such as that of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>.
