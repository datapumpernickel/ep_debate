<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kratsa-Τsagaropoulou (PPE-DE),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that it is an excellent political conjuncture to be debating women in rural areas just when the reform of the common agricultural policy is being finalised, the reform of the common fisheries policy is continuing and nothing in the planned reforms has been decided for women. I thank the Conference of Presidents for approving the initiative of the Committee on Women's Rights to draft this report and all the political groups which, with their participation and amendments, have enriched the initial draft of my report. I also warmly thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for supporting this report and cooperating with us by drafting an opinion, the most important points of which are included in the proposed resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, in the European Union, we are looking for efficient strategies to develop rural areas on the basis of the new European standard and, at the same time, to combat local and regional inequalities. Within the framework of this policy, we all recognise that human resources are a development factor of prime importance. Our policies must therefore be based on the principle of equality between men and women if we really want to give development opportunities to all rural citizens, men and women alike.</p>
<p class="contents">The policies of the European Union to strengthen the role of women in rural areas have not had the anticipated results. Today, in the European Union, the proportion of women working in agriculture is 37%. This percentage varies from one country to another, but the situation on farm holdings and in social life in rural areas has more or less the same characteristics. Only one in five farms are managed by women and the majority of these are small farms. Over the last decade there has only been an increase in this proportion of 1%. Approximately one in two women involved in agricultural production and life have the status of farmer's wife or partner, a status of invisible, unrecognised work which is not in keeping with the quality of work objectives of the European citizen and which does not provide any preconditions for personal development and the growth of local society.</p>
<p class="contents">The level of education of women is very low, both as regards basic education and as regards the level of full or partial agricultural education. Social security differs from country to country. In some places women farmers have derived [rights], in some places the same rights, and in this report we maintain that this issue should be dealt with seriously at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had a shortage of tools to date. Directive 86/613 on the application of the principle of equality between men and women, which also covers agricultural activity, is not binding enough and we therefore maintain it should be revised and brought into line with the new situation. The Member States, for their part, must also recognise and safeguard the work of women farmers, as regards security and pensions, with contributions at levels compatible with family work.</p>
<p class="contents">Another proposal by our committee is that, within the framework of the programmes and the funding of the Structural Funds for rural development, especially the Leader Plus programme, particular attention should be paid to strengthening the role of women farmers. At the same time, the Leader Observatory must be strengthened, so that it covers the gaps in European statistics as regards the situation of women in rural areas and completes them by collating additional figures and introducing networks so that we can track the situation as it stands today and measure the progress we hope there will be in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the resolution which I recommend that you approve proposes replacing the current method of calculating subsidies, funding for farm holdings, which takes account of the holdings and not the active persons, with the result that women working as the second member of the couple lose out under a system which takes no account of the total number of people working on the holding and their real contribution. It is proposed to direct the funds obtained from redistributing direct support to programmes in favour of women farmers, while we call on the European Commission to make provision within the framework of the future programme for the Structural Funds for rural development, in the new programme period, for a special programme for women farmers, due to the fact that, so far, the horizontal lines in the Structural Funds have not achieved the expected results.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we call on both the European Commission and the Member States to make life in rural areas easier and more attractive to young women, young women farmers, because we see that the presence of women in rural areas is a declining demographic development. You can find all the proposals and the explanatory statement in our report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes Mira,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(ES)</span> First of all, I wish to thank Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for having taken the initiative with this report, and I would also like to express my gratitude to Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture on this report.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee has welcomed this report, with the content of which it largely agrees. This is an own-initiative report and raises a set of issues that will help to place women nearer the centre of the Union’s common agricultural and rural development policies. The report pursues the same approach taken by the Agriculture Council in its conclusions of May 2002 on gender equality in the CAP and in rural development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">That document focuses on the need to consolidate the second pillar of the CAP and the Commission fully shares this opinion. In fact, in our proposals for CAP reform, which were approved in Luxembourg last week, additional funds have already been set aside for rural development as of 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Before making a detailed study of some of the points, I should like to recall that Regulation (EEC) No 1257/99 on rural development aid already allows Member States to include specific measures for women in their rural development programmes, such as investment in farm holdings run by women, aid to integrate young women farmers, training, the marketing and processing of farm products, aid for artesanal activity, rural tourism and other things.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Member States have already funded measures specifically targeting women or have integrated the principle of equal opportunities in their programmes for rural development, for example, including gender as a selection criterion for allocating Union funds. For this reason, some of the measures that the report calls on the Commission to take, such as item 6, for example, should be requested by the Member States that are already in a position to implement them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees fully with some of the requests made in the report. I shall now address these. First of all, in its procedures for approving relevant projects under the Structural Funds, Parliament asks the Commission to ensure that due attention is paid to the need to give women in farming a more relevant role to play. From the beginning, in the 2000-2006 Structural Funds programming period, the Commission recommended that the principle of equal opportunities should be integrated into the Structural Funds and, more recently, the Commission published a Communication that includes recommendations to Member States such as awarding extra points in the selection criteria to projects that contribute to gender equality or to the application of specialist knowledge in this area in the funds’ management.</p>
<p class="contents">The interim evaluation of the Structural Funds, due to take place at the end of this year, will take account of these developments. The Commission also agrees with the European Parliament’s insistence on the importance of the Leader initiative – items 12, 13 and 25 of its report – in promoting the role of women in rural areas. The Member States are already obliged to reveal in their annual reports the number of local action groups in which women are part of the decision-making body, the number of women who benefit from Leader funds and the budget that is allocated to these projects. The interim evaluation of Leader, which will be presented at the end of this year, will also give us a better understanding of how these initiatives are working.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission intends, in line with the proposal you make in item 24, to ensure that one of the tasks of the future European observatory, Leader, is to compile and disseminate best practice on integrating and involving farmers in rural development.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees with Parliament on the need to create incentives to encourage women’s participation in farm production and to promote a balanced representation of women farmers in the various decision-making bodies. There are, however, some points your report makes with which the Commission cannot agree. The report wants the Commission to attach priority to ensuring that resources obtained through the modulation of direct aid are reallocated to programmes that incorporate measures to benefit the social groups most in need, such as women in rural areas. Nevertheless, as you know, it falls to the Member States to decide on the future reallocation of resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor can the Commission accept the request to create a unit responsible for equal opportunities in the Directorate-General for Agriculture. This Directorate-General has already conducted a highly detailed study of the issue of equality, and consequently we do not see any need to go further.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to look at Parliament’s request for a revision of Directive 86/613/EEC on the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity, including agriculture. The Commission is of the opinion that such a revision is unnecessary, since many aspects of this Directive, especially those concerning employment and working conditions, are already regulated in the recent Directive 2002/73/EC amending Directive 76/207/EEC, and, given that these recent amendments also apply to self-employed workers pursuant to Paragraph 1(3), we do not feel there is any need to go further.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, applying the category of self-employed worker to spouses provides, in principle, adequate coverage for social security schemes, without discriminating on the grounds of gender since the applicable legislation would in this case be Directive 79/7/EEC, on the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security, which would enable us to address such situations.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the observations I wish to make on this initiative, and I thank you very much for having undertaken this task. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Women play a decisive part in the economic development of rural areas. Women’s continuing role, especially on small farms, as invisible workers – to which reference has just been made – is also made apparent by agricultural statistics according to which the proportion of women varies slightly from 0.2% to 0.3%, although nobody can deny that, as there is such a wide range of tasks to be done, women may well do more work on farms than men. This, then, is where we have to focus more on women’s role in the labour force.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, nobody will now expect the Agriculture Directorate-General to turn itself into an equal opportunities office for women – that would surely be to ask too much of it – but the programmes can of course include priorities that also take women into account, and I acknowledge that the Commission is already doing something about this. If we consider the ways in which funds are allocated, it becomes clear that what we call bottom-up approaches – that is to say, those in which local labour is involved – provide specific opportunities for women. On the whole, they are much more actively involved than are the men. If we give our attention to this, we will enhance women’s role as workers and give them greater economic clout, and that will benefit rural areas as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may, as a man, conclude my speech by saying so, women will of course – as they must – defend their own interests, and we see in rural areas that they are very well able to do this and that they are already playing their part in shaping agricultural policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, at last, there will be improved opportunities for giving support in this area, although, of course, for the farmers whose income is to be cut, this is no substitute and not much of a comfort. This is where women will come into their own, having, as is well known, a greater flexibility and more imaginative approach when it comes to taking on new tasks that can bring in some additional income.</p>
<p class="contents">This does of course depend on the right framework conditions being in place, and also on gender mainstreaming – or, to put it in comprehensible terms, equality of opportunity for men and women. Serious attention needs to be given to this in this context, so that new potential sources of income can be opened up in labour, marketing, tourism and culture – areas in which women are especially efficient, and in relation to which there are many sensible suggestions in the report by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, whom I thank most warmly for her work.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly grateful that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, in its opinion, harks back to my 1997 report on the situation of assisting spouses of the self-employed in agriculture. Six years have passed since this House called upon the Commission to cause an amendment to be made to the 1986 directive on the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity, including agriculture. I regret that the Commission has taken no specific action in response to this report. As Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has just reminded us, we did, for example, demand the registration of working married couples, so that they would no longer be invisible in the labour force.</p>
<p class="contents">If I might say one last thing, Mr President, if you want to do something to keep women in rural areas, you have to ensure that they suffer no discrimination either as regards fair payment for their work or as regards social security. We want and need mandatory insurance specifically for the millions of assisting spouses, and this is where I might, perhaps, recommend Luxembourg’s approach as exemplary.</p>

You too, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, spoke as chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. Women make up some 40% of the fifteen million people who work in agriculture in the EU, and run one in every five farms – around 1.3 million – which, apart from a mere 3% larger ones, are small and medium-sized operations. Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou’s report gives more detailed information on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Although, of all the Community’s policies, the CAP is far and away the most highly developed, there is still a positively criminal neglect of gender mainstreaming. The consequence of this is that there is scarcely any visible sign of women in rural areas enjoying equal status and equal rights. Although a number of instruments have been devised, any visible breakthrough in the CAP is still a long way in the future. Even though, in my view, the reform of agricultural policy left the fields strewn with dead lobbyists, it does have a very apparent shortcoming in that women have not managed to get the systematic promotion of women in agriculture accepted. Especially painful though that is, it is primarily in the restructuring of rural areas in the candidate countries in Central and Eastern Europe that even greater pain will be felt.</p>
<p class="contents">What is on our minds is the new working arrangements that have to be devised. We are thinking about facilities that improve the balance between working life and family life, as well as about childcare facilities, and the provision of care for disabled and older people. We are thinking about the need to further develop rural tourism, and about how to promote alternative energies, and regional marketing cycles. These may be only <span class="italic">ad hoc </span>approaches, but they have added to the range of culture on offer.</p>
<p class="contents">Women have eventually found a small niche in all this and seized an opportunity, but I think of the state of Bavaria, from which I come and which the President knows well – there, in 2002, EUR 17 million from the rural development programme were not allocated, which – if we add in the co-financed sums that could have been used for specific projects, including for women – means that a total of EUR 34 million could not be paid out. As regards many of the available resources, we still have to exert pressure on the Member States, and so I ask the Commission, when monitoring the programmes’ operation, to pay much closer attention to the way in which gender mainstreaming is actually implemented, so that it does not remain merely a topic for pious utterances.</p>
<p class="contents">My group has endorsed Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou’s report. We have tabled amendments in the hope of extending it to cover the fisheries sector, in which a very large number of women work. I speak also on behalf of the rapporteur when I ask the House to support us in seeking this, and I appeal to the Commission to include this dimension.</p>

Women have far too little power; far too few of them are at the helm of businesses, and in my country, the Netherlands, with 6% of female business managers, they are worse off than anywhere else; we should hang our heads in shame.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, one in two women farmers fall within the spouse or partner category, which is particularly detrimental to their entitlement to social security. That should change; in that respect, I totally agree with what Mrs Lulling said about finally adopting the recommendations of 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, for a moment, to dwell upon the rural policy regulation. Agricultural policy has indeed changed recently, and I do not know whether we should be that pleased with every aspect of this change. When the whole dossier is finally analysed, the rural policy regulation appears to have become the cuckoo in the nest. Mr Olsson too has already indicated in his report on rural policy how important this can be, for example, in order to give the switch-over to other sources of income, such as, agro-tourism, care farms, new energy sources, organic farming, local services and cultural manifestations a shot in the arm. That is where opportunities lie, particularly for women. This has already been said by other speakers and I should like to add something.</p>
<p class="contents">There are vast areas in Europe with large cities. Particularly rural areas near large cities can develop a raft of special services, and so I urge that this rural regulation should include a rural policy criterion in relation to large cities. I really think it is worth giving serious thought to this as a committee, and I have also raised questions in writing on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to warn against certain forms of rural pauperisation. Although buildings, in particular, do, in fact, form part of the cultural heritage, they are in a bad state of repair in many areas. I think that a sound rural policy could save a great deal, and especially for women, there are many opportunities to use these buildings for new services, such as cultural events, receiving tourists, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">I was disappointed when the Commissioner said that he could not give any guarantees for channelling the resources from the CAP leg to the second pillar. I know that the Commission wanted to put aside more resources for this in the first instance and that the Council cut these back. I also know therefore, that we must sound the alarm, particularly in our own country, but nevertheless, I hope that the Commission will continue to insist on a greater shift towards the rural policy regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In many cases, however, their contribution is not properly recognised and they do not have the support they need for their quality of life to improve. This report is thus very timely. I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, on the work she has carried out, and especially on her inclusion of proposals, some of them tabled by me, relating to the need to put particular emphasis on family-based farming, support for small and medium-sized farmers, and recognition of women from these areas in terms of social security. The latter includes women’s right to a respectable retirement pension, though without their having to pay contributions which impose an excessive burden on family farms.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot, I fear, offer similar congratulations to the Agriculture Council on its conclusions of 25 and 26 June, in relation to the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP), because I believe that these conclusions pave the way for severe problems for family-based agriculture and small and medium-sized farmers. Women in rural areas play a prominent role in such farms, especially in less-favoured regions and in countries such as my own.</p>
<p class="contents">I would emphasise the special importance of the statement made in the report under debate here to the effect that the mid-term review of the CAP will only have a positive impact on equal opportunities if its objectives are substantially modified so as to ensure that family-based agriculture and small and medium-sized farmers are given particular prominence. Equally important, however, are the proposals upholding the establishment of a specific programme devoted to the ‘Women’ project, as well as those proposals emphasising the need to pay particular attention to creating public infrastructures, community facilities and quality services, so as to ensure an appropriate network of rural services in all areas, including high-quality family planning, educational and training services and cultural facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">I would conclude by insisting also on the need to close the severe gaps in agricultural statistics. The appropriate measures could then be adopted to improve living conditions for these women and make it easier for young women farmers to establish themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think, Commissioner, that the whole debate illustrates the fact that we are facing two major problems.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I should like to see the common agricultural policy as an opportunity to look at rural development in a new light. For this purpose, we will need to employ all the forces in rural areas. We will need to shape those forces.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of these forces are more flexible than others. I know from experience that women are often much more open to innovation than men. I therefore hope that projects will be set up whereby entrepreneurship – which women display in practice but which is often not recognised economically, politically or socially – will be promoted.</p>
<p class="contents">This recognition is, of course, necessary. I would like to give the example of farm tourism in Australia, where agriculture stopped being profitable a long time ago. Families there live by farm tourism. What would become of this without the female entrepreneur? This does, of course, require a proper social statute.</p>
<p class="contents">Do you not find it shameful that after all these years, as Mrs Lulling clearly stressed, there is still not one country, as far as I know, that has a proper statute for the self-employed helper? This is all done in dribs and drabs. It remains a major problem and I think that the Union should take the initiative to guarantee women helpers in rural areas at least a minimum social standard.</p>

In so doing I ask the House to reflect on and acknowledge their already outstanding contribution, in particular the sacrifices and generosity of previous generations of rural women, who silently toiled under the most difficult conditions with little or no recognition other than the satisfaction of ensuring the welfare of their families and instilling in them the culture, ethos and spiritual values of a profession that has no equal. Society owes them a debt of gratitude.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of CAP reform, and with the greater emphasis on rural development, the role of women in rural society is of increasing importance. Their leadership qualities are crucial in the mobilisation of the human and physical resources of the rural areas of an enlarged European Union. Equal opportunities for rural women are a necessary prerequisite if we are to achieve the full potential of rural development measures. I would like to see, for example, the Early Retirement from Farming Scheme amended to provide for their greater security.</p>
<p class="contents">Not for the first time I express concern about the continuity of the EU family farm structure, of which women are an important component. Uncertainty about the long-term economic sustainability of farming, coupled with the availability of more financially rewarding employment for young people, has led to a worrying increase in the age profile of European farmers, of whom 37% are women. Of the 14.65 million people working on farms in the EU, 5.37 million are women. The figure for Portugal, at 49%, is the highest and for Ireland, my own country, at 11%, the lowest. Ireland's unique family-farm structure is, however, best demonstrated by the fact that 97% of Irish farms are jointly managed, with women playing an equal and important role. If national governments are to achieve the desirable objective of restoring urban rural balance, already seriously out of hand, then the role of women must be adequately recognised and rewarded.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, in Ireland there are many examples of women in leadership roles. The Leader Programme is just one area that comes to my mind. Likewise, the Irish Countrywomen's Association <span class="bold"></span> one of the oldest in Europe <span class="bold"></span> has played an historic role in advancing the cause of rural women and in bridging the rural and urban divide. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given the short deadline, she has taken a very reasonable and consensus-based approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, at the Third World Congress of rural women held in Madrid, the principle of equal opportunities for countrywomen was upheld as a separate requisite of sustainable development for the rural areas of Europe. Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou's report follows that line. She urges the Commission and the Member States, in cooperation with local government, to implement policies to improve the general living conditions of women in rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Although she clearly proposes the adaptation of the Leader+ programme to the new circumstances arising from the accession of the candidate countries, the Commission, as Commissioner Solbes said, will not necessarily go further and immediately extend this adaptation process to all Community initiatives, Interreg, Equal, Urban, etc. The accession of the new members of the European Union will overturn the current criteria and methods for maintaining the rural areas' internal balance, owing to the fact that the percentage of the rural population in the European Union will more than double this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we have no reliable statistics on the percentage of women in these areas, either in the European Union or in the accession countries, the Spanish Economic and Social Council has put forward its available statistics on the European Union's Member States. To refer to just one statistic: half of all women working in rural areas only have primary school education.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is quite evident that the Council of Agriculture Ministers needs to make a special effort actively to incorporate the gender dimension in rural development issues. As the rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, clearly urges, it is absolutely necessary to ensure that the old saying 'men for production, women for reproduction' no longer has any meaning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that it opens the door to more profound and structural phenomena, which relate to women in rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we have so far had successes in relation to isolated aspects, projects such as Equal and many others, which represent bringing women closer, an intention to help women in rural areas. But often society does not accept or support these efforts by the European Union to help women. The Leader projects, for example, are not always led by women. It is frankly difficult to find a woman sitting at the table: the social system rejects it. What worries me in particular, however, are the structural problems. For example, the depopulation of the countryside essentially goes hand in hand with the abandonment of women, because women have no place in the rural environment, their requirements are not socially recognised, they can neither exercise their rights nor develop themselves as individuals. Studies have been done, in the University of Cantabria for example, which demonstrate that practically 99% of women with university qualifications do not wish to return to the countryside.</p>
<p class="contents">We must incentivise transversal policies for helping women. For example, with regard to accessibility of services, we must support the policy of subsidised transport, because women in the countryside often live far from any opportunity, far from medical service, and their children are far away from education since school transport has been removed. Amongst the transversal support policies we should promote access to IT systems and bring the wealth of the urban system closer to the countryside.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, I believe we should study the harm that will be done through the delocalised policy, because clearly, not only are women going to end up without work, as in the case of the milk crisis, for example, and many other agriculture crises, but also their moveable and immoveable assets – particularly the former – will no longer be in the market. Furthermore, reforestation is all very well, but we should bear in mind that these people go to the city without any assets, which have been the inheritance upon which they have supported the development of their enterprise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have therefore changed my initial position and I am voting in favour of this final text.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of the Council of Ministers of 26 June 2003, however, have been insufficient in this regard. I understand the efforts made today by Commissioner Solbes to present it in a positive manner. I understand it because Mr Solbes, when he was Minister for Agriculture in Spain, was sensitive towards women in the field of rural development. What has been agreed on the reform of the CAP, however, in no way takes women into consideration. What is more, neither Commissioner Fischler in his proposals, nor what the Ministers have approved, makes the slightest mention of women. I have studied all the agreements and only indirectly, by means of rural development or the mention of young farmers, can I see any improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind, therefore, the importance of these agreements on the reform of the CAP, this is very serious and we must ensure that the regulations included in this reform take account of women.</p>
<p class="contents">The most interesting points in the Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou report, as it now stands, are the recognition and improvements for assisting spouses, men and women, the effective promotion measures, microloans, soft loans, and the proposal, which is very necessary, that women should participate in decision-making in professional and sectoral agricultural organisations. It is necessary because the CAP is still sexist. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it does not highlight the causes or who is responsible for this situation. A conscientious effort is being made to disorientate by creating the impression in women farmers that their position can be improved within the framework of the even harsher anti-farming measures being promoted with the recent reform of the CAP.</p>
<p class="contents">The findings about the efficiency of programmes such as Leader I and II are also misleading. It is a known fact that these programmes refer to complementary actions as far as farming and rural development are concerned and the level of funding under the so-called second pillar is not only trivial, but also mainly profits those who exercise a business activity in the subsidised sectors of these programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The report essentially accepts the supplementary and unequal role of women farmers in agricultural activity, as well as the effort to remove women in rural areas from agricultural employment, which is why they are being guided to similar activities. These proposals serve the European Union's objective to further shrink the agricultural population and desert rural areas, which already have huge abandonment problems, especially in Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this being so, proposals such as creating crèches, cultural centres, public transport and so on range from the insignificant to the cynically hypocritical. Women farmers' acute problems are the result of the CAP and anti-farming policies. Consequently, only overturning them can safeguard the continuity of farming activity, a stable income and a dignified standard of living for women farmers.</p>

She has made a very big contribution to promoting and highlighting the problems faced by a particular professional category of women, women farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, understanding and valuing the particular contribution which women farmers can make to improving rural areas, organised a public dialogue on the subject on 18 March 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the recent reform of the CAP, we expect, Commissioner, the additional funds which will be made available for rural development to target and improve the life of women farmers, which is downgraded and undervalued in all the regions of the European Union. We particularly hope that the necessary infrastructures will be created which will allow women farmers to combine their working and family life and have quality of life.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we recognise that the third Community Support Framework helped enormously to create an institutional and funding action framework for rural development, which included women. In Greece, thousands of women are benefiting from the Community initiative, Leader. Nonetheless, legal and advisory support is needed for women in rural areas, with information and awareness-raising actions within local communities, training programmes, actions which will support the specific needs of women and local development objectives, in the aim of supporting and safeguarding employment and ensuring women farmers stay in their area.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to refer to a very successful field of action in Greece, women's cooperatives, especially rural tourism cooperatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The aim of this recognition will only be usefully achieved if the Commission applies itself to submitting a revised directive that would finally enable a genuine policy of equality to be developed in this sector, which should lead to the balanced representation of women farmers in the various decision-making arenas, access to separate social rights, the principle of equal pay, particular focus on the needs of women in rural areas when actions are selected and extending the LEADER + programme to cover the new situations created by enlargement.</p>
