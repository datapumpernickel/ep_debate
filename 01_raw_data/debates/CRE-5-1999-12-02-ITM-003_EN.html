<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fraga Estévez (PPE-DE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (ES)</span> Mr President, the current common organisation of the markets has been showing signs of running out of steam. This is due to its inability to meet the new challenges of a highly globalised and competitive market in fishery products, in a European Union very dependent on imports. This House has, on many occasions, highlighted this problem and called for substantial changes.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now finally debating the Committee on Fisheries’ report on a proposal for a regulation which does not just reform the COM but establishes a completely new system. This is not just any old debate but one which affects one of the four pillars of the Community fisheries policy. It must therefore be as productive and responsible as the debate we had in the Committee on Fisheries because this report, which I ask you to approve, is the result of a hard-won compromise between the political groups and the various sectorial and national interests.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I believe we should acknowledge that the Commission’s initial proposal significantly improved the current COM. In particular, it reinforced the fundamental role played by the producers’ organisations in the marketing of products. It also granted them increased and improved mechanisms for ensuring correct operation and more responsible fishing and marketing.</p>
<p class="contents">However, our committee had to change the text of the proposal on two major aspects. In both cases this was achieved through the compromises which I have mentioned. The first compromise was reached by including aquaculture products and shellfish gathering for which no marketing aid was provided. Yet these are both subsectors which, like fishing, must be fully included in a system whose aim is to match supply to demand. They are also developing sectors in which production must be well planned so that crises, such as those which are periodically suffered by salmon producers, can, as far as possible, be avoided from the outset.</p>
<p class="contents">The other aspect which we corrected is even more serious, if this is possible. As I mentioned at the beginning, this type of regulation should be prepared very carefully, particularly when proposing a change from a quota system to a system of indefinite tariff suspension for imports. Yet the Commission acted not just thoughtlessly but even frivolously and irresponsibly.</p>
<p class="contents">Please understand that the Committee on Fisheries is not opposed to the system of tariff suspension. However, we must be certain that this system, which actually involves the voluntary removal of tariff duties, will not threaten Community companies which produce and market the same products. The Commission’s proposal included several products which are produced in the Community on a large scale. This is proven by the study being prepared at the request of the Council because the Commission’s figures lacked justification.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, for one of these products – tuna fillets – this study establishes deficit levels of between 1 500 and 3 000 tonnes. Without considering any comparative information, the Commission was therefore recklessly prepared to stifle a Community sector which provides thousands of jobs. This would also have blocked its own systems of aid for the development of GSP-Drug and ACP countries just because of an actual import requirement of less than 3 000 tonnes which can be completely covered by the current system of tariff quotas. Although the compromise reached by our committee on this issue was particularly difficult to achieve, the facts seem to justify this. Following the political agreement achieved in the last Council of Ministers, both tuna fillets and herring now fall outside the tariff suspension system, in addition to another set of corrections affecting other products contained in Annex V.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore feel that the Commission’s proposal was not well prepared. In fact, it was dangerous and we are pleased with the Council’s correction which matches ours in making the compensation for withdrawals more flexible. With these two major changes incorporated in committee, together with others such as greater precision in labelling and information to consumers, this House is helping to prevent a text which has its good points from being ineffective due to its lack of realism. I therefore ask you all to approve this report.</p>
<p class="contents">It only remains for me to thank all the Members who helped to achieve this compromise for their hard work and assistance. I ask you again to approve this report. Thanks should also go to Mr Gallagher for his excellent report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gallagher (UEN) </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – Mr President and Commissioner, in introducing this report on the conservation of fishing resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms, I can be confident that the proposals are based on sound scientific advice. As my European Parliament colleagues will know, the Fisheries Committee has been a strong supporter of technical conservation measures based on technical and scientific data.</p>
<p class="contents">This is particularly so where efforts are made to cross-reference scientific data with fisheries observations. Fishermen spend more time at sea than scientists and the sea is their natural environment, which they observe on a daily basis. They have a better understanding of fish movements and factors affecting fish stocks than people give them credit for, quite simply because it is essential for their livelihood. The House will recall the positive opinion on the substance of the measures and resolution of 25 October 1996, the Gallagher report, and its opinion of 26 April 1998 on the implementation of technical measures in the common fisheries policy. On 30 March 1998, the Council of Ministers adopted Regulation 850/98 for the conservation of fishing resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles. This regulation replaced 894/97 with the exception of Articles 11, 19 and 20 which related to driftnets and which were dealt with separately.</p>
<p class="contents">After the adoption and publication of this regulation, data brought to the attention of the Commission necessitated its incorporation into this regulation. The regulation of 13 March 1998 is due to come into effect on 1 January next year. However, it is imperative that the additional data and developments which have come too late be incorporated in this regulation and ensure that it is part of the regulation coming into force on 1 January. The present proposal for a Council regulation provides for changes to the area and timing of restrictions designed to protect the spawning of the Douglas Bank herring in the Irish Sea. In view of the current healthy state of herring stocks, the proposal changes allow for a reduction in both the area and the time period of fishing restrictions. This will increase fishing opportunities while, at the same time, protecting the stocks and ensure that there is no repeat of the collapse of the stocks which we recall in 1970.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to note that the scientific, technical and economic committee have supported the proposal, having examined the report of the advisory committee of fisheries management during its November 1999 session, in addition to the specific provisions on the use of Danish seine nets in the plaice box. This merely corrects an oversight in the original text. The conditions agreed within the international dolphin conservation programme for the use of purse seines which commonly will apply provisionally within the Community incorporate into this regulation a revision of mesh size for two species of spotted dogfish. Technical conservation measures will play an important role in the conservation of stocks by protecting juvenile fish and will reduce the threat to further yields.</p>
<p class="contents">A clear message must go out from this Parliament, from the Commission and from the Council to the fishing industry that honest endeavours will be respected and those fishermen who abide by technical conservation measures that are devised by accredited European scientists in partnership with fishermen will benefit most. If amendments are necessary in the light of new developments, no doubt the Commission will come back with further proposals and I am quite certain that the Committee and Parliament will respond expeditiously.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank my colleagues, the officials in committee and the officials in the Commission for their assistance in drawing up this report and I want to congratulate Mrs Fraga Estévez on the presentation of her very comprehensive report. But I must say that I am disappointed here today that the Council have already decided and that we are debating a report when a decision has been taken.</p>
<p class="contents">I must pose the question: are we ordering our business in a correct fashion? Commissioner Fischler told us we had no co-responsibility, but that our views would be taken into consideration. How can our views be taken into consideration when we are debating a report which has already been decided on by Council? I would sincerely hope the Council and the Commission have taken note of our views.</p>
<p class="contents">They were obviously monitoring the progress of this report through the committee, and I am pleased that they have rejected a proposal to allow unlimited quantities of herring into the Union, quantities of fresh, chilled and frozen herring at preferable rates of duty. Now it has been restricted from 2001 to 20 000 tonnes. It is still too much in view of the fact that the prices of herring in the Community at the moment are at an all-time low. This is because of the overloading of the EU market with low-price fish and frozen herring from Norway and the setting up by German companies of low-cost production units in Poland for processing duty-free Norwegian fish for export to Germany. We must remember, we have a duty and a responsibility to the Community fishermen and we must ensure that their rights are protected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Something has to change there. But first I have something to tell you on a more cheery note. Yesterday, following the trialogue between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, I was reassured in the Committee on Budgets that the financing for the important fisheries agreement with Morocco was secured at second reading. We have taken a significant step forward and a sound foundation has been laid for the forthcoming negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">It was possible to discern the beginnings of a change of direction in the debate in the Committee on Fisheries on the report by Carmen Fraga, and this change will take hold in the new year. The joint struggle has forged bonds between us within the Committee, both on general and more specific issues. It was, and continues to be, about supplying the European market with fish and about targeted production for export so as to preserve direct and indirect jobs at sea and on land. We are a Community based on solidarity and it should stay that way.</p>
<p class="contents">Now there is a new Parliament and a new Commission with many new personalities and new emphases. The market situation in general, not just in relation to the WTO negotiations, and the different understanding new personalities have of traditional practices, also bring about changes in the issues dealt with in committee, both in respect of content and the weight they are given. In future, therefore, we must also examine other viewpoints more closely. The rapporteur has presented a very well thought-out report. It received a majority vote. However, the outcome failed to satisfy several Members, which means that discussions in committee will now become livelier. The Committee on Budgets has long been asking for this. At the same time, no one wants to give up the solidarity we have with an endangered but important economic and policy arm of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Solidarity cannot, by definition, be called for from one side alone, though. The unanswered questions on the GMO report are as follows: how many subsidies and customs tariffs does the fisherman need and to what extent can the industry sustain a liberalised, global trading zone? To what extent is free competition compatible with fair competition? Grants give way to helping people to help themselves. But the net must not be closed in so tightly that those concerned no longer have to make any effort at all to maintain their independent position on the market of supply and demand. Where do we draw the line between private enterprise and planned economy measures? Questions upon questions. What is more, the EU budget is tight. </p>
<p class="contents">Why is it necessary for financial support to be extended to aquaculture as well? It is a new market segment in the breeding sector which, in view of efficient management, is able to guarantee greater stability of planning and supply than the fishing industry is capable of. Ought it not to be the fishing industry and its market prospects that attract an increased level of financial support? It is understandable that the Member States do not say no to receiving EU subsidies for this sector. As I see it, the upshot is as follows: the Commission's proposal was amended to a considerable extent. Votes against and abstentions must therefore be respected for the reasons cited earlier. The discussion on the common organisation of the markets does not end there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have spent two years extensively discussing the Community fisheries market. It is now finally the turn of the whole House to adopt a stance through this report which was approved by a large majority in the Committee on Fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">Our market has a deficit of fishery products. Some 60% of the fishery products consumed in Europe are imported. The Community fisheries sector is extraordinarily active and competitive and plays an important role in maintaining economic and social cohesion in Europe. Our duty is therefore to ensure and guarantee its future. The European market is not a closed market. It is open in that products from GSP countries enter free of tariffs or at low tariffs. We make strict demands on our fishermen in terms of gear, conservation and handling of catches which are not compulsory for foreign fleets. For us as Socialists, the Community preference is therefore our commitment to the Community fisheries sector, to our people, fishermen, fishing industry workers and shipowners who hope to be able to continue their activities and keep their jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not therefore, as proposed by the Commission, replace the current and flexible tariff quota system with the total or partial suspension of tariff duties. We oppose this removal of tariffs because we believe that we do not need to protect, as Mrs Langenhagen said, but at least defend a competitive and modern sector which is still not prepared for total liberalisation. The same is true of many other sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Many questions continue to concern us. These include the cut in financing which excludes important growth sectors such as aquaculture, the lack of definition of the information to be received by the consumer, as specifically mentioned by Mrs Fraga Estévez, with regard to the distribution of areas proposed by the Commission, and the lack of other relevant data such as minimum sizes.</p>
<p class="contents">As Socialists, our priorities include consumer protection. The defence of quality is one way of protecting these rights. We therefore want to encourage measures which emphasise quality fishery products and, at the same time, we ask for sustainable management of resources to ensure the future of fishing. Fishing must be allowed, but in accordance with the requirements of the market and the respectful management of the product.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, we Socialists want to defend European producers, consumers and importers and we believe that with the report approved by the Committee on Fisheries, with the excellent work carried out by Mrs Fraga Estévez – who I congratulate – and with the agreement reached by the Council of Ministers, we can, in the main, be satisfied. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will strengthen producer organisations giving them incentives to better resource management and it will introduce greater stability into the supply of fish for processing.</p>
<p class="contents">We also consider that there are many respects in which the report introduces major improvements to the original proposal, and we congratulate Mrs Fraga accordingly. There are, however, some areas in which we continue to have doubts. First, there are various articles, notably 11(2), where we believe that the original Commission proposals provide greater security against over-fishing than do the amendments in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, we take the view that guide prices should be fixed by reference to national ports rather than to representative ports simply because the latter idea is too lacking in specification.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, a number of us consider that the additional costs involved do not warrant extension of some of the measures to aquaculture, though I would add this is not my own view. Aquaculture is of such major importance to Scotland where many fragile local economies depend upon it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have very mixed feelings about Article 28 and the amendment to it. On the one hand, we fear that the amendment might delay implementation, and we also have certain concerns about its precise content. On the other hand, we accept that there should be a rational basis for tariff suspension rather than it resulting simply from a shopping list provided by Member States. We look to the Commission to provide such a rational basis.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, we believe that the measures being undertaken fit well with the projected regionalisation of the common fisheries policy to which we are firmly committed, and we hope that proposals to this end will be put before Parliament soon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should tell you that since yesterday and again today, all the fishing ports along the Mediterranean coast have been on strike because the fishermen are protesting against the price of diesel oil and the collapse in the prices of bluefish, tuna, sardines and also eels that are not sold any more. A real market problem exists and it is the whole of this profession that is being ruined. And they are protesting against the European directives that they find too restrictive. In the context of discussions like these, we need to show our support for the fishing trade.</p>
<p class="contents">I will raise three points with regard to Mrs Fraga Estévez’s excellent report: firstly, traceability. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is in favour of detailed labelling on the products, from first sale to the last, so that people know where the product has been caught, how and also whether it is a product of fishing or aquaculture. We wish to go even further than the proposals made by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on the questions relating to withdrawal and destruction, a reference price, a guide price, is fixed and subsidies are granted when the fishery products are not sold. Subsidies are also granted to conserve and store products. Our group is in favour of this when it is a matter of conserving products and not wasting them, but if it is a matter of increasing the amount of fishing undertaken only to then destroy the fish, we are not in favour. We believe that the producers’ organisations should be made aware so that the fisheries plan is well established throughout the year and so that intensive fishing is not favoured only to subsequently destroy the fish. It is very important and perhaps requires an increase in the reference price and, in the end, a whole procedure, but we should like the resource to be well managed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I will conclude by saying that as far as the customs duties are concerned, we are not in favour of these duties being systematically abolished. An impact study should be undertaken, as Mrs Fraga Estévez proposes, and objective criteria should be established before deciding which customs duties will be abolished.</p>

I hope, even with the commitments made by the Council, that the latter takes due regard of the results of the debate and the Fraga Estévez report in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the contents of the report, I must congratulate Mrs Fraga Estévez. As usual, she has worked very hard and I particularly want to acknowledge the effort made to achieve compromises. As is to be expected, compromises do not satisfy everyone and this case is no exception. I am unhappy with one aspect of the report in that it proposes an extension of the limits set by the Commission for fishery withdrawals. Faced with increasingly scarce fish stocks, it seems absurd to fish to destruction and immoral to waste quality protein. This reflects one of the shortcomings of the Commission’s proposal which should have supplemented the COM framework with a mechanism to maintain the income of fishery workers. This would allow the effect of price falls to be limited and would therefore make recourse to the withdrawal and destruction of fishery products unnecessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal lacks maturity and is dominated by inertia. There is inertia towards budget restrictions and in the regulation of foreign trade. This opportunity could have been used to establish a clear and transparent system of foreign trade regulation. For these reasons, I feel that the Fraga Estévez report is much more useful and my group therefore totally supports not only its efforts but, despite the reticence indicated in my speech, the compromise as a whole.</p>

Being the representative of the largest island in the Mediterranean – Sicily – and head of the province of Catania, where large numbers of people work in the fishing industry, I would have been in a good position to talk about day-to-day experiences. </p>
<p class="contents">Today though, I would like to make some constructive criticisms, which I hope can contribute to improving the proposal for a regulation in question. As far as consumer information is concerned, I fully agree with the Commission when it proposes compulsory labelling indicating the designation of the species, the production method as well as the catch area. Nevertheless, with the aim of making consumers more responsible and making the market more transparent, other details should be included, for example, the minimum legal size, which would allow fishery resources to be respected. As far as producers’ organisations are concerned, it is true that we need to make them more responsible, as regards both the organisation of the market and the efficient management of resources; however, it would be appropriate – and in this respect I stress the relevance of Amendment No 67, tabled by my political group – for the Member States to be able to grant additional aid to producers’ organisations that develop measures which valorise the species caught and measures to adapt supply to demand through structural actions of the FIFG. In view of the fact that – and it has been reaffirmed here this morning – according to data provided by the Commission, 60% of fishery products consumed in the European Union are imported, we should support aquaculture, which constitutes a major economic opportunity for maritime communities, in a substantial and comprehensive manner. Often, people do not enter this sector due to a lack of knowledge. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to conclude by thanking Mrs Fraga Estévez for upholding the amendments tabled by the UEN Group in the Committee on Fisheries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Gallagher report concerns a technical amendment to the ever sensitive protection of juveniles which we always support in our committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I must highlight the consideration and receptiveness of our rapporteur with regard to the request to the Commission for further information. The delay in this vote on his report was caused by the Commission not having dealt with his request for the most recent scientific reports to assess the coverage of the geographical area delimited in the Douglas Bank Box and the redefinition of the conditions and their scope. As Mrs Fraga Estévez had also asked for this information, I hope that this has allowed us to completely fulfil the role, reserved specifically for our Committee on Fisheries, of minutely scrutinising the activity of the European Commission and the application of the corresponding scientific reports by the Community institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Fraga Estévez report, this concerns a fundamental issue and a pillar of the common fisheries policy, namely the common organisation of the markets. As this clearly covers all fishing activity, this is why this magnificent report has taken some time in its progress through this House and its final adoption in our committee on the twenty-second of last month.</p>
<p class="contents">The final result is an excellent report. Many of its important sections were the subject of a consensus due to compromise amendments made by the rapporteur which substantially alter key aspects of the Commission’s proposal. The removal of Article 5, which was the Commission’s attempt to create new tariff suspensions on products as sensitive as tuna fillets, the request to create reference laboratories, the inclusion of aquaculture, the improvement of the regulation of consumer information on the labels of fishery products, the percentages of the compensatory allowances for tuna and the increased flexibility of withdrawals are, to mention just a few examples, very important improvements introduced in this report. I must therefore congratulate the rapporteur once again. We must also congratulate ourselves on the development and achievement of this report which lends prestige to the role of the Committee on Fisheries as well as this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This proposal on the common organisation of the markets in fisheries and aquaculture products is of central importance for the common fisheries policy in the European Union. If we take a look at the general aims in the explanatory statement of the proposal, then we will see that we can give these our full and unequivocal support. Responsible stock management, improving the competitiveness of the sector, liberalisation of the market etc. I am completely in favour of all these statements. What does give cause for concern though is the question as to which methods the Commission, and in particular the rapporteur, intend to employ in their efforts to maintain these principles. I would like to comment just on three points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I consider that, in future, one issue to be addressed will be that of establishing extensive, direct grants for the fisheries sector, as previous regulations failed to do. Now, of course, no one has anything against grants. But still the question must be asked as to whether this approach will, in the long term, achieve the goal of boosting the competitiveness of the sector. Even when a deadline is proposed, this always has certain consequences and so we should not rule out maintaining this state of affairs indefinitely. In my view, we could look to the structural funds policy for a more suitable option.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I wholeheartedly endorse the efforts being made to adapt the regime governing trade with third countries. The only question in this respect is whether they actually go far enough. After all, the fact of the matter is that we in the EU are highly dependent on imports. To a certain extent, the fish processing industry is dependent on tariff reduction and suspension arrangements for its survival.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I am unable to support the rapporteur in her desire to include aquaculture products in the intervention regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Notwithstanding all the efforts made on the part of the rapporteur, who has, as always, produced a thorough piece of work in order to improve the Commission’s proposal – and I have a great deal of respect for that – I am only able to lend my support to some of her conclusions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As there is a shortfall in our internal supply, we import 60% of the products we consume. </p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the regulation of the supply and demand for fishery products must respond to a dual consideration: it must meet consumers’ needs and safeguard the development of the fisheries sector itself. As we all know, the fisheries sector, which is concentrated in certain countries such as mine, is one of the major contributors to economic activity. </p>
<p class="contents">The report by Mrs Fraga Estévez responds adequately to this dual consideration and deserves the support of this House. In any event, it will certainly have ours. The regulation would doubtless improve if her thoughts and criticisms concerning the limited budget allocated to the regulation and the exclusion from the common organisation of the markets of almost all of our aquaculture, amongst other things, were taken into account. It will also improve if her partial criticism of the standards relating to consumer information and to its defence of tariff suspensions when there is Community production, is heeded. </p>

Nor does it take account of the potential that still exists, which is all the more incomprehensible, as the Commission itself admits that the European Union imports 60% of its consumption of fishery products. </p>
<p class="contents">There is, of course, an obvious lack of ambition which is quite visible in the proposed budgetary reduction that has been proposed: with less than EUR 20 million per year, we cannot expect the fisheries sector in the European Union to be able to develop. Furthermore, this COM does not guarantee fishermen’s incomes, nor does it take into account the fact that in some countries such as Portugal, where small-scale coastal fishing, which supplies consumers with fresh fish caught in their own waters, predominates, producers’ organisations are very weak, which means that they cannot be given such heavy responsibilities without considering the necessary financial resources. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as the report by Mrs Fraga Estévez states, it is not acceptable to change the system that has been laid down for exchanges with third countries because of the implications that this may have for European production. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will therefore speak here about the Fraga Estévez report. The Commission proposal on the reform of the fisheries COM was unacceptable as it stood and bordered on the schizophrenic.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, if we are only able to subscribe to the objectives defined by the Commission in its explanatory statement, we must, unfortunately, observe that the mechanism proposed does not provide for the means necessary to achieve them. On the contrary, the principles of Community preference and the regulation of the markets, as they have existed up to now, are called into question by the Commission’s proposal for reform. Furthermore, the imbalance is also evident between the unjustified tariff suspensions in favour of third countries and completely inadequate measures to assist Community fishermen in increasing their competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Our rapporteur, Mrs Fraga Estévez, in her draft report, incorporated a series of amendments that clearly improved the text, but we nevertheless felt that it was essential, together with Mr Gallagher, to table 31 additional amendments. I should like to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Fisheries, as 22 of these amendments have been adopted, thus making it possible to re-establish the founding principles of the CFP and the COM and to give the producers’ organisations the role and the resources necessary to allow them to regulate and obtain the best return for the fishery and aquaculture products. </p>
<p class="contents">I retabled eight amendments in plenary on behalf of my group. Among them, Mrs Fraga Estévez, I should like to stress the importance of Amendment No 67, which is an addition to Article 11, paragraph 1, of the proposal for a regulation. This amendment aims to allow the Member States to grant additional aid to producers’ organisations that, in the context of operational programmes under Article 9 of the regulation, introduce measures to obtain the best return for the species of fish caught and to equate supply with demand. This aid should be able to be financed in the context of the FIFG.</p>
<p class="contents">I know, Mrs Fraga Estévez, that you approve and will support this amendment. I therefore hope that it will be adopted by the majority of this House as it can contribute to consolidating and developing producers’ organisations which, when they work efficiently, make it possible to avoid short-term over-fishing and, thanks to their efforts to obtain the best return for their fish, to safeguard jobs in fishing-dependent areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, the European Parliament has played a decisive role in maintaining the financial instrument of the FIFG and in defining correctly the areas dependent upon fishing within the context of the new objective 2. If, in this way, we have been able to contribute, together with the Member States, to safeguarding a legal and financial framework specific to the CFP, it should now be used to the full to serve in the best way possible the needs of the coastal and maritime areas that depend on fishing. That is what we propose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should remember that we have evidence to suggest that if conservation measures are properly carried out and control is exercised we can increase the take for European fishermen by something like EUR 5,000 million worth of product a year. At least that would go some distance to compensate fishermen for the loss and fishing areas for the loss of jobs they have experienced.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank Carmen Fraga for her report: a very comprehensive statement and advice to the Commission and Council on the whole business of marketing. One of the extraordinary things about fish is that while fisherman have been finding it difficult and jobs have been reduced, the price of fish, almost alone as a food product, has been increasing continually over the years to the consumer in Europe. At the same time, margins have been squeezed for fishermen. So, we have to recognise that in the whole area of marketing and processing, there is an important job to be done. I do not think that the annual allocation is sufficient to undertake that task.</p>
<p class="contents">Fishing is very different from other occupations. Nobody produces fish. The fish are there. They are a public resource. Why should we over-fish and at the same time contribute to withdrawals from the market? Why should we over-fish and, at the same time, import a product which creates a price that is unacceptable? The herring sector referred to by Mr Gallagher is worthy of special consideration at the moment. Herring is being sold at 20% lower prices than last year. It is about or less than 20% of the price that we consider the minimum price for beef in the European Union; a high-value product, immensely valuable for health and normal maintenance of human life. Why should such a product be taken out of the seas and then given away? It is a mistake for the Commission to propose that they should readjust the regulation to further exacerbate that particular problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a sensitive subject, but this report was especially necessary. The text on which we voted is a good text and we arrived at a good compromise. I believe that it is a compromise of the kind that the European Union is capable of achieving when it is able to both transcend national interests and defend the common interests.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the fisheries policy is one of the great European policies, even if it concerns very few Europeans, at least as producers, though many more obviously as consumers. Since it was established in 1970, the Community fisheries market has changed a great deal. Its regulation has adapted to this and this report must be defined as an additional stage in building a balanced organisation between the protection and the management of fishing resources. Today, the report submitted to us strengthens the place of the consumer and the producers’ organisations in the organisation of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget, however, that this reform will have consequences for the fisheries sector. I shall refer to two of them briefly. Where will our auctions fit into all this, in view of the pre-sale contracts included under Article 12? This development should not involve a kind of ‘shift’ of our territories. Secondly, what will happen in the event of an economic crisis in the fisheries sector, if no provisions for exceptional circumstances are adopted? It would be better to make provision for all possible scenarios.</p>
<p class="contents">This report does not deal with the questions of the future, or at least with some of them, but I believe that our committee has done a good job and your report, Mrs Fraga Estévez, deserves considerable support.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In general terms, I welcome the thrust of Mrs Fraga's paper which should help to encourage market stability.</p>
<p class="contents">This use of forward-looking methods of adaptation of supply and demand by producer organisations should be of great assistance to the overall competitiveness and efficiency of the fishery sector as a whole. The recognition of the importance of the processing sector is also welcome. This is a sector which generates very significant employment and income, very often within otherwise fragile communities.</p>
<p class="contents">Stressing the importance of basing decisions on scientific and technical data and studies is fundamental, not just concerning the COM in fisheries, but also in general fisheries management. Moreover, the fact that the proposal will bring improved transparency and knowledge of the market and products, especially for the consumer, is a positive move.</p>
<p class="contents">I also support the committee's amendments which seek to include aquaculture within the support mechanism. The recent and on-going crises in the Scottish salmon industry as a result of the infectious salmon anaemia virus demonstrates more than amply that the aquaculture sector can also be volatile and unpredictable. Therefore, careful planning and support is vital. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Both reports are generally worthy of support, and with Mr Gallagher’s report I have no fundamental problems.</p>
<p class="contents">On Mrs Fraga’s report, although I welcome the general thrust of the report, there are a couple of problems. We welcome the common organisation of the markets and strengthening of the producer organisations, but I have problems firstly where there is a danger that costs are being pushed up unnecessarily and while we recognise that the level of intervention age needs increasing, maybe not in the way it is actually put here.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to tariff suspensions, we believe the criteria are rather over-strict, and we would like a more liberal system. We want to ensure that we can benefit the processing industry without affecting producers. With respect to herring, we agree that the tariff suspension should be turned into an annual quota, and we accept the recommendations for cod, Alaska pollack and shrimp.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the amendments, we will certainly be opposing Amendment No 47 and I have to express some reservations on Amendments Nos 35 and 41, which we may be unable to support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you know, my colleague, Mr Fischler, is at the moment in Seattle and he has asked me to take his place.</p>
<p class="contents">We are dealing first of all with the reform of the common organisation of the market in the fisheries and aquaculture products sector. The Commission is very pleased with the report by the European Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries and particularly with the detailed study undertaken by the rapporteur, Mrs Fraga Estévez, who has made a valuable contribution to the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The work of this Committee, that met for the last time on this subject on the same day as the Fisheries Council on 22 November, directly contributed to the discussions of the Council in this field. As you already know, the Council reached a broad consensus. Mr Fischler has only accepted this consensus provisionally. He told the ministers that he could only give his agreement to a final decision after having considered the opinion of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I have listened with interest to the speakers today and I believe that they clearly illustrate the diversity of the fisheries market throughout the Union and therefore emphasise the need for us to take account of these factors. We now need to examine the proposal and the opinion by Parliament from the point of view of their effect on all interested parties and not only on producers. I should like to stress that it is important for this reform to apply to the whole fisheries chain and, consequently, for it to encourage integration in the market. The main development of the Commission proposal is the fact that the common organisation of the market will henceforth cover consumers and the whole of the fisheries industry. This Commission proposal is good for consumers, good for producers and good for the processing industry and I shall tell you why.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as consumers are concerned, the Commission proposal stipulates that essential information must be provided on the product. The consumer will know what type of fish he is buying, how it has been produced and where it comes from. In view of the importance of traceability, in all its aspects, in the food sector, and particularly from the point of view of food safety, these provisions will reassure consumers and allow them to be better informed when making purchasing decisions. I am very pleased to note, Madam President, that the European Parliament is in agreement on this point. However, the origin of the fishing boat does not concern the consumers directly and the fact that it is mentioned could be perceived as distorting trade with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as producers are concerned, the Commission proposal aims to redirect the incentives of the common organisation of the market in order to encourage improved supply planning. The Commission has strengthened the role of the producers’ organisations by proposing a new mechanism that encourages the producers to plan their activities in order to improve the balance between supply and demand. Improved planning should lead to a reduction in withdrawals and thus make it possible to avoid waste.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept the general impetus of Parliament’s amendment in this field concerning the incorporation of the producer organisations of certain aquaculture species in the scope of the operational programmes. We also acknowledge that some of the advantages of improved planning can also apply to the aquaculture sector. If we subscribe to the idea of financial support in favour of these programmes, we feel that this support should be granted on a temporary basis and should not be linked to the value of the production owing to difficulties that may arise under the rules of international trade.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect of the amendments that will affect producers concerns the level of Community support in the form of interventions. The Commission considers that a high level of withdrawals is not justified in view of the rarity of the fishery resources, both inside and outside Community waters. If we are endeavouring to arrive at sustainability in the fisheries sector, we should not be encouraging the destruction of our resources. Intervention should become a safety net for fishermen, that would only be used on rare occasions. The Commission is of the opinion that we should reduce as far as possible the permanent withdrawals and move to support which is in favour of more active fishermen’s organisations that are better suited to the needs of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments by the European Parliament in this sphere argue in favour of a less radical reduction of the quantities eligible for support and of the financial aid for withdrawal, which is along the same lines as the consensus emerging between the Member States within the Council. The Commission will therefore not stand in the way of an agreement but would be reluctant to accept all the proposed increases relating to intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the processing industry is concerned, the situation regarding trade with third countries is of prime importance. Our processing industry should be able to supply itself with raw materials at world market prices in order to be competitive. Failing this, we risk exporting jobs outside the Community to countries that can easily obtain staple commodities at competitive prices. There are greatly differing views on the form of tariff duties to be applied to the majority of the vulnerable species: cuts of tuna, herring and cod.</p>
<p class="contents">I accept that there is no easy answer. However, the recommendation by Parliament on laying down criteria applicable to future suspensions, instead of a decision on tariff suspensions in the context of the common organisation of the market, does not resolve the problem. We should henceforth create a more stable situation for the processing industry. In its approach, the Commission mainly applies the criterion according to which imported products should be raw materials intended for the processing industry for which the volume of Community production is inadequate. It is clear that the prospects of the supply of white fish in the short and long term are worrying and the Community cannot allow itself to penalise its processing industry and leave third countries to create the added value provided by the industry.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude on this first proposal, Madam President, the studies by the European Parliament and the Commission agree on some key points of the reform, particularly on the need to strengthen the role of the producers’ organisations in the fisheries sector and in aquaculture and to improve the information provided to the consumer. As far as intervention is concerned, the Commission cannot go as far as the European Parliament would like in relaxing the new discipline in respect of withdrawals, as it considers that this position is essential in the context of our efforts to conserve resources.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as trade with third countries is concerned, where we have a different approach to that of the European Parliament, the Commission is of the opinion that there is a considerable structural problem within the European market that justifies immediate action to save jobs in the processing sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like, Madam President, to examine the second proposal by the Commission and, with this in mind, to thank the rapporteur, Mr Gallagher.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal amends Regulation EC/850/98 of 30 March 1998 for the third time and this amendment aims to improve the conservation of fishing resources through technical measures for the improved protection of juveniles of marine organisms. The mechanism proposed is based on a number of new elements that the Commission was only able to set down after the adoption of this Regulation. This mechanism will strengthen the protection of adult and juvenile herring, while improving the protection of marine mammals. The Commission proposal is supported by the competent scientific organisations like the International Commission for Marine Exploration and the Fisheries Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee. The Commission is very pleased that the Committee on Fisheries has adopted the report by Mr Gallagher which approves the Commission’s proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
