<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rübig (PPE-DE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 11 September is still on everyone's lips, and we know that nuclear material has to be handled with very great care. That is why we have a Euratom Safeguards Office (ESO) to work very intensively on ensuring that the quantity of such material available is properly checked and monitored, and to work to ensure that such materials are used only for peaceful purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the agreements entered into by the European Union and its individual Member States must be adhered to, and we should take care that, in future, nuclear materials are subject to even more scrutiny than at present. We are all aware of the bomb threats in America, where terrorist groups have, threatened, among other things, to detonate such material in exposed places. With this in mind, it is now of all times that we should be making it our concern that these materials are secured in future. Our basic assumption is that our primary interest is in protecting the public. Indeed the Euratom treaty states that the health of the public and of the workforce is to be protected from the dangers of ionising radiation, and the Commission is entitled to implement appropriate measures for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that now is the time for common European safety standards for nuclear power stations and for the transport nuclear material to be established. I would like very warmly to thank Commissioner de Palacio for committing the Commission to becoming active in this area and to producing standards. I think Parliament has already called for that in the Schwaiger Report on the accession of new states, which called for a code of nuclear safety even before the new Member States join. This report has already been adopted by Parliament. I also assume that it will, tomorrow, adopt the call for the public to be protected.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Court of Auditors has, of course, already called for safety standards, and Parliament also has its right to propose legislation, and, according to the Euratom treaty, can submit appropriate proposals on matters with regard to which it believes that a Community act is necessary. Parliament's opinion is that a Community act is very definitely required on these issues. The EU possesses at present no uniform safety standards, and if we were to make it known today that this or that nuclear power station appeared to be dangerous, we actually have no legal status on the basis of which such assertions could be confirmed or refuted. That is why, even before these countries join us, safeguards are of such particular importance to us.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not believe that finance should prove an insuperable obstacle. It is safeguards that are of particular importance for us. In this area as in others, we will have high expectations of the new ten countries that want to join the EU, and we ought also to consider role the ESO might play in future. We are therefore of the opinion that we should have two directives; one on the transport of nuclear materials and a second on the auditing, certification and supervision of nuclear safety. It might also be possible to develop the ESO into an independent authority with the capacity to actually supervise and co-ordinate these activities itself. That would be a splendid opportunity for the European Union to lay down definite Europe-wide conditions for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that Parliament takes the view that this issue should also be discussed in the Convention, which should, on these matters, contribute new plans and ideas for the future and initiate reflection on how we may, in future, take effective action in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There <span class="italic">must</span> be no room for human error. Nor must there be the possibility of sabotage or of plant or nuclear material being exposed to acts of terrorism. It is therefore gratifying that the Euratom report indicates increased safety and greater awareness of the risks. The committee has been very united in placing more focus upon safety and upon measures to bring home the importance of safety issues to all those engaged in work involving nuclear materials. I would particularly draw attention to staff training issues, increased safety in the area of transport and the increased risk of acts of terrorism with which we have all been living since 11 September 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">Nuclear power is a much debated and very controversial form of energy. We have experienced a number of serious accidents and quite a lot of incidents that could have ended very badly if staff and safety systems had not been up to the mark. Safety issues are therefore absolutely crucial in any handling of nuclear material and must never be neglected. Public anxiety about nuclear power, nuclear material and matters associated with these must always be taken with the greatest seriousness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are not even any visitors to welcome here today. There was similar silence yesterday in Yokohama, from where I have just returned. What we are doing here today does not require 70 000 spectators. But zero remains zero and gives clear expression to the fact that we have failed to give Parliament even the minimum of information. That there are only three Members in their seats to hear this debate shows how Parliament itself values this report. If the Rules of Procedure were reformed and people knew what we are doing here – and above all what we are failing to do here – then this place would be full to overflowing. The question is for how long we will be reforming ourselves and how quickly we are going about it, and is that the topic for debate? It is indeed the topic for debate, Mr President, for Euratom is doing the very same that we are doing here in this Parliament in which we hide ourselves away, where we do so much to ensure that nobody hears us doing it. It is subject to no proper democratic control, and, whilst the context of course makes fundamental criticism difficult, some aspects of Mr Rübig's report are definitely praiseworthy.</p>
<p class="contents">By that I mean item 16, item 17 and most of all item 13, because there at least the attempt is made, albeit in typical fashion, to put a finger on the spots that have just been described. Item 13 makes it very clear that Euratom functions undemocratically, without either transparency or accountability. Unless one knows Parliamentary practices and perhaps also certain usages in debate behind closed doors, it is very difficult to track the thinking behind items 1, 2 and 3. If we have so much material unaccounted for, how can we, on that basis, say that the job is done well, very well, because none of it has come to light?</p>
<p class="contents">If we carry on in this fashion, then not only will our work continue to be undermined, but so will what perhaps makes sense of the use of nuclear energy, and that brings me to my <span class="italic">ceterum censeo.</span> Mr President, there is no democracy without transparency! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Especially because – in my opinion – we are working on and talking about an issue of great importance to the citizens, which should in principle be of interest to them and which I believe does interest them.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to thank the Members who have spoken and, especially, Mr Rübig for his initiative of preparing this report.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly grateful because we are talking about the first report on Euratom’s safeguards operation to be presented by the Commission in the last eight years. This was the reaction that had been hoped for in response to the will to provide information and transparency expressed by the Commission in the exercise of the responsibilities conferred on us by the Euratom Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of requests and suggestions expressed in the motion for a resolution submitted to the vote in this Parliament coincide 100% with the desires and concerns that I myself have expressed to you on various occasions. Last week, the Commission approved my initiative to regroup under a sole management the responsibilities of the Commission in the field of nuclear safety in the broadest sense of the word. This is my response to one of the fundamental concerns of this Parliament: coherence in these key areas of the nuclear sector must be increased.</p>
<p class="contents">Without going into the details of the motion for a resolution tabled by Mr Rübig, I wish to refer to two very specific issues:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I should like to tell you that a new report on the operation of the Euratom Safeguards Office will be made available to you in the next few weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to competences in the field of nuclear safety in the broadest sense, I believe it is crucial that the exercise of Community competence can rely on the technical expertise of the national authorities and can be undertaken in a coordinated and harmonious way and in conjunction with them. This observation, which is true today, will be even more so when enlargement takes place.</p>
<p class="contents">I should, therefore, like to say to Mr Rübig and to the other speakers that I hope to be able, in the coming months, to present to Council and to this Parliament a package of initiatives specifically on nuclear safety, which will respond to the concern that you have expressed, i.e. the need for there to be common safety standards in installations in the European Union, standards which constitute a Community <span class="italic">acquis</span>, with mandatory compliance on the part not only of the fifteen current members of the Union, but also of the candidate countries, which will in time themselves be member States of the Union. These standards must also, consequently, provide guarantees to all citizens that things are done in the right way and with the highest levels of safety, which is what the European Union requires.</p>
<p class="contents">You are all aware of my position on nuclear energy. This is a controversial issue but, clearly, taking account of the new problems relating to climate change and other issues, in my opinion – I have said so repeatedly – it is an absolutely crucial one. This is something that is absolutely necessary and the nuclear option must be kept open in the European Union. This can also be deduced from the conclusions of the Green Paper recently approved by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The corollary of this<span class="italic"> </span>observation on the new circumstances, however, is the need to guarantee the utmost transparency and efficacy of the appropriate safety standards in all installations in the European Union. This is what we will be working on, and we will continue doing so in the international sphere, in the Vienna Agency, to improve even further the required standards throughout the world in this type of installation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having left my house at 7 a.m. this morning I expected to be in Strasbourg at 4 p.m. However, we were subject to a 4-hour flight delay and were taken to Düsseldorf on route. I will not bore you with the details, but we finally arrived here.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been very interesting listening to the Commissioner. Safeguards of nuclear materials are extremely important within and outside the European Union. Security of nuclear materials in the EU has been an increasingly important issue since 11 September. Unlike the Commissioner, I believe that the best way to safeguard nuclear materials is to stop production of them and a particular issue is the reprocessing of nuclear materials. We know that there are ground-to-air missiles at Cap de la Hague, and the defences of Sellafield remain a secret. It cannot be right, after 11 September, to continue to stockpile and increase the stockpile of hundreds of tonnes of plutonium. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately it is another incident in the ongoing saga of accessing Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that a clear distinction has now been made between nuclear safeguards and nuclear safety and security. I would like to see the Safeguards Office getting all the resources it needs to continue to do its job to the fullest extent possible, particularly with accession countries coming in.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome very much Commissioner Palacio's indication on 23 April, and again here today, of her intent to submit a nuclear package, which I hope we can see this autumn. This will deal with the whole area of nuclear safety and security. Could I also ask her as a matter of form to include in that package the need for proper consultation and communication between neighbouring States within the European Union, including the accession States, so that concerns can be discussed in a proper way, in a proper consultative forum.</p>
<p class="contents">Lord Inglewood of BNFL recently indicated that he would certainly take on board the concerns I expressed to him on this subject, in the same way that the concerns of the Austrians in relation to Temelin have been structured by the Commission. I would like that template to be used throughout the EU as part of the package of nuclear safety and security measures, so that there is a proper procedure and a proper forum to discuss real and perceived fears. I accept that maybe not all the fears are real, but even the perceived fears need to be dealt with before they get out of hand and become too politicised.</p>
<p class="contents">If we have such a forum as of right, with the proper expertise there to listen to both sides, it will go a long way towards helping everyone to live in peace on this very vexed issue. I come from a State that is non-nuclear and against electricity being generated from nuclear power. I respect the rights of other Member States, but they must respect our right and listen to our concerns and act on them. We look to you, Commissioner, to put such a structure in place, so that a forum of this kind could perhaps be included in the promised nuclear package, which I welcome very much. I thank my colleague, Mr Rübig, for an excellent report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
