<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Seixas da Costa,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, just a few months ago we marked the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions on the protection of victims of armed conflicts. Fifty years ago, 63 countries signed the four conventions and two protocols which still provide a basis for international humanitarian rights today. It is worth remembering that these international legal instruments were established during the period immediately after the Second World War and at that time reflected the major concerns felt at international level following the devastating effects of that conflict. Events since that time have demonstrated that those who considered it essential to strengthen the rights of individuals in war zones, including civilians and military personnel not directly involved in the conflict, were totally justified.</p>
<p class="contents">A new code of ethics has accordingly come to be applied to the actions of parties to conflicts, in terms of strengthening the dignity of human life, which has increasingly become enshrined in international law in various other areas. </p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, in reality, it has become evident that the binding nature of the conventions and the way in which they are enforced by no means meet the requirements of the situations in which they are intended to provide protection. We are still continuing to witness acts of war marked by barbarism and a total denial of the rights of civilians and of military personnel outside combat zones. The behaviour of many states and many parties to armed conflicts fails to reflect any principles whatsoever and is characterised by an “end justifies the means” approach. And it is not unusual for civilians to be the particular target of military action, either in the form of terrorism or as an instrument of political pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the unusual nature of certain conflicts, in particular those fought on a civil war footing, is increasingly being taken as an excuse for more serious crimes which are often carried out under cover of a shortage of information to the outside world and a kind of scorched earth policy intended to secure victory at all costs, and even at the cost of genocide. In cases of this kind, acts affecting more vulnerable social groups take on a particular importance and are even more shocking. Such indefensible acts ultimately expose children and the elderly to all kinds of inhumane actions, so that they are today the main victims of certain types of conflict, and sometimes even seem to be singled out to set an example.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of humanitarian organisations comes in here too, as their scope for action is frequently affected by the intolerable behaviour of certain parties to conflicts who are cynically trying to win time to seal their victories or to take retaliatory action affecting populations at risk. It is important to carry on strengthening these organisations’ freedom of action and the protection of humanitarian workers. In this context, I would particularly like to draw attention to the International Committee of the Red Cross, whose reports demonstrate that specific action is needed to improve the way in which the Geneva Conventions are applied. And if it were not for the media and the new role they now play in spreading awareness of conflicts – not to mention these conflicts power to shock and mobilise the international community – the situation that we are witnessing today in certain war zones would be even worse and the level of impunity would be even greater.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the European Union, which advocates and practises a set of values which we are proud to say is at the forefront of the international community, has been emphasising the vital importance of observing the Geneva Conventions. In the context of its external relations, the Union promotes these values and seeks to implement them at all times through its political actions. We are therefore alert to any risk of weakening the principles that unite us in this area, and we have always denounced any violations through our common foreign and security policy. In such cases we seek to use the instruments available to us to exert pressure in a timely and effective way. We are aware that in many cases we have not achieved everything we might wish, but we firmly intend to continue in future with the same determination.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, despite the gravity and the frequency of human rights violations that the Geneva Conventions and their protocols attempt to prevent, I do believe that the new millennium gives us some cause for hope. This hope is primarily founded on gradually establishing an international set of values which means that it is already becoming difficult to take refuge behind spurious criteria such as cultural differences and national traits. Although it is a slow process, there can be no doubt that we are already on the way to establishing this new international set of values and that the process of information globalisation is assisting in this and helping it to take root in our societies’ collective consciousness. Our citizens need to take this process on board in order to establish a mechanism for reacting to actions which show a lack of respect for the fundamental principles which should nowadays be regarded as our common heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">In creating international tribunals like those now dealing with the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, we have taken a step forward in making life more difficult for people who encourage acts which infringe the values of the Geneva Conventions. These people must start to realise that the world is no longer a place where impunity is the rule. If we can get this message across, we will certainly be helping to strengthen human rights and to give the principles which the Geneva Conventions and their protocols aim to protect the credibility and effectiveness that they need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would now like to speak, on behalf of the Socialist Group, in this debate which follows what we consider to be a satisfactory statement from the Council on the Geneva Convention. I will begin with an initial comment explaining the reasons why my Group tabled a resolution on this same subject during the last session of Parliament in 1999. This resolution was never debated for reasons which we will not go into here.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to us highly appropriate to speak in the European Parliament of regulations which have enriched humanity’s legal heritage and we should take every opportunity to recall and strengthen the validity of those instruments given the protection they offer and the rights they safeguard.</p>
<p class="contents">Another reason for adopting a resolution such as the one we are tabling is the fact that much of the work of the European institutions is aimed at finding balance and equality, and these are concepts which are almost completely incompatible with armed conflict. The main victims of conflicts – children, women and the population in general – are the first to be threatened and to suffer and we must make their protection one of the priority objectives of our action.</p>
<p class="contents">The more we do to prevent violations of international humanitarian law, the more we remind other states – by means of all the opportunities which our foreign relations offer us – of the need to ratify and respect the Geneva Convention and the more we will be doing to protect these weakest groups. The more suffering we prevent, the less action we will then have to take to repair the great damage caused by war.</p>
<p class="contents">What more can be done therefore to increase compliance with international humanitarian law and thus limit the suffering of the victims? For example, we can spread the knowledge of this law, particularly throughout society itself, amongst young people, within mass organisations and also in the armed forces and security services. Above all, we must, through education, instil a passion for peace amongst our citizens. In this respect, the European Union must be a prime agent for peace, but it must also provide strong support for the efforts of those organisations which the international community has entrusted with the responsibility of protecting the victims of conflicts and defending their rights. Amongst these organisations, we should highlight the International Committee of the Red Cross. All the institutions of the European Union must decisively support the work of the ICRC, because their role is quite simply indispensable.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I do not consider it acceptable to say, as the Commission did in its response to my question a couple of months ago, that it does not have the competences nor the resources for actions aimed at promoting international humanitarian law, thereby demonstrating that its approach is basically bureaucratic and that its sensitivities are very different from those expressed by the Council in reply to another question in which I expressed a concern of this type. It is also different from the sensitivity demonstrated today by the Council in its intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">In this area, the institutions of the European Union – including the Commission of course – have a generic responsibility, because this is a question of spreading and promoting essential values which, furthermore, are the same as those which underpin our European project.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, Mr President, I ask you to support the resolution tabled, which contains all the main elements of the proposal presented by the Socialist Group at the end of last year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It signified a great step forward for mankind – and yet in the fifty years since, although our own half-continent has lived in peace, more people have died in armed conflict than died in the whole of World War II.</p>
<p class="contents">We have failed to spread the lessons and values learned from that conflict. Too often our own Member States have been parties to conflict, either through the production and sales of weapons, through the production and distribution of landmines or through the temptation – in the words of a great Victorian statesman in my country – to prefer their wars to be fought at a distance and wherever possible in the name of God. We have failed to educate against the glorification of combat in our own communities. We have failed to educate against the problems and the scourge of racism and xenophobia.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, thanks to global communications, we have a constant reminder now on our television screens of the terrible effects of man's inhumanity to man, and of course to woman and child. We have seen recently in the former Yugoslavia, and now in Chechnya, the terrible effects of armed conflict and we see, furthermore, the effect of governments' efforts to suppress independent media comment on such conflicts, and the development towards totalitarian government.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union is to become a community of values – if we are to play a true role in the new global governance, then we need to be promoting the values of the Geneva Conventions not only to our own soldiers and security forces, but also to people in our civilian societies. We need to be pushing for the creation of a permanent international criminal court and urging our own Member States to sign and ratify the Convention. We need to be working hard to combat racism and xenophobia.</p>
<p class="contents">Liberal Democrats in this House are proud that three of the authors of today's reports, Mrs Malmström, Mrs Haarder and Baroness Ludford have grappled with these issues and given the House these reports today. We live in hope that the twentieth century, which Europe has soaked in blood, can give way to a twenty-first century in which the power, the genius and the enthusiasm of humankind can be applied to the construction of a more just, peaceful and sustainable world.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yesterday, we were talking about a Charter of Fundamental Rights; today we are speaking of human rights. Yesterday, in one excellent speech, someone said that we have a moral obligation to defend and develop democracy and human rights. What this moral obligation actually entails and the extent of our efforts and commitment will, however, come to light in the context of that wretched reality represented by wars and armed conflicts. Over the last century, these have totally changed in nature. Humanitarian law is that yardstick by which we can show whether that moral obligation is just some kind of rhetorical stimulus for us or something that leads to deeds and action. Today we are hearing the case of Albin Kurti, of Kosovo. The Geneva Conventions are a vital part of this minimum level of action. We also have to ensure that both the Ottawa Convention against Land Mines and the Charter for an International Criminal Court are ratified.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Personally, I cannot see any reason why the European Parliament should be thanking Russia. On the contrary, I feel that it is necessary for Parliament to condemn Russia more emphatically and clearly than before, and that not only the Community institutions, but also the national governments should join us in doing so. It was with sadness and regret that I learned of the feeble, unconvincing protest at Russia’s treatment of Chechnya and subsequent embrace and encouragement given to Mr Putin by Tony Blair, a man held in high esteem throughout the world, during his official visit to Moscow a few days ago. At a time when we are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of a great landmark in humanitarian international law, the Geneva Convention, we cannot ignore that fact that all the points of the Geneva Convention are being violated on our doorstep, even though the Russians may say that this is not a state of war but a state of emergency.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, a European delegation returning from Chechnya a few days ago reported terrible sights. If we genuinely want our action to have any effect, we must send a delegation from the European Parliament to Chechnya and the governments must undertake to abide by paragraph 6 of the Resolution, which we may shortly be voting on, in which Parliament calls upon the Council to ensure that cooperation with third countries is dependent upon reports on their application of human rights. We must ask for some consistency between the countries of Europe if we want to make a genuine stand for human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to thank you for the declaration by the Portuguese presidency and also for the Commission’s declaration. I would also like to congratulate the Portuguese presidency because once again, it appears that it attended virtually all important debates this week. Not all presidencies do this but the Portuguese do, and I think, therefore, that they deserve a compliment for this. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the Geneva Convention is more topical than ever, especially in light of the events of the past couple of years. In Kosovo, hundreds of thousands of people have been forced out of their homes because they belonged to the wrong ethnic group. The same has happened in the rest of former Yugoslavia since the early nineties. Serbs have been driven out of Croatia, Croats out of Serbia, Serbs and Croats out of parts of Bosnia and in Bosnia, the Muslim population was forced to flee, all of this with the help of military units of the respective Member States. This image has been etched in the minds of each one of us because this took place in Europe, and not least because it reminds us of the abject conditions of the 30s and the dreadful war which followed. Never again. This is what politicians decided in post-war Europe. And this is how European cooperation and the Geneva Convention came about. For a long time, we thought that Europe would remain spared of this kind of adversity and that we had sufficient instruments in place to prevent this kind of brutal disaster. This appeared not to be the case. Yugoslavia proved that Europe will remain vulnerable as long as the Union limits itself in scope to Western Europe. The task of the European Union is therefore to extend the system we have created to the whole of Europe, above all with a view to keeping the peace. </p>
<p class="contents">It is just as important to look at the world around us. Take Chechnya, where the population is the victim of a battle between the Russian army and terrorists. Or Asia, Burma, in particular, where entire groups of the population are being driven out of their traditional areas with military force. Indonesia, Timor, but also the Moluccas, where hundreds of thousands of people are forced out of their homes with the active backing of the army – yet again. Sudan, where the southern population has been on the run from the northern rulers for years and where martial law is ignored. The Great Lake areas in Africa where the fight between the Hutus and the Tutsis, an ethnic battle if ever I saw one, has forced millions of people to flee. They are increasingly beleaguered rather than being protected by the national army units. Then there are the border areas in Ethiopia and Eritrea, a kind of forgotten war, where governments are fighting over a specific border and where, meanwhile, nearly one hundred thousand Ethiopians have been driven out of Eritrea and vice versa. Nobody seems to be taking any notice of this problem. </p>
<p class="contents">This is only an outline of the problems, both within Europe and elsewhere, which occasioned the drafting of the Geneva Convention. The fiftieth anniversary of the Geneva Convention has actually been written in blood if we consider these fateful events. At the same time, the Geneva Convention is also a beacon because we now have a tool by means of which we can expose inhumanities and because we can also report on positive developments. One of these positive developments is the European Union itself where – to quote President Mitterrand, who spoke here – after 400 years of war, we have enjoyed more than 40 years’ peace. Prominent politicians, some of whom, in fact most of whom, come from within our circles, have helped to bring this about. So there <span class="italic">is</span> a solution to all these humanitarian issues which are referred to the Geneva Convention, and this solution is co-determined by us on a daily basis within our European Parliament, where 15 nationalities cooperate in a peaceful manner. We should not turn a blind eye to the suffering around us but we should also be grateful for being able to live in peace and prosperity here in Western Europe, hoping that this peace and prosperity, as well as an end to all violence, will reach all corners of the globe: in Eastern Europe, South-Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa and anywhere else in desperate need of this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Everything which has taken place in the Balkans in recent years, to use the words of a leading Greek poet, ‘without caution, without shame’, has been in a bid to correct one wrong with myriad other wrongs and has simply turned this Convention into a well-turned piece of literature with no teeth.</p>
<p class="contents">We recently witnessed a huge humanitarian disaster brought about by a supposedly humanitarian intervention. We saw a huge wave of refugees and, at the same time, we watched hospitals and embassies being bombed and unarmed civilians becoming the war targets, while the Balkan peninsular will pay the price and suffer the painful consequences of the ecological disaster caused by the bombings for years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the second section of the Convention, and in particular Articles 13 and 14, which refer to protection from the effects of war for the wounded, the sick, the aged, children and expectant mothers, here it really is worth pausing to consider Kosovo and the findings of the relevant UN report. Nearly 50% of infants born prematurely die. The children being born are underdeveloped due to malnutrition. There has been a dramatic increase in the number of abortions. Women are dying due to a lack of rudimentary medical care in clinics which have no electricity, heating or water.</p>
<p class="contents">The best way, therefore, of celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Convention is to strengthen the democratic and political facets of the Union, so that it can play a more decisive role on the international stage and solve any differences using peaceful means which respect human rights and, more importantly, respect everything set out in this truly wonderful Geneva Convention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps I could be allowed a special reason for celebrating these conventions, as one of my family members founded the British Red Cross movement.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 1(b) of the relevant Convention forbids the taking of hostages. Article 23 of the Universal Islamic Declaration of Human Rights says that no one shall be forced to leave the country of his residence or be arbitrarily deported therefrom. Millions of people are suffering worldwide. Speakers today, from Graham Watson onwards, have made those points earlier. But let us think just of a few people in order to bring home the horror and suffering.</p>
<p class="contents">We recall that on 20 August 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait in a unilateral act of aggression that was universally condemned. Nine years later, more than 600 prisoners of war are unreleased and unaccounted for by Iraq. Iraq is a formidable enemy. UNSCOM has destroyed 38 000 chemical weapons munitions, 690 tonnes of chemical weapons agents, 3 000 tonnes of precursor chemicals, 48 Scud missiles and a biological weapons factory designed to produce up to 50 000 litres of anthrax, botulism toxin and other agents. Her strength and power for evil purposes is matched only by her determination not to find the missing prisoners. After nine years she has only provided information sufficient to close three files.</p>
<p class="contents">This afternoon, when we debate Iraq, do not forget the missing Kuwaiti prisoners of war. Do not lift economic sanctions while their fate remains uncertain.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I echo without hesitation the encouraging words which the President-in-Office has just spoken. However, I need to get something off my chest. Maybe the President-in-Office of the Council is not aware that this is not the first time we have debated humanitarian law in this Parliament. We actually hold a topical debate every Thursday afternoon, which, unfortunately, is poorly attended by the Council. This, I deeply regret. </p>
<p class="contents">However, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to use this opportunity to bring to your attention once more the fate of the Kosovar prisoners in Serbian prisons. Parliament has brought the fate of these prisoners to the public’s attention three times since our appointment in July and has also asked the Council to act in this matter. The situation in Kosovo has got considerably worse, not least because the Albanians are concerned about the fate of their fellow countrymen in Serbian prisons. The situation in Serbia is becoming more and more absurd. Last Monday, the Albanian student leader, Albin Kurti, was sentenced to fifteen years’ imprisonment, simply because he had organised first-aid courses after the bombardments. This was considered helping the UCK! Surely this is too absurd for words! </p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the population remains very concerned about the fate of those in prison. There are reports of torture. The Milosevic regime is also stepping up the repression of Serbia’s own opposition. Mr President-in-Office, could I ask you once more to act upon the resolutions which this Parliament has adopted three times and may I ask you what you intend to do? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They include the right to personal and political freedom and basic social and economic rights. The idea of human rights is one of the most exalted ideas which mankind has ever had and has its roots in the concentration camps and gulags of the last century. It appeals to everything which makes man a human being and which makes him aware of his dignity, uniqueness, freedom and equality with other men. The way in which human rights have spread illustrates the fact that this human image has huge powers to project and concern for human dignity is at the core of any human rights policy.</p>
<p class="contents">50 years after the general declaration of human rights, there is still a huge gap between what we claim and what is real. It is true that more people than ever live under a democratic system and that the awareness of human rights has grown, but on balance the degree to which human rights are implemented or respected is still quite inadequate throughout the world. Respect for human rights is extremely important on both moral and political grounds. Political prisoners, violation of basic women’s rights, child soldiers, too many poor people living below the poverty line, economic exploitation, the destruction of the environment which robs many people of their means of subsistence and massacres of civilians in armed conflicts are just some examples.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a vicious circle. Lasting economic success is impossible without respect for human rights and without the guarantees of the rule of law and the constitutional state. Failure to respect human rights brings the threat of both strife and economic and social decline. And if the development spiral turns downwards, then human rights are dragged down with it. Respect for human rights is fundamental if conflict is to be prevented and peace consolidated. Trampling over human rights today paves the way for conflict tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Governments held to democratic account generally take more trouble over the welfare of their people. Here the promotion of democracy is the first rule, combined with principles of tolerance and pluralism; not a pluralism which is free from values, but a pluralism geared precisely towards these human rights. It makes no difference if people are destroyed in the name of a race or a class. There is no political excuse for oppressing people, be it from an extreme right-wing or an extreme left-wing point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">In a globalised world, human rights are no longer an internal affair and the general acknowledgement of the globalisation of human rights therefore needs to be strengthened further. Human rights are indivisible. The universality of human rights shows that the degree to which they are applied has become a measure of progress, civilisation and culture in politics and society. As a global actor, the European Union must take greater account of human rights, both at home and abroad, in the form of a stronger human rights policy. It must prove itself to be a community of values. It must act preventatively within the scope of its foreign and security policy and its development policy and must react by applying sanctions, for example, by suspending assistance. In this respect, a global human rights policy is increasingly becoming a central aspect of foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">But more responsible human rights policies need to start at home. Democrats who gear their actions towards human rights, who want to include basic rights in their constitutions and apply them, must show that they are prepared to fight right-wing and left-wing extremism on the political battlefield so that there is no cause whatsoever for human rights to be infringed and I think that, here too, we must make it clear to all sides that, for us, human rights cannot be used to justify a specific political system to a greater or lesser degree, and that it is the individual rights of the people which are at stake here, that it is human dignity which is at stake here and that, for this reason, political motives are no excuse for infringing human rights in any manner or at any stage of development. This means that democrats must stand together in fundamental consensus against any form of extremism, not only against right-wing, but also against left-wing extremists.</p>

I agree with Mr Martínez when he stressed the importance of providing adequate protection and support for victims. However we must also take action to ensure that there are fewer victims in the future. The one sure way to achieve this is to send a clear message to those who are guilty of crimes against humanity that they will be brought to justice for their evil deeds.</p>
<p class="contents">The tribunals in which those guilty of atrocities in the Balkans are currently on trial send one clear message. Furthermore, although it ended in something of a fiasco, the Pinochet case in the UK had positive aspects to it. The groundbreaking ruling by the House of Lords illustrates one way in which concerned countries can demonstrate to those that commit crimes against humanity that there will be no hiding place for them.</p>
<p class="contents">However welcome some of these developments may be, more needs to be done. They must be built upon and the establishment of the International Criminal Court was a significant development in the field of human rights. However, it will symbolise little more than a statement of platitudes and empty rhetoric unless its Statute comes into force. Ratification by sixty Member States is required to achieve this and of the seven that have done so I regret to say that only one is from the EU, namely Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say to the Council and I would say to the presidency this morning: if you want to ensure that those who commit violations of humanitarian law are brought to justice; if you want to send a clear message; if you want to prevent more victims in the future, you should use your presidency to start a campaign at least among EU Member States. They must ratify the Rome Statute and you should use whatever influence you have elsewhere in the world to achieve that magic target of sixty to ensure that the statute of the International Criminal Court comes into force.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also agree that the conventions are just as necessary today as they were 50 years ago. Allow me to take this opportunity to express my full recognition of the major humanitarian work which the International Red Cross and other humanitarian organisations carry out in regard both to spreading knowledge of the humanitarian principles as expressed in the Geneva Conventions and to providing aid to war victims throughout the world. In my view, there are at present two main problems connected with the Geneva Conventions. First of all, there is a gulf between the principles and their observance and, secondly, there are crucial states of affairs which are not covered by the conventions. Allow me to illustrate the constantly widening gulf that exists between, on the one hand, the principles contained in the conventions and, on the other hand, current observance of these by pointing out that, in conflicts in the course of the last decade, 10 times as many civilians have been killed as soldiers. That is essentially the reverse of the situation during the First World War. The widening gulf between principles and practice is due, in my opinion, to the fact that the character of wars has changed during the last 50 years. More and more wars are fought under conditions of anarchy in which there are no stable structures and in which the areas hit by war are not controlled by any government. </p>
<p class="contents">The world has also witnessed a growing number of wars in which weapons have deliberately been aimed at civilians and the purpose of which has been to annihilate specific groups in society. In these situations, humanitarian aid to victims is naturally unwelcome, and this leaves the world in a terrible dilemma. The second problem is that the Geneva Conventions do not adequately deal with the activities of those who intervene for humanitarian reasons. Even though the Geneva Conventions contain provisions concerning the right to provide humanitarian aid in crisis situations, it is also laid down that this right requires the consent of the government in the country concerned. This is especially the case if it is a question of internal conflicts. The principle of humanitarian access or the international community’s right to protect, and provide aid to, those in distress if a State is unable – or unwilling – to do so itself is not, therefore, being universally applied. This is a serious breach of the humanitarian principle and is, in some cases, a fatal shortcoming which is responsible for many war victims. It was precisely this question of providing normal access to humanitarian organisations that was the focal point of my visit to Chechnya at the beginning of February. </p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the question of to what extent circumstances require a revision of the Geneva Conventions, and what form this should take, is now an important one. I believe we have two options which are not mutually exclusive. The first is to change the conventions so that they are better placed to tackle complex contemporary crises, for example by establishing the right to provide humanitarian aid to those in need. The other option is to ensure that the humanitarian principles established in the Geneva Conventions are in actual fact observed, for example, by improving the mechanisms for enforcing them. The first option – that of reconsidering the content of the conventions in order to close all the loopholes – is a complicated and risky option: complicated because the way in which war is conducted is constantly changing, and risky because the possibility cannot be excluded that, as a result of opening the conventions to renegotiation, no new agreement might be reached. But allow me to say clearly that I am wholeheartedly in favour of establishing the principle of humanitarian access in all situations and of reinforcing the right of those in distress to receive humanitarian aid. With regard to the other option – that of securing better observance of the existing principles – I think that prosecuting offenders is one of the most promising options to be pursued. The obligation upon States to proceed against war criminals is established in the Geneva Conventions, but that is clearly not enough. I therefore wholeheartedly support the demand for prompt ratification of the statute of the International Criminal Court. This demand has also been put forward here today. On behalf of the Commission, I want to give my support to the view that we ought to work together on bringing this task to a satisfactory conclusion and turning it into legal reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
