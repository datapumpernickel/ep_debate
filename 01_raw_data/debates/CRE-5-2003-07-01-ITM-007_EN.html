<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Reform of the common fisheries policy and the stability principle</span></p>
<p class="contents">During the European Parliament's debate and vote on the reform of the common fisheries policy, much support was expressed for the principle of relative stability in the management of fisheries resources – a principle which is doubly advantageous since, on the one hand, it will help to ensure that resources are better managed and conserved (which is one of the main objectives of the reform) and, on the other, it will prevent undesirable conflicts which impede the development of harmonious relations between fishing peoples and communities. This is what is happening today, for example, all along the Portuguese coast, where people are becoming increasingly concerned and are rebelling against the EU authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">What action is the Commission intending to take in order to secure acceptance of the above principle and thereby reassure fishermen and the general public? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission’s task in this is to ensure that two principles are maintained, the first being the principle of relative stability, which is laid down in Article 20 of the new framework regulation for the common fisheries policy. This principle, according to which fishing opportunities are to be shared out among the Member States, applies, of course, to Portugal and to Portuguese waters. Another principle in the common fisheries policy, in addition to this one, is that of free access to waters outside the twelve-mile-zone, which is laid down in Article 17 of the new framework regulation, and which is of fundamental importance.</p>
<p class="contents">When dealing with the issue of access to Portuguese continental waters, the Commission clearly has to adopt the same approach as it does to all other Community waters. Although all Member States have to have access to waters outside the twelve-mile-zone, this access can be restricted on biological grounds, but restrictions of this sort must not be discriminatory in their effects. For that reason, it is not possible in law to protect fish stocks by denying fishermen from a neighbouring country access to these waters. There is a solution, however, and the right one is to have relative stability, together with total allowable catches, quotas for stocks of economic importance, and any further technical measures that may prove necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That was a formal response based on principles, the principle of relative stability and the principle of freedom of access. There is a certain contradiction implied between these principles, although commenting on this is irrelevant at present. This formal and abstract framework does, however, conflict with a situation that cannot be ignored at either the political or ethical levels. I am referring to the fact that Portuguese territorial waters have the misfortune to lie next to the territorial waters of Spain, which owns the largest fishing fleet in Europe, one which hungers to find new fishing grounds and shows a ravenous appetite, not always adhering strictly to the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">This is causing fury among Portuguese fishermen, as well as great anxiety and indignation in Portuguese public opinion, so much so that all the reactionaries and nationalists in the country, who have been keeping quiet because the European project is a success for both Europe and Portugal, are taking advantage of the situation. They are making irate speeches against a Europe which wants to deprive Portuguese fishermen of their fish and allow uncontrolled and alien fishing in Portuguese waters. This is a political problem which the Commissioner and the Union have to face. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have told you that there is a solution in practical terms, above all if the Spanish and the Portuguese are willing to meet each other halfway when quotas are laid down.</p>
<p class="contents">What is actually at issue, and of the essence, here is sardine fishery, for which, in this stretch of sea, no quota has been set up until now. We are, however, prepared to set such a quota, and it stands to reason that, when this is done, it will be possible to specify how much of this quota is to be fished by Portuguese and Spanish fishermen respectively.

First, the state of the negotiations between the Union and Mercosur; secondly, the effect of Mr Kirchner’s election as President of Argentina and, lastly, issues of economic cooperation between the Union and Mercosur to facilitate integration in that region.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us look first at the state of the negotiations. As you know, we relaunched the process last year and, since then, negotiators on both sides have been working relentlessly to make progress on its various aspects. These are complex negotiations, which address services and regulations and the trade in goods. Last year in Rio, we therefore adopted a schedule and we are sticking to it. Proposals on tariffs, which were furthermore of a high quality, were exchanged. Since March of this year, the pace has been relaxed. Some progress has also been made on rules of origin, investments, tenders, dispute settlement, trade facilitation, standardisation and technical regulation. This all bodes well. The March negotiations also enabled us to prepare an exchange of ideas on services, investment and on procurement contracts, which took place at the end of May, although we were rather disappointed with the proposals put forward by our Mercosur partners.</p>
<p class="contents">As you see, we are still actively pursuing these negotiations and we have confidence in our partners’ desire to get there. One negotiating round was concluded last week in Asunción. We must continue to make progress because much remains to be done, not least because our friends in Mercosur are anxious for the Union to make a gesture. We will only make such a gesture, should this prove necessary, in the context of an overall balance, which has not yet been fully achieved. Optimism about the state of the negotiations must, therefore, be relative.</p>
<p class="contents">It is probably premature at this stage to take the decision on launching the final phase of negotiations – always an important time – because there are many issues involved and this takes time. We are considering this step, particularly because these negotiations – especially in the field of agriculture – cannot be separated, in terms of a bargaining chip for the EU, from what is happening in the multilateral context of the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">We look favourably on Mr Kirchner’s election as President of Argentina and on the various statements by Presidents Lula and Kirchner on the future of Mercosur. Both of these undoubtedly wanted to convey to Mercosur, in other words Paraguay and Uruguay, to Latin America and more generally, to the entire world, their desire and their will to strengthen the process of integrating Mercosur. We can only welcome these statements. Latin American integration is one of the European Union’s political priorities and this is why we initially felt that we should negotiate with Mercosur as a whole. We therefore wish to hold ‘one-on-one’ negotiations and not ‘one-on-four’ as is done in other areas such as the North-South America free trade zone. I have also said, moreover, and have said so publicly to our partners in Mercosur, that the EU’s trade ambitions towards Mercosur are in line with Mercosur’s own ambition in the field of political, economic and commercial integration.</p>
<p class="contents">What means, then, are we making available to Mercosur under economic cooperation? There is first of all our action at regional level: we have a regional Mercosur/European Union strategy on contributing to the completion of Mercosur’s internal market and, for the 2000-2006 period, this amounts to just over EUR one million. We are committing more than EUR 10 million in the same period to Mercosur’s institutionalisation and there is a third chapter of assistance for civil society. Our experience as Europeans enables us to contribute to the completion of the internal market, of commercial integration, of the statistical system, of the system of veterinary and phytosanitary standards and to harmonising technical regulations; in short, to anything that requires cross-border instruments. We are familiar with these issues because we have faced them ourselves in the recent past. Furthermore, we have also developed cooperation strategies with a number of Mercosur countries involving sums of around EUR 200 million for the period that I have just mentioned. These strategies can also contribute to supporting regional integration, economic reform and social development. Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay have a real need to pursue thoroughgoing reform. We shall continue to support this course of action at economic, social and political levels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very grateful to you for that, as I am always grateful to you for your answers to my questions during Parliamentary Question Time.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I would like to say, before asking one last question, that the members of the Delegation for relations with the countries of South America and Mercosur have just returned from Brasilia. We held meetings with members of the Brazilian Government, with parliamentary leaders, with the President of Congress, and with President Lula’s principal advisors, and we realised once again that we are dealing here with an extraordinary country, which is setting in motion an exemplary social inclusion programme, which will be crucial to its future. As the Commissioner knows, this country also enjoys privileged economic relations with Europe, in addition to the traditional relations of cultural kinship.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I myself have just spent a month and a half in Argentina, on political business, and have seen the progress that the country has made. Mercosur sees its connections with the European Union as a historical relationship between sister states, as a partnership which is essential in order to avoid subordination to the United States. That is why I ask whether the Commission is prepared to give special priority in future to its relations with Mercosur, and perhaps with the whole of South America, which may possibly join Mercosur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This concept of regional integration that we wish to encourage is therefore positive, not because it systematically converts everyone to the European model, but because we believe that, since these countries themselves have decided that integration is in their interest, they deserve our full and unremitting support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In trading matters, we are clearly Africa’s main partner, with bilateral trade worth around EUR 150 billion, according to the figures for 2000, in other words, just under half of all Africa’s external trade.</p>
<p class="contents">This being the case, if we look at the matter in terms of trends, and more particularly of the trend to which the question refers, that is, trade between the Union and countries located south of the Sahara, the rate of change is clearly slow. If we look at the ACP countries in the sub-Saharan zone, the trend is for slight average growth, with some slumps, and I shall return to this. It is, in any event, lower than the growth in world trade. In the long term, the trend is for a slight increase, with total exports to Europe to the tune of EUR 30 billion. And, as I said, within this trend for a slow average increase there are occasional slumps. This was the case, for example, between 2001 and 2002, despite the ‘Everything but arms’ initiative which, in that period, provided around EUR 90 million for the whole of 2002, which was the first full year in which the system was implemented. The ‘Everything but arms’ initiative, therefore, to some extent offset the slump observed in 2001 and 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond the figures, the main problem lies in the make-up of trade and exports from those countries, which still contains structural weaknesses because it is essentially dominated by some basic products, such as oil, diamonds and cocoa. Furthermore, around one third of exports from African countries to Europe consist of farm produce, which also makes our market the major outlet for African exports.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we improve the situation? I think that the concept involves trying to improve these countries’ abilities to export to us and to diversify their economies. In order to achieve this we have a policy that has now stabilised and is one with which the European Parliament is familiar, because we discuss it often: first of all, stepping up regional integration amongst African countries themselves; second, strengthening economic and trade links between these countries and the EU; and lastly, gradually integrating African countries into the world economy, because we cannot lay claim to an exclusive relationship with them and nor would this be in their interests.</p>
<p class="contents">To help us achieve this aim we also have a framework – the Cotonou framework – as well as negotiations on economic partnership agreements, which are making progress. At multilateral level, we have the framework of the WTO. This is why we are now in continuous discussion, if I may put it this way, with our African colleagues, not only in the context of regional relations – and I am here talking about the negotiations on economic partnership agreements – but also multilaterally, given the topicality of the Doha round of negotiations. In this context, we Europeans clearly have a partial responsibility to ensure that all these negotiations meet Africa’s needs because, in my opinion, our African friends now have the means, which they did not have in the past, themselves to identify how this type of negotiation can best meet their needs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One of the reasons we do not agree is that we consider this to be an argument of dubious merit, used in an entirely justified cause and which is intended to promote the interests of GMO agri-food exports by the United States. There are other ways of proceeding, however, such as reducing food aid in kind, as we have done, in order to provide food aid in cash. In Africa in particular, we have funded food aid at regional level. Consequently, every country has choices to make, for or against GMOs, and we must not impose these choices on them. We simply hope that these countries retain their freedom to decide and their sovereignty. In order to ensure this, we simply have to reduce food aid in kind and increase financial aid for food, in line, furthermore, with the regulations of the various United Nations food programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are countries and states in Africa that have been completely dismembered. There are peoples fleeing from war. There are shattered countries. There are tragedies in Africa that defy description. Since we are speaking of trade with Africa, or the growth of trade relations with that continent, I would ask the Commissioner whether an attempt to bring peace to the countries of Africa might not be a fundamental prerequisite. Might there not be a political question to resolve before the trade question? My point is that without peace in Africa, without the stability of its countries, I do not see how one can talk of trade as calmly and with as much aplomb as the Commissioner.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In many cases I, like you, have noted that our joint efforts in the fields of promoting development, trade and human rights on this continent come up against political problems. I also believe that African leaders and the governments of these countries are more aware now than in the past of the need to address, both on their own and with one another, a number of political obstacles of this type. Programmes such as NEPAD – which we support because our work on regional integration in Africa closely mirrors the strategy adopted by this new partnership – are, in my opinion, moving in the same direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat; you are quite right. This being the case, what we have is a chicken and egg situation, in which the chicken is probably political and the egg is probably economic. Nevertheless, given the state of the world, we cannot refrain from using the eggs available to us in order to take things forward. This is a daily chore that requires patience. If we manage to convince a number of economic operators to work towards an environment that is more stable, less conflict-ridden and less disjointed, we could perhaps, here and there, create pressure for peace. If, on the other hand, communities and those who appoint their leaders are not interested, we will find it much more difficult to achieve our aim. Politicians certainly have a responsibility to free up some of these economic resources, but let us not stop working from the bottom up. This, I believe, would be a mistake. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As you probably know, the current blockage is the result of the US refusal to accept a compromise proposal which has been on the table in Geneva since December 2002 and which has been accepted by all Members of the World Trade Organisation except the United States and this is precisely wherein the problem lies. Our position on this matter is simple: Doha, and nothing but Doha. The compromise text of last December and nothing but the compromise text. Recently, furthermore – last month, to be precise – we submitted a written communication to the TRIPs Council and thus to the WTO, to remind them of our proposals and to insist that technical assistance is provided. This will enable us, once the problem is resolved, to implement the <span class="italic">acquis</span> of the Doha declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agree with the ACP countries’ view on the need to maintain the scope of the Doha declaration. We believe that the Doha mandate is a broad one and this is acknowledged in the text that has been on the table since last December. We have always maintained this position, and this is why we proposed, at the beginning of the year, to call on the World Health Organisation to re-establish confidence and to find a way out of the current impasse.</p>
<p class="contents">Our strategy remains the same. We want the Americans to accept the compromise text that has been on the table since December, without diminishing the scope of the text, where diseases are concerned. We will continue to make every effort to find a solution before the Cancun ministerial conference. A number of our friends in developing countries have intimated that, to some extent, unless agreement is reached on this point, everything that will be on the table in Cancun and, consequently, the outcome of the multilateral negotiations launched in Doha could be at risk. The issue is, therefore, one of our top priorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe it was a very good letter and one that covered the issues and concerns very well. The letter, however, refers to the EU proposals, and says that the EU is making an unacceptable attempt to restrict the ACP's use of compulsory licensing. It also mentions the references to the WHO and so on, with which the ACP countries are not happy. They are not happy with any suggestion that seems to deviate from the Doha Declaration, which sets no limitations of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">The application of the agreement on national emergencies is something the ACP and other developing countries are not happy with.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I know that you are making every effort to bring the opposing sides together, but are you not putting yourself in danger of being seen as deviating from the content and understanding of the consensus which was so valiantly achieved in the Doha Declaration?</p>
<p class="contents">In the letter, the ACP countries ask whether there is a straightforward and easy way to implement a solution.

<p class="contents">I presented this proposal to consult the World Health Organisation, should this prove necessary, in January because I believe that the Americans are not on board on this matter. The US pharmaceutical industry considers that the arrangements in their current form still contain a number of loopholes and has no confidence that the system is going to be used for the purpose for which it was put on the table. A similar position is held by the developing countries, which also lack confidence and feel that the pharmaceutical industry in general will take every opportunity to take all the credit, as it has done, in their opinion, over the last few years.</p>
<p class="contents">The diagnosis is, therefore, clear. What we have on the table is a text with which we agree. The Americans do not agree with it because they do not have confidence in the system. We must consequently raise the level of confidence in the system on both sides and this is what we are working on. This must not be done, however, to the detriment of the compromise which is on the table on the subject of the diseases mentioned – a compromise which is in place and which we do not wish to go into now – or to the detriment of countries that could benefit from the measures set out in the agreement because they do not have their own pharmaceutical production capacity. The Perez Motta compromise, as the technical jargon has it, is the one on the table and this is the right approach. We simply have to increase both sides’ level of confidence in the system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the course of 2001, China greatly increased its exports of ceramics. The continuing existence of state-owned companies and the selling off of stocks from others which have already closed account for the fact that Chinese production prices are very low. Although the country still has limited export capacity, the EU's trade deficit is steadily increasing on account of unfair competitive practices, the most serious of which is the copying of EU ceramic products which are then labelled and sold as having been 'made in the EU'.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission planning to take action in order to prevent this type of fraud in the export of ceramics from China? Are any negotiations being held with the Chinese authorities with a view to improving the terms and conditions under which Community businesses may secure access to a market in which, despite China's membership of the WTO, there are still major sources of discrimination and obstacles to investment?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This matter is not very complicated in technical terms, but the question raises two separate issues: the first is the increase in imports of ceramic products from the People’s Republic of China and the second, a problem of potential fraud with regard to the origin of these products.</p>
<p class="contents">Where our imports of ceramics from the People’s Republic of China are concerned, it is true that in 1994 quantity limits were applied to imports of this nature, and to tableware or kitchenware in particular. In the meantime, China joined the World Trade Organisation and, in recognition of this fact, it was decided to phase out these quantity limits, which will, therefore, disappear completely at the end of 2004. In 2001 there was an increase of just over 10% in imports of these products to the European market, whereas in 2002 there was a slight fall in numbers. Consequently, our markets are not being permanently flooded with these products.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to the second part of your question, which concerns problems relating to fraud. We have adequate instruments in place for combating fraud and we are prepared to make use of them. As I have already told European industrialists who have expressed concerns similar to yours, we would need more precise information on what these industrialists and you seem to consider to be fraudulent actions. The details are missing. Mr Bolkestein’s services will study your additional information so that together we can work out whether an inquiry should be opened. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are doing so in a number of areas and once again, Mr Bolkestein and myself, as well as our services, work together on many such matters. What we need, in order to commit resources which, as you know, are scarce despite the considerable efforts of the European Parliament to give the Commission additional means, is to have sufficiently precise information, rather like a unit that is given the task of investigating fraud in the police force. Give us more precise details, then.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to export opportunities in the ceramics sector, which is still a significant sector in a number of Member States, these do not depend on specific Community policies. Also on this subject, if our ceramics exporters, whose quality is recognised throughout the world found their access to the market of one third country or another obstructed because the countries concerned were not applying the open arrangements accepted bilaterally or within the World Trade Organisation, we would then set in motion the means available to us to help out our exporters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They involve on the one hand a trade component, which is not covered by the question on the subject of ceramics and the work of my colleague, Mr Byrne, and on the other, a health component. The latter area involves more than just the problems of managing trade flows or the comparative advantages that some countries have.

Accordingly, if the conditions are transparent and clear, and if the scientific evidence justifies the need for a particular protection measure on the grounds of health, the SPS agreement allows trade barriers to be put in place, and quite rightly so! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Contravention of international legal rules by Turkey, and danger of causing a serious accident to a passenger aeroplane in Greek airspace</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 9 June 2003, two Turkish F-16 fighter planes harassed an Olympic Airways aircraft on the Athens-Istanbul route, placing the lives of the passengers in direct danger. The aircraft’s automatic crash avoidance safety system was triggered and Greek fighter planes were forced to intercept the Turkish planes.</p>
<p class="contents">This action constitutes a clear contravention of the rules of international law and, more specifically, a violation of European Union airspace and thus of its territorial integrity, placing the safety of EU citizens in danger, and represents a violation of fundamental standards of international conduct, such as those enshrined in the Treaty on European Union and in the United Nations Charter and included within the Copenhagen criteria. It is a reflection of a systematic Turkish policy which leads to tension in relations between Greece and Turkey and directly threatens the peace and security of the region. In view of these facts, what urgent steps does the Commission intend to take to put a stop to such aggressive acts by Turkey and to prevent their repetition in the future, and what consequences will the Turkish strategy adopted to date have on the assessment of the country’s progress towards EU membership? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has always been our approach, in line with the criteria set out in the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council of 1999. We also made this issue a specific priority for the review of the partnership for Turkish accession, which was adopted in May 2003. Accordingly, as on other matters requiring progress on the part of Turkey, we will closely follow developments in this matter and will present a detailed assessment in the periodic report that we are due to publish at the beginning of November. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Member State's tax subsidy of abortion for other EU citizens</span></p>
<p class="contents">In early April 2003, the Swedish Government announced in the Riksdag, through the Equal Opportunities Minister Margareta Winberg, that it was prepared to review the law on abortion to consider whether women who are not resident in Sweden, and therefore not Swedish citizens, should still be able to have an abortion in the country. The underlying logic of the proposal is that taxpayers in one Member State of the EU – Sweden – would bear the costs and therefore, in practice, offer services to citizens from other Member States for an activity which is illegal in Member States such as Ireland and Portugal as well as in the new Member States of Poland and Malta.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission consider that the Swedish Government's proposal is consistent with the Treaties or the spirit of the Treaties concerning mutual solidarity given that it is prepared to subsidise an activity in Sweden for other EU citizens, which is illegal in other Member States, through taxation? Would such conduct support or undermine other Member States' legislation? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is, however, unique and serious in this case is that it entails subsidising, for foreign citizens of other Member States, an activity that I specified by name in my question, that is illegal in a number of Member States and that involves inviting citizens of other EU countries to engage in an activity that is illegal in these EU countries.</p>

Indeed, the Commission is of the view that the changes in attitude within some Member States regarding issues such as abortion are driven by public opinion rather than by external factors. The reflection of this is the fact that the legal regimes on abortion in Member States are still very divergent, as indeed the Member who has just spoken will recognise. Whilst it is illegal in one Member State, it is legal in others – subject, of course to varying restrictions.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, the fact that in some Member States, such as Ireland, abortion is against the law, does not mean that, if the Swedish Government were to pass the amendment I described, it would not be allowed to extend benefits to whoever it liked. It is within the competence of the Swedish Government to take a decision on that, and the extent of benefits allowed under Swedish legislation would, as I said earlier, have no impact on the legislation of a country where abortion is forbidden, such as Ireland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Use of a mathematical formula in awarding public contracts: distortion of the rules of competition</span></p>
<p class="contents">Recent newspaper articles discuss the intervention of the Commission which has called on the Greek authorities to postpone awards of public contracts until the curious system for awarding public contracts on the basis of a mathematical formula has been modified. The same publications claim that this formula has cost the Greek economy EUR 800 million. According to the Commission's answer to my previous question on the use of a mathematical formula in awarding public contracts in Greece (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2003-0097_EN.html">H-0097/03</a>)<a href="#def_1_2" name="ref_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, it has addressed a letter to the Greek authorities in order to obtain information about how this formula is applied and what exactly it consists of.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the application of this specific formula since 1998 has led to a distortion of competition and the creation of oligopolies and even monopolies in the construction market for public works, whether or not they are co-funded by the Community, will the Commission say:</p>
<p class="contents">Has the Commission been informed by the Greek authorities about the precise content of the legislative arrangements governing this specific mathematical formula and the proposals for modifying it published in the media and to what extent these are compatible with Community law and the rules of competition? Has the Commission asked for the Greek authorities to modify this formula, and what measures have been taken in respect of accusations of infringements of Community law and to address the issue of the exceptionally low tenders for public contracts? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following a request from the Commission the Hellenic authorities notified the relevant national legislation in January 2003. While proceeding with its assessment the Commission received a new complaint on the same matter, which gave a better picture of how the whole system of the mathematical formula is applied in practice, since the latter complaint did not concern the legislation in abstract, but made reference to concrete examples of its application.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of this new information, the Commission services addressed a letter to the competent Hellenic authorities in late April 2003, asking them to take a position on specific issues raised in relation to the compatibility of the Hellenic legislation and practice with Community public procurement legislation and the relevant jurisprudence of the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission services have very recently received a request on behalf of the Hellenic authorities to extend the time given to them to reply to this new letter until 30 June 2003, in order for them to give a comprehensive answer on the whole issue and in view of certain changes that they envisage concerning the relevant legislation. The Commission services have granted this extension and now await the answer of the Hellenic authorities. Once they receive this reply and the changes that the Hellenic authorities propose to their national legislation regulating the mathematical formula for identification of abnormally low offers, they will come to a final assessment of the compatibility of the system applied in relation to Community public procurement legislation.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Principle of 'fair compensation'</span></p>
<p class="contents">Directive 2001/29/EC<a href="#def_1_3" name="ref_1_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> introduces the principle of 'fair compensation'. In 2002, Commissioner Bolkestein confirmed that that is a new concept different from the principle of 'fair remuneration' (levy system). In April 2003, however, the Commissioner stated that the Directive does not require Member States to give up existing levy systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it really the Commission's opinion that the principle of fair compensation which has been introduced is a new concept? In the Commission's judgment, are existing systems based on fair remuneration in keeping with the Directive? Is it the Commission's opinion that Member States must bring their legislation into line by introducing a specific reference to the principle of fair compensation? Is it the Commission's opinion that the principle of fair compensation introduces a harmonised basis which will put an end to the diversity in lines of reasoning put forward and, in the process, the differences in amounts charged? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As is indicated in the directive, the concept of fair compensation offers Member States a considerable degree of flexibility or freedom of judgment when they decide on the form, the modalities or the level of fair compensation regulations. However, pursuant to recitals 35 and 38, Member States that apply copyright meet the condition that fair compensation must be in place. Relevant legislation implementing the directive need not necessarily contain a specific reference to the principle of fair compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the directive, Member States are obliged to ensure that fair compensation is in place for three of the exceptions to the reproduction right listed in the directive. First of all, there is the exception of reproduction for private use. This is the exception with most relevance for copyright, because usually, rights are levied with regard to reproduction for private use of sound and audio-visual material. The second one pertains to the exception for reprographics or photocopying and the third one relates to transmissions in some social institutions such as hospitals or prisons.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems probable that the Member States that had levy systems in place in the past, will continue to allow reproduction for private use in combination with levy systems and that they will also apply these to certain digital products. It is true that the different systems continue to result in differences in application with regard to carriers or equipment to which they apply and/or the amounts claimed, including the differences in application to digital carriers. This is due to the fact that the EC legislator ruled against a higher degree of harmonisation during negotiations about the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as analogue copying for private use is concerned, the directive acknowledges that it is unlikely that the existing differences will have a major impact on the development of the information society. With regard to digital copying for private use, the directive underlines that due account must be given to differences between digital and analogue copying for private use, and that in certain cases, a distinction must be drawn between them.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it must be stressed that the directive does not require Member States to abolish copyright, or to take a stand for or against copyright in comparison to digital rights management systems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the end of your intervention, you draw a clear distinction between analogue and digital copying, whereby the former would not be harmful to the information society, while the latter would. As far as I know – and I have been involved in information society legislation for years – we in Europe specifically do not draw a distinction between digital and analogue, in the sense that legislation must be technology-neutral. So I am a little taken aback by your statement.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I am surprised that the directive does not tend more towards harmonisation, particularly because your offices initially indicated that it would do so. Where fair compensation is concerned, it is important to establish whether the rightholder is actually being adversely affected, whether any technological protection measures are available and whether any other payment is made to the rightholder. This is why I think that it is regrettable after all that Member States are not required to adapt their legislation in the sense that only fair compensation is granted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that we need to investigate this area specifically with the internal market in mind. Are the differences in the levy systems between the countries of Europe of any significance? Do they impede the internal market and lead to distortion? I believe that our examination of the trend we have in Europe should start specifically from the perspective of a functioning internal market. I believe it would be important to obtain an account of the ways in which fair compensation or fair remuneration have developed. What are the facts of the case?

<p class="contents">The rapid alert system defined in Article 50 of the regulation is designed primarily as a tool for the rapid transmission of information amongst competent authorities in cases where a risk has been identified and measures have already been taken by the notifying Member State, such as withholding, recalling, seizure or rejection of the products concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The quick transmission of information allows all other Member States to verify immediately whether they are also affected by the problem in question, or to ensure that a product rejected at one point of entry does not enter through another place. It also ensures coherent and simultaneous actions by all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In cases where a product is still on the market and should not be consumed, the authorities of the Member States are in a position to take all the necessary urgent measures, including providing direct information to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the information collected by the rapid alert system is used by the Commission. For example, my services use the information to set priorities for the Food and Veterinary Office and to propose measures such as suspension of the placing on the market, suspension of imports or any other emergency measure under Article 53 of the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also uses this information to assist third countries. When products subject to a notification originate from a third country, its competent authorities are systematically informed in order to enable them to correct the problem at source and prevent further cases.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that, according to Article 52 of the Food Law Regulation, the Commission does not publish trade names and the identity of individual companies in the regular rapid alert summaries. However, where emergency measures are taken by Member States or the Commission, in the light of the analysis of the risk posed by the alert, such relevant information on the products concerned by the action is made public.</p>
<p class="contents">The RASFF is used both to take actions to prevent further occurrence of food-related risks and to react immediately to such related risks in order to provide consumers with safe food. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In relation to trade names and individual companies it is very important that a vague system of alerts is in place which allows the consumer to make a choice. Does the Commission not agree that if a product or food producer causes an alert then it is both in the consumer's interest and indeed in the interest of the open market that this information should be made public?</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask the Commissioner a question concerning the 2002 rapid alerts. Apparently, 26% of rapid alerts in 2002 were caused by fish. What is the breakdown of these alerts between farmed fish and wild fish? The consumer has a right to know if farmed fish cause a disproportionate number of rapid alerts. Is DG SANCO taking any specific action to address this problem? Does the Commissioner have this information on him now? It would be very useful to have this information on the breakdown as regards fish. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is very targeted and the purpose of the exercise is, as I am sure she will appreciate, to transmit as fast as possible the relevant information to the competent authorities of all Member States, so that they can make a rapid response and take rapid action in relation to the risk that has been identified in respect of any particular food or feed in question. What is important here is public health, rather than some kind of naming and shaming.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise that once the rapid alert has been made and responses have been taken, and if it is shown that it is a genuine problem from which consumers need to be protected, the Member States in question, where there is a risk – and it is for them to determine this – will immediately inform their own consumers in their Member State. That is their responsibility under the rapid alert system. In those circumstances it would be appropriate for them to then identify, for instance, trade names or companies which would assist consumers to make the appropriate response.</p>
<p class="contents">However, bear in mind that the rapid alert system is designed to allow Member States to react quickly and to remove, for instance, foods from the market.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to that, if it is necessary on further reflection and further analysis of the information that has come from the rapid alert – which is activated under Article 50 - that an emergency procedure under Article 53 is necessary, this would be something which could again be done at Member State level or, indeed, could also be done by the Commission. In those circumstances, the relevant information that would be made available would include the information that you referred to relating to trade names and companies, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to emphasise that the rapid alert is designed for a specific purpose, which is to transmit information as fast as possible, even in circumstances where all information may not be available. The important issue here is to identify the risk to the public to which the Member States must respond. I believe, in those circumstances, we have struck the correct balance.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the second part of your question concerning the figures for 2002, I do not have the specific figures to hand relating to the breakdown between farmed fish and wild fish, but I am sure this kind of information is available to my services. I will seek to ensure that it is made available by them and transmitted to you in the normal course. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In its resolution on foot and mouth disease of December 2002, the European Parliament stated that the Commission should as quickly as possible submit a proposal to amend Directive 92/102/EEC so as to improve the identification of pigs, sheep and goats.</p>
<p class="contents">According to current legislation sheep and goats must be identified with an eartag or a tattoo linked to the holding. The keepers must keep an up-to-date register on the holding, and the competent authority must keep an up-to-date central register of holdings.</p>
<p class="contents">The main new elements of the proposed system are individual identification, double eartagging to ensure that identity is retained where one eartag is lost, and the introduction of a movement document.</p>
<p class="contents">Individual identification is essential for the effective tracing of animals for veterinary purposes, which is of crucial importance for the control of contagious diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of a reinforced system will have a positive impact in case of outbreaks of major animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, allowing the rapid identification of the source of infection and limiting the further spread of the disease. Furthermore it will allow accurate tracing of animals in the framework of the animal disease eradication programmes financed by the Community. Finally, such a system would assist in reducing fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">The technology of electronic identification for sheep and goats has progressed to such a stage that it can now be applied. The Commission launched a large-scale pilot project – the IDEA Project – in 1998. The final report of this project, which included sheep and goats, as well as bovine animals, was completed in 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the implementing measures required for the proper introduction of the system of electronic identification on a Community scale have yet to be fully developed. The proposal therefore provides for further guidelines and procedures to be adopted through the Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, with entry into force of obligatory electronic tagging foreseen for 1 July 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">I am well aware of the diversity of the sheep population and the sheep production systems in the Member States. The proposal therefore includes options, which would allow: Member States to defer the identification of lambs up to the age of 6 months, where sheep are kept under extensive farming conditions, for instance in Scotland – to which the questioner referred; Member States to apply simplified identification arrangements to young lambs, up to six months of age, intended for direct slaughter. The options decided upon will influence the likely costs to the farmers of introducing the new system.</p>
<p class="contents">The estimation of the costs of introduction of the reinforced system on a Community-wide basis has to take into account the diversity of the sheep population and the sheep production systems in the Member States. In the absence of precise information on movements and other parameters, the estimate has to be based on the general structure of the various production systems.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis, the overall costs of the reinforced system are estimated to vary between EUR 1 for traditional eartags to EUR 3.7 for electronic identification per sheep per year.</p>
<p class="contents">I recognise that this proposal will require significant efforts by both operators and authorities. But these efforts in my opinion and in the opinion of the Commission are both worthwhile and necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I raised that question specifically with them. The answer they gave me – and it seemed credible – is that the system of herd tagging you suggest does not have the same degree of security in circumstances where you may have an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease or similar.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, for the reason that you identify in your supplementary question, in these markets that we see in Scotland and in my home country of Ireland as well, herds arrive, they are sub-divided into other herds, they are separated so that the chance of following a particular herd number and getting the information that you need in the case of an outbreak of disease is diluted to a considerable extent. In fact, it eliminates the opportunity of following a particular animal that may be carrying that particular disease.</p>
<p class="contents">In those circumstances, the only alternative available to us was to come forward with an individual identification tag system. I acknowledge this will last for an interim transition period until electronic tagging comes into play: it is scheduled for 1 July 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say to Mr Purvis that there are many people calling for this system of tagging for the reason that I have identified. Member States want it, even the Member States that have large sheep populations and trade a lot in sheep, both within the Member State and across borders. For those reasons, the degree of support that exists in the Community for this proposal is strong. Therefore, in the light of the need to protect animal health and for other reasons it seems necessary to come forward with that particular proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should again draw attention to what I said a moment ago: the Commission has taken into account the diversity of the sheep population and the sheep production systems in Member States and the proposal includes options which Member States may decide to apply under certain circumstances. For instance, for animals kept in extensive farming conditions and in free range, the age of tagging may be extended from one month to six months of age, but, in any event, before leaving the holding of birth. Also, for animals intended for slaughter before six months of age, the identification code may be the code of the holding of birth and the month of birth. Under this system, instead of each individual animal, groups of animals with the same identification code are recorded in the holding register and the movement document. That is a measure that was introduced in the legislation in ease of the kind of farming that I know exists in some remote areas in Scotland and, to a very large extent, meets the case that you have put forward in trying to respond to the concerns that you address.</p>
<p class="contents">Where the animals are obviously over six months of age, then, of course, individual tagging must take place for the reason I have already identified. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In recent months there has been a sharp increase in the number of BSE cases in Spain and that number is still continuing to rise.

The upper limit of this level is an incidence of 100 cases per million adult cattle over the past 12 months.</p>
<p class="contents">The BSE incidence in Spain has been increasing since the beginning of 2002. The incidence is, however, still well below this upper limit of around 45 cases per million adult cattle over the past 12 months, and it is not increasing rapidly. Therefore, the classification of Spain by the Scientific Steering Committee still remains valid.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first quarter of this year, Spain reported about 50% more BSE cases than during the corresponding period last year. At the same time the number of cases decreased or was stable in all other Member States, except Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">Compared with other Member States, Spain has a rather high rate of young animals born in 1997 and 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">The feeding of ruminant proteins to ruminants is considered to be the main source of BSE transmission to cattle. Therefore, the Commission imposed a Community-wide prohibition of the use of mammalian proteins in ruminant feed in 1994. It is, however, evident that this ban was not fully enforced at that time, since most of the BSE cases reported today were born after 1994. Meat-and-bone meal continued to be allowed in feed for non-ruminants, and thereby ruminant feed was contaminated in feed mills and during storage and transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Another source of transmission was cross-feeding of feed intended for non-ruminants to cattle on mixed farms. Shortcomings in the implementation of the feed ban were observed throughout the Community. To put an end to the transmission of BSE the feed ban was extended to the use of all animal proteins in feed for all farmed animals at the beginning of 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">Other measures to reduce the transmission of BSE are improved rendering standards – which came into effect in early 1997 – and a ban on the use of so-called BSE risk materials in food and feed, which became effective in October 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">The current Community legislation should, if rigorously implemented, be sufficient to prevent new animals from becoming infected. BSE cases will, nevertheless, continue to appear in Spain, as in other Member States, for a number of years because of an incubation time of four to six years or even longer. That is why it is important to maintain current safeguards, in particular the removal of specified risk material. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The increase in mad cow disease which has taken place in Spain as well in recent years – and your words also confirm this – is the result of the fact that the then Spanish Minister, Mr Arias Cañete, who denied that Spain was at risk – and the Scientific Committee did state this – was not complying with the Community legislation, and this is the reason for this proliferation and increase in mad cow disease.</p>

Possible explanations, in addition to shortcomings in the implementation of the feed ban, are introduction of the removal of specified risk materials in Spain only at the end of 2000 and a higher than average exposure to infected meat and bone meal in the 1996-1998 period.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be stressed, however, that the Commission's Food and Veterinary Office has carried out missions in Spain in order to verify the correct implementation of the Community provisions with regard to the control and eradication of BSE in 2001 and 2002. Shortcomings are still being detected. Spain has also informed the Commission of a number of breaches of the feed ban detected in 2002. The number of breaches is very small and below the average in Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
