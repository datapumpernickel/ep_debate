<p class="contents">The objective of our proposal is primarily to extend the legal basis for the decentralised cooperation budget line for an additional period of three years. This will ensure the continuity of the budget line until the end of 2006 when the new financial perspectives will be established. It will also give time for a more thorough discussion with all concerned partners on the role of the budget line and its financial allocation. The outcome of this discussion should provide the basis for a revision of the strategic guidelines for the decentralised cooperation instrument in a longer-term perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest evaluation of the implementation of this budget line which was sent to Parliament in July insisted on the strong added value of the concept of decentralised cooperation as a complementary tool for the actions implemented under the national indicative programmes in favour of the local civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed amendments by the Committee on Development are mainly intended to clarify the eligibility of some decentralised cooperation agents to ensure better coherence with the comitology used and to guarantee better reporting on the implementation of actions financed under this budget line.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is happy to agree with all these amendments. They reflect well the fruitful discussions between the rapporteur, the Council working group and the Commission services. The sole exception would be Amendment No 5 concerning the increase of the financial allocation from EUR 18 million to 36 million. I understand Parliament's concerns that greater emphasis should be given to strengthening the role of local actors, and in particular southern civil society, in development cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">We are making a considerable effort in this direction. However, as I explained in the letter I sent to Parliament two weeks ago, it is not necessary to seek additional funds specifically for decentralised cooperation on this budget line, as it is clear from our proposal that the financing proposed is to be used primarily in situations of difficult partnership. In other areas the geographical instruments may be used.</p>
<p class="contents">I need to confirm here that the Commission, fully supported on this by the Council, cannot accept the proposed increase in the budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The role of this report is to provide a successor. We want to continue with the existing and worthwhile provisions in 2004-06, and in order for the legal basis to allow a seamless transition we want to try to succeed on the first reading, together with the Council and the Commission. We seem to have been successful so far, in that all the amendments proposed today are, on the whole, very worthy of support. We have sought to put the emphasis on the initiatives and stakeholders in the decentralised cooperation in the developing countries themselves rather than those in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The wording of Amendment No 10 is now the result of a compromise proposed by Mr Sauquillo Pérez del Arco and myself, and now states, among other things, that independent establishments are also included. We have adopted the wording used in Recital 11 on the status of churches and ideological groups in the Annex to the Treaty of Amsterdam to ensure that the ministers could accept it without any difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner has already said that Amendment No 5 is the real sticking point. Everything else has also been agreed in the Committee on Development and Cooperation. Amendment No 5 provides for an increase from EUR 18 million to EUR 36 million. I have to say that while obviously I would like to see such an increase, given the current situation I do not think this report and the new regulation are the appropriate place for demanding one. It would undoubtedly mean – as the Council has made very clear – that no solution would be agreed at first reading. For that reason, I would prefer to stick with the EUR 18 million, as per the proposal, and then set a higher figure in the new negotiations for 2007 onwards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And this consensus has been reached not just in Parliament, but at interinstitutional level, which means that, as soon as possible and for the next three years, we will have a renewed legal basis for implementing this policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Decentralised cooperation, that is to say, the participation of non-state actors and sub-state bodies – both of the European countries and of the receiving countries – is a necessary condition for a participative development which responds to the needs and initiatives of the population to which cooperation is ultimately directed. It is an added factor in the democratisation of developing societies, since by means of decentralised cooperation the social fabric is strengthened, and it is also a proven element in the effectiveness of aid and a factor in making the concept of appropriation of development processes a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Development cooperation ceased some time ago to be solely bilateral or multilateral and governmental or non-governmental. The Group of the Party of European Socialists therefore enthusiastically supports increasingly improved decentralised cooperation. Let us accept therefore that – from the point of view of sustainable and participative local development – neither those people in Europe who believe that this approach may be used to encourage movements outside of the States nor the authorities of the receiving countries who are afraid of losing control over the aid which they consider to be their own are right.</p>
<p class="contents">Decentralised cooperation looks more towards the actors than towards economic resources or the sectoral contents of cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to economic resources – mentioned by the rapporteur – we have given up our initial desire for greater allocation of funds for the sake of the interinstitutional agreement, but we have a commitment from the Commission to maintain adequate execution of the programme and we believe, however, that the decentralised cooperation line must continue to increase and not be a minor budget line from which funds can be taken in order to fill other gaps.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment we have EUR 9 million for the first year and EUR 6 million for the two following years in line B7-6002, without prejudice to the fact that resources from geographical lines can benefit decentralised cooperation actions. We do not believe this to be satisfactory – we would like to have more – but, for the sake of consensus, we can reach this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Since we are talking about a transversal line, it has no sectoral limits and we in the Group of the Party of European Socialists have tried to open it up to the greatest possible number of beneficiaries, so that social organisation is effectively promoted. It is made explicit that local public powers are also considered municipal authorities and we are happy with the extension of the Regulation and the modifications which have been introduced, bearing in mind the references to the Gemelli, Carrilho and Howitt reports and we hope that the Commission will henceforth comply with the time periods for assessment and presentation of results established by Parliament so that we can analyse the effectiveness of this instrument in terms of development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, it is one of the only constituents of that policy which guarantees the real use of funds by the nations of the South. Mr Zimmerling’s report is a step in the right direction, in that he has created a real instrument which guarantees the participation of citizens in developing countries. The Howitt report had already opened up some interesting lines of action, and this new report improves even further the collaboration with non-governmental organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the development of the list of potential partners. It is particularly important to us that account should be taken of the organisations of the indigenous populations. They are in many cases minorities and suffer opposition from the public authorities, which more often than not represent authoritarian powers.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as those who are actually involved are concerned, however, the question of the churches gives rise to problems. Although it seems obvious to everyone that charitable organisations, including those of a religious nature, can benefit from funds for decentralised cooperation, on the other hand it seems inconceivable to me that the European Union should, under this heading, be funding the churches themselves, since by definition their aim is proselytisation. Are we going to finance Catholic churches or Protestant chapels in Moslem countries, or the building of mosques in Christian countries? We discussed this with the rapporteur, who seemed to have understood the problem that was raised. The fact that this viewpoint was retained before the vote in committee may have looked like an oversight. Now, however, when the Committee on Development and Cooperation has rejected this word, and by a large majority, its re-insertion through the intervention of the Council Presidency, which has used a version of the Treaty of Amsterdam – minus its philosophical elements – leaves me somewhat puzzled as to the final objective of this text. In the absence of any clarification on this point, we shall not be able to vote in favour of this report. I would therefore strongly urge my fellow Members to return to the amendment adopted at the committee stage, whereby the list was restricted to charitable organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital that as many representatives of civil society as possible can make their opinions known, and can have recourse to funding which is independent of their state authorities, so as to strengthen the independence of social movements which are campaigning for sustainable development, for human rights and for social rights, for democratisation or for cultural pluralism. This is why we are asking that the overall funding should be increased from EUR 18 million to EUR 36 million. This appears to us to be vitally important if all those involved are to take part in the debate. In other words, it is not enough to create a good policy: it is even more important to provide it with adequate financial resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, the separate budget line; a line for decentralised cooperation is an experiment of recent years. The assessment that the Commission has commissioned shows no trace of effective implementation. It is therefore unreasonable to persist with a separate budget line. Unfortunately, I cannot find this consideration in the report. The selection of projects, in particular, is problematic.</p>
<p class="contents">A transparent framework is required within which the delegations select the right projects. The criteria for this selection should be sound and their application insightful. According to the assessment report, however, the selection process is not transparent at all. Moreover, follow-up and assessment are inadequate; in fact, according to the assessment report, they are absent. Whilst the Commission’s delegations appreciate the instrument’s flexibility, the lack of transparency and assessment cause me to conclude that its flexibility is excessive.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission has proposed an increase in the budget; the Zimmerling report goes further and proposes a huge increase, but neither the Commission document nor the report adduce convincing arguments for this increase. In short, there is no reason for great faith in the correctness of the approach adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We must give our full support to the Commission proposal examined in the report. I must emphasise, however, that the issue of decentralised cooperation should be addressed more consistently. For example, this proposal should have been presented some time ago. I must point out that, at the time of the first extension, when I was asked to draw up a report, the presentation was already extremely late.</p>
<p class="contents">Issues relating to the financial framework must be emphasised: predicting an increase undoubtedly sends out a positive message, perhaps the only one possible, but is still far from adequate, mainly because we cannot confine ourselves to making funds available. We must also make a more serious effort to increase understanding of this type of aid, so that it is not always the same people who benefit from it, such as those who, as a result of having better connections, are better positioned to have the necessary information and explanations. Whether or not more candidates are put forward depends largely on us, on the way in which we disseminate information, on our making the application processes less bureaucratic. The Commission delegations could give some support at the stage of submitting applications. I wish, lastly, to congratulate Mr Zimmerling on the work he has undertaken and to support the amendments that have been tabled, in particular those concerned with extending the range of potential beneficiaries – and here I would underline all those that I mentioned – and with strengthening networks operating in the field of human rights and democratisation processes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with everybody who has said that this is an important and interesting area of activity. I also appreciate the realistic and constructive reaction to the need to keep to the budget level, which is necessary to move it forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I would make one additional remark, namely, that when we look at volume and this activity, the big show is the funding of non-State actors in ACP countries starting up now. In general, the average money available is between 5 and 10% of the country envelope, when we look at the whole group of ACP countries. This is for funding local NGOs, non-State actors and civil society in a broad sense. The idea is that the decision-making here will mainly be in the hands of our head of delegation there. That is truly decentralised cooperation. What we have here is a budget line managed out of Brussels which we <span class="italic">call</span> decentralised cooperation – a somewhat bureaucratic approach reflecting a time when we did not have the Cotonou agreement's new dimension of directly funding partners in civil society in those 78 countries. That is not to say that this budget line and this instrument are becoming irrelevant, because they cover the whole geography, not only the ACP countries. However, it underscores that the actual activity as such is something which has more to it than what we are discussing here.</p>
<p class="contents">So I see this budget line and the regulation and handling of it by Parliament as a way of clarifying the intentions. However, there is – like the iceberg – something bigger below the surface of this budget line, and it is important to keep that in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me again thank you for a constructive reaction by Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its main aim is to improve the quality of aid and to create conditions for the undertaking of further action and cooperation. Its main characteristic should not therefore be the amount of funding. The development, moreover, of the legislative framework does not appear to have resulted so far in a greater take-up of appropriations, while the financial reference amount in the European Commission's proposal for 2004-2006 makes provision for an average annual sum which is higher than that of the previous period of application of the action and which, in my opinion, corresponds to the objective set. I agree with the objectives and the need to continue the action. In addition, the size of the aid and its experimental character impose a flexible procedure in order to optimise its efficiency. However, it is understandable that action by these agencies and the management of Community funds on their part should be characterised by transparency and honest financial management. Finally, I should like to point out the dynamic character of this form of cooperation. It is important for the annual evaluation of the action not to be limited to a quantitative presentation of the actions funded, but also to include a qualitative evaluation of the cooperation so as to reveal the trends taking shape for coming years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
