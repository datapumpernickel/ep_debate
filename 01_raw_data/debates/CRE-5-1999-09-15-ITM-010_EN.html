<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dührkop Dührkop (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, please allow me to highlight a few points as rapporteur of the 1999 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly the 1999 budget was defined at the time as a “bridge” towards the new financial requirements, that is towards the financing of Agenda 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it was also a bridge with regard to the political priorities which this Parliament wanted to establish with a view to the future, with a view to the new millennium, especially in category 4 – external activities – where the European Parliament made an effort to increase the commitment appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally, the European Parliament also increased the payment appropriations in the 1999 budget in view of the clear shortfall of one billion in payment appropriations, a shortfall which had appeared, above all, in the Social Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we find ourselves with four supplementary and amending budgets (SABs), with 41 transferrals and a fifth amending budget.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a record. It is also a record that we have taken less than 150 hours to arrive at the first and only reading of this SAB 4.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, we have amending budget no. 1. This does not cause any problem, it is a normal procedure, it is the surplus of the 1998 budget which, normally, is returned to the Member States. But it deserves to be taken into account when we speak of the other amending budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">As for SAB 3, I will leave it to my colleague, Mr Fabra Vallés, to go into more detail. I will turn directly to SAB 4, which proposes 137 million in commitment appropriations for the creation of an Agency for the Reconstruction of Kosovo, for macro-financial aid for the former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia and 30 million in humanitarian aid for Turkey as a result of the earthquake. And, in payment appropriations, aid of 180 million for PHARE, the former Yugoslavia and Kosovo. And, apart from that, 15 posts for OLAF.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, once we have looked at the fact that all the contents of SAB 4 were to be reallocated within category 4, in view of the fact that Parliament and the Council have decided to finance these within title B-1 Agriculture, I will change the subject a little because my problem is not with the SABs. My problem is not the urgency, and is not the fact that we have to provide aid through finance which was not anticipated. I have another pressing problem, Mr President. It is that when I read page 12 of the Spanish version of the preliminary draft supplementary and amending budget no. 4/99, I realise that we are only dealing with the tip of the iceberg. Because here the Commission tells us literally that, despite the fact that we have made this financing effort through reallocation, a further sum of 570.5 million is required, which the Commission intends to reallocate in the global transferral or in a supplementary transferral during this financial year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also recognises that the reallocation of this sum is not yet possible in category 4, but says that an extensive effort should be made to make a reallocation within the budget as a whole. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this terrifies me, because at the end of the financial year of the 1999 budget – to refer to a Spanish proverb – “not even the rapporteur is going to recognise her own budget”.</p>
<p class="contents">With so many reallocations, the most serious matter is the fact that the European Parliament’s own priorities, voted for in December, no longer exist. They have been totally changed because the budgetary authority of Parliament has been undermined by this continuous reallocation. I warn you of this, Mr President, in consideration of the 2000 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">On pages 8 and 12, there is an equally terrifying problem: we have increased the payment appropriations. In this case, the Commission says that even so it is calculated that we are still missing 650.5 million in payment appropriations. Add to this the fact that an SEM 2000 forecast says that the possible shortfall in payment appropriations for the Structural Funds in 1999 is going to be even greater than in 1997 and 1998. Mr President, this “burden of the future” which you talked about years ago in the Committee on Budgets, is now the burden of the present, because I believe that we have ignored your “warning” and we have not been sufficiently strong as a Parliament to prevent this false saving on the part of the Council, which presents a payment budget while carefully forgetting that the commitments have to be fulfilled. This is the plea I would make with regard to the 2000 budget: we must not carry on like this.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur for the 1999 budget, the 2000 budget must – as I see it – anticipate a review of the Financial Perspective. It has been announced and the figures are there. It must include a considerable increase in payment appropriations, not only to prevent the burden from becoming even heavier, but also to prevent the paralysing of payments in the Community’s programmes. I hope that the 1999 budget will serve at least to prevent these mistakes in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The truth is that it appears that you have been doing it all your life. Therefore, congratulations.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the SAB 3/99, Mr President, there are two cases, which are not of that type which we have often criticised in the Committee on Budgets for the use and abuse of the supplementary and amending budgets, but which I believe are well justified cases.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, the Court of Justice, which is going to renew its entire informatics system with regard to word processing. This is totally justifiable, not only because it is currently a system which is not prepared for the “year 2000 effect”, but also because the new system takes into account the compatibility of systems and, what’s more, it is a complicated system which will cover the whole process from the beginning, from the conception of the text up to its publication, without any other system being involved, and I believe this will put the Court of Justice in the best possible position to carry out its work.</p>
<p class="contents">This increase which has been requested in this supplementary and amending budget amounts to EUR 1,675,000 which is not all for equipment, since a proportion – EUR 135,000 – will be dedicated to the training of staff. This is all that would remain in this SAB if it had been taken into account earlier, since we began to speak about it in 1998, but it could not be covered in the 1999 budget without recourse to an SAB. Well, this is due to delays because, firstly, an auditing company which understood the matter had to be used and the best system had to be chosen and also an invitation to tender had to be issued. This has led to the delay and we therefore are faced with this supplementary and amending budget which the Committee on Budgets is fully prepared to grant.</p>
<p class="contents">The second case refers to the Committee of the Regions. We all know that the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee has a common organisational structure, the COS, but that as a result of the Treaty of Amsterdam and its implementation, it was decided that this common organisational structure would be dismantled. Therefore the Committee of the Regions ended up without a financial controller or an accounting officer, and it is very difficult to function without a financial controller or an accounting officer. This is why the Committee of the Regions has requested an A3 as a financial controller, an A5 as an accounting officer and a C5 as a secretary. The Committee on Budgets fully agrees with the Council and believes that we should allow an A4 as financial controller, an A5 as accounting officer and for the moment not allow this C5.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the person responsible for the 2000 budget to bear in mind the needs of the Committee of the Regions and consider whether this post can figure amongst posts included in the 2000 budget for that Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">We have often been a little mean in the granting of staffing increases but it is also true that sometimes we do not allow the institutions to function totally efficiently through a lack of personnel. This is therefore an issue which should be looked into thoroughly.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to end, Mr President, without addressing a few words to the Commissioner, Mr Liikanen, whom I believe to be on his last day in charge of budgets. I can only say two things to him: one, that the task has been difficult and, two, that the result has been good. I would not say very good, but I would say good. You have played your role in the task and how many people would want to do the job you have done? Therefore, I would like to express my thanks and my congratulations.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Böge (PPE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a couple of basic observations regarding this matter of supplementary and amending budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">It is surely correct and necessary to react to urgent and pressing demands relating to financial policy, in particular as prompted by the situations we are faced with in Kosovo and also in Turkey. Nevertheless, one cannot help thinking that we are faced with a certain amount of confusion. Parliament, understandably, given past experiences as well, is always very quick to suspect that conscious redistribution from sections of the budget where funds are still available is actually practised since the budget undoubtedly contains unpopular priorities on the part of Parliament which other institutions do not necessarily remember to transpose.</p>
<p class="contents">The worse thing is actually not supplementary and amending budget no. 4, but the fact that I cannot today make any assessment whatsoever whether we are to end this year with the fifth supplementary budget or whether we will not get to no. 7 by December, for the Commission itself in its working document regarding the setting of borrowing requirements provided very different estimates. It is not possible to estimate what payments may still have to be made to the PHARE programme. Madam rapporteur has already mentioned the 650 million. In this respect, we should all actually feel uneasy. Commissioner, I believe that in order for us to arrive at a well-ordered and rational procedure, it is absolutely necessary that the Commission gets down to clearing–up operations by December, before the second reading, so as to avoid finding ourselves in a similar situation next year to the one we have this year, particularly as the Commission itself is saying that it can certainly not be estimated what payments will be needed for the year 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to set great store by the fact, Commissioner, this being a matter of concern for the Committee on Budgetary Control, that the Commission declares itself ready, in presenting the fifth supplementary and amending budget, to introduce the extra 15 posts called for in the agreement by the Committee on Budgetary Control. As far as we are concerned, this is one of the prerequisites if we are to come to a decision in October.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to establish a connection with tomorrow’s debate, Mr President. Tomorrow, we are discussing and voting on the proposal relating to the Agency for Reconstruction for Kosovo. I would like to make it very clear that we, through the fourth supplementary and amending budget, were spontaneously and quickly in a position to increase the appropriate resources and to make said resources available. But it is also in the interests of the Commission itself that the proposals, both with regard to financial responsibility and as regards the structure of the Agency for Reconstruction, are urgently revised by Parliament, for making the resources available is not in itself sufficient to make the undertaking efficient, transparent and responsible. We will come back to this point tomorrow.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly I saw you sitting there, instead of out here for our budget debate. The one great advantage of that is that because you are there and not here the Socialists now get more speaking time since you would have had speaking time in this debate. The second surprise is to see Commissioner Liikanen, after I praised him yesterday. I was about to welcome Mrs. Schreyer to her first debate and all of a sudden I see him there. The third surprise is the fact that there is no one here from the Council, because this debate is on SABs.</p>
<p class="contents">I say that with a lot of sadness because the Council deserves to be criticised over SAB1 and SAB3. I have said this at a trialogue meeting, we have said it in our committee and I now wish it to go on public record. The way the Council behaved over SAB 1 and 3 was nothing short of disgraceful. It was a slap in the face to this Parliament. For those who do not understand what I am talking about, I am referring to the timing of their submissions for both the supplementary and amending budgets, which meant that we would not have the chance to debate them in full. We will vote on them this week but it will be to all intents and purposes a formality. I hope it does not happen again. If I thought they were going to do the same thing next year, i.e. submit an SAB at the end of July, I would not hesitate to call a special meeting of the Budgets Committee within the 45-day timetable to make sure that we blocked it so that we could discuss it in full. It did nothing for the trust that we are trying to build up between the two institutions. It just led to antagonism and suspicion.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said all that, when it comes to SAB4 the speed with which the institutions have worked has been quite commendable. The Council took on board what we were asking and got it through within a week and tomorrow we will be voting on SAB4. This is indeed encouraging. We welcome the cooperation that has gone on in SAB4. We welcome the use of category 1 funds for external expenditure and we welcome that speed. However, two things need to be said about SAB4. One is that the 15 extra posts for OLAF are there, which we accept, but we need to stress that there has to be an SAB5. SAB5 should be imminent because of the Commission’s needs for payments but within the resolution that we will vote on we will insist on an SAB5 and an extra 15 posts for OLAF. This is a political decision which the committee and the Budget Control Committee have to make and the message that therefore needs to be taken to Mrs Schreyer, if not from you, Commissioner, then at least from the Commission services, is that we would want an early meeting with Mrs Schreyer to talk about the contents of an SAB5 to be placed before Parliament as soon as possible and, more importantly, to include the extra staff for OLAF.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It shows that Parliament and its Committee on Budgets show real responsibility for the European Union economy and, in addition, real responsibility for the development of different policies and adjusting promptly to prevailing circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">Budgets 1 and 3 are mainly technical; they concern a surplus and certain computer-related purchases. The most interesting additional budget is number 4 which channels significant sums in respect of reconstruction and humanitarian aid to the Balkans – Kosovo and Macedonia – and aid to Turkey. Putting this fund together was a significant challenge to EU credibility and the fact that they were dealt with by the Committee on Budgets leading to amendments being made shows just how great that responsibility is.</p>
<p class="contents">I would particularly like to stress that when reconstruction in Kosovo gets under way, the procedure must be simple and clear, with regard also to the administration of funds and the share of responsibility. For this reason, the agency responsible for reconstruction should not be split up into two separate areas, but must be in one place, and it should be independent with sufficient authority to take decisions. Otherwise, the management of funds will be time-consuming and will lead to a situation in which the impact of aid is weakened. For this reason, when tomorrow we debate and decide on this issue, the Agency for Reconstruction should be set up in Pristina, and it should on no account be associated with the agency that monitors the Stability Pact at Thessaloniki. </p>
<p class="contents">On other matters I would say that the questions raised by Mr Fabra Vallés on arrangements regarding appointments can surely be dealt with at the next debate on the budget.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This newcomer had to make up her mind on the matter based on this little piece of paper. It seems to me that that is not an exercise to be repeated.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal provides for the reallocation of commitment appropriations to the value of EUR 137 million, 30 million of which is for Turkey, largely for relief action in the form of temporary accommodation now that winter is on its way, emergency aid in other words. Yet only 15 million in payment appropriations is being reserved, and under certain conditions at that. Therefore, we can expect another amending budget soon. Otherwise, companies and organisations are going to have to wait rather a long time before they are paid. There will have to be another amending budget for Kosovo, too. 30 million is now being released in payment appropriations, but we need 50 million. Plugging holes and robbing Peter to pay Paul creates a lack of transparency in relation to the budget and also compromises budgetary authority, a point clearly made by Mrs Dührkop Dührkop.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the content of amending budget 4, the original proposal provided for a reduction in the amount spent on co-operation with Latin America and Asia. This was certainly unacceptable as far as we were concerned. What we want is to see that this money is actually spent, and to see the Commission do its best, put its shoulder to the wheel, create the posts and ensure that the money is indeed spent on those things that the budgetary authority intended it to be spent on.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group welcomes the fact that, as Mr Wynne said, the Council has certainly been quick to take up the Committee on Budgets’ idea and to look into the agricultural guarantee fund’s underspending.</p>
<p class="contents">But soon, when the time comes to deal with Budget 2000, the same discussion will start up again. Once again, the Council and Parliament will have to reach agreement on expenditure on external activities, and the reconstruction of Kosovo will feature here again, too. It is likely, under these circumstances, that the Council will place the money set aside for co-operation with Latin America, Asia and Africa, in jeopardy for good. Cutbacks are also being made in spending on projects for furthering the peace process in the Middle East, and on projects for reintegrating demoralised soldiers and refugees into society. The support for NGOs is on the decline. I want to take the opportunity now to say that the Green Group will not support this.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, some of the 500 million needed for the reconstruction of Kosovo will be borne by those countries for which the European Union is providing development assistance. We do not believe that to be fair. The Green Group does not support the short-sighted slogan: “I want my money back”. We want to ensure that the people of Europe get value for their money, and we are quite prepared to discuss making cutbacks in, or abolishing, aid programmes that are not going well. But the 10% linear reduction, the drip-feed method, shows that there has been no serious weighing up of priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Kosovo is a special case. Even at the time when the Financial Perspective was being discussed, people said that it would probably be necessary to increase spending in category 4 for the purposes of the reconstruction work there. I think we are indeed going to have to lay the Interinstitutional Agreement on the table for a short and limited period of time. In view of this discussion, I would like to remind you that one of the matters we are dealing with this week concerns actually giving back 1.6 billion in payment appropriations to the Member States. Surely it would not be an insurmountable problem to devote part of that surplus to Kosovo.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Greek version did not reach us until just an hour ago, and I believe that it is something that we must pay particular attention to. I understand that it may have been due to the urgency of the procedure, but we are a new Parliament, we are just starting out, and I believe that some principles and procedural mechanisms must be upheld. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to make two comments on the amending and supplementary budget 4/99 and I believe that the matter should be discussed with a representative of the Council. We see various activities: for example, we have been informed that the Yugoslav Opposition is organising conferences and demonstrations in Brussels. My question concerns how these activities are being funded. These Parliament-approved appropriations are reserved solely for Yugoslavia for strictly humanitarian action, but on what political criteria do the Commission and the Council of Ministers base their decisions as to when and how they should be used? Other fundamental issues, however, such as the continuing phenomenon of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, directed against the Serbian, Gypsy and Turkish communities, are not being addressed at all. </p>
<p class="contents">The second point I would like to make concerns the EUR 30 million which is being given to Turkey as humanitarian aid. It is a sound move, a positive act, as is the involvement of the European Investment Bank and the use of other programmes. However, we must not forget the principles laid down by Parliament as regards relations with Turkey and which the Turkish Government should be taking into consideration. We saw no signs of this in the meeting two days ago with the Turkish Foreign Minister.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Both the reconstruction of Kosovo and the provision of humanitarian aid to north-west Turkey must be undertaken without delay in view of the disasters that have taken place in those regions, and it is the European Union’s moral duty to provide the financial means for doing so. Hence the resolution put forward by Mrs Dührkop Dührkop and Mr Fabra Vallés deserves all our support. Amending it will lead to unwelcome delay.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we have a problem with certain aspects of the package. For example, we are not at all happy that the extra appropriations for Kosovo, Turkey and the Republic of Macedonia are to be financed in full by appropriations from category 1, agricultural expenditure. That is at odds with the spirit of the Financial Perspective. Additional appropriation requirements should, in the first instance, be met by making economies in programmes which come under the same budgetary heading, i.e. category 4 in this case. Initially, the Commission took this line as well, but came to abandon it under pressure from the Committee on Budgets, even though there is a great deal of scope for making economies within category 4. The MEDA programme, among others, comes to mind here. This programme’s low rate of utilisation gives cause for concern. At the beginning of September, only 24% of the payment appropriations for 1999 had been spent. Given this fact, it would surely be appropriate to reallocate this money.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear from the current state of affairs as regards these payment appropriations in category 4 that a thorough and on-going discussion between the Commission, the Council and Parliament needs to get underway. How is it that practically all the payment appropriations for 1999 for programmes such as TACIS and the programmes for former Yugoslavia have been used up now, when this is by no means the case as far as MEDA is concerned? Can it be put down to poor administration on the part of the Commission? Or, and I suspect this to be the more likely scenario, does the budgetary authority fail to take adequate account of the actual appropriation requirements and absorption capacity of the various programmes when it adopts the budget? Bearing in mind that we are due to embark on the budgetary procedure for 2000, this must be resolved as soon as possible. One of the new Commission’s first challenges.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a new Member of Parliament and of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I discovered relatively quickly that the organisational arrangements and support offered to new Members are distinctly lacking. In order to be able to vote “yes” or “no” in the Committee on Budgetary Control, I would have to familiarise myself with several years’ worth of Budgets of the European Union in a few days, and this without the support of this Chamber. I could not do this, of course. I am basically an optimist and believe that it is very feasible to familiarise oneself with this subject matter, although I am conscious of the interventions of several Members, the gist of which is that in the Committee matters are handled like in a cattle market, where funds are passed back and forth, and that documents are, to some extent, prepared worse than in a good many municipal councils.</p>
<p class="contents">I would propose, however, that, in future, new members are quickly provided with the necessary information and training which will allow them to carry out their duties in the respective Committee and participate in voting.
