<p class="contents">Consensus is also important because that way it is easier for us to influence the decision-makers in Russia. As now these are particularly urgent matters, we Social Democrats wanted just to focus on this issue covered in the statement. The issue is also an urgent one for the Duma, which will return to the matter in five days’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">In the next parliamentary sitting we will be debating the resolution on Chechnya. We fully agree with Russia’s human rights ombudsman Vladimir Lukin that the draft law goes against Russia’s own constitution. It also goes against international law. I hope that Lukin’s opinion carries weight, because he has chaired the European Parliament-Duma joint delegation for many years.</p>
<p class="contents">The freedom of NGOs to operate is an essential part of democracy and stable civil society, which the Russian leadership had said it supports. As a member of the Council of Europe, Russia has committed itself to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and, for example, its plans to restrict freedom of association conflicts with that totally. Parliament is worried about recent developments in Russia, and now the Duma has an excellent opportunity to contribute to the development of democracy. It can show that changes can be made. Obviously we hope that that will be the case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Khodorkovsky and Lebedev are being held, contrary to Russian law, in prison camps in Siberia, a long way from Moscow and north of the Arctic Circle, in temperatures of - 50°. Lebedev is seriously ill. Contact with their family members and lawyers has been made extremely difficult; they have no access to information and are not allowed newspapers. Their defence counsel, Yevgeni Baro and Yuri Schmit, are themselves facing trial next week on a charge of defamation. The Russian justice system’s denial of human rights is made all the worse by the ever-tighter restrictions placed on the freedom of the press. We should be clear in our own minds as to what is going on here and call upon the Council and the Commission to use their influence on Russia to get human rights respected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, there are still a number of areas where progress is much needed in this vast country, with its very long and unique history and culture, and it must be encouraged to proceed with the outstanding issues, where reform is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Such an issue is that of NGO legislation. It is a well accepted fact that NGOs and non-profit-making organisations are often key to developing a strong and well functioning civil society. Such organisations, ranging from children's charities to consumer groups, are not present in very large numbers in Russia. It is, of course, a fact that Russia has suffered severely from terrorism in the last few years and public sentiment, expressed through elected representatives, may, when dealing with certain NGOs, especially those in Chechnya, border on the extreme and tend to be unduly legalistic and severe.</p>
<p class="contents">Although this may be understandable under certain circumstances, it is not acceptable in terms of proper respect of human rights. We therefore call on the Russian Duma to listen to our advice and take the necessary time to review and impose the amendments concerned with the legislation, in the light of the recommendations expressed in the Presidential review, the Council of Europe provisional opinion and this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its economy now resembles America’s to a greater degree. The discrepancies between rich and poor that have come about as a result are now more pronounced than in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In the areas of democracy and human rights, the situation is certainly no better than it was in the final years of the Soviet Union under Mr Gorbachev’s leadership, and the oppression in Chechnya outstrips the crimes of Stalin. Where democracy and human rights are concerned, Russia is continuing a bad tradition. It is not so much Russia that has changed, as the perception of that nation in the countries of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Before, we in Western Europe saw the East, under the leadership of the Soviet Union, as an economic rival and military opponent. These days, we consider Russia to be an ally and supplier of energy. According to the former German Chancellor, who is now on Russia’s payroll, Russia now boasts a flawless democracy. In those circumstances, it hardly comes as a surprise that there is increasingly less room for independent television stations and that freedom of association and assembly is being curbed.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens are given less and less opportunity to get involved in government policy. The return to a blemished past is hastened by a law that places non-commercial organisations of citizens under government control and that has the power to suspend their funding and to dissolve them. This House therefore has every reason to endorse the criticism made by the Council of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It currently enjoys privileges, such as the PCA Agreement, a strategic partnership based on the Four Common Spaces Agreement, and eventual ENPI and EIB funding benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia continues to be a democracy, albeit an imperfect one. However, for some time now, concerns have been expressed that the Kremlin and the <span class="italic">siloviki</span>, so-called men of power close to President Putin, have been attempting to restrict freedom of the media and NGOs, in particular, where it was felt that they were interfering with Russian strategic interests, such as the bloody conflict in Chechnya, or the strategy of reversing some of the controversial sell-offs of the oil and gas sector in the early 1990s in order to increase the patronage of the state.</p>
<p class="contents">A handful of men, such as Khodorkovsky, benefited enormously. He was convicted of several criminal offences and had his extensive Yukos holdings renationalised. His controversial trial followed with accusations internationally of political manipulation of the judicial system. More recently, on 23 November, the Duma approved the law restricting freedom of association and the ability of foreign NGOs to operate in Russia by imposing fiscal and residency requirements of registration, which the Council of Europe, in a provisional opinion, has seriously questioned as incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">However, much to his credit, President Putin has listened to the objections and asked to rewrite aspects of the bill which infringe fundamental human rights and which are not legitimately necessary to fight terrorism, as was mentioned in Chechnya in particular, and money laundering.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope reason prevails. We all wish to see a democratic, European Russia with whom we can all share fundamental common values of basic human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is often the case in these debates that we take up the cudgels against small-time dictators and neglect to address the human rights situation in major states that are of strategic and economic importance to us. I am glad that we are, today, spelling out how things stand in China and Russia, for if we do not, we run the risk of our economic dependency on them – for it is a regrettable fact that we are economically dependent on them in some areas – causing us to take a one-sided view of human rights or making us blind to the issues at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">For years on end, the German Government minimised the importance of such things as the war in Chechnya or the smothering of human rights in Russia, or even passed over them in silence, and when you see the position that the former German Chancellor, Mr Schröder, has now taken on, you can quickly understand why they did so. We must take care that Gasprom, the partly state-owned Russian energy giant, does not start to play the sort of role once played by the United Fruit Company in Latin America. While we must cooperate economically and politically, we must not mince words when telling what is really going on as regards human rights. I am thinking here not only of the prisoners languishing under unspeakable conditions in Siberia, about whom Mr Horáček has had something to say, but also of the attempt at silencing independent organisations – NGOs, in other words – as successfully as the Russian media already have been. I am very much obliged to Mr Deß for seeing to it that we end up using more renewable energies, for Europe’s dependency on Russian energy is bringing us to the point where we start keeping our mouths shut about things that must not be hushed up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The public prosecutor’s office and the judiciary in this country are increasingly being used as political weapons by President Putin’s regime.</p>
<p class="contents">On 9 December 2005, the Russian public prosecutor’s office charged the Neftyanoi Bank with money-laundering and tax fraud. The Bank’s director, Boris Nemtsov, is one of Russia’s most able liberal politicians, and a key member of the anti-Putin opposition. This is particularly significant in view of the forthcoming presidential elections, which will be held in 2008 and which will determine the future of democracy in Russia. In a statement given to my party’s headquarters for its November 2005 newsletter, Mr Nemtsov said that there was a risk that a state-controlled and monopolistic capitalism could be established in Russia. He also expressed his belief that the country is currently undergoing a process of, and I quote, ‘Lukashenkisation’.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union should waive the requirement for Russian citizens to hold visas before they can enter EU Member States. The abolition of visas would serve as a guarantee for Russian civil society that the country will become more democratic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Except in Russia, where people or groups, business people and journalists that are too critical of the Kremlin’s and Putin’s policy are gagged. To top it all, the Russian authorities now also intend to silence domestic and foreign NGOs.</p>

This is the main thrust of the resolution, which is a response to new rules according to which it will no longer be possible in future to bring any amount of money into the country provided that it is used to support the development of civil society. The second reason for the resolution is the influence exerted by the government over the majority of media outlets.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that the Duma will soon adopt a similar resolution on the European Union. Freedom, and consequently democracy, are after all also under threat here following the adoption of a proposal for the mandatory retention of telephone calls, text messages and emails for the police. In Italy, Prime Minister Berlusconi controls a decisive share of the television market, and indeed of the media market in general. Foreign owners clearly dominate the media in the Czech Republic, where 80% of the press is in the hands of two German groups. This constitutes a clear threat to the freedom of information, and the situation is similar in Poland and the Balkan States. Is no one in the House concerned in the slightest by this state of affairs? It is my belief that this House will unanimously reject this motion for a resolution once it has given a small amount of thought to the matter. If it does not, our electorate’s opinion of us will be far from flattering. Unless, of course, Members of this House have drafted a motion for a resolution condemning media monopolies in EU Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is particularly regrettable as we spent a great deal of time debating Tunisia on Wednesday, when all the Members of the House and the media were present.</p>
<p class="contents">Freedom of speech and thought is one of the European Union’s fundamental values, and it is the cornerstone of democracy. This is reflected in the activities of the hundreds of thousands of NGOs that constitute the third most powerful and influential force in Europe. Yet it is an unfortunate fact that laws are being adopted in Russia which are alien and incomprehensible to us in Europe. Russia is moving ever further away from democratic standards, and we cannot stand idly by and watch fundamental rights being denied in a country that has a privileged relationship with the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot remain indifferent in the face of changes that are so blatantly undemocratic. Russian NGOs will find it more difficult or even impossible to obtain foreign funding. The new restrictions will apply to as many as 450 000 organisations in Russia, including foreign and international organisations operating in the Russian Federation. The new law prohibits the activities carried out in line with the rules previously in force by Russian branches and representations of foreign and international organisations. What this means is that they will have to shut down their current branches, and submit applications to set up new organisations that will be independent of the parent NGOs. Foreigners who do not have permanent residency in Russia will lose the right to form civil organisations, as well as the right to sit on the boards or be members of such organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain Russian politicians have claimed that NGOs are a tool used by third countries to conduct foreign policy in Russia, but these arguments are absurd and make a mockery of the concept of democracy. The European Union should make known its strong opposition to such a reprehensible attitude, which is symptomatic of the increase in xenophobia among Russia’s political elite. The existence of 450 000 NGOs in Russia, and the fact that they are so active, testify to the popularity of this aspect of public and social life in Russia. The European Union should support this manifestation of civil society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Here is a concrete example: the widely known and regular violation of human rights in Belarus and Russia. Russia, furthermore, is engaged in the genocide of a nation, which is something that is not happening even in Belarus. Nevertheless, the Council and the Commission treat the two States completely differently. The doors to European Union States have been slammed in Lukashenka’s face, yet President Putin is welcomed with open arms. If these double standards are only being applied because of Russia’s oil and gas, resources that Belarus does not have, then such a policy is immoral, although the European Union is supposed to be the standard-bearer of human rights, as well as moral policy. I do not believe that the Council and the Commission are unaware of the principles of moral policy; however, these principles should not be sold for oil and gas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What happens in Russia is in our interests; its interests are our interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, the clock in Russia is now being turned back nearly to Soviet times. There is, at the moment, no independent judiciary, there is no free television, and the political opposition has been totally marginalised. I will not even talk about what is happening in Chechnya; human life is very cheap there. Regarding NGOs, what happens to them is another link in this far too long chain of sad events in Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot be the victim of the ‘NIMBY’ syndrome: not in my back yard. Indeed, it is all in our back yard. It concerns us all. Old habits die very hard in the Soviet Union, but we have to help Russia to come back towards democracy and universal values. First of all, it is in the interests of the Russian people: they deserve liberty, democracy and transparent governance. We also cannot work with a partner who does not adhere to international rules. We have to help Russia become a confident nation which sees that there is no conflict between strength and a democratic, thriving civil society. We have to speak with one voice; otherwise, we reduce our position to something insignificant. We cannot have a good Christmas, we cannot have a good conscience, if we do not see what is happening to our near neighbour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an undeniable fact that organisations known as NGOs and MPOs have a vital role in our civil society, both in large countries such as Russia, as well as in small countries such as where I come from. In Russia, the number of the many organisations which exist is around seventy thousand. Less than three weeks ago the parliament known as the State Duma passed some amendments, through the first reading, which had an impact on these organisations. One must appreciate the thought both within Russia as well as outside Russia about these amendments which can have an impact on human rights. However, one must mention that in certain countries there was a small number of these organisations which were abused for illicit and illegal aims. On the other hand, the amendments proposed by Russia have a negative impact on those organisations known as ‘buona fide’. On a positive note, the Council of Europe was asked for guidance and even the President of this country, Putin, made some proposals to the new chairman. To conclude, I would like to say that the solution is not to place these organisations in the same category, but to have the necessary legal tools within the parameters of the European Convention so that those which are not genuine will be identified.

There are a number of issues which give us cause for concern and which we raise regularly with Russia within the framework of the existing strategic partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me begin with Chechnya. We were glad that the elections took place there on 27 November, and that they took place without violence. Given the troubled history of this region that in itself is an achievement. We hope they will be a step in the process towards peaceful democracy there. However, there are a number of reports of irregularities, and we expect that these will be properly investigated.</p>
<p class="contents">But much more needs to be done if Chechnya is to progress to democratic stability. Although there appears to have been an improvement in the security situation, a culture of impunity remains. It is essential that the authorities fully investigate cases of disappearances and allegations of torture and bring the perpetrators, including members of the law enforcement authorities, to justice. Russia should also implement its expressed willingness to cooperate with United Nations human rights mechanisms, including the High Commissioner for Human Rights and UN Special Rapporteurs. It is also important that the local ombudsman in Chechnya is seen to be carrying out his duties impartially and effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also express our concern at the evidence of continuing harassment of NGOs including those receiving support from the European Community, such as the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society in Nizhny Novgorod. This also affects NGOs delivering humanitarian assistance under the ECHO programme.</p>
<p class="contents">In that context, I should draw attention to the proposal for amending Russian legislation on NGOs which is currently before the Duma. We have been concerned that it could make the operations of many NGOs, especially foreign ones, more difficult, and could therefore potentially jeopardise the Commission’s efforts to help build up civil society in Russia, as well as our humanitarian aid programme in Chechnya. The amendments have been presented as necessary to enforce Russia’s right to protect itself from terrorism. Of course, we respect that right, but action taken must be proportionate and must respect international commitments regarding civil society, notably those relating to the OSCE and the Council of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner raised these concerns with Foreign Minister Lavrov during the Russian Government’s visit to Brussels on 7 December. He expressed understanding and said that amendments would be made to the bill to address these issues. We were, therefore, pleased to note that changes to the draft law have now been sent from the presidential administration to the Duma and welcome the prior consultations held with the Council of Europe on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we remain concerned that the present draft law could still lead to constraints on the legitimate activities of NGOs. We urge the Russian Parliament, therefore, to use the second reading on 21 December to take the Council of Europe’s opinion fully into account. We will continue to follow this matter closely, including the implementation of any new law adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me say that we want to address these issues in a spirit of cooperation with Russia. The EU-Russia human rights consultations, which began this year, are now a regular feature of our dialogue and provide an opportunity for frank and open exchanges. In addition the Commission, as well as being the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to the North Caucasus through ECHO, has agreed a EUR 20 million programme for socio-economic recovery there – a clear indication of our willingness to be actively involved in the process of strengthening democracy and stability in the region. We will continue to take all opportunities to contribute constructively to that process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
