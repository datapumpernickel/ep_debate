My general view is that such a broad-based compromise, that has the support of the four largest groups in this House, should not be called into question again by amendments. However, assuming that the compromise – and I would once again like to express my sincere thanks to all those involved in achieving it – remains unchanged in other respects, I would ask you to vote for Amendment No 1 tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, because it includes a sensible addition.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I must reject Amendments Nos 2 and 3, because in terms of content they would have too great an impact on the overall compromise. I also have to reject Amendment No 5. I think that it is legally unacceptable, because it sets aside the clear provisions of Rule 161 of our own Rules of Procedure. The amendment is essentially about a vote on the explanatory statement in my report. As far as I know this would set a precedent which every Member of this House would be justified in referring to in future.</p>
<p class="contents">The President has accepted Amendment No 5, and out of respect for the authority of her position, I accept this decision.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Last Monday we did indeed have a wide-ranging discussion in the Committee on Budgetary Control on the admissibility of this question, and on whether, as chair of the committee, I should make use of Rule 161. Almost every member of the committee spoke on this. I myself have several times looked into the connection between the resolution, as it now appears in the compromise, and the explanatory statement, which reflects the rapporteur’s position and is her responsibility. I established the connection, and I said in the clearest terms that the language in the explanatory statement before us is very harsh. Nevertheless, I do not think I should comment on the style and choice of words in a censorious way, because I would then have to do the same for every explanatory statement. As I see it, there is a factual connection and I therefore decided not to reject this explanatory statement and informed the committee accordingly.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was struck by the contradiction in tone between the explanatory statement and the content of the resolution. They are radically different. That is why I tabled this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I think you are right, Madam President, to declare it admissible because the vote this amendment involves is not a vote for or against the explanatory statement, but is simply intended to highlight the distance between that explanatory statement and the resolution. </p>

<p class="contents">Our Group supports this compromise amendment with, however, the exception of one word: <span class="italic">"plus"</span> – "<span class="italic">plus proportionnelle"</span>. Presumably the English version is "more proportional". We cannot accept that word. However, under the Rules, it is not possible to ask for a split vote on a compromise amendment. I note that if Amendments Nos 100 and 101 were both to be adopted, it would come to exactly the same text as this compromise amendment, except for the problematic word "more". As I know that colleagues in other groups had exactly the same problem with this word, I would suggest to friends and colleagues that it might be appropriate not to accept the compromise amendment but to vote instead in favour of both Amendments Nos 100 and 101, which are compatible, and that would achieve precisely the result desired by many people.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By way of explanation, consider the following quotes:</p>
<p class="contents">"One might conclude that the Commission had decided in some fields to draw a veil over and forget past events. The Commission has sought to distract the public attention from unresolved internal problems in the present by making glib and bombastic promises for the future."</p>
<p class="contents">"The Commission apparatus which wielded excessive power even under President Santer has now become even more powerful; moreover it is all too often dominated by coteries".</p>
<p class="contents">By any standards these comments are excessive, unfair and, in the context of the discharge procedure, wholly unsuitable.</p>
<p class="contents">On the final vote on the resolution we were faced with three choices today: to vote in favour, to vote against or to abstain. We chose to abstain and this requires explanation. To vote in favour of the Stauner report is to vote for postponement of granting discharge which, all things considered, we believe should be granted now. As we explained in the Budgetary Control Committee, our preference was to vote "yes" to reform but "no" to visiting on this Commission the sins of its predecessors.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Liberal Group we have been consistently in favour of many of the elements in the Stauner report such as access to documents – it is a duty of the current Commission to provide access to documents. But the political question remains – is this the moment and is this the issue for an apparent public stand off between Parliament and the Prodi Commission? We think not.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not vote in favour of the report it is because we want to indicate a preference to do business on reform now rather than later because we believe, on the evidence to date, that this Commission is a reformist Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Voting against the report would merely have the effect of sending the report back to the Budgetary Control Committee without a clear expression of what happens next and by what means. We are against such an approach.</p>
<p class="contents">So we have chosen to abstain. This is a motivated abstention rather than an indifferent one. Our Group preference was to have voted to grant discharge while promoting reform which we accept is also the view of the European Commission. Unfortunately, today's choice did not allow for such an option and so we have chosen to abstain.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This resolution reflected the desire of the majority of members of the Committee on Budgetary Control to break the deadlock over Mrs Stauner’s proposed report in the committee, but also in the European Parliament, which was putting our institution’s relations with the Commission onto a defiant footing.</p>
<p class="contents">The French Socialist delegation is glad a majority was achieved to pass Amendment No 5 highlighting the slippage between the resolution put to the vote and the explanatory statement. By that vote, Members have reaffirmed that only the rapporteur is responsible for the explanatory statement.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed report Mrs Stauner submitted to the Committee on Budgetary Control caused consternation far beyond the members of the committee itself. Indeed, the proposed document bore little relation to the discharge procedure, which is about approval of the accounts for the financial year and the propriety of the expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution put to the vote in Parliament today presents a catalogue of reasonable demands and recommendations to the Commission. The postponement and the response time given to the Commission allow it to answer the questions from the Committee on Budgetary Control within the set time. They leave the Committee on Budgetary Control sufficient time to prepare a report which will rule effectively on the implementation of the 1998 budget by the Commission.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report does not focus on the Commission’s actions during 1998, to which the discharge relates, pursuant to Article 205a and Article 206 of the Treaty and Article 89(5) of the Financial Regulation, but is lingering over alleged cases of fraud, most of which occurred in the early nineties during the terms of previous Commissions. </p>
<p class="contents">The Prodi Commission has undertaken a vast reform, which is necessary in order to modernise the European civil service and to reorganise its structures in preparation for the many challenges which it will have to face over the next few years. We, too, are convinced that reform of the budgetary control and programme management procedures is essential, for these systems have proved to be inadequate. Indeed, it is necessary to ensure not only that past cases of fraud cannot be repeated, but also, and above all, that the level of management errors identified by the Court of Auditors in its annual report is greatly reduced. </p>
<p class="contents">In any case, it is not by attempting without fresh proof to reopen disciplinary proceedings which have now been concluded that we will achieve a thorough, effective reform of the Commission. It should be recalled that 80% of Community funds are managed at national level, and improving the financial management of the European Union budget could not therefore be contemplated without the cooperation of the Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we fear that behind this unjustified vicious attack lies an attempt to use such incidents to undermine and sabotage not just Commission actions but the work of the European institutions in general. We cannot therefore support the perpetrators of these schemes, and, for this reason, we voted against the report.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is clear. The overall message that we are giving to the IGC is that this Parliament wants the IGC to be ambitious, to think long term and not short term and to address all the issues that need to be addressed if a Union of nearly 30 Member States is to be able to function effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">We have put a large number of suggestions on the table. Clearly, not all of them will be taken up in the form which this Parliament has advocated. But we know that. We think it is right that the IGC should look at these issues, look at them seriously and come up with appropriate solutions that will enable the Union to work.</p>
<p class="contents">My Group, as you know and as Barón Crespo has just said, has some reservations on particular points. They relate, in particular, to the composition of this Parliament, where unfortunately attempts to reach a compromise position fell down at the last minute. We must come back to this issue and put forward a proper proposal on a matter which is of direct concern to this House. I am confident that we can do that. We were very near to a compromise agreement. We should be able to crack this one.</p>

We find three points in this report particularly harmful. </p>
<p class="contents">The first is the federalisation of the institutions, by making qualified majority voting in the Council and codecision with the European Parliament the general rule, introducing transnational European elections, and strengthening the powers of the Commission in an attempt to turn it into a European Government. The necessary but unacknowledged counterpart of all these measures is the marginalisation of the national democracies. </p>
<p class="contents">The second is making a constitution out of the Treaties and adding a restrictive European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights, gradually subjecting the peoples to texts which go far beyond them and which will be imposed on them, without any of them, individually, being able to escape that.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the totalitarian drift of so-called European democracy, with the introduction of mechanisms, in particular making the application of Article 7 of the EU Treaty more flexible so that a Member State can be suspended, mechanisms, then, which will give a handful of leaders authority to operate a thought police across the continent, even against peoples expressing themselves democratically, as in Austria. </p>
<p class="contents">One of the most controversial points that arose during the debate was the contradiction between the anticipated proliferation of Members of the European Parliament because of enlargement, and the ceiling of 700 Members the Treaty of Amsterdam has imposed on our Parliament. That limit was chosen to make the European Parliament resemble a national one, but all it does today is set the countries against each other, as none of them will accept a reduction in its quota of Members, and that is understandable.</p>
<p class="contents">The Europe of Nations Group proposes putting an end to these conflicts by breaking through the ceiling of 700 Members. Why not a European Parliament of 1000 Members? It could work in variable geometry formations and its originality would have a powerful impact on the imagination.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We form part of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, but by taking this position we wanted to express our disillusionment over what is being discussed here today. This agenda is, of course, too restricted. Europe is very ambitious when it comes to enlargement, which is a good thing, but it is not ambitious enough to provide a real democratic structure that emanates from the regions and the people. We regret that all amendments that serve to incorporate this dimension into Europe have been rejected. We have had to conclude that, contrary to our expectations, the power of the large states will increase and the power of the European Parliament and the possibility of our regions being represented within it, will decrease. We therefore hope that the IGC will prove successful in getting vigorous reform under way.

<p class="contents">First of all, it is not, as many perhaps believe, federalism which is now a salient feature of Parliament’s attitude but, rather, centralism. It is the big States which are obtaining more power, those and the central institutions. There is no trace of decentralisation and the redistribution of power and no sign of any substance being given to the subsidiarity principle. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, no adjustments are being made in anticipation of enlargement, which is perhaps the most serious feature of all. If a Union of 28 Member States is to be successful, it must obviously have a flexible structure. There must be clear definitions of powers in regard to what is to be decided centrally, what is to be decided in the Member States and what can be decided at regional level. There is nothing of this, however. If such a large Union is to be a real success, a large proportion of the decisions now made centrally must clearly be decentralised to a lower level. Otherwise, the whole system will implode. </p>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, my Green colleagues deemed these amendments unnecessary, which raises the question whether the Greens are changing their policy on nuclear weapons and on the arms industries. I voted against the report itself, because I feel that more centralisation means less safety for smaller Member States, less democracy, less involvement of people at a local and national level. This is not in the interest of the ordinary people of Europe. A new constitution for Europe that overrides national constitutions, a legal personality for the European Union and, of course, more militarisation: this is not the kind of Europe I want.

It laid down that elections to the European Parliament should be held as soon as possible using the same lists of candidates in all 15 Member States, that is to say genuinely European lists. I feel that this amendment is based on a point which brings the citizens much closer to Europe and the European Union: the citizens who are called on to vote realise that the candidates are the same throughout the 15 States, and this would show them that Europe does exist and that there is a reason for its existence.

The Dimitrakopoulos report does not go far enough for me in terms of EU federalisation and integration. I believe that we should go much further, and move more determinedly, towards federalisation and away from nation states, towards the regions and the peoples of Europe. I hope, even if the omens for this Intergovernmental Conference are not the best, that there may still be an opening here or there.</p>

It was difficult for me to support the resolution because it mixes the worst in with the best. On the other hand, I did not want to vote against a resolution which probably represents the best the European Parliament can do at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The obvious conclusion seems to me that Parliament itself still has a long way to go to meet the profound aspirations of the majority of European Union citizens. Moreover, the rejection of two compromise amendments during the sitting bears witness to the difficulty of finding representative majorities, as does the rejection or acceptance, by the narrowest of margins, of institutional measures of the highest importance.</p>
<p class="contents">To take just one example, Parliament was only able to maintain a compromise on the composition of the Commission with difficulty, but truth obliges me to state that the compromise incorporates two contradictory ideas. We have passed a resolution actually stating that the number of members of the Commission should be limited, as long as it is not. Is that really a very sensible position for a Parliament to take?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We consider that in insisting on a broad agenda, the European Parliament is not facilitating what should be the main task of the IGC, namely that of resolving the outstanding institutional problems regarding the composition and voting rules of the Council, the Commission, the European Parliament, the Court of Justice and the other institutions, and so making enlargement possible. The European Parliament ought instead to take up the important task of ensuring that the essential issues which need to be resolved are debated in such a way that Europe’s citizens are involved and can form their own views on the important subjects being debated. The EU should build on a common political will to achieve the overriding objectives relating to peace, the environment and prosperity in Europe, focusing on the interests of its citizens. The debate in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which adopted the draft report with a very small majority, plus the fact that more than 200 amendments have been tabled for consideration in plenary, show that this report cannot contribute to creating a common basis for the IGC. Despite the fact that we do not consider that the European Parliament should propose all these amendments to the Treaty, we have elected to adopt positions on the individual points, as will be evident from our voting. However, we would like to draw particular attention to the points which we think the IGC should concentrate on.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the composition of the European Parliament, we have voted for calculation of the number of Members from each Member State according to a sliding scale so that the European Parliament’s composition reflects the size of the individual States, populations as well as the fact that there are benefits to be had from making the European Parliament more representative by enabling the different political viewpoints in the individual countries to be represented there. As regards the composition of the Commission, it is important that all States have the right to a Commissioner with the same rights and obligations, particularly as in our opinion, the Commission must continue to enjoy the right of initiative. When it comes to the voting rules in the Council, we consider that a balance must be maintained between the interests of the small and large states. This can be achieved by laying down requirements for a certain number of votes in the Council which must, at the same time, represent a simple majority of the total population of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We are open to discussing increased use of qualified majority voting, although we do not consider that it should be the rule. Each particular instance of a transition to qualified majority voting must, however, be analysed and debated thoroughly and a balance struck between what is fundamental as far as the individual Member States are concerned and the need to make cooperation work. It is especially important that this matter be discussed on an on-going basis with Europe’s citizens. All Member States must demonstrate the political will to make cooperation work. It is this will and the desire for common solutions which the EU must also build on in future. We are not, therefore, worried that, following enlargement, the EU will be paralysed unless a thorough reform of the Treaty is carried out now. In parallel with the IGC, the Member States are discussing a common European security and defence policy. These discussions are far from complete, and we do not think that the European Parliament should table amendments to the Treaty before the outcome is known. We continue to believe that the EU should not be an actual defence alliance. In this area, the EU must focus in particular on conflict prevention and civil crisis management. Also in parallel with the IGC, the creation of a Charter of Fundamental Rights is being debated. We would like once again to stress that we want a charter in the form of a political document and that it should not be raised at the IGC with a view to incorporating it into the Treaty.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The building of Europe is today, more than ever, essential for peace and progress not only in Europe, but also throughout the world. The European project is a gradual process, which has been able to adapt to changing realities and to respond to the vicissitudes of history.</p>
<p class="contents">We find ourselves today at one of those key moments at which the European Union needs to rethink and adapt its policies and its institutions so that it can respond better to the challenges of enlargement and of the effective and democratic functioning of its institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Advocacy of a progressive political union, pursuing the federalism which was at its origins, strengthening European citizenship and the economic and social cohesion and cultural diversity of its peoples are essential and inseparable aspects of the options before us.</p>
<p class="contents">The institutional implications of enlargement cannot be allowed to damage the fundamental balance – which the Treaties successfully express – between the twofold legitimacy of the union of peoples and the union of states which underpins the European project and which has made a decisive contribution to shaping its institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The deepening, at global level, of European integration with a view to political union must satisfactorily preserve this fundamental balance which has ensured the success of the European project, bringing together states with such divergent demographic and geographical characteristics.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement should not in any way be used as a pretext for making institutional changes which would gratuitously upset the equilibrium carefully created since 1957, as these institutional changes have no direct logical or political link with enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">It was out of respect for these principles and convictions that we recognised the value of, and voted for, the European Parliament’s proposals to the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) on the revision of these Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">And it is also out of respect for these principles and convictions that we have felt obliged to vote against the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen report, which, in our view, attempts to respond to the challenges of enlargement by means of solutions which would lead to a significant imbalance in the twofold legitimacy of the union of peoples and the unity of states.</p>
<p class="contents">- Accordingly, with regard to the solution proposed for the composition of the European Parliament, we believe that insufficient attention has been paid to certain aspects which, in our view, are fundamental. These relate to the need to eliminate a quantified minimum number of seats in the European Parliament for each Member State and to introduce a degressive approach which can correct the negative effects of strictly applying the rules of proportionality.</p>
<p class="contents">- Furthermore, we believe that the references in the report to the composition of the Commission are also not totally clear. We do not believe that the proposal in the report describes with sufficient clarity and openness the adoption of a criterion putting all Member States on an equal footing, whether the Commission is made up of one Commissioner per Member State or of a college of 20 Commissioners. The same thing could also be said about the idea of a simple rotation principle and about how this would work, which we believe should be properly spelt out if the scenario of a Commission consisting of only 20 members is adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">- With regard to qualified majority voting in the Council, we believe that the system proposed is not in fact the most acceptable. In fact, although we agree with the double majority principle, we believe that the solution to be adopted should involve Council measures requiring two thirds of the votes of the Member States and a simple majority of the Member States with a majority of the population. We believe that this approach will ensure greater cohesion in the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">- As regards the rotation of the Council Presidency, we are also unable to accept the new system proposed, under which the presidency of the Council in its various formations shall be divided among the Member States so that the same Member State may not hold the Presidency of more than one of these formations at the same time, and shall rotate by periods of at least two years. We consider that this new rule does not guarantee the necessary balance and equality in the representation of the Member States in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">- The issue of electing 10% of the Members of the European Parliament via European lists is also insufficiently clear. We believe that the wording used in the report to describe this option is relatively vague and does not as such offer any guarantees that it would be used to create genuine European public opinion of the kind we would like to see. The European list is a good idea, especially if the only people included in it are individuals who represent a genuine point of reference in the spirit of Europe. Nevertheless, it is our view that this concept should be considered in greater depth so that the fears that we have legitimately expressed here can be set aside. </p>
<p class="contents">- We are also unable to accept the rule on qualified majority voting for decisions concerning appointments. Until now all decisions in the European Union relating to appointments have been taken unanimously, and there has never been a lack of appointments or any kind of crisis. We believe that the unanimity rule has the virtue of ensuring a greater balance and of avoiding possible conflicts between large and small countries within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the spirit in which we have voted should not be confused with the motives of those who have a self-seeking and limited vision of national interest. Unlike certain others, we want a politically strong European Union capable of sharing sovereignty and of making an ever greater contribution to social progress and to the well-being of its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The Portuguese members of the Socialist Group will continue to work, alongside those political forces which favour the broadening and deepening of our political union, to find better formulas for pursuing this political struggle. </p>
<p class="contents">For procedural reasons we have made this statement immediately, but some of the points remain dependent on a more detailed knowledge of the changes that have been made.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to add that, because of the speed with which we proceeded to the vote, it was not always easy to understand what we were voting on, there being a certain degree of confusion, specifically about votes on amendments and paragraphs. The Portuguese members of the Socialist Group therefore reserve the right, after studying the results of the vote, to change the way they have voted.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It can therefore be said that the IGC, which is charged with proceeding with the institutional reforms which will make enlargement possible, holds the future of the European Union in its hands, since it has to decide between the minimal reform laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the broad reform which will allow the Union to accept the countries which are preparing for accession and pursue its task in favour of respect for human rights, peace and social justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, given that we are at a crucial moment in the process of European integration, it was appropriate for Parliament to send a message indicating what it understood to be the key points of the reform. In the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report which we have just approved and which I have voted in favour of, Parliament indicates that we have to make further progress and that, to this end, we have to give the European Union the necessary means to complete the shared project of peace and well-being initiated 50 years ago. Let us hope that the IGC is aiming sufficiently high for the great challenges facing the Union and that it follows that path which Parliament has set for it.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The aim of the present Intergovernmental Conference is to prepare the EU for this enlargement. If enlargement is to be implemented successfully, certain institutional changes are required. The EU must become more efficient and more democratic, and a balance should be maintained between the small and large countries. Moreover, it is important that the Intergovernmental Conference should be concluded before the end of the year so that the process of enlargement which has been embarked upon is not delayed. </p>
<p class="contents">The report on the Intergovernmental Conference is the European Parliament’s contribution to that conference. It discusses both the necessary institutional reforms, about which no conclusions were reached in the Treaty of Amsterdam, and a number of additional questions which must also be dealt with prior to enlargement. We, the Swedish Members, Mr Pierre Schori, Mr Jan Andersson, Mr Göran Färm and Mrs Ewa Hedkvist Petersen, support the main features of the report, but we would highlight the following points on which, to some extent, we have different opinions, which is why we abstained from voting in the final ballot. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">The role of the European Parliament </span>is to represent the people in the Union. Enlargement means more States’ representatives in Parliament. If an efficient decision-making procedure is to be maintained, there must be a change in the way the seats are distributed. We advocate a ceiling of 700 Members of the European Parliament. The number of seats allocated to each country is determined through a system of degressive proportionality on the basis of the country’s population. Should a system with a single European constituency be introduced, the number of Members should not be increased. </p>
<p class="contents">A new weighting of votes in the <span class="italic">Council</span> is a prerequisite for successful enlargement of the EU. It is important that the solution should be a permanent one and not need to be changed in connection with any future enlargement. It ought to strike a balance between the principles of, on the one hand, ‘one country, one vote’ and, on the other hand, ‘one citizen, one vote’. An alternative would be for the weighting of votes in the Council to be calculated on the basis of the root of the population in the individual countries. </p>
<p class="contents">We believe that each Member State should have a Member in the <span class="italic">Commission</span>. The Members of the Commission work for the whole Union and are important if a consensus between the Member States is to be achieved. The Commission should therefore be able to draw upon knowledge and experience from all the countries in the Union. In that way, the legitimacy of the Commission would also be strengthened. </p>
<p class="contents">The task of protecting the Union’s interests against fraud is to be carried out by the individual Member States’ institutions and not by a <span class="italic">supranational authority</span>. It is nonetheless important and desirable that there should be European prosecutors in each Member State and that they should cooperate. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">Unanimity </span>in the Council must be required in questions of a constitutional and fundamental nature, as well as in questions affecting general security and defence policy. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">Closer cooperation </span>between at least a third of the Member States cannot apply in the case of defence cooperation. </p>
<p class="contents">EU cooperation is, in the first place, a <span class="italic">civilian European project</span> and ought to be distinguished from military cooperation. The Member States have different backgrounds where military alliances and neutrality are concerned. We made great progress in Cologne and Helsinki by preparing ourselves for preventive crisis and conflict management. It is therefore important that the Treaty should reflect the difference between civilian and military cooperation. Military aid of a kind which places countries under obligations to each other has no place in the EU’s Treaty. </p>
<p class="contents">We are not prepared to dispense with the veto in regard to military cooperation.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, instead of heeding the anxiety and supporting the claims of all these classes of society, the resolution on the Intergovernmental Conference kow-tows to capitalist forces and adopts the decisions made by the monopolies to militarise Europe and intervene in third countries, including militarily, in order to limit further still the national independence and the grass-roots sovereignty of individual countries.</p>
<p class="contents">With the Single European Act and the Treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam, the ΕU is now beginning, under the pressure of enlargement and the new order, to address issues which it was unable to solve at previous intergovernmental conferences.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite proclamations to the contrary, what we have before us is an integrated plan of attack by capitalist forces on the democratic, social, collective and personal rights and freedoms which workers have fought hard to acquire within the context of bourgeois democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is being used by imperialists and multinationals as a battering ram to break the people’s resistance and make them give up their fight for a better tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">The efforts being made, supposedly in the name of democracy and the “effectiveness of the institutions”, seek mainly to serve the interests of monopolies and they will inevitably be opposed by the workers and people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the implication behind generalising the majority voting rule by introducing majority voting, in terms of both the number of States and the number of EU citizens, if not complete indifference to, and degradation of, the interests of the “smaller” countries, of the less developed regions, of the weaker classes of society and of the working and grass-roots classes of the EU in general?</p>
<p class="contents">How else are we to interpret the abolition of a country’s right of veto when its vital national interests are at stake?</p>
<p class="contents">What is the point of rotating Commissioners’ nationalities and not rotating the presidency of the Union if not to exile a supposedly small country from the centre of power for long periods of time so that it is basically unable to defend its interests and the interests of its people, insofar as they can be defended within the framework of the European Union?</p>
<p class="contents">What is the point of limiting the number of MEPs, despite the increase in the number of Member States of the European Union, if not to silence those voices which criticise capitalist forces and their plans and promote political processes which brook no alternatives and which are confined to vapid changes of power which pose no threat to capitalism? </p>
<p class="contents">Why is the role of national parliaments being eroded by substantially limiting democratic scrutiny?</p>
<p class="contents">Why is the weighting of votes in the Council being changed for the benefit of the large countries, at the expense of smaller countries?</p>
<p class="contents">There is only one conclusion to be drawn from the EP resolution, which the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against, and from the Commission’s recent proposals. The people of Europe can once again expect no good to come out of this Intergovernmental Conference. They alone can defend their rights by conducting their own fights, fights which the EU will face in ever more acute form, ever more dynamic form, despite all its efforts to mislead, pull the wool over everyone’s eyes and sugar the pill. Fights which will lead to coordinated action by the peoples of the EU, to a strong, pan-European, grass-roots front opposed to the EU and its policies and fighting for a different sort of Europe free from rulers, exploitation and war.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We therefore welcome the fact that Parliament wishes to accept the challenge to reform the Union along these lines, but we wish to clarify our position as follows. </p>
<p class="contents">A Union of 25 to 30 Member States cannot operate in the same way as a Union of 15 Member States. Instead, we need both an overview of the institutions’ working methods and a clearer distribution of labour between the Member States and the EU. The EU can only function efficiently and democratically if it deals exclusively with cross-border issues and leaves other issues to be resolved mainly at national level. </p>
<p class="contents">The difficulty for the Intergovernmental Conference is to find a delicate balance between the desire to create an efficient and democratic Union and the need, at the same time, to reflect the historic balance of power between small and large Member States. In other words, it must be borne in mind that the EU is a Union of both peoples and States. On this basis, we think it is important for the present Intergovernmental Conference to establish the size of the Commission at one Commissioner per Member State. With regard to the distribution of power in the Council, the Commission has proposed a system of ‘double simple majority’ voting on certain questions. This means that a majority is required from the Member States, but also that these States should represent a majority of the citizens if a decision is to be implemented. This is important from a democratic perspective in view of the fact that, in this way, the voting clearly reflects the will of the people. The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party supports the Commission’s proposal but would emphasise that small countries should not be placed at a disadvantage. Parliament ought to have 700 seats, distributed among the population on the basis of a degressive proportional scale. We are well disposed towards trying out a new system involving European lists, which means that elections for a limited number of the 700 seats could take place within the context of a single constituency. We are aware of the fact that European parties at present have little support among our citizens, but we believe that a supplementary system involving European lists would, in time, lead to an increased European identity. </p>
<p class="contents">An EU of approximately 25-30 Member States will lead to more countries wanting to exploit the opportunity that exists for a number of them to go further than others in certain areas of policy (so-called closer cooperation). We do not think it is appropriate to see this as a permanent solution to the problem which will arise when the EU is enlarged. The risk entailed in a Europe ‘à la carte’ is that the whole integrity and basic idea of EU cooperation will be lost. The solidarity between cooperating States would be in danger of becoming fragmented, something which might have very undesirable consequences for the Union as such. Flexibility of this kind ought to be seen, rather, as a temporary alternative for countries which are not yet ready, or sufficiently well prepared, to enter into deeper cooperation. The wording in the Treaty of Amsterdam about closer cooperation is therefore an adequate and acceptable solution. Too many parallel concentric circles create a system which is difficult to supervise. The Union’s common objectives should be promoted within the context of such cooperation, and no Member State should be excluded from participating. </p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the EU’s increased opportunities to pursue a credible foreign and security policy so that the EU can assume increased responsibility when it comes to solving conflicts in the vicinity of the EU. At the same time, we would emphasise that this development ought not to lead to our having two parallel and competing organisations for resolving conflicts. It is therefore important to emphasise that the development concerned must take place in the context of close cooperation between NATO and the EU and that representatives of these organisations must sit down together as soon as possible and agree upon a satisfactory distribution of labour.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As usual, it is going all out for an unfettered federalist approach. This is reflected in the proposal to almost totally eliminate the unanimity rule, to make the codecision process the norm, to institutionalise the European political parties, to create a European electoral club, to integrate the Western European Union, to strengthen Europol, and, to constitutionalise the Treaties in a far-reaching way. These are ideas from which we have always unequivocally distanced ourselves and will continue to do so. </p>
<p class="contents">However, this report also proposes new and unacceptable ideas. On the pretext that it is necessary to adapt the institutions to the prospect of enlargement, it is now being suggested that there should be a disproportionate strengthening at various levels of the decision-making powers of the large countries and an intolerable reduction of the decision-making powers of the small- and medium-sized countries. All this suggests and implicitly encourages the creation of political inner cabinets, which are totally unacceptable, and which will make it easier to achieve ‘enhanced cooperation’. We are, of course, opposed to such ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, if the European Parliament approves a report like this, it will appear to be indifferent to situations which are obviously urgent, such as the need to overcome or at least mitigate serious democratic deficits; the need to modify the monetarist principles – in particular the Stability Pact – which are the root cause of today’s social scourges such as unemployment and unstable employment; to change the Statute of the European Central Bank so as to ensure greater transparency and appropriate controls and limits on its powers; and to make the existing principle of economic and social cohesion a reality, which is a vital step in creating a Europe of the future based on solidarity. The European Parliament could demonstrate its worth by adopting these policies. But if it opts for the proposals contained in the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report, this will suggest that it is becoming increasingly remote from the people it is supposed to represent. We will therefore be voting against the report.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">1) There ought to be one Commissioner per Member State (paragraph 10). This is about the Commission’s legitimacy and future and about its being able to claim popular support. </p>
<p class="contents">2) There ought to be at least six Members of the European Parliament per Member State and, thereafter, a degressive proportional system as at present (paragraph 3.2) and not, as the Committee on Constitutional Affairs proposes, only four Members per State, followed by a strict proportional system. This is required if it is to be possible to mirror the political breadth and diversity in each Member State. </p>
<p class="contents">3) There ought not to be any pan-European lists or single European constituency (paragraph 4). So as not to make the distance between electors and elected representatives still greater, the Member States should remain as constituencies. </p>
<p class="contents">4) 700 should not be set as the upper ceiling for the number of Members of the European Parliament (paragraph 3). Instead, a certain flexibility should be possible, depending upon the number of Member States in the EU. </p>
<p class="contents">5) No EU financing of parties which operate at European level should be introduced, nor should any democratically dangerous and arbitrary suspension procedure (paragraph 6). </p>
<p class="contents">6) Decisions by qualified majority voting in the Council should not be taken on the basis of a simple majority from the Member States. Instead, it ought to be a two-thirds majority (paragraph 8), and this in order to win legitimacy. </p>
<p class="contents">7) A decision as serious as that of suspending a Member State from the EU should require the unanimous agreement of the other Member States and not, as proposed by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, the agreement of four-fifths of the Member States (paragraph 29).</p>
<p class="contents">8) Social protection should not be regarded as an issue of Community interest (paragraph 42). In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, this ought instead to remain an issue to be legislated on at national level. </p>
<p class="contents">9) The financing of the EU should not be completely independent of contributions by the Member States (paragraph 44.4).</p>
<p class="contents">10) Respect for neutral States’ solutions in the field of defence policy and for their right to make their own decisions should be clearly upheld within the framework of the CFSP (paragraph 34).</p>
<p class="contents">11) To make it easier for citizens of the Member States to know which institutions are responsible for what, the principle of subsidiarity (to which there are unfortunately no references at all in this report) should be integrated into the Treaty in such a way that the EU’s powers are concentrated upon clearly defined, cross-border core issues. The national parliaments and local authorities should play an important role by ensuring that the principle of subsidiarity is respected and by monitoring governments’ action in the Council.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Since I do not consider the report to be in earnest with regard to the demands for decision making in the Council, to the way in which judges are to be appointed and to the number of Members of Parliament, I voted against the report in the final vote (238 votes in favour, 147 votes against and 73 abstentions). Because the report is far-reaching in its scope and because there is considerable disagreement about it, Parliament’s point of view will be of little significance.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We therefore asked the President of the Parliament, Mrs Fontaine, to carry out an internal enquiry, which we hope will take place during the mini part-session at the beginning of May.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
