<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Τrakatellis (PPE-DE)</span></span>  <span class="bold"><span class="italic">,</span></span><span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Madam President, the adoption of the Community action programme in the public health sector is the European Union's first integrated attempt to protect public health. Protecting public health is currently one of the primary concerns of the Union's citizens. Health must be a priority, over and above political or economic compromises, and cannot be treated as a commodity. The programme designed to replace sectoral and fragmented Community action on health is a more integrated programme, based mainly on disease prevention, which will help us to introduce quality standards in the public health sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has included a large number of the amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading in its common position, mainly as the result of excellent cross-institutional collaboration. However, important aspects of our proposals have been rejected in the common position; worse, part of the programme's proposal has been deleted by the Council, forcing us to amend the common position in the Committee on the Environment, the members of which voted in favour of the present recommendation for second reading by a large majority.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like now to make a few comments on the programme itself. The main objective of the programme is to strengthen collaboration between the Member States – and hence achieve added value from the synergy of Community action – by developing three lines of approach, which constitute the general aims of the programme. The first line of approach is to improve the information and knowledge needed in order to develop public health. The second line of approach is to strengthen the potential for a rapid and coordinated response to health threats. I should point out here, given that it is three months to the day since the terrorist attack on 11 September, that we need to include a category to deal with health threats from natural, biological and chemical agents caused by unforeseen circumstances, such as accidents or defective infrastructure or machinery, human error or even acts of terrorism. The third line of approach is to take account of health-determining factors in all policies and activities through health promotion and disease prevention schemes. The programme, which complements national policies, aims to achieve a high level of physical and mental health and greater equality in health issues throughout the Community. Given that the programme has limited resources, we need to prioritise health protection measures, so we can support action to prevent the most serious diseases, together with practical action and the need to develop an integrated, cross-sectoral health strategy within which all Community policy and action will help to protect and improve health.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to highlight two points in our amendments to the common position. Although we are in almost total agreement with the Council on the objectives of the programme and on individual issues, there is still a great deal of discussion as regards coordination and the budget for the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament feels that this sort of complex programme, which includes networks, data, various institutions and non-governmental organisations, needs efficient coordination and control. Obviously, there is a need for a coordinating organisation, which is why, at first reading, Parliament recommended a mechanism called the Health Coordination and Monitoring Centre which would, of course, operate under the Commission and the programme. We have now confirmed this approach in the Committee on the Environment, which voted for a second reading. Of course, the Council, in its common position, and the Commission, in its amended proposal, espoused and adopted the main elements of Parliament's position on developing what they refer to as an efficient system and mechanism for coordinating and monitoring the programme. However, the configuration which they have opted for, in the form of structural arrangements including strengthened central resources, is not ideal and will, at the very least, give rise to confusion and ambiguity, which is why we shall clearly insist on a coordinating centre in a bid to achieve efficient, overall and continuous coordination of the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the budget. The programme must be adequately funded. Parliament is asking for EUR three hundred and eighty million, given that the programme contains extremely ambitious projects and schemes. Consequently, the budget needs to be increased if we are to fully satisfy the needs and objectives of the programme and meet the demands involved in applying the Council's proposals for preparing, adopting and operating suitable structural arrangements including strengthened central resources, as set out by the Council in the second paragraph of Article 7.1.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also vital for us to have the flexibility to redistribute resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, strengthening the foundations of our European Structure depends on convergence, not just at the level of economic strategy and policies, such as the single market and EMU, but in individual sectors, such as the health sector. These are new forms of integration, which I call new convergences, which broaden and deepen the unifying processes. My view, therefore, is that the new programme marks the start of just such a convergence process in the vitally important health sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To start with, we feel that the European Commission really must make suitable structural arrangements, within a year of the date on which the programme starts, for a mechanism which guarantees permanent monitoring and coordination, boosts efficiency and supplies the Member States with information on best practices and an overall evaluation of the programme. This will provide an opportunity to readjust national policies along the right lines. Following recent events and their impact on health, we need to extend action in order to deal with unforeseen threats and new circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the budget is concerned, I shall not mince my words because, if we really want to respond to the needs and objectives of the programme in question, we need to provide the resources required in order to implement it. Given that current programmes have been extended as a result of the delay in approving this programme, at the expense of the present budget, the sum of EUR 280 million proposed by the Council is already too little and is incompatible with the successful application of the programme. I know the budget has limited room for manoeuvre, but I think that, on such serious issues, which directly affect our citizens, the Union needs to make its priorities clear and find suitable solutions. So I ask the Council to reconsider its position, accept the relevant amendments approved by the parliamentary committee and allow for a budget of EUR 380 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think it is important that the exact objective of the programme under discussion be made clear. Amendment No 23, which is referred to in Article 2, reinstates questions such as a holistic approach to health, highlighting mental health and well-being, and the importance of preventing and combating morbidity or premature mortality and reducing inequalities in health matters.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish by congratulating the rapporteur on his effort to reconcile opposing views and ensure that the procedure for approving the programme will be completed shortly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">He has succeeded in extracting from the 57 amendments our essential concerns, as expressed by our vote on the occasion of the first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, I should just like to say that I am glad that he has abandoned the idea of creating a European centre for the coordination and monitoring of public health. On this point, I would just like to remind the House that the Liberal Group supports Amendment Nos 34 and 57 which, more prudently, are evidently intended to strengthen that coordination and also Community integration at the level of the various existing public health networks, under the auspices of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">At a more fundamental level, of course, there are still points on which we disagree with the Council: first of all its refusal to include in the enacting terms any mention of a specific disease, any explicit reference to patients’ rights, or the methods of action for preventing diseases. Amendment Nos 16, 22 and 47 are essential. They emphasise the importance of a policy of prevention and epidemiological monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, thanks to Amendment Nos 3, 26 and 42, the rights of young and adult patients are finally laid down in a Community programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point on which we disagree is the budget, on which Parliament has already made numerous efforts to reach a compromise with the Council. The EUR 380 million which we had adopted at the time of the first reading in plenary session, on 4 April, is in our view the <span class="italic">minimum minimorum</span>. Moreover, as far as the budgetary aspect is concerned the Council’s position is to my mind somewhat paradoxical. It has drastically reduced the budget to EUR 280 million, and at the same time it intends to open up this programme to the candidate and associated countries. There is a problem here.</p>
<p class="contents">Should it be necessary to remind the House, as our rapporteur has done, that health is one of the most important concerns of the citizens of Europe? Food safety issues, changed attitudes in the face of the AIDS scourge, for example, or the threat of biological terrorism, remind us that the human race is not immune from outbreaks of new viruses or the reappearance of former pandemics. This fully justifies an appropriate budget for the next six years. The citizens – and I am just about to finish, Madam President – the citizens, the Members that represent them, and the Commission, all insist on that budget, in order to ensure that health is not sacrificed on the altar of budgetary dogmatism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is in Europe’s interest. This is why we do not understand the attitude of the Council which, by not wanting to fill in the details of this programme, is in fact leaving the Commission with all the powers, while Members of the European Parliament will be deprived of any right of review for the next six years. The European Parliament must be consulted about the annual priorities, and I hope that our fellow Members will support us on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Far from being innovative, this programme restricts itself mainly to the setting up of an epidemiological monitoring network. As far as we are concerned, this is not the main priority; we already have comparable data from other countries. The Community added value should appear upstream, in the form of a reduction in the health risks emanating, for the most part, from our environment in the broadest sense of the word: transport, pollution, chemicals, food etc., but also from our behaviour and from social, economic and environmental inequalities. We recommend prevention throughout the world, but we have to start by applying it ourselves in our health programme.</p>
<p class="contents">This programme should also give greater consideration to the risks arising from transmissible diseases, including in the candidate countries. AIDS remains a scourge in Europe, and tuberculosis is resurfacing everywhere. We also need to think about the therapeutic technologies that we wish to give priority to. The ‘all-drug’ approach has revealed its limitations with the increasing levels of resistance to antibiotics and vaccines. It is time to take other methods and replacement treatments into consideration, but this should also be done on the basis of relevant evaluations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we cannot give in on this matter of the budget. Even EUR 380 million over a period of six years is not enough. By sticking at EUR 280 million, the Council would be demonstrating a desire to restrict the actions of the European Union on public health issues, which is something that we cannot comprehend. That is why we support Mr Trakatellis’ report, which is the result of numerous exchanges between us and which enables us to demonstrate to the Council that the European Parliament’s opinions on health matters must be taken into consideration. They are reasonable and they are essential to the health of all Europeans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The recommendation contains some good intentions, but nothing about how they are to be put into practice. Yet even in the most highly developed countries of the European Union, in any case in France, public health is short of resources, personnel, premises and equipment. The idea of profitability is becoming more generalised. Local hospitals and maternity hospitals are being closed down. Because of staff shortages, nurses, carers and junior doctors have horrendous timetables. Healthcare, and health itself, are commodities which a part of the population is finding it increasingly difficult to afford.</p>
<p class="contents">A proper public health policy implies disease prevention. Yet how can we prevent disease in a society wracked by unemployment and poverty, in which we are witnessing the reappearance of diseases that we thought had been eradicated, like tuberculosis? A civilised society which has the resources of the European Union at its disposal ought to provide everyone with free, high-quality healthcare. Its inability to do so is one example of its failure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, this appears to be a hollow phrase. I have noticed that the EU’s public health programme is being extended and embellished by all manner of things related to public health. Certainly in the field of education and the provision of information, I do not expect Europe to outstrip the individual Member States. Moreover, the distance between Europe and the citizen is far too great. I do, however, support the promotion of health in the candidate countries where even basic health care is below standard. In those countries, the European Union can offer help to combat various illnesses effectively. A great deal can be achieved with relatively limited financial resources.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the developments in the public health sector in the European Union are going one step too far, in my opinion. According to the Treaty of Amsterdam, public health is national policy and should stay that way. I am therefore opposed to public health programmes which are used as a means to undermine national policy while the present programmes hardly offer any added value compared to Member State efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, rather than spending more money on public health programmes, it would be better to phase out subsidies on tobacco growing completely. This would greatly benefit public health in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we will, I think, probably end up going into the conciliation procedure, the programme will probably not become effective before early 2002 and its term will be delayed accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission had allocated EUR 300 million for all the European Union's health projects over five years. I feel provoked by the way the Council of Ministers has again cut this amount and is willing to authorise only EUR 280 million. This programme set itself the extensive goals of continuing the eight existing action programmes, and there are additional tasks, considered to be urgent, especially in the area of information and, as Mr Trakatellis has already mentioned, in that of the challenges posed by international terrorism, whose scale we can as yet scarcely grasp. That being so, I cannot do other than give my full, whole-hearted support to Parliament's demand for EUR 380 million; indeed, I consider that the very least that the European Community must make available. We must not be amenable to compromise on this, and the Council must not be left under any misapprehension about this.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position on the other areas, however, is in my view a great improvement on what the Commission originally submitted and on the documents produced by the first reading in Parliament. The great majority of the amendments that have now been resubmitted, and to which the Environment Committee has agreed, I do not see as an improvement in absolutely every respect. Despite the difficulties I have with them, I would like to express my thanks to Mr Trakatellis for the work he has done and, in particular, for his efforts at achieving a broad consensus in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say, though, that further and continuing education is certainly a good start across national boundaries, but I have great difficulty with training in healthcare, medicine, and so on, becoming a matter for the European Community. I see it as a matter for the Member States. Some Members have expressed doubt about everything having to be done at a European level. Coming as I do from a large Member State, I have seen only that the centralised allocation of tasks does not necessarily represent an improvement, but that individuals must really be helped where they actually are, and that, I believe, is done better by the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new public health strategy will determine the EU's focus on health for the next five years. That is why having clear priorities is so important: firstly, improving information and knowledge concerning health issues; secondly, strengthening rapid reaction to health threats; and, finally, tackling health determinants. However, as many of my colleagues have mentioned, the budget remains an issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy would like EUR 300 million. This is an EUR 80 million increase which would correspond to the amount already in the existing programmes. As many have mentioned, this is EUR 100 million more than the Council asked for in the common position. This is necessary in order for the programme to work effectively, and it is more than fair.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity, in light of 11 September, to ask the Commissioner if any new action to combat bioterrorism will be funded by a new budgetary proposal and not from the framework programme?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to emphasise the importance of working with NGOs. I am alarmed that the Conservatives in this House have called for a split vote on the issue of NGO networks. I fear that this will undermine the partnership which has been built up under the previous programme where the Community relied on NGO networks to deliver messages such as the "Europe Against Cancer Week". The new health programme is about protecting the health of all EU citizens, not just the privileged few. This will not be achieved without working with the EU citizens who are most interested and knowledgeable about public health. Health is what matters to the majority of EU citizens. We should make sure that this programme matters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I want to mention a few points I think need to be part of this programme. The first is what is absolutely the most important objective of a health programme, namely to ensure that diseases do not occur at all. Preventative measures cannot be emphasised enough, and consideration must be given to these in all policies and all activities. That applies above all to environmental pollution which, as we know, damages public health when, for example, food is contaminated or poisonous chemicals that are dangerous to health are used in consumer products. I therefore really want to urge everyone to vote in favour of Amendment Nos 24, 40, 49 and 54.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point relates to complementary medicine. It is important for this to be recognised in the action programme and for research, evaluation and the provision of information to be encouraged in the area of complementary methods of treatment. That is what Amendment Nos 25 and 44 are about.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I want to draw your attention to Amendment No 60, tabled by my own political group. This says that we need to develop strategies for reducing resistance to antibiotics. This is a major public health issue and a major public health problem, as the World Health Organisation has also pointed out by way of a warning.</p>
<p class="contents">My fourth and last point concerns the importance of the efforts in support of the activities of the not-for-profit and non-governmental organisations that operate in the public health field. They do sterling work in the field and need all the support they can get. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At a time when there are many questions with regard to what Europe is doing and what it is about, the one area where we can claim to have success and where we have responded to the concerns of European citizens is in the area of public health. We have been to the fore with in bringing forward innovative programmes tackling common diseases such as cancer, biological hazards, risks to food and food safety, and also the ongoing problems of BSE and foot-and-mouth disease.</p>
<p class="contents">The one certainty, the one foundation stone that European citizens could depend on was the European Union. This has been particularly the case because of the role of our present Commissioner, David Byrne with his proactive attitude to dealing with problems head on, refusing to hide behind any of the cloaks or daggers generally used to get through any difficult political situation. Instead, he delivers clear and factual information quickly to the people. What we are asking for in Parliament here, in the second reading of the Trakatellis, report is a continuation of that relationship with the European citizen, a continuation of the confidence that the European citizens have in us to deliver for them in real terms.</p>
<p class="contents">I, like my colleagues, do not think that the European Union should be involved in setting out treatment programmes or setting out the delivery of medical services to individual citizens – that is obviously best dealt with at national or local level.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is much that we can learn from each other. There are practices with regard to medical devices and new technologies which are in use in one Member State and are not even discussed in another. The Commission and Europe can act as the honest broker in bringing together these sides to ensure that we deliver the best possible remedies for people within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one area of concern in particular – and there is nothing in the report to help resolve the problem – and that is having a clear account of the illness and diseases suffered right across the European Union. For instance, in areas such as autism, polio, cancer – breaking down the individual cancers is probably easier to collate than anything else – cystic fibrosis and other generic and genetic diseases, we have seen continuing problems for people trying to give services to sufferers. If the Commissioner could come forward with an idea of being the collator of information, at least we could then say that there is 10% or 12% or 50%, instead of using guess-work or guess-figures as regards the extent of disease, illness or disability prevalent in our Union. Along with my colleagues, I will support the measures looking for increased funding to be made available. We must live in the real world. The work we are asking for costs money, whether in terms of personnel or resources, and we should be fully supportive of that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – I am very grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Trakatellis, the Members of Parliament and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for their work on this important and ambitious programme.</p>
<p class="contents">This programme is important because protecting and improving public health is at the very centre of our citizens' concerns and their expectations. The recent terrorist attacks have underlined the need to strengthen and extend the existing Community preparedness and response mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the amendments tabled are in line with our broad view of public health and how we should address it at Community level. We can accept 38 of the 60 amendments – 28 in full and a further 10 in part.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to concentrate on a few key areas where some clarification of the Commission's position may be of help.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the implementation of the programme. The success of the programme will depend on the availability of resources and expertise. The Commission will do everything it can to ensure the necessary, effective coordination by establishing the appropriate structural arrangements. Putting these in place requires, in our view, a step-by-step approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Commission services are engaged in the process of restructuring in order better to reflect the main areas of the programme. Secondly, in order to strengthen the Commission's capacity to coordinate actions, we intend to outsource some administrative and technical assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">For the longer term, we are looking at the possibilities to set up an executive agency. However, this will have to await the adoption of the Commission's proposal for a regulation on such agencies which I hope will be adopted in the fairly near future. In the light of this, I can accept Amendment No 8 which calls for the appropriate structural arrangements to ensure the effectiveness and cohesion of measures and actions in the programme and to promote cooperation between the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am unable to accept Amendments Nos 6, 34 and 57 which impose a deadline on the Commission to carry out this work, and propose the creation of a coordination centre. This constrains the exercise of the Commission's executive powers under the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I hope that Parliament will accept the Commission's firm commitment to proceed as rapidly as we can on the establishment of the structural arrangements to ensure effective coordination and monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area on which I would like to focus is the programme's budget. The Commission's proposal was for a total budget of EUR 300 million over a period of six years. Amendment No 36 increases this amount to EUR 380 million. The Council's common position proposes a budget of EUR 280 million. The decision on this matter is for the Council and the European Parliament, as the budgetary authority. I would simply say that the Commission is keeping to its original proposal which, in our view, provides a reasonable figure for the implementation of the programme. I cannot, therefore, accept Amendment No 36.</p>
<p class="contents">This amendment and the last part of Amendment No 56 also set limits on how we spend the programme budget. Such restrictions undermine the essential principle that the programme must be flexible and able to respond to new concerns and threats to health, as they arise.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent events have clearly demonstrated the need to retain such flexibility. Therefore we cannot accept these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I leave the issue of the budget, there is one point I want to make. The Council and Parliament stressed the need to put in place new structural arrangements to ensure effective coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">This was not included in the composition of the original proposal in the budget. In view of this, when we put forward our opinion on the amendments adopted, we intend also to present a revised financial sheet for that programme. This would incorporate an increase in the budget line for expenditure on resources, for technical assistance and support which will be required for the structural arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to turn now to the amendments concerning the scope and structure of the programme. Amendments Nos 7, 13, 25, 30, 44, 46, 50, 52 and part of Amendment No 58 touch on a variety of subjects, such as giving support to regional and national centres of excellence in various fields.</p>
<p class="contents">Complementary therapeutic methods – developing guidelines for medicine and healthcare interventions as well as actions to improve diet and eating habits. These amendments cannot be accepted since they cover areas under the responsibility of Member States. Moreover, there are a number of amendments that require specific comments.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 41 and 59 seek to impose an obligation for the Commission to report annually to Parliament on the implementation of the programme. Parliament will be informed on a regular basis of the development of the programme through both the comitology rules and the evaluation process foreseen in Article 12 of the common position. Therefore, we cannot accept these amendments. Amendment No 42 cannot be accepted since it limits the scope of the health information system by linking it explicitly to the right of patients to receive certain information on their illnesses and treatment. I stress, however, that I favour the concept of the promotion of patient rights and I am following the policy on this, which is included in the health forum and – you will note – is specifically referred to in the legislation at recital 3.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is a group of seven amendments that we cannot accept because they take away the flexibility necessary for the implementation of the programme or because they duplicate provisions of the common position. These are Amendments Nos 9, 10, 23, 27, 28, 35 and 43. On the other hand, there are a number of amendments proposing important new actions that will reinforce the broad objectives and aims of the programme. To name just a few, Amendment No 48 and part of No 26 that cover activities to counter health threats, including terrorists acts. Amendment No 47 which covers the development of a vaccination and immunisation strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">As these amendments, as well as Amendments Nos 3, 11, 29, 31, 45 and 60 will serve to strengthen the programme and improve its effectiveness, they are all acceptable to the Commission. I should add that applicant countries can join in and that is provided for. Furthermore, I also want to mention the reference made to the extent to which it is necessary to acquire information on diseases and disabilities, as Mr Prodi mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">I can, of course, confirm that this particular programme can deal with these issues, particularly under the first strand of the programme dealing with information and data collection.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me, in conclusion, Madam President, repeat my appreciation for all the constructive work that the rapporteur and the committee have put in on shaping the future of public health policy in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">For those points where difficulties remain, the Commission is, of course, ready and willing to assist in finding solutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
