If I have to leave before the end of the discussion it is not for lack of appreciation of the importance of what we are discussing – I believe this issue is going to dominate the international agenda for the next few months – but because I have to attend an important meeting before the EU-Russia Summit with the Deputy-Premier of the Russian Federation to discuss the modalities for beginning discussions on a common European economic area. We will try to agree the terms of reference of our work this evening before our summit with President Putin tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be other reports on the Troika visit that I took part in last week with the Foreign Minister of Belgium, which holds the presidency, and with the Foreign Minister of Spain – the next presidency – which demonstrated our commitment to the issues we were discussing. With my friend and colleague Mr Solana we went to Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria, all in the space of four-and-a-half action-packed, sleep-free days and nights.</p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to say two or three words about that visit and make two or three points about the political situation in Afghanistan, leaving the humanitarian issues, which are of such compelling importance, to Commissioner Nielson. Then I would like to say a word about a draft regulation which the Commission has today adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">The main purposes of the Troika visit were three-fold. First of all, we wanted to make the point clearly to the Islamic countries we were visiting that the campaign against terrorism is not a campaign of the West against Islam. It is not a campaign of Europe and North America against the poorer countries of the globe. It is a campaign of decent governments everywhere against those who would try to make their political point through murder and mayhem. It is a fight, in my judgment, between those who stand up in favour of civilisation, of a number of different religious bases and those who represent the forces which have always been opposed to civilised values. We made that point strongly in every country we went to.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, it is very important to recognise that if we are to make the point around the world that human rights are universally valid, including the right not to be murdered by terrorists – if we are to make that point successfully around the world – it is very important for us not to give the impression that we have a monopoly of virtue, that we in Europe are perfect when it comes to talking about these matters. It is also exceptionally important for us not to concede that human rights bear a different weight according to the continent you are in. It feels exactly the same to be tortured, whatever sort of country you are in. It is exactly the same if you are locked up as a journalist or an editor because you disagree with the government, whatever country you are in. Those sort of rights are universally valid. It seems to me that we dilute the integrity of our argument if we give the impression that somehow different civilisations have fundamentally different approaches to human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point we were seeking to make is that out of the appalling events, out of the atrocities of 11 September, we must hope that it is possible for some good to come. Adversity sometimes produces an opportunity to be constructive, positive and to build better for the future. One thing we said in Pakistan, Iran and elsewhere is that we have a chance now – taking account of the awful things that have happened – of opening some doors and windows which have been closed for too long.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we say that it is a cliché, a truism when people talk about 11 September to say – rather like the fall of the Berlin Wall – nothing will ever be the same again. But it is actually true. Nothing will ever be quite the same again. One way in which we have to make sure that nothing is ever the same again is to try to ensure this time that multilateralism, that international cooperation, works a great deal more effectively in the wake of those awful events than it perhaps has since the 1940s. That is the challenge to us: to make sure that when we discuss conventions against terrorism in the UN, everybody signs them and everybody implements them. Those are the sort of practical challenges that we are going to face for weeks and months and years in the future when these events are no longer on the front pages of the newspapers.</p>
<p class="contents">Those were three points that we – the only four-person Troika in the business – were making insistently at each of our stops.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the political situation in Afghanistan, which we were able to discuss both in Pakistan and in Iran, there were of course different views of the situation. In Iran, for example, there are very strong views about the Taliban. That is not surprising given the number of Iranian diplomats that were killed three or so years ago by the Taliban in Afghanistan. There is a general agreement that the political situation in Afghanistan remains extremely fluid. There are reports from neighbouring countries that the Taliban are in terminal decline. There are also reports that speak of some Taliban military successes and of a return to what passes for a sort of grim normality in Kabul.</p>
<p class="contents">The Taliban continue to show no real sign of being ready to give up Osama bin Laden or forcefully to encourage his voluntary departure from the country. The opposition Northern Alliance has declared itself ready and willing to assist the United States and international coalition efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the death of Commander Masood on 8 September – and I know he made an important visit to Parliament not long ago – there is greater uncertainty as to the cohesion of this alliance. What is certain is that no wholly military solution is possible in Afghanistan. In both Pakistan and Iran, where as I said there are very different views of the situation in Afghanistan, there was agreement that only a broad-based government made up of representatives of all factions and ethnic groups in the country, taking account of the security concerns of neighbouring countries, can begin the process of restoring Afghanistan to normality and pave the way for reconstruction. The means of doing this may be through the Loya Jirga or Grand Assembly mechanism. It would be for the Afghan people to decide what kind of Loya Jirga process they want and what role different political personages might play in such a development.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat that there is a shared perception of what the outcome should be: a broad-based government. How you get to that broad-based government is incomparably more difficult to work out, but there is also a shared perception that the world outside – even in the shape of the United Nations – cannot impose a political settlement on Afghanistan. We can and should aim to facilitate a political settlement, and having facilitated it not then walk away. We have to make sure that a better government, which will emerge from that sad, embittered country will be able to count on the long-term support of the international community to rebuild from the ruin of the medieval ferocity which has been unleashed on Afghanistan for the last few years.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make one other point. We have in the Commission today adopted a draft regulation on specific measures directed against certain persons and entities with a view to combating international terrorism. The draft proposal includes all those individuals and organisations potentially related to the 11 September attack covered by the US Executive Order issued by President Bush last week. But it takes the form of a framework regulation which could serve as the vehicle for a wider campaign against terrorist financing. There is a considerable urgency to this regulation, which is put forward on the basis of Article 308, for reasons which I am sure I do not have to set out for Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances we would be extremely grateful if Parliament could consider an emergency procedure, if possible completing the consultation process during this week's part-session. We would then be able to put the draft regulation to the General Affairs Council next Monday.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that the President of the Commission will be writing to you on these lines, Madam President. We understand the difficulties. We do not want in any way to curtail examination of this important measure; but if it could be done very rapidly it would send the right signals. It would be an opportunity to demonstrate that in exceptional circumstances the Community institutions can act with real despatch. Not only would we thereby signal the strength of our determination to rise to the challenges presented by the 11 September attack, but we would show that the EU institutions are able to respond to crisis situations.</p>
<p class="contents">I will finish my remarks with that point. So far, in the proposals brought forward by my friend and colleague, Mr Vitorino, a couple of weeks ago, we have demonstrated that though we are sometimes the butt of people's humour about the lack of speed of our reactions, when it really matters we are able to react very rapidly and comprehensively and we are able to demonstrate in practice what multilateralism should mean. If there is any institution in the world, if there is any group of countries in the world that can demonstrate the benefits of multilateralism, of arguing about fish quotas or budgets, rather than murdering one another, it is the European Union. That seems to me to give us a particular responsibility to show leadership in the coming weeks and months and I hope we will be able to do so with this regulation this week.</p>

<p class="contents">Even the President of Pakistan – a country where over the last few days there have been huge demonstrations of support for the Taliban regime – has unambiguously stated that the days of the regime are numbered.</p>
<p class="contents">The offer to open up the government of three Afghan provinces and the exodus of people fleeing the country to avoid being mobilised against potential intervention by the international alliance clearly suggest that this is true.</p>
<p class="contents">If, to this fact we add the decision made yesterday in Rome to create a Supreme Council of National Unity instructed to form a provisional government and name a Head of State, we can truly arrive at the conclusion that the situation in Afghanistan is changing from one day to the next.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Madam President, in this context, what attitude should the European Union adopt? Well, in my opinion, the European Union, faced with the crisis situation in this region, should present itself as an element of stability and moderation. The EU should contribute to the establishment of a democratic government in Afghanistan. The EU should encourage the full application in that country of respect for human rights and fundamental liberties, which the Taliban regime refuses to acknowledge, as proposed by the mission led by Commissioner Patten and the Troika.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the European Union has to sign up to the international alliance referred to yesterday by the Secretary-General of the United Nations at their General Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Madam President, the European Union should give its support to an enormous humanitarian task. We should not forget that 25% of the 22 million Afghans will survive thanks exclusively to international aid. However, Madam President, it is important that the European Union does not commit a series of errors.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, that of supporting governments that do not have sufficient popular support, as happened in the first Afghan crisis a decade ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European Union should not commit the error of carrying out indiscriminate actions and of not pursuing tangible objectives. For we should not forget, Madam President, that our objective should not be to dominate a country that certainly holds a strategic position, but not to encourage the action of extremist elements that could cause the overthrow of regimes such as those in Saudi Arabia, Pakistan or Egypt that would make Bin Laden a martyr or a political military leader or, something that would be far more serious, a religious or spiritual leader.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that in conclusion, Madam President, we need to give our total support to Mr Patten’s proposal and behave with maximum diligence and efficiency to support the Commission’s proposals today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This statistic makes it the poorest country in Asia and the world’s fifth poorest country. There are some five million people who rely on food programmes. Millions of people live on the Iranian side of the border, millions of others live on the Pakistani side. The borders are now closed, but it is expected that another million people will end up fleeing.</p>
<p class="contents">The hands of the WFP and UNHCR are tied, for they cannot work in that country. There are a few other international NGOs which boast sound structures and can offer aid. Over the past few years, the Commission has granted a great deal of aid via the ECHO programme. I should like to hear Commissioner Nielson give us an extensive account on this in a moment. We know that we are extremely limited in what we can do. We, as Europe, must do more. We cannot cross the borders. We can use the structure in the country to some extent. UNHCR and WFP are in the same boat.</p>
<p class="contents">I would actually like to echo Mr Lubbers, the High Commissioner of UNHCR who stated that ‘in fact, we also need a new coalition which can cope, as it were, with the huge humanitarian tragedy which is unfolding before our eyes’. I am consciously disassociating myself from tomorrow’s debate on security issues that is much broader still.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to home in on this particular region, however. We will need to take action in Iran. We, together with UNHCR, will also need to take action in Pakistan. We will need to do this as Europe. To date, each of our Member States has failed to earmark sufficient funding. They are dallying and dithering. The European Union has taken sound initiatives in that respect, for which I should like to praise Commissioner Nielson and the Commission, but now is the time to build this coalition. For if we are not able to tackle this humanitarian issue jointly, we will be presented with the political bill in due course. You are dividing the world into two. You are on your own side but not on ours. It is not ‘them’ or ‘they’, but it is our joint responsibility to act in that region. On behalf of the Socialist Group, I hope that the Commission, in close cooperation with all those involved, the international NGOs, UNHCR, WFP, in Iran, in Pakistan, with the political initiatives which Commissioner Patten indicated a moment ago, manages to send out that signal on time: a new coalition for humanitarian aid in the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I say that we have a quarrel with those who abuse Islam and who turn the principles of Islam into weapons against the innocent. In the same way, we have no quarrel with the Afghan people. Our quarrel is with bin Laden who shelters in Afghanistan and with the Taliban, they seem to be almost one and the same, and we pity the situation of the Afghan people. They are already one of the poorest nations upon Earth. Two million Afghan refugees are sheltering in the Islamic Republic of Iran and they have been for some years now. It is sad to see how little international help has been given to those refugees or to their hosts, the Iranian government.</p>
<p class="contents">These refugees fled acute starvation and utter brutality in Afghanistan to find a haven in Iran and there are huge numbers of new refugees now on the move. The psychological terror that our new alliance has properly caused against terrorism in the region is causing the new flight of so many new millions of refugees. We must ask ourselves, how we can save lives?</p>
<p class="contents">We have always supported NGOs. We have perhaps given less interinstitutional support. I plead here to the Commission to look closely at how best to involve our work with that of the United Nations, particularly UNHCR and the World Health Organization, for only the UN, can command the volumes of support that are needed in such a situation, in terms of food, clothing, shelter and the provision of basic needs.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask the Commission to assist the refugees who have already fled and are <span class="italic">in situ </span>elsewhere. May I also include the 3.5 million Iraqi refugees in the region. We must do all we can to help. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would like to add one more aspect, which is at the same time a question, a question to the Council, who are not here. I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner a question instead. A special area of concern when granting aid is the protection of the aid workers. It is extremely dangerous to grant the necessary aid. Is the Commission aware of any European countries being prepared to provide those aid workers military back-up?</p>
<p class="contents">Next, I should like to turn my attention to the political relationship between the EU and Afghanistan. What is that relationship not? Let us be clear about that too. It does not aim to arm the Northern Alliance. Neither does it aim to overthrow the Taliban by military force or play the role of Florence Nightingale, caring for the wounded and displaced once the American big brother has smashed everything to smithereens. So what is – or what should be – the role of the European Union? Allow me to quote three examples.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I believe it would be beneficial if the European Union, as in the past two, three weeks, were to exercise its moderating influence on the United States, so as to prevent any unnecessary civilian victims from being claimed when the Taliban are brought down. This is an extremely important condition for any broad coalition in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I strongly urge the United States and Europe not to make the same mistake as we did fifteen years ago, when we supported the mujahedin in the fight against the Russian presence in Afghanistan by filling the country with arms and then walking away. That is not acceptable. Mr Joschka Fischer, Germany’s Foreign Affairs Minister, put this across very articulately, in my opinion, when he said that we can no longer afford any black holes on the global map.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, I should like to move on to my most important point. In my opinion, any aid, whether it be military, financial, political or economic, now and in future, to the Afghan opposition, whether it be royal or not, should be typified by at least one aspect, namely that this aid should be conditional. It is not acceptable for Afghanistan to be lumbered with another regime which fails to observe democracy and human rights. As far as I am concerned, the lesson we should draw from the cold war is, or should be, that not every enemy of our enemy is our friend. It is friends, in particular, that need to be alerted in an open and critical manner to respecting democracy and human rights. And that should therefore apply to any aid to any Afghan opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, if the Taliban are fought or overthrown in the name of fighting a strange regime which has been repressing human rights for the past five years, for example where women’s rights are concerned, then that is a fair motivation for this fight in my view, but we then also need to be consistent, and this must also apply to other countries in the region. It is unacceptable for a country such as Saudi Arabia to escape our attention, because it now forms part of our coalition, for that country too violates human rights and operates an anti-democratic regime. In my opinion, the real consequences of 11 September can only be drawn if we display the honesty to tackle that country and that region. Only then will we have a truly justifiable argument against the objection which is currently being heard in that region that our anxiety with regard to Afghanistan would be one of selective indignation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Who is it we are cooperating with when we wish to strengthen democracy and combat totalitarian regimes, and what is it we are cooperating <span class="italic">about</span>? In the course of the next few days, we shall no doubt become much clearer about what is possible. We still do not know, of course, how the United States will react. We still do not know whether the United States will choose to use violent methods and first and foremost seek revenge, or whether we shall in actual fact be given the opportunity to engage in a radical fight against terrorism following the terrible events of 11 September. With regard, however, to the issue of whom we are to cooperate with, I would urge us to focus upon the very special circumstance that what we have here is a population exposed to violent oppression and that we must be alert to the fact that half of this population is doubly oppressed. I am talking about the female portion of the population.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise that there are in actual fact women’s organisations which are still attempting, in Afghanistan too, to fight for women’s rights. One of these organisations, RAWA, is trying to create the opportunity for both boys and girls to go to school, and we know of course that illiteracy is very high in Afghanistan – 96% in the case of women and 72% in the case of men – so that this is in itself a useful thing to fight for. They are also attempting to put some documentation together and to do some fact-finding in Afghanistan so that those of us outside the situation have a chance of actually knowing what is going on. When we find out, it is up to us to use that knowledge, and I should like to call upon us to do just that: to use the knowledge that there are courageous women, committed to democracy, and to cooperate with them in our attempt to eradicate the breeding grounds for terrorism in, for example, Afghanistan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The problem is not one of humanitarian efficiency or effectiveness, which have been proven for a long time now, but rather of deciding what political response to make to the matter at hand. I am happy to be able to say this here in this Chamber because Parliament and the European Commission have been the only, rare exceptions among the institutions to pay constant attention to the issue of Afghanistan: in recent years, Parliament has been able to present to the Member States and the Council of Ministers a whole range of political and other suggestions. We can only lament the fact that we were never heeded and our suggestions never taken up or even considered.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been trying to draw attention to the indisputable problem of the tragic violation of human rights for years and, since 1997, the Commission and the European Parliament have also been reiterating that there is a problem of terrorism and drugs in Afghanistan, that is, a major geopolitical problem. All we can do is lament the indifference shown by the major international institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">At the present moment, however, I feel that we have to make a choice: there are moments in history when one has to stop hesitating and take sides, and if we are to do so we must not side with religious fanaticism, dictatorships or some other form of nationalism, but with the liberal democracies – with all their failings and imperfections, admittedly – but also with all their power and their capacity to operate systems which are better equipped to protect human rights in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">My concern is the political response. I fear that it would be a mistake to think that our only enemy is terrorism and, in particular, possibly just Osama Bin Laden. The issue is much more complex than that: our current enemy is that explosive mixture of authoritarian regimes and dictatorships based on religious fanaticism. We must make an effort and go deeper into the matter rather than simply believing that if we catch Osama Bin Laden – which would be right and proper and is a legitimate, necessary thing to do – then the problem will be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">A ‘holy alliance’ to combat terrorism is being formed, made up of a collection of unlikely, not to say dubious allies: there are a number of regimes which are likely to join this alliance, each for its own reasons, each maybe drawing up a list of its own genuine or alleged terrorists with the aim of suppressing its own dissidents, who may well be non-terrorist, democratic individuals. We must be careful not to put everything under the same umbrella indiscriminately.</p>
<p class="contents">I wonder whether it would not make more sense and be more useful to create a world organisation of democracy, of liberal democracy as we know it – and, once again, I do not deny any of its shortcomings – for I feel that this is the institution which we should envisage in the medium term.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, when we talk about women or violation or female genital mutilation, we have no organisation to turn to for help. This is the great challenge before us: to create, export and promote democracy and freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At home, the Taliban keep the country under a reign of mental terror and prefer continuing the civil war to relieving acute famines. Viewed from outside, their prompt departure from the political stage deserves the highest commendation, because the Taliban export terrorism. The handiwork of their guest Osama bin Laden is a case in point, as is the fact that they export narcotics on a large scale.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Afghan history and today’s political reality prove that the Taliban can only be driven out by internal opposition forces. That is why we deem the present Afghanistan strategy of the American administration to provide financial and material aid to the broadest possible coalition against the Taliban around the king in exile, Zahir Shah, to be the most plausible foreign contribution to this political and military <span class="italic">tour de force</span>. That is why I call on Europe to lend its unconditional support to this strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also delighted by the fact that President Bush has earmarked USD 100 million by way of aid for the immense damage incurred to the Afghan refugees. May this gesture of compassion with the suffering Afghan people be the first step towards a Marshall plan for this country that has been completely razed to the ground by sustained armed violence. In that way, the international community can discharge itself from its share of the blame for the present situation in Afghanistan and raise a dam against Muslim terrorism and drugs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A number of our Members had the opportunity to meet him here just six months ago, at your invitation, and we discovered that not only was he a man of war famous for his tactics and his exceptional charisma, but he could also be a statesman, and a man of peace and reconciliation, the peace and reconciliation for which his country has been waiting for more than thirty years.</p>
<p class="contents">My hope today is that this man, my friend, who said that he was prepared to give his life for the sake of the people of Afghanistan, will not have died for nothing. Obviously I regret the fact that he was not listened to sooner when he asked for international aid to rid his country of the iron rule of the Taliban, and when he condemned the development of that totalitarian movement of Islamic fundamentalism flaunting its desire for world domination.</p>
<p class="contents">What Mr Patten has just told us about the political situation in Afghanistan confirms my analysis that Commander Masood’s plan for solving the crisis in Afghanistan could be well underway. Now that Pakistan has been obliged to stop giving political and military support to the Taliban regime, that regime should collapse under the pressure of the whole of the Afghan people, as Commander Masood predicted. I think that proof of this has been provided by the agreement that has just been signed in Rome between the opposition forces and the former King Mohammed Zahir Shah, whose prestige is still as great as ever in his home country. I also see proof of this in the statements made by Mullah Omar himself, when he announced yesterday that he might possibly be overthrown, and finally in the news that has just reached us about the defection, with seven hundred of his militia men, of the Taliban governor of the Javan region on the border with Turkmenistan, which has brought the province of Badghis under opposition control. Carried away by the idea of realpolitik, the international community, and with it, I am sorry to say, the European Union, had adopted an attitude towards the Taliban that was at the very least conciliatory, working on the principle that they exercised the real power and that they could not do so without the support of the whole of the Afghan people. At the time I compared this attitude with the attitude that the Western governments thought they ought to adopt towards the Cambodia of the Khmer Rouge before their abominable barbarism became apparent. Thanks to that same blind tolerance, we have allowed this hornets’ nest of Islamic terror to develop on Afghan territory. Its evil deeds were denounced by Commander Masood, and it must now be destroyed, something which I hope will happen very soon. However, for the sake of destroying a hornets’ next it should not be necessary to burn down the whole house. On the contrary, it is essential that the Afghan people should be spared, and given all the assistance, of whatever kind, that they need in order to establish a stable regime based on national reconciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">I have the feeling – and Mr Patten has just reinforced it – that this is the direction in which the Union’s efforts are heading, and I welcome this, but I do not forget the disastrous humanitarian situation that prevails in the region as a whole. I am thinking of the hundreds of thousands of refugees waiting at the border with Pakistan, and also of the people who for months now have been completely without supplies in the northern provinces. I know that the Russians have set up an airlift for emergency humanitarian aid, operating from the airport at Dushanbe in Tajikistan. I would not like to see the European Union conspicuous by its absence in this undertaking, in which its assistance is also desirable. What these people want is, of course, food, but in addition they want medicines, blankets and shelters, and above all they want us to demonstrate our solidarity. In Bosnia, at the height of the crisis, Europe, acting within the Atlantic Alliance, was able to set up a scheme for parachuting supplies into the most isolated enclaves, those that were at greatest risk. This is what the people of Panshir are now expecting. Have we, and have you, Commissioner Nielson, the will and the means to provide it? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do think, however, that all of it should be taken into account, given that the whole world is waiting to see the European Union’s reaction.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that, given the condemnation of the situation in Afghanistan that this Parliament has already issued, and given the danger of the reduction in civil liberties, we have to remain united, as Commissioner Patten has said, and present a united front against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also worried, however, by something else that has already been said: the tragic situation that has arisen since these attacks. On the one hand there is the Afghan population, which is facing a serious crisis, as was very clearly stated by the Joint Committee of the FAO and the World Food Programme (WFP) that recently visited Afghanistan, and which has said that, at this moment in time, the country is suffering widespread starvation due to a serious crisis in agricultural production, that could cause the death of a huge number of people. To this we must add the continuing danger to the farming population posed by the antipersonnel mines scattered throughout the country and the situation of the thousands of refugees in bordering countries – not only in Pakistan and Iran, but also in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan I would like to point out – that have to be dealt with.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what also worries me – and it is on this that I would like to focus, Madam President – is the situation of the populations in all the other developing countries, particularly the African countries, who will suffer the worst economic consequences of this crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">According to information from the World Bank, the terror attacks condemn ten million more people to poverty, as a result of economic slowdown and, particularly, from the loss of income due to decreased exports, a reduction in tourism, falling prices, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true, Madam President, that the European Union and this Parliament now have to form a strong coalition against terrorism. But we should also consider – and this would send a signal to the whole world – an international coalition against the poverty, misery and despair of millions of citizens across the world who very often seek protection from the very fanatics who organise these acts of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, therefore, ask that, alongside this coalition against terrorism, we also send a signal, chiefly to the peoples of Africa and Asia, stating our desire to build a coalition against misery, poverty and despair. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These countries have been, and will be, the first to be affected by the refugee problem as a result of what is now happening in Afghanistan and in that part of the world. There is, therefore, an unqualified need for European consultation on the provision of emergency aid, something which Mr Morillon was quite right to point out. Central Asia is a vulnerable and very fragile region. It is a vulnerable region economically speaking, in terms of respect for human rights and in terms of the fabric of the civil society and democratic institutions. It is a region which, for years, has required our support in the fight against fundamentalism and the drugs trade. That is why we need to ensure that we lend sufficient support to that region. And what do we do? In the 2002 budget, we cut back the budgetary resources allocated to that region. I therefore urge the MEPs of the Committee on Budgets, together with the entire plenary session, to rectify that budget and to give Central Asia what it is entitled to.</p>

As you know, I was born in a country that understands terrorism, with 65 000 dead – please remember that the LTT suicide bombers in Sri Lanka are not Muslims – but the world has so far turned a blind eye on twenty-three years of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The tragedy of 11 September has finally focused the attention of those that love democracy and freedom on the cancer that hides within. The cancer of terrorism. A cancer that is fed, not by religion, but by greed, hate, envy and ignorance.</p>
<p class="contents">In Afghanistan, the 1963 Constitution as promulgated by King Zahir Shah is an exemplary document. I salute my colleague, Edward McMillan-Scott, for taking the initiative to lead a delegation to Rome to initiate a coalition between the King and the Northern Alliance, which I am happy to say has now been signed, as General Morillon has just mentioned. I want to congratulate General Morillon on inviting Shah Masood here, so that in April we had a chance to meet him.</p>
<p class="contents">The 1963 Constitution states that liberty is a natural right of each human being – this right has no limitations except the liberty of others, but freedom of thought and expression is invaluable – that every Afghan has a right to print and publish ideas, that education is a right of every Afghan and shall be provided, free of charge, by the State, and that work is a right of every Afghan who has the capability to do it.</p>
<p class="contents">What a far cry this is from the tragedy existing in Afghanistan today, where women are beaten, denied education, kept at home as slaves and with one in eight dying in childbirth. It is a State run by ignorance using the stick of religion, of which they know little, to cower and terrorise their own people. The war against terrorism is a war to free the people of Afghanistan from the twenty-eight years of slavery.</p>
<p class="contents">I salute President Bush and the British Prime Minister for their determination – shoulder-to-shoulder with a Democratic Party and Ian Duncan Smith, the leader of the Conservative Party who was here in Parliament today – to defeat and eradicate international terrorism. But this must not be a purely Anglo-Saxon affair. If the EU and this House are to be anything at all, they must have an involvement in ensuring this most basic of human activities; the right to live without being terrorised, the freedom to live without the daily sudden threat of death. We should not think that we in Europe are not targets. We already know of plans to attack Genoa, Paris and elsewhere. When will we learn that is our war too? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European response has for once been fast and immediate in the case of this Parliament. The response of the Commission and the Council has also been quick, as Commissioner Patten has just reminded us with regard to the mission by the Troika. This is a response that should be firm, forceful, proportionate and selective, in cooperation with the United Nations, and which requires political, military and police measures by the intelligence, diplomatic, legal and economic services which have, in one form or another, already been or are in the process of being adopted. These must be measures that can be adopted and upheld in the short, medium and long term.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to remind you that the magnitude and gravity of events is such that the decisions taken here a few days ago that have still not been implemented have already been superseded by events. I remember several opinions expressed here by various speakers on the occasion of the Watson report on the European Union search and arrest order just three weeks ago. Mr Massoud, who came to visit us a short while ago, has been assassinated and so will not be able to see to fruition the objectives he spoke to us about here in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation I would call for the implementation of a major humanitarian aid programme that must be put in place immediately to help the millions of displaced persons and refugees in Afghanistan, Pakistan and other countries in the region. The humanitarian disaster that is on the horizon could be of a greater scale than any that has taken place in the past as a result of human barbarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude, Madam President, by stating that the fight against poverty in the world, that we have highlighted on numerous occasions, is now particularly relevant and that we should make it one of our top priorities if we want to solve this problem in the short, medium and long term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The speedy declarations of solidarity by Europe and the NATO allies have not been forgotten. Now that the USA has demonstrated that it is not engaging in cowboy politics, but is giving very serious consideration to every step in the fight against the terrorists, we must not leave it to later to convey our thanks and appreciation across the Atlantic. But what is being done in comparison?</p>
<p class="contents">Take us in Germany as an example: we find fault with the USA and make so bold as to set up rules of conduct. We are already distancing ourselves from the USA, and an objectionable anti-Americanism occasionally puts in an appearance. As a German European, I am ashamed of this, bearing in mind also that around 100 Germans were murdered in New York on 11 September. I can understand why the USA, despite the announcement today that this is an issue for the Alliance as a whole, does not want, if possible, to involve its 19 NATO partners in the military counter-attack against the terrorists and their accomplices, with the exception of Great Britain.</p>
<p class="contents">You cannot fight and win a campaign with doubters – and I say that as an officer in the Parachute Reservists. This is evidence of Europe's incapacity, all the more so as the wrecked twin towers in New York have their counterparts all over the EU. Afghanistan may well be a target for the USA's counter-attack. The inhabitants of this country battered over decades are leaving their homeland in droves, eking out an existence in refugee camps in Pakistan. These people deserve the complete solidarity of the EU and of our Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Aid from the EU should be unbureaucratic and be given swiftly, bearing in mind that winter is very hard over there. If we do not help now, it is to be feared that the many young refugees there will be easy prey for one fundamentalist or another. The European Parliament should consider the advisability of sending a delegation of members of this Parliament's Committee on Development and Cooperation to Pakistan as soon as possible. Impressions gained directly from experience are always better than voluminous reports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has now suffered 28 years of communist dictatorship, followed by fanatic Islamic theocracy, turning it into a pariah State as the Taliban harbours terrorists and executes thousands. There are over 2 million refugees outside the country and some 5 million internally displaced persons, many of whom may flee if hostilities break out between the US and its allies and Afghanistan itself. The World Food Programme is hampered by difficult terrain, destroyed infrastructure and Taliban policies which prevent female participation, and which have led to the arbitrary arrest of aid workers on charges of religious proselytising and a ban on communications with the outside world, so essential to an international aid programme. In spite of this, some 218 tonnes of food got through to Kabul last week to avert a crisis. It is clear that the West must now think of what can be done post-Taliban to bring permanent stability to the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, with two of my fellow MEPs, I was privileged to meet in Rome, the former King of Afghanistan, who has lived in the European Union for much of his life. We were the first Western elected politicians to visit the royal household since the crisis. He demonstrated a supreme sense of patriotism and duty to his estranged country, and went as far as to say that he would serve Afghanistan in any capacity his people chose through their assembled tribal council, or Loya Jirga, which he has been working on for the last two years. He confirmed that he has now received key support from the opposition United Front/Northern Alliance forces and will facilitate an internal settlement appropriate to his country. He is the only acceptable Afghan figure who can unite all the warring factions and demonstrated the ability, when he ruled his country between 1933 and 1973, to rule constitutionally with tolerance and moderation, even using the English model of sport as a way to unite the disparate ethnic groups.</p>
<p class="contents">It was clear to me that Zahir Shah, in spite of his advanced age, was both cogent and fit enough to do the job, after conducting a lengthy one-and-a-half-hour interview with myself and my colleagues. He has also wisely distanced himself from the restoration of the monarchy as an issue, leaving this to his people to decide. I urge this House to support the King's mission in this tricky area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with my colleagues that there is no reason for it and no-one has a right to carry out such acts. Terrorists choose violence rather than the ballot box, inflicting death and pain on innocent civilians, justifying their actions by flying the banner of religion, race or political sovereignty.</p>
<p class="contents">Islam, like other great world religions, such as Judaism and Christianity, is a way of life for over one thousand million people in this world. These millions of Muslims, from Indonesia to Nigeria, from Central Asia to the leafy suburbs of California, knew nothing about Osama bin Laden before 11 September. For these millions and for Islam there is no place for terrorists like him or any others, whoever they are and wherever they come from.</p>
<p class="contents">These terrorists have no authority to act on behalf of any people, race or religion. Therefore, we must fight terrorism and act against terrorists, not innocent civilians who pursue their lives peacefully and who should have the freedom to believe in a religion of their choice. Human life is precious and the death of innocent civilians, wherever it occurs, is simply not acceptable. Reason without passion is sterile, passion without reason is heat. Let us be firm and decisive. Let us target terrorism: let us remove the causes that conceive, feed and sustain terrorism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Madam President, the situation was already bad and now it is worse. I totally agree with what has been said this afternoon on the situation of the people in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">We put Afghanistan on the list of so-called forgotten crises when we fixed ECHO's programme and priorities for 2001. We had a spending level of some EUR 23 million, which would have covered the continuation until New Year of the very last activity that we were funding there. In fact we had 29 European NGOs delivering humanitarian aid inside Afghanistan. They were all there on 11 September. On 11 September I was on my way to a mission to Afghanistan and to Pakistan. I was supposed to meet Dr Masood, the Taliban leadership and to go around the whole country seeing the work of these NGOs that we are funding. I had to cancel the trip. The morning after, we took the train back from London to Brussels but our luggage was already in the aeroplane for Islamabad.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, as I said, the situation is worse. Winter is approaching. Winter is such a dominating feature of reality there that even in normal years military fighting more or less stops simply because getting around is so difficult. So humanitarian aid now faces a really scary challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">The international staff of the different aid agencies and NGOs have all been withdrawn from the country. However, it is very encouraging to see that the local staff is continuing to distribute food – if the food has not been taken over by the Taliban – and is still running health clinics and providing education where it is possible. Obtaining real, true information is extremely difficult, but we can see that they are trying to keep these activities going even in this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course the threat of an outside attack has resulted in large movements of population. This also has the effect that we cannot rely on people accessing the different storage centres for food as they used to, because they have fled into the countryside in their millions and lost the access to food they had in the cities. So the internal situation is extremely bad and the people who make it to the border look even weaker than they did before. Some six million Afghanis are considered to be totally dependent on food supplies from the outside.</p>
<p class="contents">If no planting is possible before the winter sets in – and this is most probable – we are in for a very serious threat within less than half a year, even if things work out well in terms of stability. The very logistics of what is needed down the line, even on the basis of the best case scenario, pose a formidable challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">We have supported the different UN organisations very actively, and participated at the meeting of the Afghan support group in Berlin on 27 September. The UN has launched a UN-donor alert in support of emergency assistance. The alert calls for some USD 580 million from now until March next year to ensure that delivery of humanitarian assistance and the protection of what is estimated to be around 7.5 million Afghans. USD 120 million is required immediately. Funding of this appeal would, in fact, seem to be less of a problem than the overall question of accessibility to internally displaced people and refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">There are conflicting views in the discussion as to whether emphasis should be placed on keeping the additional migratory flows within Afghanistan or on encouraging Pakistan and Iran to open their borders, as the UNHCR intends to do. My personal analysis of this is that we are only able to influence the choice of these people to a very small degree. Things may happen and we will have to be very flexible in order to be able to do what we need to do as things develop.</p>
<p class="contents">We have never had to draw up a contingency plan with so few given elements and so many unknowns. The need to keep food aid going was central to the discussion at this Afghan group meeting. Everybody agreed on the urgency, but concurred that the prospects for actually delivering such aid were quite poor. Most participants argued that food-aid distribution without the presence of expatriates could expose Afghan partners to undue risk. My earlier reference to Afghan local staff continuing to do what they did before the expatriates had to leave relates to deliveries of existing food and other stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a far more difficult and demanding task to manage the convoys of new supplies coming in, given the internal situation that exists today.</p>
<p class="contents">Things are different in the north-eastern part controlled by the Northern Alliance and in the rest of the country. But from the humanitarian point of view it is quite evident that our activities must be targeted at the whole country. That is how it must be.</p>
<p class="contents">We are using three financial tools to fund the aid to the Afghan population. First – and this is to set the record straight – over the past ten years we have provided humanitarian aid of more than EUR 400 million to internally displaced persons in Afghanistan and refugees in neighbouring countries: ECHO funds, drought mitigation and response activities like food aid, agricultural rehabilitation, water and sanitation rehabilitation, assistance to internally displaced persons and to refugees in Pakistan, as well as prevention of displacements and support for returnees. So this is more than just food aid. ECHO and the organisations working with our money have managed to build up a portfolio of meaningful activities that they have been able to continue.</p>
<p class="contents">I add that one unfortunate international case is not representative of the situation of the 29 organisations that the Commission is funding. It is a difficult situation but it is important to note that the organisations we are funding cannot be accused of the same kind of activity. They were able to work with expatriates until 11 September and to build up a portfolio of activity, which I was very much looking forward to coming to see. I pay tribute also to my predecessor in this job for laying the seeds of this kind of good cooperation with the European humanitarian NGOs.</p>
<p class="contents">We have, this year, committed EUR 23 million to ECHO, channelled through NGOs and different UN agencies. As I said, this would have covered a continuation of this level of activity until the end of the year. Then this terrible act of terrorism took place. We reacted immediately with an additional EUR 4 million. This is committed for action through the World Food Programme, UNHCR, and the International Red Cross.</p>
<p class="contents">Now our response has to go beyond this. We will approach the budgetary authority in order to get the green light for accessing and using funds from the emergency budget reserve, as in earlier years when ECHO's normal budget did not cover the needs that arose because of terrible events. We announced EUR 25 million a week ago in the Commission. It will form part of this operation and be directed at the immediate situation of the refugees. We will be asking for more money. But this is covered by the normal procedure for accessing additional money.</p>
<p class="contents">The second line of support is EC aid to uprooted people. Here we fund activities creating environments conducive to a sustainable resettlement of returnees and activities aimed at persuading people to remain in their villages. This budget line will commit funds from October for a budget of EUR 19 million in Afghanistan, EUR 3 million in Pakistan and EUR 2 million in Iran. Funds are channelled through Afghan NGOs and UN agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">The third line is EC food aid and food security. Since the beginning of this year this line has committed 30 000 tonnes of food aid to the World Food Programme and 7 000 tonnes to NGOs. A further EUR 7 million is now being requested by the Commission for the WFP Afghan programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me address some of the questions that have been asked. Mrs Nicholson mentioned that we should do more through UNHCR and WHO to broaden the broad basis and improve the organisation of this assistance. In relation also to Mr Van den Berg's remarks, from a commercial management point of view, if you will, the operation in Afghanistan is a good case of cooperation between the UN organisations and those very professional and relatively big and specialised NGOs which, for some years now, have formed part of the operation. What we need now are operational plans for concrete action. We hear in the media now about a convoy getting through the Khyber Pass and going north. This is a ‘pilot scheme’, so to speak, which may also progress towards Kabul and on, to try to see what is possible. But there is no overall plan in place; this was a response to the UNHCR proposals in the discussion with donors for better planning so as to know what to do and not be burdened down with red tape, as Mr Knolle called it. This is not the problem. I would go as far as to say that in general this is not the problem with our work in the humanitarian aid area. Please keep in mind that the totality of ECHO's budget is used every year and this year we are coming to you asking for more because of this situation. The red tape here is minimal.</p>
<p class="contents">Protection was mentioned. Here we are in a terrible dilemma. We cannot push those voluntary organisations that work with our money into doing something that goes beyond what they want to do. On the other hand, we have a problem as a funder, for example if they want to do something very daring that may get them into trouble and we just do what we can on the issue of security, no questions asked. Chechnya is a case in point; the Russians are still denying our NGOs access to radios, and this is a real problem for the safety of the people there. This is a balancing act and the responsibility that we have as the funder of the activity goes far into the issue of security. Again, working with the UN is partly an answer to this, but working to deliver humanitarian aid now to the Taliban-controlled part of Afghanistan under some sort of armed protection is not an option.</p>
<p class="contents">There has to be a very open humanitarian mode of operation where suspicion about how one moves around in their country is not a factor. But this is extremely difficult. I agree with what Mrs Frahm and Mrs Bonino said about the situation of women. This is the most extreme version of a denial and violation of human rights apparent to us. It is part of the conflict that they are in the midst of, and one would hope that sanity emerges after what we are about to go through now.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Belder mentioned the export of drugs. It should in all objectivity be noted that the Taliban has made an incredible effort to reduce the production of opium and this may be one of the best cases globally that we have seen where they have done what the international community would like to see done. It reflects a totally different agenda, but has in fact taken place, and so I believed I should mention it.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Mr Morillon's reference to the deceased leader of the Northern Alliance, Ahmed Shah Masood, we have no better answer than the one very well presented by Commissioner Patten as our view of the need for a comprehensive sort of basis for shaping the future of Afghanistan. This is the line to take. Mr Morillon also asked me if I had the determination and the means to do what must be done. We are relying on the international aid organisations to do what needs to be done on the ground. We have not been hesitant in mobilising funds and are actively participating in the region with the people representing ECHO who are permanently stationed there. We are participating in the debate on how to organise things and to understand the situation as much as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Mr Staes, consideration for the countries in the Central Asian region bordering Afghanistan to the north will be part of the package I mentioned and we are discussing resources in addition to the EUR 25 million that we have publicly mentioned. In respect of the dialogue with the budgetary authority, we are not releasing figures other than this EUR 25 million, but this will be an element in that package which we will be coming back to quite soon.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for your patience. This is an extremely demanding situation. I see this as something that demonstrates to us that, looking back on the history of our own experiment in Europe, we got organised to do what needed to be done in Europe after the Second World War and we did it. The problem we are discussing here today and the challenges it involves tell us that Europe now needs to get organised and find a way of achieving what the world needs to achieve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
