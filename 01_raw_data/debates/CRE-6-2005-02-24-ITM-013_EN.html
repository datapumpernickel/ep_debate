<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mann, Thomas (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, in January 1990 Nepal celebrated the Year of Tourism. A magnificent parade involving tens of thousands of participants and several hundred thousand spectators demonstrated the full extent of the cultural wealth of the country, with its sherpas, monks, temple dancers, sadhus, mahouts, mandala artists and mountaineers.</p>
<p class="contents">I took part in this parade with the organisation Friends of Nepal. We marched through Kathmandu and past King Birendra, who enjoyed the highest respect of 95-98% of the Nepalese people, both as a person and as a champion of the constitutional monarchy. This makes the contrast with King Gyanendra, seven years later, appear all the starker. He has dismissed yet another prime minister, and dozens of politicians, human rights activists and journalists have been taken into custody or placed under house arrest. He now intends to rule as an autocrat for three years.</p>
<p class="contents">The question that needs to be asked is why not one prime minister in recent years has managed to hold free elections, and the answer is that agreement has never been reached between the various parties, not to mention with the Maoists. The main reason, however, is the lack of security in the country. People are living in fear, and by no means only in western Nepal. Two thirds of the country is now under the control of Maoist rebels, and inadequately-trained police officers fall victim time and time again to lethal attacks. The civil war has claimed 10 000 lives so far and shows no sign of coming to an end, with tourism, the country's main source of income, having been brought almost to a standstill.</p>
<p class="contents">I am afraid that the Maoists will gain further supporters following the coup of 1 February. The state of emergency will be used to place further restrictions on human rights, and it is for this reason that it is a cause of great concern to us in the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. By way of example, key places of refuge for Tibetans who have been forced to leave their homeland have been closed, including the Tibetan Refugee Welfare Office. For the past 15 years, this Office has supported the work of the UNHCR refugee centre in Kathmandu, with which I myself am familiar, and at present around 1 000 asylum seekers are living there.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Office of the Representative of the Dalai Lama, which was established in 1959, has been closed. The situation is becoming increasingly desperate. Commissioner, I welcome the initiatives taken by the European Union, as well as those taken by India and the USA, one example of these being that the King has been called upon to end the state of emergency within 100 days. A representative of the European Commission who was present at the meeting of our SAARC Delegation this morning said that a number of funding programmes would be suspended, in order to strengthen democracy by means of economic pressure. Fortunately, however, development aid will continue to be granted, and targeted at the poorer sections of the population and local human rights organisations and NGOs.</p>
<p class="contents">I would be delighted if the issue of human rights violations in Nepal were to appear on the agenda of the session of the UN Commission on Human Rights to be held in Geneva. Nepalese democracy is only 15 years old; it is still fragile, and must be protected rather than destroyed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is facing a dilemma. On the one hand we cannot afford to waste any time in taking a stance on this issue. That is exactly why we are aiming to adopt a position today. On the other hand, however, we have no detailed knowledge of the precise reasons behind the <span class="italic">coup d'état</span> staged by the King of Nepal, although that knowledge would be extremely useful for us. If we delay on this account, however, it is likely that our intervention will come too late, and rapid intervention is key.</p>
<p class="contents">The King has announced that he wishes to mount a more effective fight against the Maoist guerrilla movement, but at the same time he has closed the Tibetan Refugee Welfare Office, as Mr Mann mentioned a short time ago. In addition to this closure, Nepal has stopped its aid to Tibet, which was intended to strengthen the country’s resistance against China's aggression. Against this background, the reasons given by the King appear somewhat unconvincing.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament must adopt a stance on this issue rapidly, as if we leave it too late we will be unable to achieve our goal, which is to prevent further criminal acts. I believe we should be reassured that the more active diplomatic measures taken by other countries, such as the United States and India, are appropriate. India is a neighbour of Nepal, and so it may well have its own reasons for taking diplomatic action. These may be reasons we would not entirely subscribe to if we were familiar with them. The measures taken by other countries such as the United States, however, should convince us that that theirs is a course of action we should also be following.</p>
<p class="contents">All rights have been suspended by the King, and while we have not forgotten the tragedy that befell the royal family several years ago, since that time no questions have been asked by the international community or international organisations as to the legitimacy of the royal rule. There are therefore a number of considerations that must be weighed up. As I said earlier, the reasons behind these events are unclear, but they are a source of some concern. Furthermore, and reiterating Mr Mann’s comments, we cannot condone cutting off aid to Tibet, just as we cannot agree to the suspension of civil rights, to arrests, to the closure of press outlets or to far-reaching restrictions on freedom of speech. We are therefore fully justified in taking action, and we should adopt the resolution. Let us hope that a rapid reaction by this House, along with the measures taken by other countries, will go some way towards normalising the situation in Tibet. Many thanks, Mr President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Both these destinations for alternative holidays have since become places of horror to which nobody goes any more as a tourist or as somebody in search of a better world. In both countries, over past decades, various attempts have been made at imposing from the top downwards an authoritarian monolith lacking any real support from a majority of the population. The outside world, too, has an interest in putting governments in the saddle or imposing one new regime or another.</p>
<p class="contents">It is under such circumstances that people, on realising that they cannot bring about change by peaceful means, reach for their weapons. In Nepal, one king after another has dismissed democratically-elected governments in the belief that they could do a better job themselves. In so doing, they have not only incurred the hostility of a wide variety of political parties, but have also provoked popular uprisings. Insurgents are now in control of much of the country, particularly its western parts. The warring factions on both sides will stop at nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">While this is going on, mainstream politicians are in dispute about how best to gain the upper hand over the insurgents, whether through one-man rule by the king or by means of parliamentary democracy. It is Belgian weapons suppliers that protect the King against the insurgents. There seems to be no prospect of an end to this misery for anyone, and yet a stop must be put to it. The traditions that Mr Mann celebrates may well not return that quickly, but the people of Nepal still have the right to make their own choices, to opt for democracy and human rights. Let us not impose limits on the people of Nepal’s ability to choose for themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We must all remember, however, that although the European Union's Code of Conduct in the field of arms exports explicitly prohibits sales to countries in armed conflict, certain European governments, such as the government of the United Kingdom, have been selling arms to the Nepalese Government over the last three years.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the resolution we are voting on today is of crucial importance in terms of clarifying the European Union's position on the peace process and on human rights in Nepal. Given the seriousness of the situation, we must firstly welcome London's decision, and that of the Indian Government, to suspend all military aid to the current Nepalese Government.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the European Union must strongly insist that King Gyanendra immediately suspend the state of emergency and engage in a political process aimed at resolving the conflict, based on justice and respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the European Union must urge the Maoist guerrillas to commit themselves to respecting international humanitarian law and to signing a humanitarian and human rights agreement with the governmental security forces.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, in accordance with the resolution we adopted this morning on the next session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, we must also urge that Commission to adopt a specific resolution on Nepal and to appoint a Special Rapporteur to monitor the human rights situation in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with reference to Mr Mann’s invitation — with whom I entirely agree — we must not forget that the situation in Nepal has a regional dimension, particularly with regard to its neighbour Tibet. To this end, we must demand that the Nepalese Government reopen the Tibet Refugee Welfare Office, as well as the Dalai Lama’s representation in Kathmandu. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He sacked the Government and assumed direct powers himself. This follows on from a decade-long conflict, which has cost 11 000 lives. The Nepalese people have suffered a legacy of human rights abuses, both from the security forces and from the Maoist rebels. They have suffered torture, detention, disappearances and unlawful killing.</p>
<p class="contents">Communication links with the outside world have been severed and, hidden from public scrutiny, the risk of further abuse escalates, according to Amnesty International. Radio news broadcasts have been shut down, foreign news channels taken off air and local media barred from publishing news or commentary without prior approval. In the immediate aftermath, telephone lines were severed, and some mobile phone services have not resumed.</p>
<p class="contents">Approximately 3 000 people are currently under house arrest according to Nepalese Government sources. The people who have been arrested are either senior members of the ousted government, human rights defenders or student and trade union leaders. Access to them has been restricted. They should either be charged or tried under due process of the law, or released forthwith.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and the Member States provide more than EUR 100 million in aid per year. All military assistance should be stopped now. Emphasis should be put on a multiparty democracy, conflict mitigation and alleviating poverty and suffering. A military solution is not the answer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It cannot be overlooked that King Gyanendra's actions on 1 February were a sad day for democracy in Nepal. Neither can we ignore the actions of the terrorists. The European Parliament cannot just stand by.</p>
<p class="contents">Nepal, as we have heard, is a desperately poor nation with an unfortunate history of conflict and has recently suffered under terrorist attacks from the Maoist rebels. This Himalayan country faces several problems, including the issue of refugees from Bhutan. The dissolution of the Nepalese Parliament does not help the situation of the common Nepalese people. On the contrary, the Nepalese need stability and democracy in order to prosper economically and politically.</p>
<p class="contents">The most immediate actions that we demand of the Nepalese authorities are: the lifting of the state of emergency; the release of all political prisoners under house arrest or detention in prison; and the lifting of the media embargo, to allow freedom of the press, national and international.</p>
<p class="contents">In the medium and long term, we must also examine the ways that the EU and other international bodies can help. So, I ask the Commission and the Council to support the following three suggestions. First, that the EU look very closely into our conflict resolution programmes and identify other innovative solutions to help reduce poverty. This is conducive to reducing the vulnerability of the Nepalese to the Maoist rebels.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would request that the Member States impose sanctions in their bilateral programmes. That would send a clear message that Member States do not approve of what has happened. However, we must be careful not to penalise the ordinary people, as that would alienate us from helping them.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must look at the diplomatic efforts we could make. That could include arbitrating between the monarchy and other political parties, so as to encourage them both to the negotiating table, where steps towards multi-party democracy could be made. Furthermore, we need to explore the possibility of sending a neutral third party, such as Javier Solana, the EU High Representative, or the United Nations, to formulate a road map to peace and democracy in Nepal. It might even be helpful to send a delegation from Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to stress the importance of the restoration of fundamental freedoms in Nepal, and the role we can play to encourage and support a democratic future. However, the EU must act with caution: there are dangers in this unstable time of aggravating a fragile situation. We must remember Nepal's fairly precarious geographical situation between India, Pakistan and China. So, this small country is very significant for regional security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have heard that the King has declared a state of emergency, dismissed the government, assumed direct power and suspended civil rights indefinitely. Since then the King has continued to suppress the media and potential opposition, detaining thousands of people, including politicians, student leaders, human rights activists, journalists, professors and other important public figures. A few have been released since then.</p>
<p class="contents">Nepal is relatively new to the concept of multiparty democracy, which it established only in 1990 with the framework of a constitutional monarchy. I enjoy and respect constitutional monarchies. At this time, Nepal reinstated previously banned political parties and increased the civil liberties of the Nepalese people. Unfortunately, its attempt at democracy has been fraught with difficulties. Over the last 15 years, the credibility of the Nepalese politicians has been repeatedly undermined with allegations of corruption and self-interest. They refuse to put Nepalese interests first; they have been putting their own first.</p>
<p class="contents">Politicians have proved incapable of ridding Nepal of a group of so-called 'Maoist insurgents' that was launched in 1996 to bring down the monarchy and the regime. The ceasefire they attempted to negotiate with the insurgents broke down in August 2003. The King's recent actions exemplify someone who, on the one hand, wishes to rid Nepal of terrorism and, on the other, wishes to bring stability to a country whose democratic actors have failed to achieve it. He has decided to take matters into his own hands. However, in doing so, he has played into the hands of rebel forces and has infringed upon the very rights he was purportedly aiming to protect.</p>
<p class="contents">Nepal cannot be allowed to regress to a system whereby the King is undisputed ruler and the rights and lives of his subjects are in the hands of one man. The recent chain of events is extremely worrying and reminiscent of the Nepal of the Rana oligarchs, a Nepal whose human rights record the world had hoped was finally going to be laid to rest. We in the international community must encourage the King to undo his recent actions. If necessary, this may involve suspending military aid to Nepal until the King finally realises that the fight against terror is an international struggle which is best dealt with in an open and democratic society, as opposed to the oppressive, closed, authoritarian state which he is sadly attempting to recreate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this period more than 11 000 people have been killed. In June 2001 the King of Nepal was murdered, along with other members of the royal family. His brother, Gyanendra, was crowned as the new King.</p>
<p class="contents">Gyanendra's democratic credentials have never been too obvious, quite the contrary. He has followed the line of aggravating confrontation with the rebels and he has side-stepped the country's political forces. In 2001-2002 a state of emergency was declared which led to an explosion of serious human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings and torture. Despite this, the King continued to enjoy the support of Western nations, including EU Member States, I am sorry to say. On 1 February this year, the King, supported by the Royal Nepalese Army, dismissed the government, assumed direct power and again declared a state of emergency. As expected, widespread human rights violations ensued.</p>
<p class="contents">This joint motion calls on the King to lift the state of emergency, to restore all fundamental democratic freedoms, including freedom of the media, and re-establish parliamentary powers. It also calls on the Council and the Commission to take practical measures such as imposing an embargo on military assistance to force the King to give up his dictatorship. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The events of recent weeks have left the European Parliament with no choice but to hold a debate on human rights violations in Nepal, a problem that has been escalating for many years. The Kingdom of Nepal, which is situated between India and China, is becoming ever more dependent on China, as that country is both its main trading partner and the main source of inspiration for the Maoist guerrilla movement. The latter is engaged in a struggle to overthrow the constitutional monarchy, and its aim is to establish a Communist state. The civil war in Nepal has already claimed over 12 000 victims, and the political situation is Byzantine in its complexity, although the information blackout means that we are not familiar with all the details. After the Prime Minister was dismissed, the King and the Nepalese army seized power and suspended basic constitutional rights such as the right of association, the freedom of speech, the right to information, privacy and property and the ban on illegal detentions. The King has prohibited criticism of the security services on the radio, on television and on the Internet. Censorship and persecution are part of everyday life. The Nepalese Government also disregards the rights of refugees, as it has closed the Office of the Representative of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Refugees Welfare Office, which provided assistance to Tibetans persecuted for their faith. Every year 2 500 people flee from Chinese-occupied Tibet because they wish to practice their religion freely and to study in their native language. An ever-greater number of Tibetans are choosing to leave the country because they feel increasingly threatened. The Nepalese Government, however, acts in violation of national and international law by handing Tibetans over to China. These Tibetans are imprisoned and subjected to unbelievably cruel abuse after having been deported to China.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the Government and the Maoist rebels have been accused by international humanitarian organisations of committing atrocities against the civil population. The debate this House is holding today will make it possible to identify the roots of the conflict. These can be found in an insane totalitarian, Communist and atheist ideology that denies the existence of God and treats human beings as objects, as well as trampling on their dignity and violating their rights. Nepal has a population of 23 million, and every second person is illiterate, whilst society is still governed by a caste system. What are needed are improved living conditions and education, not a civil war aimed at establishing a destructive Communist system.</p>
<p class="contents">The only options available to us are to increase awareness of the conflict and to use diplomatic channels, such as this European Parliament resolution, to insist that the Nepalese Government puts an end to the illegal arrests and other corrupt practices. We must also demand that the Nepalese Government protects human rights activists, journalists and political leaders from such practices. Public pressure has already resulted in a decline in persecution once before. Consideration should be given to the question of whether EU aid is in fact used to foster development and for humanitarian purposes, and there is also a need for action. Finally, I should like to quote the Holy Father John XXIII, who wrote that a threat to the family is a threat to the state, and that similarly, a threat to social order in one state is a threat to international order. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ladies and gentlemen, the previous speakers have spoken very knowledgably on the internal situation in Nepal, the lack of democracy in the country and its history. I should like to highlight a further point, namely the lack of media freedom, which has become particularly acute since 1 February 2005. We know for certain that censorship is taking place and that journalists are being dismissed and arrested, often without their families being informed. The Government has also barred private radio stations from broadcasting, and 800 journalists have lost their jobs as a result. As many Nepalese citizens cannot read, the closure of these radio stations means that they no longer have any access to news or to any radio stations other than the BBC. As if this were not enough, editorial offices have been ransacked and documents censored. This is a brief snapshot of the present situation in Nepal, and we must not remain unmoved by it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having said that, I would press for just as much effort to be put into resolutions and, above all, into robust measures to place political and economic pressure on China, which has been oppressing the Tibetan people for decades. The goal of Parliament and the other institutions must be to promote the defence of Tibet and its culture, and we should do so not just by denouncing the systematic genocide of the Tibetan people, which has been taking place for decades.</p>
<p class="contents">We must draw on principles such as non-violence, democracy, tolerance, solidarity, dialogue, respect and justice as a whole, without choosing, as often happens, however, easier or more convenient struggles with regard to upholding peoples’ right to self-determination. This principle knows no geographic boundaries, nor must it ever be subject to the dictates of the economy, or worse still, of finance on policy.

<p class="contents">I do not have to tell Members of this Parliament how important the respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law are in our relations with third countries. The Presidency’s declaration of 2 February is very clear: the European Union views the King's move as a serious setback for the prospect of a negotiated and democratically-based solution to the current conflict. The European Union troika, which visited Nepal only two months ago, expressed at that time its grave concerns at the rapidly deteriorating human rights situation. Since 1 February, Nepal has been experiencing a profound human rights crisis, as many parliamentarians have now underlined.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations has recorded more than 340 detentions of political leaders, journalists, human rights defenders and civil society activists. We, the European Union, will continue to press for the release of all those who remain arbitrarily detained, and we will use the opportunity of the forthcoming session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva to remind both sides to the conflict of their obligations under international law.</p>
<p class="contents">As Members may be aware, no European Union position has yet been taken on the issue of continued external assistance to Nepal, because the situation is very complex. The Commission's global approach to conflict prevention calls for us to ensure that Community instruments and programmes are directed towards achieving political and social stability and democracy. As we have frequently stated, development policy and other cooperation programmes provide the most powerful instruments at the Community's disposal for treating the root causes of conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">We have learned that conflict countries sometimes require more, rather than less, assistance, and applying blunt political conditions risks penalising the weakest in society. That is why we think that the basic objectives of EC cooperation remain achievable. Indeed, the priorities of support to poverty reduction, human rights and conflict mitigation are more urgent in the new environment. Now is not the time for us, for instance, to cancel our support to Nepal's National Human Rights Commission, provided this institution continues to operate as an autonomous and independent technical body, seeking to promote the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this does not mean that it is 'business as usual' in terms of donor support to Nepal, not least because of the new constraints faced in ensuring that all sides respect the donors' basic operational guidelines in the state of emergency as the conflict escalates.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the Commission has taken the following position. The delegation of the European Commission in Kathmandu will not accept any high level invitations from the King or from any of his cabinet ministers unless instructed otherwise by its headquarters. All ongoing EC cooperation activities are carefully reviewed and the situation in the field is constantly monitored. For the time being, activities continue but new appraisals or identification missions will not be launched for the preparation of the 2005 cooperation pipeline until further notice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission maintains extensive contacts on this issue with Member States and with other donors on the ground, and will participate in a meeting of like-minded donors during the week of 7 March in Europe to continue to seek a coordinated line.</p>
<p class="contents">As ever in such situations, the cost of conflict falls heaviest on the weakest in Nepalese society. I am thinking of the children denied schooling or forcibly recruited, the poor deprived of basic healthcare and shelter and the many victims of brutal violence. Whilst the primary responsibility for resolving the conflict in Nepal rests with the local actors, we must not abandon them now.</p>
<p class="contents">Working closely with the European Union Member States and especially with successive European Union Council presidencies, the Commission remains committed to pursuing all diplomatic, political, and developmental efforts that might facilitate the peace process and a return to democracy in Nepal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
