<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Carlsson, Gunilla (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, it is now ten years since Estonia won back its independence. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the world has become more secure, and our European home is now more dynamic and inspires more hope. The conditions for European cooperation changed radically when the Wall came down, and the EU has so far been able to live up to these.</p>
<p class="contents">The presence of a successful Western Europe and of political visionaries such as Kohl, Reagan, Thatcher and, for that matter, Gorbachev, is partly responsible for this success, but it was, above all, individual people’s longing for freedom which made possible this revolutionary change to the age in which we live. It was courageous men and women, both young and old, who feared reprisals but who loved freedom more.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a fantastic inheritance to have experienced this dividend of freedom and liberation. Let us remind people of the way in which democracy triumphed over dictatorship and oppression was exchanged for freedom. The enlargement process must be seen in this perspective. Just as the Coal and Steel Union succeeded in its task of securing peace in the participating countries of Europe, we must now make sure that the European Union increases freedom and the opportunity for more people to participate in freedom of movement and that it increases prosperity, promotes diversity and contributes to solving our common problems involving crime and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">This is probably not as dramatic a task as was once the task of reconciling historic enemies, but I think that it is at least as large a task, involving just as many benefits but being perhaps more difficult to carry out. That is precisely why it is my political group’s most important task of all to continue to fight for freedom and now to enable our fellow human beings in Eastern and Central Europe to participate on the same conditions as ourselves. In this way, we should also be showing, especially to today’s young people, that we believe in an EU that is able to change in order to live up to its own ideals.</p>
<p class="contents">This must not be some wait-and-see project. The EU’s commitment will be commensurate with the active work done by the candidate countries. I want to praise the Commission’s work on this aspect but still put a question mark over the Council’s ambition and ability.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to say a few words about Estonia, that fascinating little country on the Baltic. Through singleness of purpose, sound political leadership and cooperation, Estonia has come a long way in its preparations for EU membership. In my report, I tried to make it clear that, in many areas, the EU has a lot to learn from the Estonians, for example in the area of trade and within what we call the new economy.</p>
<p class="contents">In many respects, developments in Estonia constitute a success story in which an incredible amount has happened during the last ten years. I addressed the subject of security policy in my report. We cannot view enlargement of the EU in isolation or fondly imagine that the EU has powers it at present completely lacks. The Estonians, who also want to see themselves participating in NATO soon, are aware of this. The Estonians, who were oppressed, expelled from their homes and driven to despair under the Soviet Union’s Communist dictatorship, know that the only important thing is to defend freedom. Those of us in the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats share their analysis and support them in this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Greens here in Parliament are anxious about poverty in a country that has experienced a remarkably greater degree of prosperity since the liberation. I view the Greens’ amendment as an attempt to defend existing structures and a social model that have entrenched unemployment in the EU. I believe, for my part, that the economy of the EU needs more dynamism and less hegemony, and I do not therefore wish to support that amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a few words about minorities, mainly a large proportion of Russian speakers in the case of Estonia. It is not a straightforward issue. We are concerned here with power, prejudices and ancient wrongs. The precondition for integration and a successful sense of community is the successful rule of law, together with institutions and laws that are non-discriminatory. However, that is not enough. When it comes to practical work too, political leaders must take these issues seriously. That applies just as much in our own countries. Overcoming differences requires tolerance and mutual respect and takes time. In this respect too, Estonia is on the right road.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank those of my fellow MEPs who have been involved with this topic, and I also wish to extend my thanks to the Committee Secretariat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schroedter (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President – unfortunately I cannot greet the Council yet, although I have a number of things to say with it in mind – Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, amidst the squabbling over direct aid in agriculture or the future allocation of the Structural Funds, we sometimes lose sight of the fact that the project to heal our divided Europe is of historical importance and that its significance is such that it also determines Europe's standing in the world. More fainthearted talk of delay not only harms the project but also Europe as a whole. That is why I would call on the Council, together with Parliament and the Commission, to do all it can to ensure that the first new members are able to take part in the European elections in 2004. Given the current state of play in the negotiations, we are realistically talking about 10 countries. This also means that not just one Baltic country but all three will be involved. Should enlargement be delayed further then there is also the danger that the negative implications of this for the people in our own countries will cause problems. Even now the fact that increasing numbers of firms are relocating to neighbouring countries in the East because of environmental and social dumping is intolerable.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU's environmental and social standards can only be upheld, however, if there is actual membership. I will give just one example from Latvia: I think it is incredible that EU companies can permit themselves to boycott the social dialogue while the Commission simply stands by and watches. In any case, it is a characteristic of the enlargement process that the people's existing rights of participation play no part in it. Why are we surprised at the diminishing interest of the people in the accession countries if enlargement is practically solely a project of the political elite?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Verheugen, you mentioned the positive attitude of the national minorities towards enlargement. I cannot say the same for the Russian minority in Latvia. No debate of any kind is taking place in society about the successes achieved and problems experienced either in the accession process or with enlargement; neither is it a joint process. The communication strategy is to have separate projects for East and West and as such is ill-conceived even in terms of structure. It prevents people from getting to know each other. How many people in the West are aware of the European treasures in the Baltic cultures; how many know anything about what is of significance there? In our countries it goes without saying that projects in rural and urban areas are developed by the stakeholders. In the accession countries it is a Commission-led top-down process. Why do they not attach any importance to having the same quality of participation as is demanded here by the Member States? In Latvia too the administration is the weakest point and of course an administration is only strong if it offers a service facility to all of its citizens, regardless of their social standing and language. It needs to be able to organise and implement procedures to allow them to participate.</p>
<p class="contents">As a predominantly rural country, Latvia is particularly affected by the foolhardy project to export the EU's unsuccessful agricultural policy to the accession countries. Surely we all need to work together to convert direct aid into ecologically and socially sustainable structural development. It would be beneficial not only to Latvia but also to consumer protection and thus to the entire population of the EU and the accession countries. I should like to stress once more that in this whole process the social dimension is being wholly neglected. It is illusory to believe that processes of transformation in society can be managed by free market forces alone. We cannot ignore the alarming gulf between rich and poor. But we could reduce it if the idea of Europe were understood as a common political task for the people of Europe regardless of their region and social position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope and pray that Parliament and the Commission, the term of office of which expires at the start of 2005, will have the joy and honour of making these twelve countries members of the European Union in a new European configuration, the aim of which is obviously not to create new borders, but to create a community of states and nations working towards common objectives of peace, social prosperity and global collaboration. I think that, as a political objective, this is the major objective for all of us and we must all serve it faithfully.</p>
<p class="contents">I am the third rapporteur for the Baltic states. All three states have more or less the same problems, as do most of the candidate countries, given that they all have a history of the same socio-economic and political system and are now in a process of reform. What is special about these countries is that, until recently, the enlargement of the European Union only involved countries with similar social and economic systems. Now we are moving towards countries moving from centralised economies and state control to market economies and democratic procedures. In this sense, this move, which unites Europe ideologically and politically without forming borders which divide something between us which we should not divide, is most positive.</p>
<p class="contents">Lithuania, on which I am reporting, has the same general problems and two specific problems. One specific problem is the Ignalina nuclear power station and the second is Kaliningrad. I believe that every effort will be made at Ignalina to secure Lithuania's energy supply and deal with the secondary and primary repercussions on both society and the economy and I trust that things will go smoothly. As far as Kaliningrad is concerned, it is indeed here in this Russian enclave that the policies which give us the opportunity to create a new Europe will be judged and, even if it is not integrated into the same economic and political system, it will work with us, exist alongside us and share a common future with us rather than clashing with us.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sense, I believe that Commissioner Verheugen, who has demonstrated sophisticated political skills, will help move things along here. He has proven as much in other difficult cases because – let us not deceive ourselves – the real political problems will be numerous. I should like to refer to Cyprus, given that it has already been mentioned and even though it is not the subject of my report, merely to say that it is because of Commissioner Verheugen's correct political handling of the case that he says, yes, there is the issue of Turkey's occupation of northern Cyprus; however, at the same time, he says that Helsinki expects the accession of Cyprus to proceed irrespective of whether or not the question of northern Cyprus is resolved. Put simply, this is a message to all quarters that it is political Europe's intention to proceed on the basis of its own principles and perceptions and without allowing anyone to dictate how issues relating to human rights, democracy, international standing and international law are to be handled. From this point of view, I hope and trust that Commissioner Verheugen will do his very best.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as tomorrow is concerned, the crucial question is: what do we as Europeans hope for? A united Europe which integrates as it goes along or a microcosm of economic transience and short-termism? If Europe and its people truly want to achieve some sort of ideal, some sort of vision – and I believe that they do – then it must be a social and political vision, not a small-term or short-term economic vision. In this sense, I think that we should move towards this vision of an integrated Europe of peace, collaboration, cohesion and development and impart visions of this sort of Europe to our people, leaving aside petty confrontations on transient issues which have no future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Precisely now, at the most decisive moment when they should be making the final spurt towards the finishing line, when there is most need of enthusiasm and single-mindedness, the Poles, like many others, are starting to have second thoughts and to wonder whether the sacrifices required of them, the supposed costs of accession, will not outweigh the advantages, the potential and future gains.</p>
<p class="contents">A certain alarming scepticism is becoming rife which is in danger of threatening consensus on accession to the Union. Commissioner Verheugen mentioned this phenomenon this morning, and this is why we have tabled an amendment which I hope will be adopted tomorrow, calling upon the Commission to increase its commitment to European Union information and promotion campaigns in order to convince the Poles that their presence in Europe is essential for both us and them.</p>
<p class="contents">Factors which are certainly contributing to the scepticism of the Poles are a centre-right government which is about to come to the end of its term amongst difficulties and instability after a long period of clear, decisive action, and an economy which was the envy of the postcommunist world with consistently high growth rates of around 7 % per annum and which now, after the great dynamic progress of recent years, has started to show signs of slowing down. To these must be added the natural disasters which struck Poland this summer, floods and tornadoes which caused severe damage both in material terms and in terms of loss of human life.</p>
<p class="contents">The left, the postcommunists, the current opposition – which will have the majority at the elections on 23 September, that is in a few days – are certainly not helping to calm things down and are tending to throw oil on the fire and present a picture of Poland which is not particularly reassuring so that they can then set themselves up as the saviours of the homeland. Of course, when this same left comes to power, it will not do anything at all to change the resolute, competent action taken by the Polish government to make every endeavour to enter Europe as soon as possible. There is no doubt that the left is committed to taking this path because all the Polish parties – both right and left – signed an explicit agreement a few days ago committing themselves to working together<span class="bold"> </span>to this end.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not ignore the fact that there are still issues which need resolving, and we have listed them in our resolution; to cite some examples: environmental protection, which was totally disregarded and abandoned during the long period of communist dictatorship with the result that the environment is now in a pitiful state; improving air and water quality to European Union standards requires huge effort and investment which would be impossible without external aid or those transition periods to which Mr Brok referred this morning. With regard to the environment, I would like to say to some of the Members, who are rightly sensitive to the argument and who have tabled amendments, that I support the amendments for the most part but that I have not accepted them because they are too specific and go into too much detail.</p>
<p class="contents">Another well-known problem is agriculture, which is suffering the consequences of the Polish farmers’ heroic resistance to collectivisation under Soviet rule and is now extremely fragmented. For Poland, 26% of whose population lives in country areas, the restructuring of agriculture affects and involves many other sectors, starting with the need to create new jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">A further issue is that of the borders to the east, which will become the Union’s borders with Ukraine and Belarus. These borders will have to be open, on the one hand, but also totally crime- and mafia-proof. Commissioner Verheugen talked about that as well this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, we are sure that Poland will enter Europe as soon as possible, in 2004, and we are pleased to note that the Belgian Presidency – as we heard this morning – wants to give fresh impetus and new dynamism to the negotiations. Poland – the President-in-Office said – will enter, although it is more appropriate to say ‘will return to’ Europe, for it has occupied its rightful place in Europe for centuries and only a perverse dictatorship was able to deny it its true place in history and geography for many decades.</p>

Anyone who has read it will also realise that the criticism that came from the Right at the end of this morning's debate was unjustified. It does, in fact, contain a number of observations on these points.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to comment on the latest developments. In the past week it has emerged from the Czech Republic that the government has a very ambitious programme, namely that by June 2002 it wants to have met the accession criteria and therefore to regard the accession negotiations as closed. So far, 19 out of 31 chapters have been closed and by the end of the year a further six key chapters should be completed. Commissioner Verheugen rightly said that completing chapters is not the only thing that counts and that neither is it an indicator of how far a country is. Nevertheless, the Czech Republic is well on the way and we should not believe those who are confusing the people in the country. Only last week a leading Czech politician asserted that the European Union was a rigid, unwieldy and costly concern.</p>
<p class="contents">With your permission, Mr President, I should like to analyse these three erroneously employed concepts. The European Union is not rigid. If there is one constant in the European Community – which today is the European Union – then it is the desire for change and the possibility of achieving it. Since the Fifties, the European Community has been constantly changing and today we are even facing the possibility and necessity of enlarging this Union once more. Anyone, therefore, who says that this organisation is rigid does not know what they are talking about.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I turn to the charge that it is unwieldy. We should not confuse two different things here. Of course the European Union is a large entity, but it is, nevertheless, manoeuvrable. It can be compared to a great ship sailing across a wide ocean. It can be manoeuvred and yet it is large, like the European Union. The decision-making process is certainly lengthy in the European Union and it is sometimes tedious as well, but what do you actually expect in a Community of 15 sovereign states, where each state – and, incidentally, not least the small ones – is asked what its position is? Everyone has a say, and this is something which those circles in the Czech Republic should bear in mind. So the Union is not unwieldy and it is not rigid either.</p>
<p class="contents">The third argument, that it is costly, is actually the least accurate because the countries which freed themselves from communism would have had to undergo reform and a process of transformation anyway, regardless of accession to the European Union. There is a further point: there are two possibilities in the European Union, either you receive money or you contribute money. Those who receive money – and the Czech Republic is already one of them – actually ought not to complain at all. Those who contribute money have also shown over the last few decades that they fare very well when they pay money into the European Community or Union because somehow they always get it back again.</p>
<p class="contents">These three arguments are therefore purely and simply populist, to put it mildly. My final comment on this is that where cost is concerned there are also things which should not be measured or explained in terms of marks and pfennigs or euros. These people in the Czech Republic who are blackening the name of the EU have forgotten one thing, namely our founding fathers' prime concern: peace in freedom. This is something which up until now has prevented wars and, by the way, expulsion. Despite a number of points which are explained in my report, for example in relation to Temelin, the Czech Republic is making good progress. No one should take fright; Temelin is not an obstacle to joining the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, allow me to make one further comment which I already made last year in my report. I am from Saxony, which borders the Czech Republic; in the past in socialist times I was in the same boat as the Czechs and I should also like to be in the future, but in a different boat, a boat which the Czechs can help to steer. Admittedly, no one in the Czech Republic should think that the Czechs will be the only ones deciding where the boat goes because it is not the European Union which wishes to join the Czech Republic but the Czechs who wish to join the EU. Nevertheless, the Czechs are guaranteed to be one of those helping to steer the course of the European Union in the future.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wiersma (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the current Slovakian Government has, since 1998, made considerable inroads into the accession process. If Brussels was very sceptical at that time, the country is now joining the ranks of candidate countries that are first in line to join the EU. It is no longer playing second fiddle to the members of the so-called Luxembourg Club if one considers the number of concluded negotiation chapters. Credit where credit is due. To the Slovakian Government, but also to the population which has managed to sit and wait for far-reaching reforms, which also have their drawbacks, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">Take the unacceptably high level of unemployment. The high speed with which the negotiations have taken place is not merely a reflection of an energetic government. Slovakia is one of the smaller candidate countries and can therefore afford a higher degree of flexibility. The country is taking advantage of this. The support for EU Membership remains as high as ever, and it is fair to say that there is political consensus surrounding this issue in Slovakia. However, one can question whether a government of a different make-up would have managed to make the same progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, there are points of criticism. In the light of the Council’s and Commission’s strategy to conclude a number of negotiations next year, these points of criticism deserve extra attention. If Slovakia is to keep up with the frontrunners, an extra effort will need to be made in this connection. That is why, with all due respect, it is not so much the role of the European Parliament to be kind, but rather to give the right incentives. I have therefore adopted in my report many of the critical observations which my fellow MEPs have made in the various committees. These observations will hopefully speak for themselves as it is impossible to list them all here.</p>
<p class="contents">Slovakia is transposing EU legislation at a rate of knots, which, in fact, as in other candidate countries, begs the question of whether all these new laws can actually be implemented and whether sufficient, qualified staff are available for this task. This is all the more pressing in the sphere of financial control for which, admittedly, draft legislation has now been submitted in Slovakia, but in respect of which it is fair to continue to question the country’s aptitude to process EU subsidies in an adequate manner once it is an EU Member State. Fortunately, the Slovakian Government is in the process of recruiting additional officials, which, in itself, is a considerable step forward. Commissioner Verheugen was right this morning to declare this topic a priority, and I should like to give him my unqualified support in this. I should also like to provide him with the word ‘transparency’ as a key concept in this connection. In the spring, we were startled by the news of irregularities committed by a high official responsible for the distribution of EU monies. Needless to say, the Government took action, which is praiseworthy in itself. However, the inquiry is still under way. The matter should, in our opinion, be subject to a thorough investigation, particularly to establish whether this was simply one incident or whether this was a symptom of a more systematic phenomenon. We would, in this framework, also like to receive the initial assessment of the anti-corruption programme which the Slovakian Government adopted a while ago.</p>
<p class="contents">I have, in the past, regularly expressed my concern regarding the large discrepancies in income between the different regions in Slovakia. The country is not unique in this either, and it will soon have fresh opportunities to do something about it thanks to EU membership. Nevertheless, I cannot shake off the feeling that many plans take a long time to come to fruition. That is unfortunate because what matters is relations between rich and poor in Slovakia.</p>
<p class="contents">A worrying trend is that concerning the deployment of elected regional councils. This decentralisation is important from an EU point of view, because the country’s administration will become more efficient and democratic control will improve as a result. Parliament recently took a few decisions, but the Slovakian Government partners do not consider these to be satisfactory. That is why the coalition has come under pressure. A year before the possible conclusion of the negotiations, there is now the threat of a Government crisis, the implications of which are not entirely clear. We do not decide on the regional re-division of Slovakia. We can, however, ask that every effort be made to stave off a crisis. The present coalition has a job to finish, and the involvement of the Hungarian minority remains every bit as important in this connection. In fact, they themselves subscribe to this wish. Surely during further discussions on this topic, it should be possible to reach a final compromise which is acceptable to everyone. That means that everyone must be accommodating, for everyone is responsible for the cohesion within the Government. A free vote in Parliament is not always the best solution in this connection.</p>
<p class="contents">We continue to receive complaints about the treatment of minorities, and not only from Budapest. Progress has been made with regard to the Roma people. Nevertheless, we can continue to question the speed with which improvements are being made and the willingness of local authorities to commit themselves fully to these. Unpleasant incidents are still occurring. I repeat once again that next year, at the – what we hope will be – final assessment, the first genuine and concrete results of the Roma policy will be revealed.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be an exciting year for Slovakia, a year of hard toil in order to maintain the momentum of the negotiations, and we hope we will be able to pass a verdict on the end result next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, the Nice Summit, at which the European Heads of State and Government undertook to reform the Community institutions so that these could accommodate a Europe enlarged by a further twelve countries. We all share the conviction that failure in this area would damage the project of enlargement for many years to come. Secondly, the Göteborg Summit, which brought the Swedish Presidency to a close. In their conclusions, Europe’s leaders categorically stated that the process of enlargement was irreversible, having for the first time set a deadline at the end of 2002 for concluding negotiations with applicant countries that are ready, with the stated aim of these countries already being able to participate as Members in the 2004 European Parliamentary elections.</p>
<p class="contents">To this political commitment we must add the emphasis placed on the principle of differentiation, according to which the applicant countries will continue to be assessed solely on the basis of their merits. It is in this context that we should consider the report on Hungary’s accession to the European Union and developments in its application process over the last year. Hungary’s integration into the European Union is a truly national ambition for that country. Tangible proof of this is the agreement reached by all the political parties represented in the Hungarian Parliament in favour of accession and by the consensus obtained on first holding a referendum on this decisive step for their shared future.</p>
<p class="contents">By channelling all of its energies into fulfilling this national objective, Hungary has already been able to conclude negotiations with the Commission on a substantial number of chapters, (22 out of a total of 30), which gives us hope that negotiations on welcoming Hungary into the European Union within the 2002 deadline set at Göteborg can be concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">This fact, combined with the existence of a ‘road map’ of clearly delimited negotiations, is of great political importance, since it has not only enabled Hungary’s leaders and the Community’s negotiators to plan and undertake their work in line with the previously established timetable. It has also contributed to preventing a climate of anxiety and disillusionment arising in Hungarian society as a consequence of it being impossible to give commitments on deadlines for concluding negotiations on joining the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, with regard to developments in Hungary’s application procedure, the main aspects that I wish to highlight are obviously ongoing, although some new situations can also be mentioned. As for the former, reference must be made, first of all, to Hungary’s economic situation, which is continuing to improve, despite signs of the slowdown that are being felt everywhere. Gross domestic product growth stands at around 6% and exports continue to perform very well, as does investment in housing. Consumption, employment and foreign investment have also achieved very healthy figures. We can conclude that today, Hungary has a solidly developing market economy and if it continues to make progress in the field of structural reforms and in consolidating public auditing, it will be able to withstand the pressure of competition and market forces within the European Union, without having to jump through any hoops.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, inflation remains high, at around 10%, and the government must keep a close eye on this by implementing the appropriate measures for reducing pressure for price increases. There is also the situation of the Roma population, which remains difficult in spite of the progress that has been made under the mid-term programme. This is why we are warning that this programme must be complemented by immediate practical measures for social support in the fields of education, employment, housing and health, amongst others, in conjunction with representatives from that community, which will be jointly monitored with them. Some of these measures are already in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Mention must also be made of the need, which has been fully accepted by Hungary’s political leaders, to step up the fight against corruption. The approval and implementation of a very thorough package of legislation against corruption, to enter into force with immediate effect, should be emphasised. We are aware of the difficult situation inherited by countries in similar areas and with similar recent histories to that of Hungary, and we know that this battle must be fought throughout the European Union and beyond.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Hungary recently approved a law on protecting Hungarian minorities living in neighbouring countries, which evoked various reactions and controversies, particularly in Romania and Slovakia, where the largest of these minorities live and work. The Hungarian authorities have insisted that this new law does not have any extraterritorial effect and will not have any consequences that are not in complete harmony with the legal systems in force in the neighbouring countries in which these minorities live. In this regard, I must once again repeat what is stated in the report, which is that the Commission must provide an assessment of this type of law in terms of its compatibility with the Community acquis. The Commission must also appeal to Hungary’s spirit of good neighbourliness and cooperation with its neighbours and, in general, with all Member States. The fact that this law contains a provision – Article 27 – laying down the supremacy of Community legislation over its national laws and the fact that the Hungarian government has demonstrated willingness to hold bilateral discussions with its neighbours on issues of the law’s interpretation and implementation give me grounds for optimism about the resolution of any potential problems that it may raise.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in the short speaking time granted to me as rapporteur, I can only present the main conclusions of this report. I am nevertheless convinced that my fellow Members will agree with me in my interpretation, analysis, and support for this report. The European Parliament will therefore continue to make its essential contribution to the process of bringing together the European peoples and nations and of truly raising the awareness of the citizens of the Europe of Fifteen and of the applicant countries to the advantages and also to the obligations inherent in European integration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While there have undoubtedly been many areas of disappointment, three months ago there was a very dramatic political development in Bulgaria. In the general election on 17 June we saw the governing UDF routed by a new political force, the Simeon II National Movement, led by the former King Simeon who, as Simeon Sakskoburggotski, is now Prime Minister and will be visiting European Union institutions and NATO in Brussels for the first time next week. In the elections some 60% of the electorate preferred to vote for parties that were not represented in the previous parliament. It was a resounding vote of no confidence on the government in office, and a heartfelt demand for real progress, improvement and change: a leap of faith.</p>
<p class="contents">The previous UDF administration faced enormous difficulties and I wish to acknowledge its success in many areas. It was the first of the post-communist governments to see out its full term. It took forward Bulgaria's application for European Union membership and put Bulgaria in a position formally to open accession negotiations in February 2000. As a result, 11 negotiating chapters have now been successfully closed. A further 10 have been opened and are under negotiation. It is expected that five more will be opened this year. Only four chapters therefore will remain to be opened by the beginning of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">On the macroeconomic level there has been excellent growth in GDP. Bulgaria has been a pillar of regional stability, first through all the international difficulties with the Milosevic regime in neighbouring Yugoslavia, then the Kosovo conflict and most recently with the tensions in neighbouring Macedonia. Bulgaria has acted throughout in a manner supportive of European Union and NATO policies, but the regional instability has inevitably had an impact on the Bulgarian economy and on investor confidence in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">But the formal process of negotiation and the aspiration to take reform forward are clearly not enough. Certainly the Bulgarian political system has confirmed its democratic stability. Certainly structures have begun to be put in place to deal with the fundamental problems of weak administrative capacity, of corruption and of excluded minorities. The fact is that most of the people of Bulgaria, through all these difficulties and upheavals, have seen little improvement in their own lives and standards of living.</p>
<p class="contents">My report is in effect a final report on the performance of the last government and an indicator as to the problems that need to be addressed by the new administration. The challenge for the new government is to maintain its coherence and to translate its aspirations, its ambitious programme, into concrete reality.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very encouraged by what I have heard so far. The new government team, particularly concerning the economy, balances its vitality and enthusiasm with professional competence and a degree of modesty in view of the tasks ahead. The priorities for the government are continuity and the preparations for European Union and NATO membership, with acceleration of political and economic reform, concentrating on tax reforms to stimulate the economy, squeezing out corruption, reform of the judiciary, modernisation of the customs service and border security, and legal changes to ensure that Bulgaria has a functioning market economy through amendment of banking laws and improvement in the bankruptcy laws.</p>
<p class="contents">In many ways the new team offers a breath of fresh air. It has a clear agenda and is willing to consider novel solutions drawing on sound experience from other countries. It will be judged by the quality, rather than quantity, of its legislation, by its ability to implement its policies and by its determination to bring about real reform that will benefit the population at large in a tangible manner. At a time of regional crisis and an international economic downturn, this will not be easy. It is time to build the widest possible consensus for reform in Bulgaria.</p>
<p class="contents">Bulgaria previously set itself the target of concluding negotiations by 2004 with a view to European Union membership by 2007. Many regard this as ambitious, but not unrealistic. I have agreed to remove such references from my resolution for the sake of consistency with the approach adopted in the other enlargement reports. I do not support amendments which would seek to add further conditionality to Bulgaria's membership application. Of course each candidate country should be judged on its own progress towards accession, without any hidden political barriers and without having to follow the course of any other candidate country. I trust this House will give every encouragement to Bulgaria and its new government on the path to EU and NATO accession and support my resolution. I feel sure that the new government of Bulgaria will respond positively to the points that I have made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the moment, Romania has a unique opportunity, unequalled in modern times, to make very swift progress. For the first time in living history, it has a stable government, elected on a democratic mandate. It has clear political leadership, a greater understanding of the European Union's Community values and exceptionally good economic signals.</p>
<p class="contents">The reform process is under way under the tutelage of the European Commission and with the efforts the Romanian administration has made on the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> a larger number of chapters is under negotiation now than had been anticipated. If Romania continues to move ahead in this way and has the courage to undertake the painful political structural reforms, there is nothing to stop Romania joining the European Union without delay and it is pleasing to know that 79% of Romanians are enthusiastic about this prospect.</p>
<p class="contents">The accession process is continuing. The number of chapters is increasing and I am pleased to announce that the Commission could receive all the position papers from the Ministry by Christmas, if it is able to do so. Certainly that is what the European Ministry for Integration in Romania is hoping for. President Iliescu announced in Gothenburg that he hoped and believed that all chapters could be fulfilled during his period of office. We in Parliament are dismayed and I am sure others must be too, that the visa restrictions have not yet been lifted. The Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs are meeting today and I sincerely hope that they will come to the conclusion that visa restrictions are no longer necessary for Romanian citizens. It is pleasing to note that the German Ambassador to Romania last week opened the new embassy by laying the foundation stone and saying that this embassy will have no visa section.</p>
<p class="contents">The Romanian Government has decided to be judged by action and not by words. It has already done excellent foreign affairs work through Romania's chairmanship of the OSCE and made excellent progress in its relationships with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. It might be dogged by poverty, but good things have happened; industrial productivity has gone up by 17% and inflation is coming down little by little.</p>
<p class="contents">Romania's largest investor is still France, but other EU Member States such as Germany, Italy, Greece and the United Kingdom are coming in. It has at the same time been cementing its relationship with North America and particularly with the USA. But Romania's destiny remains in Europe and her future lies with NATO and the European Union. Perhaps Ceausescu's bitter legacy, however, was responsible for the fact that the political will for change was slower to emerge in Romania than in some other former Soviet Union candidate countries. Indeed, the treatment of children in Romania, as the Commissioner mentioned this morning, rapidly became a global media horror story.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, however, Romania is in the process of change, helped all the way along the line by the Commission's faultless work in Brussels and Bucharest and guided by long-term friends here in Parliament right across the political spectrum. We are working as a team to assist Romania in her progress towards the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner said on another occasion, the progress of integration is unstoppable. Romania is an integral part of that process and social change in the last few months has been rapid. Gay rights are now part of law, an anti-trafficking law has recently been passed and domestic violence law has gone through. A children's act, on children's rights, which will incorporate adoption law, both local and international, is now being prepared.</p>
<p class="contents">The high-level group for Romanian children is moving towards registration. This will incorporate a wise persons' panel to assess Romania's capacity to come back into the inter-country adoption world when the time is right. It is imperative that the children's act is not hurried.</p>
<p class="contents">Local adoptions have doubled in the last few months and 20 000 children are leaving special schools this week and will be going back into normal schools and normal life. That is tremendous progress. Here may I pay special tribute to my Spanish colleagues in the European Parliament, who have had many pressures on them from different families in Spain. I am delighted that the new Romanian Government has nominated very competent officials to review the problems that these Spanish families are facing. I will keep a very careful eye on this and report back to my Spanish colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Romania has much to offer the European Union and the world. Its deep-rooted knowledge of its early European status in the Roman Empire gives it every encouragement to work through these difficult times and in due course become a full Member of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, Ljubljana hopes to finish incorporating the Community acquis during the Spanish Presidency, within the second half of next year that is, maintaining the steady rhythm demanded by the current Belgian Presidency as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The Slovenians have been diligent in closing the chapters of the acquis, and they have succeeded in resolving some very complex issues, a prime example being the environment, for which they received recognition from the European visitors to Ljubljana. Slovenia surprised the European Union by concluding, before the deadline moreover, the negotiations on the free transfer of capital as early as spring 2001, despite some problems with opinion makers.</p>
<p class="contents">In Ljubljana, the difficulties which would arise for the Slovenian government in terms of public opinion if the dates were to be put back and the Slovenians, who were obviously very pleased to see the conclusions of the Gothenburg and earlier Summits, were not to enter Europe, were explained to the European guests.</p>
<p class="contents">As usually happens in the last stage of the entry of a country into Europe, the sceptics come out of the woodwork, but it is often a matter of internal political tactics. Slovenia is aware that it must settle the issue of the restoration of goods within the time frames specified, even though in some – quite clear-cut – cases, appeals to the courts have slowed the process down.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the time limits for the charges have expired in any case, and there are also delays in denationalising foreign capital.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, Slovenia is one of the countries where, despite macro- and microeconomic stability, foreign capital flows are very low and are often just the result of reinvestment from previous years. Greater transparency – a word used very frequently in this Chamber – was required in order to proceed to privatisation, so that the launching of companies, banks and enterprises on the market does not end up being a purely national affair, with foreign investors being kept at bay.</p>
<p class="contents">The privatisation rules have finally been fixed with the large banks as well, in which the State will continue to hold – for a certain period of time at least – a sort of golden share or what is known as the ‘veto’ holding. Foreign interest exists in this sector and negotiations are in progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Slovenia is currently working strenuously for stability in the central and southern region, and, following the disappearance of Milosevic, the issue has become a little less dramatic. There are psychological reserves in this field: “We have not yet set foot in Europe” reflect some observers, “and already international capital is threatening to restrict our sovereignty”. This is a development which is evident in other small ex-royal socialist countries. Nevertheless, Slovenia gives the impression of realising that it must complete opening-up of the market within the time frames laid down in the agreement with Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Various measures such as providing backup for the courts which are swamped with work or creating an ad hoc mobile group of judges<span class="bold"> </span>to support the district courts with the greatest backlog are speeding up the work related to the many outstanding civil actions, most of which concern precisely the issue of the restitution of goods and property.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s report bewails the sluggishness of the administrative system: laws have been adopted in this area too. Slovenia is prepared to amend its Constitution to bring it into line with the conditions for accession to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to relations with neighbouring countries, it has, notably, a cultural agreement with Austria in which it acknowledges the existence of a German-speaking community in the country and, not long ago – and this is a very important issue – the sea and land borders with Croatia were defined. They are currently being ratified by the two parliaments. These are the major events which have taken place in the area of cross-border cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The macroeconomic indicators are still positive and inflation and unemployment are below the European average, while the GDP is not far off the European average. Considering the preparations which have been made or are currently being completed, Slovenia seems well prepared for integration into the European Community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The motion for a resolution before you was adopted in committee by 55 votes to 2 with 1 abstention. It proves to be an account with many contrasts.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, it underlines Cyprus’ excellent performance in relation to the adoption of the acquis: 23 chapters have already been closed and the remaining chapters do not present insurmountable difficulties. On the other hand, the motion deplores the continuing division of the island. The hopes that the international community had placed in proximity talks, held under the aegis of the United Nations, were dashed last November by the unilateral withdrawal of Mr Denktash from the process. This withdrawal has been supported by Turkey to this day.</p>
<p class="contents">Although precious time has been wasted in the process of trying to find a solution to the political problem before accession, I can only recommend that the European Parliament adhere firmly to its previous position founded on International Law and justice. This position, which is also that of the United Nations, the Council of Europe and all the other European institutions, including the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, was confirmed on 10 May 2001 by the European Court of Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The political solution we seek cannot include the persistence of a <span class="italic">de facto</span> situation created by force. It must, on the other hand, turn the page on the past and resolutely face the future. The Secretary-General of the United Nations made a proposal to both the Greek and the Turkish Cypriots for a federal system based upon a democratic model that would respect the distinct characteristics of each of the parties. Such models work in many European countries – Germany, Belgium and Switzerland among others – where they have proven both their viability and their vitality.</p>
<p class="contents">Solutions to all longstanding issues can be found through the negotiation process, whether these issues be the reciprocal wrongs which have accumulated since 1960 (the problem of refugees, property, the retreat of troops, for example), with the support, as the need arises, of the International Community. Cyprus’ problems are not irresolvable if the political will is there to give a boost to proceedings now. The cold war is over. All the walls in Europe have been knocked down. The enemies of yesteryear have become our partners. It would be in the widely acknowledged common interest of all countries in our region, especially Turkey, to resolve this bone of contention.</p>
<p class="contents">Both communities on the island – and recent opinion polls are proof of this – want to be part of the European Union. Those who have chosen stagnation as their only strategy, maybe as a strategy for survival, should respect this will.</p>
<p class="contents">By guaranteeing a large majority to the motion for a resolution on Cyprus, the European Parliament will strengthen the negotiating position of Mr Kofi Annan. In late 2001 and early 2002, the General Secretary of the United Nations will have a last chance to make a breakthrough in intercommunity negotiations. If, however, his efforts continue to be sabotaged by one of the parties, history will forever condemn those who are opposed to international order. Should this happen, the European Union can only honour its engagement made at the highest level at Helsinki in December 1999, being conscious of the fact that a political settlement does not constitute a prerequisite for the accession of Cyprus to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, I can only call on the legitimate government of Cyprus to contribute steadfastly to the removal of obstacles to remaining problems so that accession negotiations can be settled before the end of 2002. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Parliament without doubt views the accession process of Malta, this small Mediterranean island at the interface between the European Union and Africa, positively and is supporting it constructively. The report is, on the one hand, guided by the Copenhagen criteria, which apply equally to all of the accession countries, and on the other hand, it examines Malta's special characteristics, which result from its island position and from its economic and social structure.</p>
<p class="contents">Malta's basic political situation is, of course, unchanged. Malta is continuing to fulfil the Copenhagen political criteria. Its institutions are democratic and function smoothly. There are no particular problems as regards human rights. The overall situation as far as economic, social and cultural rights are concerned is satisfactory. In terms of the economy, Malta is a functioning market economy and is in a position to withstand competition from the EU in the medium term, provided that it carries out the structural reforms that are still pending.</p>
<p class="contents">Malta is doing well in this field, with regard both to phasing out import levies on finished products by 2003 and abolishing the remaining capital controls by the end of 2002. The far-reaching privatisation programme which was adopted in 1999, and which includes plans to privatise major utilities over the next five years, is also heading in the right direction. The reduction of the budget deficit from 11.8% of GDP in 1998 to 5% this year is a positive and significant result, as are the positive developments in the economic data.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite oil prices, inflation stood at 2.4% in November 2000 and, after rising slightly in 1999, the unemployment rate fell to 5.3% of those capable of gainful employment. It should be borne in mind, however, that this positive process needs to be consolidated by a further cut in structural expenditure. The favourable progress that Malta has made towards joining the EU is also reflected in the stage that it has reached in the accession negotiations. With 17 chapters, Malta heads the list of those candidates which were able to open negotiations only in 2000. This shows that Malta has made up the time lost through the 22-month suspension of negotiations and is therefore well placed to be in the first round of new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Malta's general political situation is concerned, namely the different positions of the government on EU accession on the one hand, and the opposition on the other, not only has nothing changed but the views of the government and the Labour opposition have if anything become more polarised. As rapporteur, I can only note this with regret. Of course this does not mean that the European Parliament should ignore the position of the Labour Party, which would like Malta to follow in Switzerland's footsteps. Nonetheless, we must do all we can to safeguard the continuity of Malta's accession process and therefore to support a constructive dialogue with all its constitutive entities and at every level of its society.</p>
<p class="contents">The matters of particular concern to the European Parliament in relation to Malta's accession process, of course, include issues related to internal security and maritime safety. As far as internal security is concerned, Malta has now set out an effective policy to combat corruption and money laundering, which will allow Malta both to accede to the Council of Europe's Criminal Law Convention on Corruption and to ratify the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions and thus to respond to a short-term priority of the Accession Partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">In the environmental field too, we endorse Malta's efforts to support short-term priorities of the Accession Partnership to maintain clean air and water and to stem rising levels of waste, and are thus sympathetic towards Malta's policy to ban the use of plastic bottles. In my capacity as rapporteur I also showed sympathy for Malta's specific concerns about the free movement of persons and its fears of there being an influx of foreign workers onto its labour market. The Commission's concession on the free movement of persons takes account of this rather psychologically conditioned fear. Malta is not a country in transition. It has repeatedly referred to the fact that it should like to be treated on the same footing as the other accession countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's efforts to make sources of funding available here so as to make up for this shortcoming are to be welcomed. On the other hand, the Maltese authorities need to make the necessary preparations to enable structural and regional aid to be administered on a decentralised basis.</p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to turn briefly to the Council. Malta's position on the agricultural chapter should, I hope, also soon be on the table.</p>

After all, the European Union is primarily an alliance of constitutional states. That is why we are devoting a great deal of attention to the establishment of democratic institutions in the candidate countries, something in which the Council of Europe too, with its own expertise, is involved in an extremely constructive manner. We appreciate the difficulties involved in heightening democratic awareness in countries which have for many decades suffered under totalitarian regimes which brought them to political, social and economic ruin. Fortunately, a great deal of progress is generally to be observed in this field. All the more painful were the recent reports that the present Romanian Government is trying to ban an opposition party by means of judicial tricks. We have had similar experiences in Slovakia under Mr Meciar, which led us to suspend the accession process with that country. The question I should like to ask the Commissioner is the following: is it not time we also indicated to the Romanian Government that this type of suspension will ensue if it continues to take measures which contravene the rule of law? This illustrates that independent jurisdiction is particularly beneficial, as is the extent to which the police enforces the rule of law. The fight against corruption is being tackled bravely in many countries, and I should like to quote Bulgaria in this connection.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, strengthening society’s legal infrastructure is extremely beneficial. However, the concern for the integrity of civil servants, judges, police and administrators is often in stark contrast to the paltry salaries they receive, and I believe that this too should remain an area of attention during the accession process. European integration is multifaceted and embraces all levels of society. That is why the exchange programmes and town twinning associations have a practical value, as well as the use of specialist EU institutions, such as the European Drugs Monitoring Centre and the European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia in Vienna. A concept which, by the way, since Durban, has had all kinds of unpleasant connotations. That Centre too could play a role in integration and in solving problems in the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">My question to the Commissioner is: are these specialist centres involved in the integration of the candidate countries and do they have sufficient capacity?</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I share the Commissioner’s view that, where minorities and non-discrimination are concerned, the social integration of the Roma population – not just in Slovakia or Romania, but in Europe as a whole – is a very difficult task which requires an explicitly European approach. Mr Wiersma made his views known on this subject earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the Commissioner’s hope that the division in Cyprus will be resolved soon. If the Cypriot Government continues to do what it can in order to restore unity, the division will not be so much of an obstacle to the Government as it will be in the negotiations with Turkey. And I hope that Turkey takes proper note of this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite the difficulties, the work that has been carried out is considerable. It must be said that, on a technical level, the negotiators must be congratulated on the great efforts they are making and we also congratulate you, Commissioner. However, I would like to insist on two points that have not been forgotten but which, in our opinion, should be emphasised.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first instance, I am thinking of the social repercussions of enlargement. It seems that the Commission, the Council and the rest of us should take greater steps to face up to the disorganisation of society that will inevitably result and is already resulting from economic reforms forcibly imposed in the candidate countries. Restructuring of companies, privatisation, modernisation of working methods, which seem necessary to us, create unemployment, disrupt social protection systems and have disastrous consequences for families and individuals. Let us all make a greater effort to limit these social problems that could, if we are not careful, become serious political problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I want to stress concerns contact with public opinion, both in candidate countries and Member States. Negotiation should be left to the specialists. I would once more congratulate them on their responsible approach. However, the accession of a country to the European Union affects its whole population. Opinion polls show this. As the deadline approaches the amount of opposition increases, but so does the number of those who are concerned and anxious. We need to provide more information and explanations, making things seem as undaunting as possible. This is a huge exercise in public relations to which the Commission – and we ourselves as well, of course – should devote more effort. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Beneath the happy surface, however, there are of course anxieties, also on the part of the people in the candidate countries, and we must listen to these. As the Commissioner also said, these anxieties cannot be conjured away. We must not in any way postpone enlargement, but we must listen to countries’ requests for transitional arrangements, whether on the subjects of land purchase or the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">An agreement is only sound if both parties are satisfied. We must not make demands of others that we do not make of ourselves. I am thinking in this context, for example, of the environmental demands for waste water treatment with which Brussels does not yet, of course, comply. We must therefore be willing to listen to those countries which wish us to be flexible. Enlargement is not merely a gift to them on our part. It is also a gift from them to ourselves. We want them to accede to the EU with their values and their knowledge of what it means not to have freedom and democracy, for that is the most important thing of all. It is perhaps they who know most of all about this, for it is they who have experienced the loss of freedom and democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to emphasise two aspects: the treatment of cultural minorities, and information and communication in respect of the population.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union should be more than a market. It is also a community of citizens and, in addition, a collection of peoples and of smaller and larger cultural communities. The way in which human rights and the rights of minorities are guaranteed still leads to problems in some countries. Everything seems to run more smoothly on paper but, in practice, we see, for example, that, in most countries, the Roma are still really being treated like second-class citizens and that we are still being confronted with third-world situations which are on a par with the worst slums in Africa and in third-world cities.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the treatment of other minorities, what is written so neatly on paper and in laws appears, once again, not to bear any resemblance to reality. I would, for example, like to refer to the treatment of the Hungarian minority both in Slovakia and in Romania. It is not looking so good in practice as it is on paper.</p>
<p class="contents">Communication with the population is a major problem because people have substituted a spontaneous enthusiasm for Europe with a more critical stance. If no promises are made or promises remain unfulfilled, this critical attitude will naturally increase.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I do wonder whether the Commission is pursuing the right policy by not addressing the people in those countries in the language of those people. Is it safe to leave communication entirely to the governments? I have noticed that some governments do not even inform their own MPs, never mind whether the population knows what is being said at the wonderful <span class="italic">Infopoint</span> in Warsaw in all Member State languages apart from Polish. I wonder whether we are communicating or simply hiding? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must not ignore the fact that there are to be referendums in quite a lot of the candidate countries. I hope that people in the candidate countries read, in particular, that part of Mr Brok’s report consisting of the statements from the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for these, in my opinion, give due weight to what is really important to the individual citizen. I hope, however, that they do not read the part concerning the common foreign and security policy and, in particular, NATO membership. We all know that a common European defence would cost a fair amount of money. Calculations show that, for our part of Europe, it would mean a 50% increase in budgets. I dare not even imagine what it would mean for the candidate countries. I hope that people read the good part of the reports, and I hope that it is this, and not all the other parts, that will be pivotal to the enlargement process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To pick up on something Mr Haarder has already mentioned, our duty and responsibility is to the countries of eastern Europe, not because of the gift that we give them but because of the new enthusiasm and spirit that they can bring into what is becoming a stagnating European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular I want to focus on Hungary. As one of the leaders and front runners for enlargement, it has proved itself capable of throwing off the yoke of totalitarian communism and building a new market-based economy, creating new opportunities in education, improving its infrastructure and industrial capacity and developing its tourism and agriculture. It has already completed 22 of its 31 chapters of accession to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the implementation of the SAPARD programme to help further rural development and community development within Hungary. In particular, I call upon the Commission to help alleviate some of the difficulties the Hungarian negotiators are facing with internal bureaucracies within the Commission and speed up that whole process.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Belder (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President on the basis of the Christian idea of charity, I wholeheartedly support enlargement of the European Union. Much to my delight, the Communist system collapsed in Central and Eastern Europe in 1989. That happiness was generally shared in Western Europe at the time. It now requires a sequel, namely our aid to the candidate countries, to enable them to join the European Union and, in that way, actually return to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This line of thinking also shows realism, for the predominantly eastward enlargement of the Union benefits the Member States and candidate countries politically and economically speaking. Just to give you an example: after 1988, reciprocal trade experienced turbulent growth. The resolution following Mr Brok’s oral question is right, therefore, to underline the shared benefits of the enlargement process.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this view of enlargement is definitely not shared by everyone. This is borne out by recent opinion polls. These studies show a contrast between general public opinion in the candidate countries and that within the 15 EU Member States. In the candidate countries, enlargement is widely supported. In the Member States, however, only 43% of the citizens can muster any real enthusiasm. In fact, in a number of EU countries, those against outnumber those in favour by quite a margin. As if the burden and insecurities of this major enlargement were to rest on EU shoulders only.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, Mr Brok’s motion for a resolution does not take account of this imbalanced public opinion. It encourages both Member States and candidate countries to provide their populations with more and better information. I fear that that will not entirely cause the noted lack of European commitment to disappear. Whatever the case, the incentive in the resolution is mainly aimed at the Member States. However, those in favour are not alone by any means. The EU Member States are most definitely populated by scores of people who feel for Central and Eastern Europeans. The extent of their initiatives, private or church-based, since time immemorial, and often long before the fall of the Berlin Wall, speak for themselves. Members of the Council and the Commission: make sure you definitely involve these allies in your information campaigns on enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to turn to another point of the motion for a resolution which caught my attention. Paragraph 49 states that there is no need for candidate countries to meet stricter conditions than the Member States themselves. That seems to me to be self-evident. What is more, the European Union has explicitly restricted its admission requirements to compliance with the Copenhagen criteria. As long as the candidate countries cannot co-determine far-reaching cooperation in various areas of policy – such as the CFSP and the asylum, immigration and monetary policies – the European Union may not impose new criteria in these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, there is a saying in Dutch which means that the last mile is the longest one. This will once again be apparent when we complete the accession negotiations with candidate countries which have made most progress. After all, there are a number of difficult issues left to deal with. I hope that the European Union will know how to give a tangible sign of its willingness to enlarge. Moreover, to quote the well-known biblical saying, it is better to give than to receive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The merit of this text is that it takes the decision of the Irish people to reject the Nice Treaty seriously and does not disguise, and I quote, "the uncertainty” that this brings into “the timetable for enlargement". We are therefore very pleased to see Mr Brok himself include, in point 2 of his motion for a resolution, the recommendation made by us the very day after the Irish vote, to include alternative solutions within the framework of the accession treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it is completely unacceptable to exploit the result of the Irish referendum to justify the abandonment of the intergovernmental process. If current Intergovernmental Conference practice is often opaque and unintelligible, this is not due to the method itself which associates governments that have been democratically elected by their citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It would not be at all difficult to make the intergovernmental process more transparent and comprehensible. We must take practical steps to achieve this, keeping away from the pursuit of ideologies which, when we do not approve of a decision, lead us to conclude that, in order to prevent such a thing being repeated, the legal framework within which it occurred needs to be abolished by majority vote. This really would be a case of hallucinatory thinking, or, as our fellow member Mr Berthu stated last night, a regulatory illusion.</p>
<p class="contents">The lesson to be learnt from the Irish referendum is certainly not that we must make the process of European integration even more undemocratic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would add that this is already the case today. Nevertheless, it is our task precisely as one arm of the budgetary authority to discuss and engage in some serious and sober preliminary budgetary planning – at the same time allaying our emotions and fears – and to approach the figures in a rational way. On the basis of our experience with the pre-accession programme and given the take-up capacities and administrative structures in the new Member States, we can also assume that in respect of both agricultural policy and the Structural Funds integration into the Community programmes will be gradual.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis, even if ten new countries join before 2006 in a big bang, we will be able to meet the financial requirements of enlargement up until then within the financial perspective, as agreed in Agenda 2000: EUR 7 billion in the final stage for agricultural policy given gradual integration and from EUR 6.1 billion in 2004 to around EUR 10.9 billion for structural policy, and this compared with a current Commission preliminary draft budget of around EUR 100 billion for 2002 to put it in context.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt, however, that for the period after 2006, even taking into account compliance with future world trade obligations, we will very probably have to discuss the issue of revenue and expenditure in the European budget because in the final stages in 2013 these comparative figures could amount to EUR 17 billion and EUR 26 billion respectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not confine ourselves to looking at these two areas of budgetary policy. I have grave concerns about whether the Commission's reflections on how Europe is to be governed or the practical plans in this House to overcome the languages problem really do take sufficient account of the requirements which will need to be met if we really are to safeguard European national identities and preserve the ability of the European institutions to act in the interests of the citizens of a larger European Union. A further far more intensive debate needs to be initiated here to ensure that we are capable of acting in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Freedom and independence incite nations into action. This should also be the case with people, and the control of individuals over their own lives needs, of course, to improve. This is not a project for some élite, and this point must now become clear in these applicant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe's boom phase of economic growth has now ended. In the opinion of many we are on the way to a downturn, even a recession. This economic standstill will affect those applicant countries even more than our economies, since the former are considerably more frail. The popularity of the Union has, however, declined in many applicant countries such as Estonia to less than half of what it was, even before this economic standstill which has now taken place in Europe. The fact that a severe budgetary discipline has been followed is, in these Member States, seen as one reason for this. A downturn would reduce further the popularity enjoyed by the Union. For this reason then I ask, and urge as a priority, that we energetically seize the challenge of narrowing social differences and the social and economic gulf, since this is the base upon which we will be able to get the large majority of people in these countries to support membership. This also means that unemployment within the Union itself must not grow, otherwise it will erode the very base and the broad support for enlargement which exist here within the Union. In other words, the worsening economic situation may pose a threat to enlargement within the agreed or envisaged timetable. Therefore, let us get to grips with social inequality before this entire matter is pushed too far into the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We shall then be able to unite in solving the problems that exist and in creating good conditions of life for the citizens of Europe, and not before time.</p>
<p class="contents">It will soon be twelve years since the fall of the Berlin Wall, and many Europeans promised that those countries which had finally thrown off the yoke of communism would quickly be able to obtain membership of the EU.

Great progress is being made, and I am delighted that the Belgian presidency has such lofty ambitions. It is important that no more demands should be made now.</p>

<p class="contents">The future of the European Union is not and should not be enlargement, contrary to what the President-in-Office of the Council said in his introductory speech. The future after 2004 of an enlarged Union is uncharted territory. The Union could be a consolidated free trade area, or else a supranational Union where objectives of sustainable development and social cohesion are the fundamental objectives of a reformed policy.</p>
<p class="contents">If we fight for this second option, then the next Intergovernmental Conference in 2003–2004 will be the last chance for the Fifteen to correct the failures of Nice and assume their responsibilities so that a Union of 27 Member States can be governed democratically and effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is not, however, of a purely institutional nature: it is also a budgetary issue. If a policy of solidarity between the Member States is pursued, this means that, in the future, the Union’s financial resources will have to be increased for, in economic terms, the integration of the markets of the candidate countries with those of the Union has been taking place for 10 years at the cost of increasing territorial and social inequalities in the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Current European aid is essential and alleviates the cost of the transition, but if we really want to preserve a model of European society based upon solidarity and negotiation between all players in a 27-State European Union, there needs to be a clear commitment from both sides to this objective that exceeds the commitment to incorporating the Community acquis and will oblige each of the 15 current members to provide additional aid.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want enlargement to be a success whilst preserving our chances of an interdependent Europe, we must not, as Mr Verheugen rightly said, bury our heads in the sand. From this point of view, I am very shocked by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy’s rejection of the majority of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This House was pleased when in September 1998 the government of Malta informed the Presidency of its intention to reactivate Malta's application and since then, with the structures put in place by the government, Malta has demonstrated its sincerity and determination to become part of an integrated and enlarged Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming as I do from a small island state similar to Malta, I can testify to the EU's commitment to the development of small and underdeveloped peripheral regions. In my view, despite the many criticisms, the vision of Europe's founding fathers continues to be realised. I look forward to the participation of Malta and other applicant countries in the Europe of the new millennium. It is worth noting that by June 2001 Malta had closed negotiations on over 17 different chapters, including important issues ranging from education and training to telecommunications, fisheries and consumer protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, where the reunification of Europe is concerned, all of us are aware of its historical dimension and our own political and moral responsibility. It must succeed and it will succeed because it is right and proper.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the economic data show positive developments. Economic growth in Central and Eastern Europe continues to be above the EU average. The macroeconomic situation has improved. EU exports to the accession countries are on the up and the accession countries are already benefiting now from the accession negotiations because under this process they are also being given orientation aid for necessary reforms, which would have had to be implemented anyway after 50 years of Communist dictatorship, even if they did not have the prospect of joining the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, and the Commissioner touched on this, economic and monetary union – the euro – will not be achieved immediately upon accession. It is important that we point out that once the Copenhagen criteria have been fulfilled, the Maastricht criteria will need to be met – without any opting-out clauses and that this will probably require at least another three, four, five or more years.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, money and balance sheets are, after all, not the be-all and end-all. The economic indicators are positive, but they are only a means to an end and not an end in themselves. We said this today in the debate on the Middle East: a means to an end which is to create peace, provide security, guarantee social stability, build up a democratic polity and safeguard growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, there is much to be done: to meet the stability criteria, to regulate state aid, to remove regional disparities, to reform pensions, social security and health services, to make rapid progress on privatisation, and to guarantee the independence of the judiciary and the public authorities. We have reached an important stage. We look towards the goal with optimism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is crucial that the EU send out a signal that we desire enlargement for our own sakes. It is also important, however, that there should be broad grassroots support for the project among the populations of the candidate countries. It is, of course, the countries themselves that must hold the debates on membership, but it is also our task to ensure that the conditions are of such a kind that this development is perceived as progress by the populations of the candidate countries too and that they are not given the feeling that it is a case of the strong riding roughshod over the weak.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement must therefore be based upon mutuality, respect and equality. Above all, we must, for our part, understand that there will naturally be changes to the way in which the EU develops once new countries and people come on board. Their starting points are not always the same as ours, and it is precisely that fact which can also be a source of enrichment for us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to make one crucial point. The key to the enlarged community has to be the integrity of the single market. We must ensure that the complete integrity of that single market will emerge at the end of these negotiations. If it is not the case, then there will be considerable resistance to enlargement from businesses in the Community and from the workers in the Community who feel themselves disadvantaged.</p>
<p class="contents">I take one particular example. Recently in the Czech Republic there was restructuring in the banking sector. One of the major banks in the Czech Republic – IPB – was forced into administration and this was done to the benefit of another bank – CSOB. There appears to have been some use of state aids to support the position of the CSOB in order to support the position of a private sector rival to the IPB. Clearly that whole saga is very unsatisfactory. It is not transparent and it is not in accordance with the terms of the association agreement. We must ensure that those sorts of events do not continue to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">As chairman of the joint parliamentary committee, I should also like to say a few words in relation to Lithuania. I welcome Mrs Souladakis' report. It is clear that the Lithuanian government has made enormous strides to catch up. I am very hopeful that they will be alongside the original group within the next 12 months. But again, they have to ensure implementation of the single market, particularly as regards counterfeiting in the audiovisual sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Very vulnerable women, at that. Let us not forget that most accession countries are also countries of origin and transit of trafficking in women. Let us also, therefore, discuss women for a change, as opposed to farmers, employers, trade unions, and the like. Let us talk about this large majority whom we wish to make Europe-minded and not frightened of Europe. If we do not devote any attention to that group, things are bound to go wrong. We therefore need to set up a proper information campaign by means of which women’s organisations, but also all individual women in the country or in the cities, can be reached for the purpose of explaining, among other things, the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> as it relates to women. In that way, Europe stands a better chance of being accepted, and the situation for women will improve considerably.</p>

For reasons of solidarity, therefore, we must vote against the reports. We do not want to be accomplices.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Cyprus is concerned, we have taken note of the positive points in the Poos report, which is why we shall abstain rather than vote against it. However, our general political position, as stated above, also applies here. We also note that the pre-accession procedure, especially post-Helsinki, has not only failed to resolve the Cyprus question, it has encouraged Ankara and its vassal Denktash to take an even more intransigent stance. We are particularly worried by the fact that accession negotiations are being used to pressurise the Cypriot leadership into accepting a federal solution, i.e. into legally recognising the invasion and occupation of Cypriot territory and totally abandoning the relevant UN resolutions.

The issues that are around in our countries are a fear of immigrants, anxiety about loss of jobs and concerns surrounding the relocation of businesses. Those issues are equally present in the candidate countries, where joining the European Union is measured by the acquisition of, and increase in, income and by employment. If we study the latest employment figures in the Central European countries, we see that employment has fallen everywhere in 1999 and 2000, except in Hungary, Lithuania and Slovenia. This is why it is vital that we give our attention to this development. As far as social policy is concerned, I should like to talk mainly about two points. I tend to think along the same lines as Mrs Maes. Paper is accommodating, but one must also learn to read between the lines and look for the hidden meaning.</p>
<p class="contents">I should first like to turn my attention to social security. The great danger is that traditional social security will be dismantled before the new system of social security is operational or is fully operational. As a consequence, a whole generation of people will not be able to benefit from either system. My experience and the discussions I have had in a number of countries show this to be true. This is a terrible prospect, since it indicates that a large group of people are becoming poorer. These people compare the situation with the previous one and feel that they are worse off now than in the past. That is the first point and I would ask the Commission to focus much more closely on the problem of social security than it has done to date.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to mention the organisations which are being set up and developed by the social partners. Again on the basis of my local contacts, my observation is that here too things are progressing with great difficulty and very slowly. So, we must once again look beyond the words and face reality. Let us help them and let us help the social partners to help each other. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that I work closely with Minister Michel, but full metamorphosis has not yet taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to begin, ladies and gentlemen, by apologising for the fact that I arrived a little late and was not here promptly at 3 p.m. That was because I was also taking part on behalf of the presidency in the Conference of Committee Chairmen. Since I do not have the gift of ubiquity, I could not be here on time, for which I again apologise.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, many of you have referred either during this morning’s speeches or in the (incidentally very interesting) reports that you have introduced – usually with much pleasure and sympathy – to the contacts you have had with people in the candidate countries, the visits you have made, and so on. The same applies to me. I have been visiting the capitals of all candidate countries with which we have entered into negotiations at least once and, in certain cases, twice, three times or more. It is true that that creates a bond and leads to a more than purely theoretical political interest in the countries concerned. I find it almost touching to see how you, in your progress reports, are concerned almost like godparents with the welfare of the candidate countries on which you have to report. I should, by the way, like to emphasise that this Parliament, in its successive constituent forms, has been one of the great engines of enlargement. An engine that has never misfired and never stopped, and I believe that you can wear that badge with pride.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is more. I should like in particular, not only echoing Mrs Lalumière, but also because it reflects my own feelings, to congratulate most sincerely the Commission, Commissioner Verheugen and his department on the gigantic task of negotiation that they are carrying out. At present, they are conducting over 300 different sets of negotiations. You have only to multiply the number of headings by the number of Member States. Of course I know that there are parallels, but two cases are never entirely similar.</p>
<p class="contents">Public opinion, which is scarcely aware of this because it is insufficiently informed, therefore thinks that accession is taking so long because we are either having second thoughts or because we have not taken particularly effective decisions. It has no clear idea of how complex this whole matter is. That is not the fault of public opinion. That is the fault of all those, including ourselves, who have not told the public the facts.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the work is not yet complete, it has been said that the end is in sight. As a result, tension is rising, of course, as are the number of sweepstakes on who will be crossing the finishing line first. I agree entirely with Commissioner Verheugen that it would be wrong of us to speculate at this point on which candidate countries will be in the first wave and which will not. It is still far too early, but we must all start discussing together how we can effectively translate these accessions into reality. I would like, if I may, to tell a little anecdote here to highlight just one aspect of all this: when Sweden, Finland and Austria joined – and that was also a chronicle of a much-heralded fact that had long been known about – there were nevertheless insufficient interpreters and translators. That problem will, of course, become even more complex, but all the institutions will have discuss this too in good time.</p>
<p class="contents">I said this morning that enlargement is the future of the Union. Mr Jonckheer, a compatriot of mine but from a different party, has denied that, saying that the future is uncertain. I repeat what I said this morning. I must add that I did not say this just for formality’s sake. I said it because I am firmly convinced that it is true, although I am just as prepared to say that the future will not be limited to enlargement, but that is the first great challenge that we have to meet in the near future. That is absolutely certain.</p>
<p class="contents">My country’s Prime Minister shares this view, and in fact will undoubtedly be providing, and I say this to you very definitely, a role for candidate countries in his proposals for the preparation for the IGC. This is in answer to a concern expressed this morning by group chairman, Mr Poettering.</p>
<p class="contents">During the so-called “Gymnich meeting” at the end of this week, the candidate countries will be taking part in the discussions on the future of Europe. During the informal Council of Ghent and, of course, during the European Council of Laeken, enlargement will be discussed at length. It will be approached in the spirit that Commissioner Verheugen and I myself set out and also in the spirit which you have supported almost without exception in your respective speeches. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Swoboda (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, the enlargement of the European Union is certainly the most fascinating and most important project that we are working on. I fully agree with this. In this respect I believe that the future is certain, as you said; the timing may not be quite certain but it will happen and that is good, that is important. This should not, however, blind us to the fact that there are still a number of problems which need to be resolved in the process or that enlargement in itself will also create problems which we will need to overcome, and which must not be a reason to delay or abandon the process.</p>
<p class="contents">One of these problem areas is, without a doubt, the social issue, which has already been mentioned by previous speakers, because the accession of the enlargement candidates will also make the gulf between rich and poor within the European Union wider. It is not because the rich are now becoming poorer but because these questions are being posed afresh in the Union; consequently cohesion policy will gain a new and even more important task. Where rich and poor meet, in particular in the border regions, this will of course also lead to problems because amongst the rich there are also pockets of poorer people and less qualified workers who feel threatened. Solutions need to be found here. I am very grateful to the Commission and the Council for identifying a reasonable standard which is to be applied flexibly and for as short a period as possible because the aim is integration. Integration means living together, not only living alongside each other but living together and growing together. This is an important task which we need to carry out together step by step.</p>
<p class="contents">A second problem which I should like to touch on is the problem of minorities. Increasingly, of course, we are all living in a continent of minorities. The protection of minorities is an important task which we have not yet fully achieved in the existing Union either. Although it is legitimate to protect these minorities, we must, however, also endeavour to prepare the people to live in one united Europe and not create new privileges. I say this because I have been looking in particular at Hungary and the legislation there may run the risk of creating certain privileges for the Hungarians on the other side of the Hungarian border, that is in the neighbouring countries of Slovakia and Romania. I believe that we should be cautious here; protection of and solidarity with the Hungarian minorities yes, but no new discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">While I am on the subject of discrimination – and this is my final point – I should like to add that in quite a number of areas, and this is a major achievement of the work we have done together, discriminatory laws have been abolished and, for example, discrimination on grounds of religion, gender or sexual orientation has already been outlawed, including in Romania. The fact that this is still in the report means, at least according to my information, that it is already out of date because a law has been passed which abolishes discrimination against homosexuals. This just goes to show that everything is in flux and that our joint efforts have already improved the situation in Europe, even before enlargement.</p>

Today Commissioner Verheugen said that to live in Europe is to live with compromises. To my mind these are crucial to European values. It is for the vast majority to make compromises for the minority. Therefore I was unhappy when I learnt that the European Parliament rapporteur on Slovakia had accused the Hungarian minority parties of setting ultimatums and using methods that are used only in wartime when they made their future in the government dependent on an administrative reform.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur's remark seems very unfair and does not take note of the different steps in the development of self-government at different levels, nor is it consistent with the views expressed by the Prime Minister of Slovakia. The Hungarian political representatives have, in spite of the adoption of new administrative borders that were promoted by nationalist and left-wing parties and deprived them of chances of adequate political representation, signalled that they are ready to continue in the government but that their future participation is dependent on giving real content to the administrative laws. That is what we are asking for in Resolution No 39. We should refrain from unfounded accusations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Anyone who takes a bird’s eye view of Europe can see very clearly where the old borders between East and West run. This means that the EU and the EU’s Member States have a lot to gain from contributing to investment in better road and rail networks in the candidate countries and from ensuring that these are linked together with the networks in the rest of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">For a country such as Poland, which the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has studied from a transport point of view, that is quite obvious. Poland is far and away the largest of the candidate countries and, in the last ten years, it has invested extensively in improvements in roads and railways.</p>
<p class="contents">We often talk in East-West terms within the EU but, where a country such as Poland is concerned, it is probably just as important to see the issues from a north-south perspective. Poland is now already one of the most important countries in Europe when it comes to transport between North and South in Europe. Clearly integrating Poland into the EU’s transport system is the same as broadening the waistline of Europe. North-South transport would obtain a wider range of possible transit routes. This would ease the burden on Germany, which is something positive – especially from an environmental point of view – and it would also increase competition, which is good for trade.</p>
<p class="contents">On the day when Poland, together with other candidate countries around the Baltic, becomes a member of the EU, we shall also jointly be able to make greater demands in terms both of marine safety and of the management of the sensitive environment in the Baltic. There is therefore a lot to be gained from Poland’s becoming a member of the EU once the negotiations have been successfully completed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clearly a means; I would go further, it is a means within a group of means.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, the other means are: political deepening, economic and social cohesion and budgetary sufficiency. The success of enlargement depends on whether these three elements are clearly present.</p>
<p class="contents">If it is a means, what is the end? That people live better, qualitatively and quantitatively, in the countries of the current Union and in the candidate countries. This is therefore true in the case of a country such as Bulgaria. We hope that during the next political stage which that country is going to experience after the latest elections, the Europeanist will and effort shown so far will remain as strong and that, furthermore, essential actions will be strengthened in various fields.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, in the political field. We must say clearly to the Bulgarian Government that this Parliament would not even consider voting for an accession agreement while, for example, Article 157 of the Penal Code remains in force, which establishes unacceptable discrimination against homosexual citizens in Bulgaria.</p>
<p class="contents">We clearly also have to ask the Bulgarian Government to make progress on the reform of judicial power, on the fight against corruption, on improving the social living conditions of the citizens and, particularly, on the fight against unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also ask for progress on the protection of the environment and, above all, for compliance with the commitments made so far on the closure, within certain time limits, of units 1 to 4 of the Kozloduy nuclear power station.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we want to say to Bulgaria that it is this Parliament’s desire that it be well incorporated into the European Union and on time, but, of course within the political, economic and social framework established. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot afford to close our eyes to the reality.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot politicians sitting alongside us as parliamentarians in this Chamber and to the creation of a bi-zonal federal state. But in discussing this issue, it is not acceptable simply to say that the problems of Cyprus started with the Turkish invasion in 1974 without mentioning the divisions of the island from 1963 when Greek Cypriots murdered Turkish Cypriots.

Our committee calls for a more developed schema governing the future representation of the candidate countries in the European Parliament than is provided for in the Treaty of Nice. We call for the discrimination against Hungary and the Czech Republic to be rectified and we think it is necessary for provision also to be made for the period after the 2004 European elections for any candidates acceding then.</p>
<p class="contents">Other important concerns of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs relate to the candidate countries' participating as soon as possible in the so-called post-Nice process. A constitutional reform in Europe without the participation of the future members is politically indefensible. Of course the candidates will not be able to have an equal say in the decisions for as long as they are still candidates, but they will be affected and we should therefore also attach importance to their opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee continues to be in favour of actively involving civil society in the Member States and the candidate countries in the process of reforming our future institutions. A prerequisite for this will be high-quality, comprehensive and above all not only one-sided information. A further concern has obviously already reached the ears of the Commission. Commissioner Verheugen already mentioned in this morning's debate that the application of Community law will be a priority in the ongoing assessment of the candidates' readiness to join the European Union. We can only fully agree with him.</p>
<p class="contents">I have mixed feelings about another comment which Commissioner Verheugen made this morning. Commissioner, you said that the border regions would spearhead the EU enlargement process. In the light of the great restraint being exercised by the Commission where support for border regions is concerned, I fear that some border regions may see themselves as spearheads in a different sense, in the sense that they are being speared. Perhaps here too it will be possible to find a solution by working together constructively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Stenzel report gives us an excellent description of all these developments and I fully endorse it. However, there is the problem of why a significant proportion of the Maltese people, all of whom we welcome with open arms, has a number of objections and concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, the agricultural population totals 1000 people and agriculture is a problem for Malta and for these 1000 people. Perhaps they are worried that, because it is so small, a property developer could come and buy up the whole of Malta. Some other nations are worried about their cultural identity. The vision of Europe which we impart must be a vision which safeguards all the rights of the nations which accede at a later date, be they cultural, economic or social.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sense, because our debates are often highly technocratic and focus solely on indicators, Maastricht, approximations and so on, we should understand that, for these nations, most of whom are experiencing economic problems, the economic factor takes precedence. If we want to bring these nations – and our own nations – on board, we need to show them a Europe of security, peace, culture and individuality, not just the sexual individuality which is often the subject of debate, but cultural individuality, because people do not just have multiple sexual needs, they also have multiple spiritual and cultural needs and linguistic diversity. In this sense, I think that Malta, which is Europe in miniature, is a good prospect; at the same time, however, we should use Malta to look at other aspects of our policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In other words, these countries have to harmonise their national legislation with the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>in the area of sexual equality, on the one hand, and develop institutions and mechanisms which allow appropriate policies to be applied on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear from the opinions of our committee that women everywhere have difficulty accessing the job market and are under-represented at the centres of power. They also refer to specific problems such as high unemployment in Lithuania, the Czech Republic and Latvia and violence against and human trafficking of women in places such as Hungary, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Turkey. At the same time, we have welcomed positive achievements, such as state mechanisms in Lithuania to facilitate suitable policies and the employment rate among women in Cyprus, which is close to the Community average. Moreover, as the rapporteur Mr Poos mentioned, Cyprus is top of the league of negotiating countries and meets all the economic and political accession criteria. Consequently, we are entirely justified in believing and hoping that Cyprus will become a full member of the European Union as soon as the pre-accession procedure is completed even if, despite our efforts, no solution can be found to the Cyprus problem in the meantime, due to Turkey's intransigence.</p>
<p class="contents">What our committee is calling for, Commissioner, to come back to women, is for candidate countries to take part in Community programmes which help safeguard women's rights and for civil society, and especially women's non-governmental organisations, to be encouraged to take part in these programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At some point in their history, these nations decided never again to allow themselves to fall into the cesspit of genocide. At the same time, they abolished the diplomacy of threat and pressure and replaced it with the language of reconciliation, compromise and understanding in good faith. Primarily, enlarging Europe can only mean one thing: extending the application of these principles. And nowhere in Europe today is there a more pressing need for the application of these principles to be extended than in Cyprus, whose history of violence, threat, blood-stained borders, military occupation, armed reckonings – all the situations from which Europe has drawn back in horror – is repeating itself for both nations living on the island.</p>
<p class="contents">The upshot of this for northern, Turkish-occupied Cyprus has been economic ruin and the abolition of political freedom for its people. They live under a military regime in the guise of a pseudo-democracy. In southern Cyprus, which constitutes the internationally recognised Republic of Cyprus, and which functions as a true democracy, even if it is handicapped by the Turkish occupation, the economy is flourishing, prosperity is increasing and all the economic and political criteria set in Copenhagen have been met; however, the people are deprived of the natural, supremely human right to travel around their country, to return to the houses in which they were born, to their small villages, to travel the length and breadth of the country without coming up against barbed wire, road blocks, divided towns or armed soldiers ready to shoot.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these circumstances, the accession of Cyprus into the European Union, which should not be delayed, will also bring new peace to international relations between Greece, Turkey and Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean in general – the European Union's blessing on all three countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They also seemed to me to be very critical. That is why, with your permission, I should now like to highlight two positive points which present the overall picture in a perhaps more favourable and also, in my opinion, a more realistic light.</p>
<p class="contents">In many reports – and the same is true of the report on Latvia's application, there is a statement at the beginning which is simple and which is important but which cannot be taken for granted. Latvia satisfies the political criteria for membership of the European Union. This simple sentence represents splendid achievements, achievements which deserve respect and recognition. In the light of the difficult situation which these countries were in at the outset and the complicated basic conditions, satisfying the first Copenhagen criterion is a remarkable result. This is especially true for the three Baltic states which, compared with all of the other candidates, were forced to a far greater degree into the totalitarian structures of the former Soviet Union. This applies particularly to Latvia, given the complicated ethnic make-up of its population. It is precisely against this tragic historical background that the systematic and continuous efforts of its parliament and government to integrate all of the country's inhabitants into society deserve our respect and support.</p>
<p class="contents">Latvia is also an excellent example of how clear political prospects for the future can strengthen and accelerate social and economic development. On 15 February 2000 the accession negotiations were formally opened. In the same year, growth of 6.6% in gross domestic product was achieved and in the first quarter of this year growth even reached 8.2%. These are just a few of very many other indicators which point to the opportunities – the opportunities to create political stability and economic dynamism – which enlargement brings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to start by thanking the chairman of our Committee on Foreign Affairs, Elmar Brok, for including important points from the various committee opinions in the joint motion. As joint draftsman of an opinion on behalf of the Committee on Fundamental Freedoms and an opinion on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I am one of the few members of the committees required to give an opinion who has been able to take the floor in this debate and I do so in order to voice my criticism of our in-house procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the timing of the debate. I think that it would have been better to wait for the Commission's next progress reports. Secondly, it is a great pity that only a few of those reporting on individual countries for the Committee on Foreign Affairs have taken note of the opinions of the other committees and that the draftsmen of these opinions were not automatically allocated speaking time during the debate, as is our custom in the House.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, I am delighted that a number of very important points raised by my committees have been included in the common opinion, including the all-important Article 13 and the <span class="italic">acquis </span>developed in the meantime in order to combat discrimination. I think enlargement negotiations should attach equal importance to this and, for example, internal market legislation. I also believe that it is important to note that the motion calls, for the first time, for the security of the external borders of the enlarged European Union to be a Community responsibility, rather than the sole responsibility of the country on the border.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, one further request, this time in my capacity as an Austrian member. I think Mr Schröder has written an excellent report on the Czech Republic and I should like to ask the House to support him on all counts.</p>

It is, however, not an end in itself, but a means towards political, economic, cultural and civilisational ends. Enlargement must mean more and better Europe and not less Europe, even if it increases in area and territory. Enlargement must be supported and well received by national public opinion. Public opinion in many countries is favourable towards enlargement for reasons other than simple economic calculations and national self-interest. These countries hope that enlargement will strengthen Europe and will be fair and, unless this happens, they will feel cheated. For example, and if we take account of the opinion polls, the Portuguese are clearly more in favour of enlargement than – irony of ironies! – the Belgians, the French and the Germans. Why should this be the case? It is because the Portuguese have benefited from the support of the European Union at a crucial time in their recent history and feel that other Europeans share this right. These very Portuguese citizens would not have the same attitude, however, if they were afraid that enlargement might weaken the European project and harm Europe’s internal cohesion. I am delighted at the orderly, methodical and smooth course of the negotiations, but the hard core of the trickiest dossiers has still not been broached. Some Members have recommended today, in this part-session, that the ten applicant countries should join the European Union by 2004. I think this is too soon. We must not delay the process of accession through expedient measures, neither should we rush things. We must respect the pace of each applicant country.</p>
<p class="contents">In the 1930s, the celebrated French writer Paul Valéry, coined the famous phrase, which said, and I quote, that civilisations are now aware of their mortality. He also pointed out that Europe’s greatest weakness was its inability to form a political entity with powers that are both solid and legitimate. This is the problem.

Slovakia is an example of how, with political will, a country initially at a disadvantage, in this case a country which, under the Meciar regime, lost nearly four years compared with everyone else, can catch up with the other countries negotiating for accession and join with them in resolving problems quickly. What is most impressive is that Slovakia has successfully stabilised its economy over recent years and has started and, in many cases, completed comprehensive structural reforms, including privatising the banks.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the European Union also needs Slovakia to accede, lying as it does between Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, because it will be easier to guarantee an area of freedom and security in an enlarged European Union along a continuous external border. However, Slovakia will only be able to accede quickly if it is equally quick in implementing government and administrative reform. This includes making the judiciary independent, introducing effective financial controls and reforming the communes and local authorities, all within the next few weeks. This will also indirectly guarantee the involvement of national minorities, especially the Hungarians, in over 500 communities. Slovakia should therefore keep up its resolve to deal with outstanding accession problems in liaison with the Commission and the European Parliament, so as to pave the way for fast accession to the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First topic: there are still major deficiencies in the social sphere, including in the country I myself am monitoring, namely Latvia. I believe it is important to understand that a modern society is most successful if there is a partnership between politicians and the two sides of the labour market. That is why we must not forget the social dialogue. It is not merely the internal market which is important for enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Second topic: there is a positive spirit at present, and this must continue. We must not believe that enlargement will be without its problems, and we cannot expect enlargement to be nice and easy. It will have its shortcomings; there will be untidiness and incoherence; there will be lengthy transitional arrangements; and there will be no thorough agricultural reform and no complete structural reform. I am not saying that we must accept everything. I believe, however, that we must contrive to show magnanimity and that we are obliged to accept that enlargement will be messy and untidy. Naturally, we must comply with the Copenhagen criteria, but we must count on enlargement’s not being as seamless as we perhaps might have hoped.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we go for major enlargement, show magnanimity and obtain the ‘big bang’ in 2003. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Hungary was the first country to raise the Iron Curtain and to start intensive preparations for full membership. Today, thank God, fear of enlargement is clearly beginning to recede. We could see in Burgenland, which borders on Hungary, that the Euro-sceptics did not stand a chance and were losing more and more ground. The same applies in Austria and Germany with regard to the Czech Republic and Poland, although here the problems are patently worse. But I think that this is a positive development and that this development is thanks to Hungary's policy of settling its minority problems, which it has done in an exemplary fashion, and of taking a clearly pro-European stance across the political divide. I should like, first and foremost, to call on the Czech Republic, for which I also have a soft spot and which I hope, like Hungary, will be one of the first wave of candidate countries, to follow Hungary's example and resolve its minority problems, discard its historical baggage and, at the same time, find a consensus between the political parties on the question of political integration. I think this is paramount.</p>
<p class="contents">I am positive that the so-called candidate countries – not an expression I particularly like – will not become the ballast of European unification; it is precisely Hungary, the Czech Republic and others which can become the driving force behind European integration. The same applies to Slovakia, although it has internal political problems. But if it resolves them, I think that Slovakia, together with Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland, will become the countries to drive European integration forward. We should therefore take a less anxious view of this project, which we should not call enlargement to the east but, to quote Pope John Paul II, the "Europeanisation of Europe". Because a European Union without Hungary or the Czech Republic is no European Union! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The decision to open an enlargement process highlights the great, long-term vision of our predecessors. However, this great vision and long-term perspective is not being matched by an adequate financial and budgetary initiative. I feel that Member States’ contributions need to be revised in order to include our new commitments and needs even before 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">Like everything new, enlargement is causing uncertainty among the public. We must reassure them from the economic as well as political point of view, particularly where the structural and cohesion policies are concerned. Wealthy Europe must be more generous and the governments must be the vehicles of this generosity.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Slovenia, I have already had the opportunity to thank Mr Volcic for his valuable contribution and his report. In my opinion, the accession of the candidate countries will be our first opportunity to tackle the issue of relations with the Balkan countries after the war.</p>
<p class="contents">The first, absolute necessity which the European Union must establish and confirm, where it is lacking, is multiculturality based on recognition of and respect for differences, all differences whether physical, intellectual, ethnic, religious, economic or other, to prevent any more ethnic or religious wars.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe and the European Union must demand reciprocity from all the countries with which they sustain relations or for which they are finalising solidarity programmes in the area of multiculturality, for this dimension is the basis of all the democratic structures of the States.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, in the future, Slovenia’s situation will be mirrored in all the Balkan States and bring peace and prosperity to the war-torn communities. Lastly, I feel that, for the European Union, the economic element of globalisation is not about maximising profit and its social element is not about standardising societies, but globalisation is about the readiness to harmonise existing differences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have observed developments in Lithuania with interest, and not only since I became the shadow rapporteur for this country. It demonstrates the classic problems of a candidate country, problems which apply across the board and do not therefore need to be restated.</p>
<p class="contents">One specific aspect, and this also costs the EU a great deal of money, is Lithuanian energy policy. The sector as a whole has already cost three heads of government their job.</p>
<p class="contents">First on the subject of Ignalina, which Mr Souladakis has already addressed. I think that it is up to us to ensure, when the closure process is implemented, that locals are kept properly informed at all times of what it is actually planned to do and what their prospects are in this relatively isolated area. My personal impression is that this is not yet the case. As a result, some Lithuanian politicians, admittedly without portfolio, are irresponsibly raising people's hopes in order to curry votes. This triggers anti-European sentiments because the debate is over-simplified.</p>
<p class="contents">Privatisation of the oil and gas sectors is also causing a degree of ill feeling among the people because western investors have acted as if this is a banana republic. Now, no one even bothers to distinguish between EU nationals and Americans. People have become sceptical of western capital and more receptive to so-called national solutions. However, allegedly national solutions in Lithuania are in fact generally a front for Russian money. I just want to make sure that everyone involved both inside and outside Lithuania is aware of this and bears it in mind when making political and economic decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This demonstrates the excellent work of negotiation and consensus carried out by the rapporteur and the cooperation of the whole committee on this report which was not devoid of difficulties, owing, above all, to the occupation of part of the island by Turkey and the stalemate in the dialogue between the Turkish and Cypriot Governments.</p>
<p class="contents">My group has wanted to promote a text which does not hinder or compromise a renewal of the negotiations between both sides, but quite the opposite, one which motivates and speeds up the process of resolving the problem which is undoubtedly seeing a change of attitude from the Turkish Government.</p>

<p class="contents">Cyprus has now closed 22 chapters in the negotiation and presents itself as a firm candidate for accession. However, intense work will have to be done on the incorporation of the Community <span class="italic">acquis</span>, especially in terms of compliance with environmental legislation, where significant shortcomings in the areas of waste management and water quality and management have been noted.</p>

I think that this debate has highlighted the potential for the European Parliament, especially when it comes to Romania, on which I should like to say a few words. As a former national member of parliament, I know that a national member of parliament can do very little. What Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne has done for Romania, with her report and her hard work, is to get things moving there. The Commissioner acknowledged as much this morning and I think that we could use this as an example to the numerous groups of visitors who question exactly what we in the European Parliament can do.</p>
<p class="contents">To start with, the head of government in Romania reacted as perhaps every head of government in the world would react. He claimed that Mr Verheugen had said, not to worry, it is only the European Parliament. Talk to the Commission if you want to become a member of the European Union one day. I am sure that Mr Verheugen said no such thing. All the Romanian media quoted him, although they then acknowledged that it makes sense to take a closer look at Parliament's reports and opinions; we have reached a legal position on the question of orphans and homosexuals in Romania which now has to be implemented, something which was unthinkable a few weeks ago.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, if I may, to comment on a question which divides the House. The Socialist group and Mr Sakellariou have tabled a proposed amendment asking if the report should mention euro-Atlantic structures, yes or no? The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy says yes, if Romania wants to join these euro-Atlantic structures, then we want to support this and I think it is important, especially in Romania's case, that we do. We know that Romania will not accede in the first round in 2004 and a decision to invite Romania to join the North Atlantic Alliance in 2002 is therefore all the more important. This would bring stability to the whole of Europe and I therefore call on you to reject this amendment tomorrow and support the Committee on Foreign Affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
