In addition, I would like to congratulate you once more, Madam President, on being elected. I am glad to have the opportunity to start working together with you. In response to the wishes of Parliament, shall now outline the main points of the programme that has been drawn up in respect of the Finnish presidential term. As requested by yourselves, I shall deal in particular with the situation in the Western Balkans and the death sentence passed on the Kurdish leader Öçalan. Firstly, however, a few words on developments in the Union in general.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission"s President-elect, Romano Prodi, drew attention in his speech to the fact that the institutions of the European Union have failed to keep up with the changes that are going on in the world around us. I completely agree with him. Not just the Commission, but the whole European Union, must undergo reform. It is not a matter of a one-off dramatic upheaval nor does this concern just one institution in particular, but of an on-going, unremitting process. We have to remember that its ability to grow, enlarge and face up to ever newer challenges has made the Union both unique and long-lasting.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, as we embark on our work together, we have the chance to make a clean sweep of matters, in a manner of speaking. The new Parliament has now started and the appointment of the new Commission is under way. We Finns now hold the Presidency of the Council for the first time. The Treaty of Amsterdam, which recently came into force, will provide us with a good basis for developing closer co-operation than has existed before between Parliament, the Commission and the Council. We now have a splendid opportunity to reform old ways of working. For my own part, I would like to emphasise the fact that the work of the Council also has to be advanced. It is a paradox that, as the Union"s importance grows, co-operation among its governments in the Council is being threatened as powers are fragmented and compartmentalised. The Council, like the Union as a whole, has to focus on the essential. The Council is expected to provide political leadership to give real added value to the lives of our citizens. During its Presidency, Finland intends to embark on new projects to improve the work of the Council. We will attempt to make the work of the Council significantly more transparent and efficient; we consider greater transparency to be a vital precondition of the public"s approval of the Union as a whole. We would also like the General Affairs Council to assume a relevant role in managing the work of the Council. We must do all we can to ensure the Union is one, and is regarded as such: the Union must have a common will, a common policy and a common voice.</p>
<p class="contents">President-elect Prodi said the key words in the work of the new Commission will be transparency, accountability and efficiency. I am very happy to see that the new Commission"s policy corresponds word for word with the key aims of the Finnish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">The Finnish Presidency begins at a time when there is exceptional pressure on the Union"s ability to function in external affairs. The war that has raged in the Western Balkans has caused an inconceivable amount of human suffering and damage to property. The European Union must be ready both politically and financially to invest in developing the Western Balkan region, so that democracy and stability can take root there. During the Finnish presidential term, we will be paying special attention to how efficiently and consistently the Union functions in external matters. Dealing with the situation in Kosovo now that the crisis is over, and ensuring the stability of the Western Balkans, will be, for us, the most crucial acid test.</p>
<p class="contents">On Monday, the European Union"s General Affairs Council stressed that the Union furthermore intends to help the Serbian people, who are suffering from the disastrous policies their leaders have pursued. When we finally start to put an end to the sanctions we imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia we will realise that the government in Belgrade and the Yugoslavian people are two different things.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">The Yugoslav government must implement Resolution 1244 of the UN Security Council, work in co-operation with the International Court of Justice, and progress towards establishing democracy. We agreed on Monday that first we would remove the sanctions that were imposed on the people, such as the flight ban and the avoidance of sporting links. We emphasised the need to remove immediately the sanctions on imports of oil and other sanctions imposed on Kosovo and Montenegro. We also consider it important to provide support for all those players in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia who are committed to the values of democracy. Next, we should be defining the ways and means by which we can make their situation easier. This would include, for example, shipments of raw materials and the supply of electricity. We asked the Commission and the competent bodies to make recommendations on the matter without delay. Furthermore, we confirmed the decision taken by the Heads of Member States and Governments in the General Affairs Council to set up an agency responsible for the rebuilding of the region, and we decided to hold a South-Eastern Europe Stability Pact Summit in Sarajevo.</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis in Kosovo may mark a turning point in the Union"s external actions which should now be conducted purposefully and with a common cause. We need to broaden our scope when it comes to the Union"s external relations, we must improve our ability to foresee crises, and we must become more adept at coping with the aftermath of crises. We discussed this at length on Monday in an open sitting of the General Affairs Council. We were all unanimous on the subject of developing this area, and adhering to a tight schedule. The European Union has the perfect opportunity to assist in stabilising the region in a coherent and determined fashion. However, I hope we will remember that the Union is by no means solely responsible for the restructuring programme in Kosovo. We are working in close co-operation with other countries and international organisations. There is a vital need for further development and expansion of co-operation with the United Nations, the CSCE and the Council of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">MEPs have, in many different connections, stressed the great importance of the Union as a driving force behind, and a guarantor of, peace and stability in our continent. It is precisely this that lies at the heart of the next phase of enlargement. Gradually, the European Union will become a entirely pan-European Union. In one respect at least the next phase of enlargement will differ from all those that went before: co-operation within the Union itself has reached a level that will place very great demands on all applicant countries. Nevertheless, I am convinced that these demands are for the good of both the applicant countries and the Union. Meeting the criteria will strengthen social and economic development in the applicant countries concerned, and this has also been observed in the applicant countries themselves. Enlargement is a process which must move forward constantly and which cannot be allowed to be compromised with empty promises. During the Finnish presidential term, accession negotiations will continue in a spirit of determination. We aim to reach a decision on as many points of negotiation as possible, and initiate new ones. The European Council in Helsinki intends to reach a decision, on the basis of a report by the Commission, to include new applicant countries in accession negotiations. At the same time, we are discussing the development of relations with European countries and long-term aspects of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement will require the countries involved to adapt to the Union"s institutional framework. We have already begun preparations for an Intergovernmental Conference, and we intend to draft a chairmans" report on it for the European Council in Helsinki. The views of Parliament will be vitally important while these reforms are under way, and I realise, with a sense of satisfaction, that our opinions are similar on many issues.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot neglect Turkey in the enlargement process. Turkey is an important partner for the Union. It is involved in the enlargement process, and a separate strategy has been created for it. Opinion on Turkey"s membership of the Union is affected by the progress the country is making in the areas of democratic reform and human rights, and, above all, the rights of minority groups.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I would like to stress the fact that the Union opposes the death penalty everywhere and in each and every case. It is a common aim of the European Union to do away with capital punishment. Finland, as holder of the Presidency, will be monitoring the situation. If the sentence passed on the Kurdish leader, Öçalan, were to be carried out, it would be an unfortunate turn of events in Turkish policy. Turkey is a member of the Council of Europe, and thus endorses the aim to abolish the death penalty. The death penalty has not been carried out in the country since 1984. It is to be hoped that Turkey will continue to postpone the implementation of the death penalty until it is abolished entirely. It is hoped that the Turkish parliament will use its powers to reverse the judgment. Turkey has expressed its desire to join the European Union. One of the common values of the Union is to refrain from carrying out the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I shall not go through the entire Presidency programme with regard to this matter. My committee visit in September will be an opportunity for me to continue the discussion on external relations. Many matters of current interest, including Russia and the northern dimension, are thus certainly on the agenda, but I would still like to raise one question that is of topical interest: the outlook for the peace process in the middle East since Barak"s government came to power is brighter than it has been for years. The European Union is actively promoting the peace process in both political and economic terms. I myself will be travelling to the region in early August to meet key players in the process and to convey the views of the union on how best to promote it.</p>
<p class="contents">(SV) Regardless of whether we speak of the proliferation or the prevention of conflict, there is one thing we can be sure of: we can only assist others if our own wealth is assured. Knowledge and ability are fundamental preconditions for our well-being and ability to compete, as they are for the Member States and for the whole Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The information society offers new opportunities to citizens, to enterprises and to the administrative sector. During the coming months, we will scrutinise how the information society can be utilised in order to enhance our ability to compete. At the same time we have to ensure that the development does not lead to wider gulfs between different groups within society.</p>
<p class="contents">We have not yet completely exploited the opportunities which monetary union and the internal market offer us. We can only create new employment opportunities if our economy is doing well. The increase in the employment level indicates that we are going in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">We are going to continue our work in the areas of gender equality, socially and ecologically sustainable development, the problems affecting our youth and the well-being of our fellow citizens. I know that all these problems are important to this House, and that the European Parliament has carried out important work in promoting them.</p>
<p class="contents">(FI) I was talking before about how the Union can have an impact on strengthening security in Europe and the world in general. People"s security does not only stem from the avoidance of war, but also has to do with economic security, the realisation of human rights, and the protection afforded by a constitution. At the Tampere European Council, there will be an attempt to create a more uniform, more united policy on immigration and asylum-seeking and increased efforts to prevent cross-border criminality. Legislation in the Member States in this area should be harmonised and aligned, judgments should be more effectively carried out, and administrative and legal barriers to co-operation should be removed.</p>
<p class="contents">My ideas are based on the principle that the Union can only succeed through close and open co-operation between its various agencies, and with the active support of the citizens of Europe. The European Parliament will play a crucial role in the process. Madam President, may you and all the members find the energy, perseverance and will you need as this session begins, and I would like to assure you that Finland, as holder of the Presidency, expects much from our mutual co-operation.</p>

As the Member State to hold the Presidency of the Council, Finland is piloting the European Union into a new millennium with an extremely well-balanced programme. It is important to point out, as the Foreign minister made clear in her speech, that together, the internal reform of the Union and the strengthening of civil societies all over Europe will form the cornerstone of EU development in the future. Emphasis on these goals can be seen very clearly in the Finnish Presidency programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The hallmark of the Finnish Presidency, a strong and open Europe for a new millennium, reflects the Union"s vital need for reforms. The people"s Europe must be built with the emphasis on the serious importance of transparency among the EU institutions and on the principle of subsidiarity. The enormous challenges of the future, such as the economic changes associated with the single currency, the Union"s enlargement to the east, and the prevention of international crime, require the support of more viable EU institutions than is the case today. It is a positive sign that Finland has started off with concrete proposals. Wordy proclamations will not produce the changes we now need.</p>
<p class="contents">Tragedies such as the crisis in Kosovo, and, more generally, in the whole of the former Yugoslavia, show that the peace and stability afforded by European integration do not as yet extend very far beyond the Union"s external borders. The inevitable conclusions must be made regarding this point, so that the Union"s crisis management skills may be strengthened as promptly as possible. The EU must ensure that it has in future an effective non-military range of options at its disposal both to prevent a crisis and to put out fires that have already started. The fact that these goals are high up on the agenda is a very positive sign.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic, social and political rebuilding of the Western Balkans must proceed at a brisk pace while Finland holds the Presidency. It is such an immense challenge that the Finnish Presidency will be required to show it has the special ability to keep all the interwoven threads tightly in its hands. Finland has to ensure that all allocated funds are used effectively. Not a single bridge can be rebuilt nor a single school constructed if the costs of administering the reconstruction projects are inflated. The reconstruction programme should be funded in a way that takes account of the use of local resources. In this way, the region"s business community, ravaged as it has been by war, can be revived, jobs can be created, and trade with the surrounding areas and the Union can be developed. The Union"s employment problems cannot be solved by making official appointments at Kosovo"s expense. Aid must go to where it is most needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The enlargement of the Union to the East will require the unflagging support of its citizens. The Union must make absolutely sure no bottlenecks in the enlargement process arise through its inability to function properly. Ensuring the single market functions effectively and strengthening the Union"s internal security are the important keys to successful enlargement. We must expect the Tampere Council meeting, which will focus <span class="italic">inter alia</span> on questions relating to asylum-seekers and refugees as well as the fight against organised crime, to provide concrete proposals for action to improve internal security.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union"s northern dimension concept, about to come into the limelight, features many aspects of EU internal security, such as nuclear and environmental safety and co-operation with neighbouring regions. Furthermore, the ideas expressed concerning the Union"s northern dimension need to be made into more concrete programmes of action.</p>

Parliament, in its new assembly, will start newly invigorated by its recently acquired constitutional rights as bestowed on it under the Treaty of Amsterdam; in place of the former Commission that resigned before its term was over we await the appointment of the new Commission, and Council is preparing for reforms in its working practices. The undeniable fact is that we shall be unable to restore the confidence of the people in the Union to take decisions, without reforming the way we do things and this concerns all institutions: the Commission, the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most pressing matters we are expecting Parliament and the Council to resolve is a proper arrangement relating to members" pay and expenses. The reform of the Union"s institutions is a crucial part of the Finnish presidential programme, as Ms Halonen mentioned in her speech. We note with particular satisfaction that the programme includes an aim to reform working practices in the Council. The principle of transparency will be promoted in a very real sense with the development of open sessions of the Council, better accessibility to documents, and the general availability of Council and working party agendas and meeting schedules. In acknowledgement of decisions taken by the Cologne European Council, Finland will oversee preparations to convene an Intergovernmental Conference. The aim must be for a conference which leads to a new agreement to make enlargement possible and create the right conditions for more effective action on the part of the Union after enlargement has taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be said, however, that the efficient functioning of the Union has already met with obstacles during this session. I cannot help wondering why the right-wing group in the Parliament is attempting to postpone the appointment of the Commission using the report by the Committee of Independent Experts as an excuse. I shall be frank and say that tactics like these will make it difficult for the Finnish Presidency to succeed. We must speed up the drawing up of the report and the proper debate on it in Parliament in every way possible, but we cannot surrender the legal rights of the Parliament to an unofficial investigative body and give in to the timetable it imposes.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to strengthen the Union"s credibility, to enable us to become fully involved in serious problems that are our responsibility, the most pressing of which is the drawing up of the timetable for the rebuilding programme in Kosovo. That will be the start of our task to strengthen stability in the whole Balkan region. The Finnish President, Martti Ahtisaari, made a sound contribution to the achievement of a solution for Kosovo, showing that a non-aligned state can also successfully represent the common view of the Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">A properly functioning Union is a pre-condition of a successful conclusion to the enlargement process that is under way in respect of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The starting point must be insistence on uniform membership criteria, which also means an attempt at the truth when discussing a timetable for enlargement. Finland has quite rightly pointed out that it is necessary to connect the enlargement process with Europe"s influence on developments in the areas of environmental protection and social welfare. The aim must be sustainable development and the inclusion of the issue of environmental protection in all community policy, which means obligations not only for future members but for the present members also.</p>
<p class="contents">The enlargement process can make headway if co-operation with the Union"s neighbouring regions is strengthened. The northern dimension policy, which has been approved by the Union, covers <span class="italic">inter alia</span> co-operation in the Baltic region, but it also supports the implementation of the approved strategy on Russia. The main issue in need of reform is genuine cross-border co-operation, which needs to be strengthened. Another current challenge for the Union also is the realisation of economic and monetary union in a way that will generate jobs. So there are various challenges. Finally, I would sincerely like to wish the Finnish Presidency luck in the implementation of its programme, favourably inclined as it is, to reform.</p>

<p class="contents">The agenda of the Finnish Presidency does not contain any great surprises; it is balanced, and is focused on the most important challenges to the Union. The agenda actually emphasises those problems which earlier Summit Meetings have agreed that we should solve in Helsinki. I am very glad that the minister tackled the problems concerning the work of the Council of Ministers so frankly for I am of the opinion that they have not been discussed sufficiently, and there remain for us many tricky problems to be solved. Precisely for this reason, many issues have also been delayed until Finland"s Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">We emphasise in the agenda a strong and open Europe, which is correct. A strong Europe is a Europe in which the institutions are strong, not where some strongmen solve Europe"s problems. Unfortunately we have witnessed the tendency that some problems have not been solved in the institutions, but by individual persons. This is not in the spirit of Monnet. I hope that the Finnish presidency will succeed in its aim of making the EU act unanimously for a common policy and with common will.</p>
<p class="contents">A strong Union is also a Union which is able to create stability in its neighbouring regions. For this reason, it is important to also build up a comprehensive and clear strategy of involvement, which includes countries such as Albania and Macedonia, by means of successful expansion and through credible crisis management. Regardless of all the work carried out with a view to stabilisation, there are nevertheless risks that the streams of refugees might increase. In this regard, I think that the Finnish agenda could have been more ambitious, in particular in light of the Kosovo crisis. We certainly must not find ourselves once again in a situation of unreadiness as was the case when we had to find a solution to the distribution of payments.</p>
<p class="contents">I finally wish to stress that I sincerely hope that Minister Halonen, who knows the situation in Slovakia personally, is going to fight for an end to the discrimination, for instance against the Roma population, which exists there as well as elsewhere.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I promise that the Greens/European Free Alliance will do all it can to achieve close and effective co-operation with your institution.</p>
<p class="contents">It really cannot be stressed enough that Finland is embarking on its Presidency in quite problematic circumstances. We have to see that a properly functioning Commission is appointed in September, and the Green Group must do all within its power to ensure that the procedures here in Parliament are as realistic as possible, though at the same time thorough. That is something we surely all want to see.</p>
<p class="contents">Foreign Minister, you said that the Kosovo crisis might prove to be a sort of turning point in EU common foreign and security policy. My group"s position is that the European Union must strengthen its common foreign and security policy, but we would hope that Finland, which is a militarily non-aligned State, will emphasise the importance of the non-military aspect of crisis management. It is quite obvious that occasionally human rights in the modern world have to be defended with weapons, but if we want to act wisely and avoid large-scale human and economic suffering and destruction we have to work on a long-term basis and use specifically non-military means to solve future crises. Our group would like to remind everyone that the European Parliament this Spring approved a report recommending the establishment of non-military peacekeeping bodies for the European Union. We are surprised how little the non-military options were spoken of at the Cologne Council meeting, and we hope that during the Finnish presidential term they will be energetically addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is large enough to be able to have an influence on global developments. During the Finnish Presidency, we will be involved in preparations for future world trade talks. It is absolutely vital that this is undertaken in a spirit of openness. We have already seen how civil society is eager to participate in this debate. I am now referring to what happened with the Multilateral Agreement on Investment. I believe you all want to work in such a way that civil society is able to interact openly with the decision makers, when the topic of debate is the relationship between free trade, people"s health and the protection of the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group would like to point out that, during its presidential term, Finland will have ample opportunity to lead Europe towards social and ecological union. We will give you all our support, so that the Directive on an energy tax can finally be issued. We have been preparing it for seven years now. I would imagine we are all starting to become rather impatient with regard to this matter, as it has been so difficult to move the decision-making process along. At the same time it is obviously necessary to strengthen the marketability of labour. Throughout the entire European Union it is possible, for example, to reduce the figures for non-waged labour enabling us to create new jobs once more and thus induce a more vigorous degree of economic activity.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I would like to state firmly that the Tampere Council meeting must not simply prove to be a chance to increase police activity and the surveillance of the public. It also has to promote civil rights, as well as improve the status of third country citizens legally resident in the Member States of the European Union. All this must take place in a spirit of openness. We also expect the Commission to start to ease the task of the Finnish Presidency to increase transparency as soon as possible by furnishing Parliament and the Council with information on the public availability of documents.</p>

Right at the start, the EU"s Finance Ministers, under the leadership of Finland, reached the conclusion that it is only possible to speak of EMU within the EU if it is with one voice. As a result, we have now fallen silent in eleven languages over the subject of monetary policy in the EU. Under Finland"s leadership, transparency and public accountability should extend to the secret and secretive work of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Finland is a non-aligned country, and not a member of NATO. Nevertheless, she should show more credibility in her opposition to an EU common defence force. We should not give in to the former Social Democrats and the Green pacifists, to Schröder, Fischer, Blair, D"Alema or Solana, who want more arms for Europe, and to expand NATO. NATO is also now an organisation on the offensive. It will be Finland"s task to see to it that EU Member States are free to remain non-aligned. This goal is being undermined by the principle that the EU should have a common will, a common policy and a common voice, a goal the 70 per cent of Finns who did not vote in the European Parliamentary elections were opposed to.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This year has seen the implementation of some very wide-ranging and aggressive policies which are all going to play a role in developing the economies within the fifteen Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The launch of the new euro currency will certainly help to reduce business costs for small and medium-sized enterprises as foreign exchange transactions in eleven countries become an event of the past. I know that the euro currency has experienced some trading problems at times during this year. The instability within the EU institutions and the war in Kosovo have certainly not encouraged a climate of investor confidence. However, in recent times, the value of the euro currency has substantially increased as political and economic stability within the European landscape has re-emerged. There are eleven participating countries within the new euro currency zone encompassing over 291 million people. It is of the utmost importance that consumer information campaigns about the timetable and effects of the new euro currency continue in the run-up to the introduction of euro notes and coins in the year 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">The Finnish Presidency of the EU, together with the Commission, should review progress that is being made on this important issue across the EU so that consumer concerns about the new euro currency are fully addressed. The increased interdependence between the Member States and EMU demands the strengthening of economic co-ordination. In order to boost competitiveness, growth and employment, the Finnish Government rightly intends to promote the co-ordination of economic, employment and structural policies and to complete the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">The ageing nature of our population, globalisation and technological advances present real challenges for European economic and social development. European employment strategies must be put in place in accordance with the new powers contained within the Amsterdam Treaty as well as within revised European social fund regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">Unemployment still remains at over 9 % within the European Union which is unacceptably high. It is not right that one in four people below the age of 25 have difficulty in getting a decent start in life. The Finnish Government is certainly laying a great emphasis on the need to promote the enlargement process to a greater extent. The Finnish Presidency will direct preparations to convene an Intergovernmental Conference in accordance with the decisions taken at the recent Cologne European Council. An IGC is very important as institutional reform must take place before the practical process of enlargement can succeed and much work needs to be done to prepare EU Institutions for this intergovernmental phase. I am very satisfied that the Finnish Government intends to pursue this matter vigorously over the next six months.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement of the Union is essential for the stability of Europe. The opening-up of larger markets will assist in the process of economic growth. The Union itself must be prepared to take up the challenges posed by enlargement by improving its decision-making capacity and improving the functioning of its institutions. National interests must be protected during this phase of negotiations as an overburdened bureaucracy at EU level is not the desired outcome from these IGC talks.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, as a result of the Cologne Summit of March of last year, it has been agreed that the EU budget will be worth over £506 billion during the seven-year period, i.e. 2000-2006. The conclusion of the Agenda 2000 discussion has ensured that the European Union can move forward and discuss and implement new policy objectives and goals. The Finnish Government has certainly started this process. The EU certainly now has a golden opportunity to put in place new policies in the fields of consumer rights, food safety and assistance to the elderly, as well as areas of environmental protection.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that, on the Finnish initiative, the European Union is preparing to implement other initiatives on an international level, and I am grateful for that.</p>
<p class="contents">The point I would like to highlight here concerns Kosovo. Nobody has spoken about it until now, but there is a problem which has not been confronted, or has not been confronted with the determination expected by the European Union. It is that of the three thousand Kosovan prisoners who were literally kidnapped by Mr Milosevic and his henchmen during the latter days of the international intervention in Kosovo and transferred by force to Serbian prisons. Nobody knows anything about these three thousand people. They are Mr Kurti, the former leader of the student movement in Pristina, Professor Oti, and three thousand other people who have literally disappeared.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to know whether, on the initiative of the Finnish Presidency, we may finally take determined action, with the support of the Red Cross and other international organisations, to oblige the war criminal Milosevic not to do what he has done so many times before: to use blackmail, to use these people who are now in his hands and about whom nothing is known, to once again oblige the European Union to drop the evidence. I believe that, before even talking about lifting the embargo, Mr Milosevic should be forced to release all of these people unconditionally.</p>

As things stand, the next treaty will be even worse than the one we already have. It will provide for more majority decisions whereby ministers and civil servants are able to tone down the democracy in our Member States. Decisions which today are taken in publicly elected open assemblies will pass to secret committees within the Commission and the Council. We will have much more Brussels and less democracy. That the new treaty is to be called the Paris Treaty is unfair on the city of cities. The power which we as voters are losing is mainly being transferred to the Commission and the Council, although the Parliament is taking over the right of veto from the parliaments of the Member States. The individual States may no longer prevent the adoption of a law or recommend that a law be amended. A democratic era is being superseded by a bureaucratic era in which the voters are being driven into a siding. It is to prevent this watering down of democracy that we have created a new group: the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities. Democracy, because power must lie with the publicly elected in our Member States and because the necessary common legislation must also be controlled democratically. Plurality, because we wish to maintain diverse identities and cultures and to counter euro-nationalism and its euro-anthems and common passports, currency, policing and defence. We no longer want centralism and unification, but decentralisation and freedom. We do not want the EU to be a new state, but rather a practical collaboration on problems which we cannot solve individually.

The guns may well have fallen silent, Mr President, but the anti-personnel mines continue their butchery; the horror of war is over but not the horror of the discovery of mass graves day after day, a tragic, heart-rending testimony to a contempt for the right to live of individuals and populations, a right which is no less than respect for the diversity and identity of a people for whose affirmation we will fight both here and in our national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">’It is not acceptable that in the very heart of Europe, human rights should once more be flouted in such a barbaric manner, ’ declared Mrs Fontaine once again. We are in agreement on this point as well, reaching forward as we are to be part of the process of solidarity between nations through a common foreign and security policy for which my group has fought right from the start of its representation in the European Parliament. Starting with the Balkans, with the urgency and determination which today"s situation demands, the Common Foreign and Security Policy will allow us to achieve the objectives of peace, economic stability and the certainty that human rights are being respected. NATO has won the war and Europe must build the peace: this is the challenge which we must take up immediately, in the loud and clear definition of the role that Europe will assume in the construction of the peace process, in political wisdom, in the quality of the steps that it will take in order to prevent the migration flows which it is currently suffering and will continue to do so in the years to come, from causing religious, economic and social conflict, especially in areas in which unemployment is increasing at an alarming rate. Of course, the establishment of an agency will not in itself solve the problem. However, all remains to be seen. How will this body, which we hope will guarantee rapid, efficient, useful, rational and fair measures, be structured and made operative, with the appropriate participation in the reconstruction, above all, of all those areas such as Italy and, in particular, Puglia, whose tourist trades have suffered extensive economic damage from the war and the effects of migration. It is true that the war has left deep wounds: they are clearly visible. They can be clearly seen on territories and on the people who lost their lives in or were driven from those territories; but it has also harmed certain governments, which are left without a clear foreign policy. In any case, it has displayed the failure of ten years of diplomacy and highlighted the oversights, the shortcomings and the squanderings, of international co-operation.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe"s undertaking, then, cannot be understood as merely revolving around the reconciliation of the parties involved in the conflict, but the measure of its performance will depend upon the overall ability it displays in reconciling the Stability Pact, reconstruction and ever-increasing unemployment. In his statement, the President of the Commission undertook to spend money on reconstruction, not bureaucracy. Let us hope that this reconstruction will be more than just material. We must rebuild roads, schools, ports and water systems, but we must also restore the faith of peoples who for years have been deprived of the right to live with their loved ones on their own land with their own jobs, and who are now hoping to enjoy the peaceful life denied to them for years. If Europe were to pursue the aim indicated by Professor Prodi of providing the Balkans with a clear political and economic future, it would certainly achieve a great deal, but it would not be performing the whole of its task, which includes making a substantial contribution to building a path for democratic, and of course economic, development, but essentially social and cultural development, in the knowledge that reconciliation is all the stronger and more stable, the higher the level of tolerance and respect for diversity of the parties is concerned.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler, </span></span>   <span class="bold">Member of the Commission</span> . – <span class="underline"> </span>(DE) Honoured President, esteemed Representative of the Council Presidency, ladies and gentlemen, it is inappropriate that the Representative for the acting Commission should make a full statement on the Finnish Presidency"s programme here, for this programme will largely be implemented under the new Commission. Permit me, therefore, to restrict my comments in the main to two issues, namely reconstruction in Kosovo and the sentence passed on Abdullah Öçalan.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I should like to remind you that from the very beginning, the European Union was heavily involved in the endeavours being made to bring about a peaceful resolution of the Kosovo conflict. The Commission also provided humanitarian aid throughout the conflict. The European Union is, as we are all aware, the largest donor. We gave financial aid to those countries most severely affected by the influx of exiles and refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that the conflict is over, our immediate priority is to support KFOR"s endeavours to restore peace and order and to reconstruct a functioning civil administration under the leadership of the United Nations. The European Union has a special task to fulfil in this respect. In particular, we bear the responsibility for the reconstruction aspects of UNMIG. Jollie Dixon, the acting Special Delegate for the Commission appointed for this purpose, has now taken up his position in Pristina and it is time to solve the huge number of practical problems.</p>
<p class="contents">What has been provided so far in terms of aid? The humanitarian aid committed to Kosovo and the neighbouring countries totals EUR 378 million, with the bulk going towards providing essential foods and other goods such as medicines, sanitation equipment and accommodation. This aid is channelled through the UNHCR, the International Red Cross, UNICEF and various NGOs. This amount includes the EUR 196 million currently being mobilised from the Commission"s budgetary reserves.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, EUR 100 million were committed as macroeconomic aid for the damage sustained by other countries as a result of the Kosovo crisis, 62 million being earmarked for Albania, 25 million for FYROM and 13 million for Montenegro. The first instalments have already been paid out. In addition, EUR 45 million will be committed to Kosovo through the OBNOVA programme, a first priority of which will be to finance a delegation whose task is to ascertain the scale of material damage. The first set of findings will be available on 23 July.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission will then base its definitive aid programme on these figures. In addition, the budgetary requirements for reconstruction will need to be set in the course of the next two to three years, and the anticipated costs which the other donors are to incur will need to be calculated.</p>
<p class="contents">The measures to be financed under the OBNOVA programme as a matter of priority include such areas as mine clearance, obtaining materials for rebuilding houses and also public buildings, supporting public utilities and customs control, and a village employment and rehabilitation programme. Working in conjunction with KFOR, UNMIG and UNHCR, these projects were prioritised and they are to supplement the on-going work undertaken by the humanitarian organisations. We hope to be able to commit the EUR 45 million before the end of this month.</p>
<p class="contents">As explained to the budgetary authorities in the trialogue of 2 July, an additional EUR 92 million will still be required this year. It was agreed during this trialogue session that in September the Commission will submit a proposal to increase the budget by means of an amending and supplementary budget which will raise the 92 million required. The funds are largely to be raised by reallocation, with as little utilisation as possible being made of additional funds. It was also agreed that both parts of the budgetary authorities will deal with this proposal in one reading. We are counting on receiving Parliament"s support as far as this is concerned, so that the European Community can continue to play a leading role in the reconstruction process.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to say a few words on the issue of a reconstruction agency. Before the Cologne European Council meeting, the Commission proposed to the Heads of State and Government that a special agency should be set up which would deal with the implementation of the reconstruction work. The European Council followed this recommendation and instructed the Commission back in June to formulate an actual proposal on the basis of experience gained from Bosnia. We at the Commission proposed that the agency should be located in Pristina, that is at the centre of reconstruction activity, where all the other international organisations are located.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">However, at the informal meeting of Heads of State and Government in Rio, the Heads of Government agreed that the agency ‘s seat should be in Thessaloniki. We cannot escape the conclusion though, that this was due not so much to the fact that the reconstruction activities, for which this agency was to be responsible, were in the immediate vicinity, but rather to the fact that there was a general need for economic aid throughout the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission takes the view that it will only be possible to work effectively if the vast proportion of activities is concentrated in Pristina. However, the Commission could envisage a solution whereby, for example, some of the administrative personnel would be based at another location. But this must not be to the detriment of the efficiency and effectiveness of the operation. The Commission assumes that to uphold these principles accords with the Court of Auditors" position and the first reactions of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Council decided conclusively on Monday this week that the agency"s seat should be in Thessaloniki. The Commission has refrained from stating its position, preferring the Commission"s definitive position to be established by the new Commission. The proposal has now been submitted to Parliament for advice. Meanwhile, as of 1 July, the Commission has been despatching a task force consisting of approximately 20 officials and supporting personnel to Pristina, where it will be responsible for implementing the reconstruction programme. All authority required to effect implementation was transferred from Brussels to the leader of the task force in Pristina in order to create a mechanism which will work with optimum efficiency and speed to provide aid at a time when it is most urgently needed in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a comment on achieving co-ordination amongst the donors. On 13 July, a meeting took place of the High Level Steering Group, the committee managed by the European Commission and the World Bank which is based on partnership and is intended to co-ordinate the Kosovo crisis aid provided by international donors. It was confirmed on this occasion that the first Kosovo donor conference would be held on 28 July in Brussels. This conference is to focus in particular on determining what the pressing needs will be from now until the end of the year. A second donor conference has been planned for October and this will deal in greater depth with the reconstruction efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the Öçalan trial, the Commission takes the same position on this matter as that taken up by the German Presidency on 29 June, following the death sentence passed by the state security tribunal of Ankara on Abdullah Öçalan, and again expresses its absolute repudiation of the death penalty. It was for this reason that on 29 June, the Commission asked the relevant Turkish authorities to take account of the European Union"s repudiation of this death penalty. Consequently, the Commission, knowing that Turkey has not employed the death penalty since 1984, anticipates that as a member of the Council of Europe, Turkey will abide by the obligations that it has entered into. To carry out the death penalty would inevitably place relations between the European Union and Turkey under huge strain.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the majority of EU Member States, the Commission believes that recent amendments to Turkish legislation have paved the way for the case against Mr Öçalan and the process of reaching a verdict, to be transferred to a civil court.</p>

These three attributes, which I wish to highlight, bode well for the success of this first Finnish Presidency and they will be needed, given the challenges which face it.</p>
<p class="contents">Since it is impossible in three minutes to list all these challenges – the Presidency-in-Office of the Council has said that it is impossible to list its programme – I will limit myself to a few brief observations on some particular points.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to enlargement, we must be aware that events in the Balkans have changed the landscape, and in Helsinki we will have to open negotiations with other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to institutional affairs, the Finnish Presidency has an enormous responsibility: that of initiating work which will lead to the conclusion of a statute on fundamental rights. But we should not forget that the mandate of the Cologne European Council meeting speaks of a non-binding statute which, initially, will not be incorporated into the Treaties. If our intention, from the outset, is to implement a set of binding rights, this would leave us with a minimal statute which will offer little to European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the statute on MEPs, the Finnish Presidency – and it should be congratulated on this – has also shown respect for the fact that this initiative concerns this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the functioning of the College of Commissioners, I would like to say, from this Chamber, that we will not allow the individual responsibility of the Commissioners to be used as a weapon.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to economic affairs, the matter of a tax on energy has been mentioned here. The Finnish Presidency knows that this is a disputed question and we hope it will make use of all its powers of conciliation in order that this taxation package might move forward, since it is of great importance to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">And I would like to say a few words on the question of the internal market. I hope that the internal market does not suffer as a result of this idea of bringing it into line with international agreements in areas such as electronic commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">It is must be stated that the Tampere Summit must not become a Summit on immigration and asylum. Although this is very important and events in the Balkans have demonstrated the urgency required in this field, the Tampere Summit must be dedicated to developing a region which enjoys liberty, security and justice. We must be conscious of the fact that, if this development is to be harmonious, we must insist on the idea of ‘justice’, we must promote the European judicial network, we must be capable of making sentences effective and making the sentences immediate, both the criminal and the non-criminal ones, and we must facilitate direct relationships between judges. These are the challenges for the Tampere Summit and immigration, although important, must not be allowed to push them to one side.</p>
<p class="contents">And just a word about three matters which have been side-stepped and which are important for the South and for Spain. We must begin a dialogue with Mexico and Mercosur. And with regard to Morocco, those EUR 125 million must be released.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is exactly what we need. There will be more than enough problems to solve, the list is already before us, but best efforts have been made to this end.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to stress the following, further to the points made by Mr Commissioner Fischler, giving particular attention to the two matters of Turkey and reconstruction in Yugoslavia. Firstly, I consider that it is right that as far as actual reconstruction work is concerned, particularly in Kosovo, the decisions should be taken on site. That is a line of argument that this Parliament has represented and which we have defended, namely that greater local autonomy should be devolved to the area where the reconstruction work is actually to take place. However, and I am probably prepared to go further than you are in this respect, Mr Commissioner, I believe that Greece and Thessaloniki would be a good location when it comes to aid for reconstruction in general for the Balkans or South-Eastern Europe, and particularly in co-operation with Mr Hombach. This work cannot be undertaken in Pristina alone, both in view of infrastructure and political relations.</p>
<p class="contents">People may well say that is a bad compromise. I don"t believe it is. I believe that they are two different things, but that they must be closely interwoven. But this decision is entirely reasonable, on the one hand Pristina for the actual reconstruction aid and, on the other, Thessaloniki.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to my second point, which is Turkey, I believe that we must state in a clear and unambiguous fashion that as far as we are concerned, the Öçalan case is not just about one man threatened with the death penalty, but rather we repudiate the death penalty in general. He is a symbol for many others, for example Akim Birdal or others too, who are in prison, some of whom have not had legal proceedings taken against them, and some whose health is greatly impaired. Turkey must at last demonstrate respect for human rights, for full democracy, particularly as regards the Kurdish question.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not support terrorism in either word or deed. We support a political solution for Turkey; this is necessary in every sense, and I hope that the Finnish Presidency too will succeed in making this clear to Turkey. Yes, there is a road that leads to Europe and there is also a road that leads to the European Union for Turkey, and the same rules apply to Turkey as apply to Latvia, Bratislava and Slovenia. If Turkey is prepared to recognise these rules, then there is a clear and unambiguous road leading to Europe, but that means showing respect for democracy and showing respect for human rights.</p>

The Finnish government"s programme for its presidential term shows that Finland intends to carry out its most important tasks in an effective manner. For my part, I would like to make two points. As far as the future of the Union is concerned the most important tasks of the Council will be tied, on the one hand, to enlargement, and, on the other, to improving the Union"s decision-making machinery, both of which hinge on one another.</p>
<p class="contents">The large-scale programme of enlargement which is now on the horizon calls for a selection of bold reforms to the decision-making process. The Union, which is achieving pan-European dimensions, can only function properly if it develops more as a union of independent states rather than a federation. This must be taken into account when the mandate for the next Intergovernmental Conference is being drafted. The mandate must be drafted in such a way that the Union"s decision-making process is changed to cater for the needs of eastward enlargement as a whole and not the requirements of accession in respect of just five or six countries. This being the case, action cannot be restricted merely to the points not covered by the Treaty of Amsterdam. The Union has to change direction. Any move towards a centralised federation of states on the American model must be checked; we should be aiming for a decentralised Union, and here the Swiss federation might serve as a model in principle. The Swiss system is often referred to as a confederation. Only a Union developing in this sort of direction will be able to enlarge in accordance with existing plans. The Intergovernmental Conference mandate must therefore be broad in scope and include an investigation into the basic principles of the Union"s decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">My other point is connected with the northern dimension. During its presidential term, Finland must try to speed up developments associated with the northern dimension. The next major step will be the development of the northern dimension as part of the union"s internal policy. The northern dimension means that the situation and circumstances pertaining to the northern regions should be taken into consideration in all Union decision making.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have spoken about Bosnia and have endlessly discussed the same problems of decentralisation. I believe that the Balkans will not be reconstructed unless the European spirit of co-responsibility becomes the dominant spirit of politics there.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the European Union can offer the spirit of European construction to the reconstruction of the Balkans and that will be the determining factor. Nothing we say about Thessaloniki, Pristina or Sarajevo will have the same meaning, because today – and this is where the danger lies – in the method of reconstruction with the UN on one side, the European Union on another and the OSCE on yet another, we are creating institutions of dependence where the reconstruction of the Balkans depends on our will but the self-determination of the Balkan peoples in terms of managing themselves is not achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">The danger is that we plan and construct on behalf of others, but do not create the conditions necessary for the peoples and countries of the Balkans to take control of their own destiny. It is for this reason that here, in this Parliament, we have already proposed, for example, a foundation for democracy which, starting with the Bosnian problems, should be extended to the whole of the Balkans. This foundation would finance all the initiatives and contribute to the reconstruction of democratic structures in the Balkans, because, at the end of the day, the capacity for self-determination depends on the society"s capacity to organise itself democratically. This is where the great problem lies in those countries with authoritarian structures where democracy is not readily available. Not until democracy is readily available will the reconstruction of the Balkans be possible.</p>

That is precisely why it is essential for our citizens to step up their fight against the objectives of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, under the Finnish Presidency, we will see EU militarisation become increasingly subordinate to NATO. Indeed, with the Presidency of a country which is not even a NATO member and which is renowned for its pacifist stance, we will also witness the continuation of the European Union"s participation in the escapades of new NATO on a similar or even a much worse scale, as in the imperialist attack against Yugoslavia. We can also expect to see a lot more of the flagrant attacks on workers, in addition to an increase in unemployment and poverty, heightened levels of social and marginal inequality, continuation by the Turkish regime, with the support of the European Union, of the 25 year occupation of 40 % of Cyprus and the genocide of the Kurdish people, regarded by some as terrorists.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a crying shame that Öçalan has been refused asylum and that he was handed over to the Turkish authorities when it was certain that a death sentence would be imposed. In other words, we are dealing with a combination of imperialistic policies and crass hypocracies, since, amongst other things, the European Union does its utmost for Human Rights and the rights of its citizens.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of course, the Atlantic coalition, on the orders of American politicians, appears to have come out on top. But at what price? We are now faced with the enormous destruction which we have caused, mostly with no serious military objective. Having paid for this destruction, the European tax-payer will now be asked to pay for reconstruction. Bitter derision and, material waste have added to the human and political damage, and we are now in the front line of Community confrontations, in a psychological situation which is aggravated by the destruction which we have brought about.</p>
<p class="contents">We are at risk of being ensnared in these conflicts, unless the European countries do not stand by powerless in the face of the final phase of ethnic cleansing which has not touched the universal sense of conscience to any great extent: we risk the elimination of the remaining Serb inhabitants, in that region, who have become a minority in their own country.</p>
<p class="contents">Respect for international law, for the sovereignty of States, for their territorial integrity, is not always without its problems, but the violation of that respect causes infinitely more problems. This is what the authorities of the Union and the governments of the Member States should understand.

Indeed, it was the violent escalation of the drawn-out Kosovo affair that now places before us the prospect of a Stability Pact for the Balkans. I should like to make a number of recommendations in connection with both interrelated themes.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to consolidate the fragile peace on the legendary killing fields of Kosovo Polje, there must be optimum co-operation between the international organisations concerned; the UN for the return of the refugees, the OSCE in terms of constructing democracy, and the EU for economic and social construction. If international co-ordination is lacking or falls short then the price paid for this will be institutional chaos. For its part, the EU would do well to guard against this critical danger. Thus, there should be no proliferation of EU bodies all concentrating on the one essential task: the reconstruction of Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, Brussels must urge the rival Albanian parties, that is the Democratic League of Kosovo and the Kosovo Liberation Army, to work together. Ultimately, those who pay have a fair amount of say in the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that it is precisely this kind of homegrown contribution that is indispensable to the realisation of an effective Stability Pact in the Balkans. That is why all those engaged in the Balkans should also turn their hand to the wheel together; with every available support from the European Union. A regional Stability Pact could be one solution, or a pan Balkans bureau for reconstruction. Homegrown initiatives of this kind will boost Western stabilisation efforts in a way that cannot be underestimated. For neither the region nor the European Union will be served by Balkan states entering into the race for Brussels on a purely individual basis. As I speak, the notion, perhaps the distant dream, of a form of Benelux, is spreading through the Balkans. This is certainly an encouraging sign, for even if we do not strive for political unity, we are certainly in favour of being on good neighbourly terms. Indeed, that is in every sense our Christian duty.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have demanded action and warned against passivity on the part of the West. I make this point so that those who are new here today know that we have been talking about this for a very long time. Unfortunately, the Western governments" lack of action led to Milosevic first launching an assault on Croatia, then on Bosnia Herzegovina, and ultimately creating a bloodbath in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">There are millions of refugees, umpteen thousand dead and misery everywhere we look in the region. Many years of turning a blind eye is one of the reasons why it was necessary to undertake a military strike. We are all glad that the joint action undertaken by the West and Russia brought the war to an end and made it possible for the Albanian refugees to return to their homeland. But major tasks now await us which we must tackle energetically and efficiently, ensuring above all that we do not exclude the citizens of Kosovo in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">The errors that we made when undertaking reconstruction work in Bosnia Herzegovina must not be repeated. If the salaries received by the international personnel in Bosnia Herzegovina are not in reasonable proportion to the aid which is received on site, then that is unacceptable and must not be repeated in Kosovo under any circumstances. But we must also avoid making other errors of the kind that the Council is prepared to make now. If the Council were to locate the Kosovo agency in Thessaloniki then inefficiency would be the order of the day. This agency must be located in Kosovo, and not 200 Kilometres away in another country, when all the UN, OSCE, and UNHCR organisations and agencies are located in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am convinced that Thessaloniki is the best location for the headquarters of the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe. I urgently call upon the Council and also the Greek government to vote for this option. Permit me also to mention at this point that I cannot begin to see the point of next week"s spectacle in Sarajevo. One and a half days of spectacle will cost EUR 1.5 million, which is out of all proportion to the achievements that won"t be made that day, since all the things that are supposed to be achieved there have already been decided on in Cologne.</p>
<p class="contents">How many small and medium-sized enterprises could we set up in Bosnia Herzegovina with this one and a half million euro? How many jobs could we create and how many more people could return than have been able to hitherto? Now just a word for Serbia"s benefit. A warm welcome to two representatives of the Serbian Opposition in the stand. Esteemed colleagues, the Serbian resistance to the Milosevic regime must now be given all the help that we can offer, unlike two years ago when we left the Opposition to their own devices for fear of antagonising the regime. Let us at last learn from our mistakes.</p>

<p class="contents">In order to face up to this, Madam President, we require a Community machine which is in good working order, and I can assure you that my group will do everything possible so that this machine may be put in order as soon as possible. You need it and we need it. How can we allow a situation in which the resigning Commission has continued to operate since last March and is still intervening to try to undermine the implementation of a single price for books and to define the mandate for the next WTO negotiation, the importance of which for the future is well known. This is not democratic and we will fight it. On the other hand, we will help you with the rapid establishment of a serious and trustworthy Commission which is at the service of all Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from these considerations, our candidate for the Presidency, Mr Romano Prodi, has just displayed the constructive and creative spirit with which he views the contribution of the Commission to the next Intergovernmental Conference. Under your Presidency, it will fall to the Council to define the mandate of that IGC. I believe that the presence by your side of a strong Commission making its contribution to the development of that mandate is equally essential. We will certainly help you in this to ensure that everyone faces up to his or her responsibilities. However, apart from that IGC, certain things will also depend on your Presidency, and we all know that certain improvements to the functioning of the institutions do not necessarily depend on a reform of the Treaties and that it concerns firstly – and perhaps principally – the Council. It depends particularly on you.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Kosovo, I only have one thing to say. At the end of the day we Europeans often regret our lack of a common foreign and security policy. We express our impatience in the face of these vacillations. However, the President of your country has given a marvellous demonstration of the contribution that Europeans can make to peace on their continent and the development of a European solution to European problems. The fact that the United Nations and Russia have been able to be incorporated into the peace process in Kosovo is due to united European action.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Öçalan affair, Mrs President, I would like to say a few words. The first is to congratulate you for having made Tampere into a European Council primarily dedicated to asylum policy. In fact I believe that the current Öçalan affair in Istanbul is also due to the fact that we were not at first able to implement an asylum policy worthy of its name.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in relation to the death penalty, please allow me to draw your attention and insist to you that your Presidency intervenes with all its powers in Istanbul as well as in Tehran, since in Tehran we know of thirteen judges who face the death penalty simply for having been accused of spying on behalf of Israel. We are counting on you, Madam President.</p>

It is even harder to rebuild relations between the Serbs and the Albanians which make it possible for the Serbian minority to remain in Kosovo. This can only be achieved if legal proceedings are initiated against murderers, rapists and war criminals. This is one of the genuinely difficult tasks. The most difficult of all will be to secure long-term peace. We must learn to combine the military iron gloves of NATO with the economic velvet gloves of the EU and provide co-operation and aid for economic and democratic development. We in the EU must establish an anteroom to those Balkan states which intend to develop along the lines of democracy and the market economy. If they hope to perhaps one day become members of the European Union, we can strengthen the democratic forces in the same way as was successful for other previous dictatorships in Southern Europe. We must also provide humanitarian aid to Serbia, insofar as this can be achieved without supporting the Milosevic regime, and we must urge municipal leaders, private associations and others to work with the democratic forces in both Kosovo and Serbia.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the reconstruction agency, I would like to thank Mr Fischler for his frankness. I have seldom heard a Commissioner distance himself so clearly, and in such a well-reasoned manner, from a Council Resolution. The Council has entered into a shameful, face-saving compromise for those who promised to locate the centre in Thessaloniki. Now, the Headquarters will be in Thessaloniki, whilst those carrying out the work will be in Pristina. What on earth is that all about? I ask all the Union"s citizens to note that it is therefore not the Commission and the Parliament but their own governments which cannot grasp something as simple as the fact that the reconstruction work in Kosovo must be carried out in Kosovo and from Kosovo. We in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party will vigorously contest the Resolution. It simply won"t do. It must be amended.</p>

Abdullah Öçalan was in Italy. Abdullah Öçalan was in Greece. My country, Germany, didn"t want him. He was not supposed to remain in Italy and neither did he wish to. He was not permitted to be in Greece. Now he is in Turkey. Our collective failure in the Öçalan case makes it difficult for us to explain to many people in Turkey, irrespective as to whether they are Turks or Kurds, why we are against the death penalty in principle, and that, as Mr Swoboda has just said, we do not just oppose the death penalty on account of Mr Öçalan, but in principle.</p>
<p class="contents">We challenge the Turkish Parliament to abolish the death penalty once and for all, because it is very much in our interest to welcome Turkey amongst us as a European country amongst equal partners. For this reason, we are convinced that to use the death penalty in the Öçalan case would not be the right answer to the long-standing Kurdish question and certainly cannot be an alternative solution. The Öçalan case could also be an opportunity for the people, for the Turks, for the Kurds in Anatolia and for the country, the Republic of Turkey, if the Turkish government and the Turkish Parliament only had the will for this to be so.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, our resolution, which hopefully we will adopt tomorrow, is also an appeal to our Turkish colleagues in Ankara. Working together, we could ensure that one day it will not be necessary to conduct debates in this exalted Chamber on a democratic Republic of Turkey. I hope that together we will succeed in bringing this about.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Between the violence of Serbian paramilitary forces, the intimidation and violence of the KLA and NATO bombs falling from the sky: this is the sentiment of those Kosovo Albanian troops who chose to fight for their rights without resorting to violence. Against the NATO bombings and against nationalism and the homicidal and suicidal politics of Milosevic: this is the feeling of millions and millions of European men and women who hold the respect of human rights to be fundamental, wherever they have been violated: in Kosovo, Kurdistan, Palestine or Iran. These are the democratic, peaceful forces which should have been supported by the international community. Obviously, Milosevic had and has to be stopped, as the KLA had and has to be stopped, each responsible in different ways. Now, after NATO has destroyed and laid waste in the name of the defence of human rights, we must rebuild. We hope and wish to act in this Parliament so that construction takes place in such a way that human resources and the dignity of each side involved in the conflict are respected and valued during the process, and that colonisation by Europe or the United States World Bank is avoided. Kosovo must be reconstructed with its present and past inhabitants – both Albanian and Serbian – as protagonists. At the same time, Serbia and Montenegro and the infrastructures laid to waste and destroyed by air raids, must be rebuilt, and the damage to the environment investigated and remedied. The reconstruction of Kosovo must focus not only on the economy and trade, but also on the social, civil and democratic fabric. To achieve this, reconstruction must be carried out through the involvement of local communities, with exchanges between municipalities, universities, men and women of the European Union, Kosovo and the Republic of Yugoslavia. For the war to be truly erased from the picture, we must bring about reconciliation, create societies and build democracy. This is our challenge.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the crux of the Öçalan issue: the fact that laws still exist in too many national legal codes which punish as a crime the exercising of peoples" rights to self-determination in its extreme form of secession, even when non-violent, democratic means are employed. This is the meaning of Article 125 of the Turkish Penal Code, which, as Mr Kaleli, the Turkish ambassador, stated right here in Strasbourg, follows the example of Article 241 of the Italian Penal Code, which was issued at the time of the Fascists and is still in force. Therefore, for as long as the European Parliament focuses its attention solely on whether Öçalan"s death sentence will be enforced, without dealing with the question of peoples" rights to self-determination, it will scratch the surface of the problem but never manage to resolve it.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the Parliament of a union of democratic constitutional States how can we do otherwise than to advocate a just peace and reconciliation in that region, and particularly in Kosovo. That is the heart of the matter and we have gained that insight particularly during the debates on and inquiry into the enlargement of the European Union, a democratic constitutional state, that is the heart of our movement, of our Union. I also think that we are justified in saying that everything depends on this, both the safety of the citizens and the development of the economy in the regions concerned. Nothing can be achieved when there is no constitutional state.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we must also endeavour in earnest to see that particularly the other aspects associated with law and government in Kosovo are also given the attention they deserve. It is about the safety of the citizens, and particularly those who are returning. I should like in particular to draw your attention to the fact that there are perhaps 2000 or maybe more Kosovan prisoners who have been taken to Serbia by the withdrawing Serbian troops. I feel that there should be no question of us leaving them to their fate, but that we in this Parliament, the Council and the Commission should give our full attention to the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, if we are to see justice done then we will have to ensure that full co-operation is given to the International Tribunal in The Hague in order to pursue the criminals that have wrought havoc in Kosovo, and not just in Kosovo but now at last in Bosnia too. Why have Karadzic and Mladic still not been arrested? If that doesn"t happen, Mr President, then we can more or less forget being able to achieve reconstruction in the region in any real sense. If we talk about a Stability Pact then it isn"t about gagging those who are screaming for justice, but about a just peace, and that demands action and not keeping serious crimes under wraps.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we should also urge parties and groups in Kosovo towards political participation in government. That is why the resolution also states how important it is for Mr Rugova to be present in Kosovo. On the subject of which, it will not do for the most important figures not to be present at all times when they too have a role to play in the process of political reconstruction, also perhaps in co-operation with other parties that have emerged from the KLA. We are going to have to get everyone there wishing to take political responsibility used to the fact that they are responsible in an administrative sense, so that later on, when elections take place, the population will also be able to see whom it can trust.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the Stability Pact is of great importance for the wider region. For far too long now, we as the European Union have taken measures, for example against Serbia, measures which were necessary but which were taken at no cost whatsoever to ourselves. It was Macedonia, Bulgaria, Albania, Romania, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, the surrounding regions, which paid the price. It is imperative that we offer financial compensation here, but by no means that alone. We will also have to create economic opportunities so that the European Union, by taking a more generous stance, is able to recompense the economic damage done in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the whole process of development, also in terms of society, is of great importance. The same applies to the insights we have gained from the enlargement process. Democracy can only grow if the population truly experiences it. I should like to close by quoting the Bishop of Kosovo: ‘Nothing will ever become of Serbia unless it is transformed into a democratic constitutional state’. The Parliament has never given up hoping for this.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I too intend to speak mainly on Kosovo and the Balkans, but I suspect that the Finnish Presidency will, of course, be preoccupied with much weightier matters over the year to come.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most important tasks facing the Finnish Presidency is the future of Kosovo. We must now look forwards. It is the European Union"s move, now that we are talking about the reconstruction of that part of former Yugoslavia. That must be brought about swiftly and efficiently, working in close co-operation with the United Nations and the OSCE. A great deal went wrong in Bosnia. We must learn from that. Our own initiatives must not be fragmented. Activities in Kosovo must be directed from Pristina. This responsibility cannot be shared with another office in Thessaloniki. We feel that it would be better, as has also been proposed here, for the administration of the Stability Pact for the entire Balkans region to be located in Thessaloniki.<br /></p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that Kosovo has become a protectorate. It could not be any other way. But I hope that the UN will implement this in such a way that the Kosovars themselves play the leading part in the reconstruction process. The international administration continues to have to step in in Bosnia and has to do so too often, which is no way to bring about democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">An agreement has been reached on Kosovo which must be worked out in further detail. To this end, it is of great importance that safety in this region of former Yugoslavia is guaranteed. We attach great importance to achieving demilitarisation as rapidly as possible. We hope that all parties will work together to achieve this. In discussing the future of Kosovo we are of the opinion as a group that if there is any question of borders being redefined, then this will only be permitted in accordance with the Helsinki principles, by peaceful, political means.</p>
<p class="contents">A great deal has already been said about the situation in Serbia. I support all those who maintain, on the one hand, that Milosevic should be sent to The Hague as soon as possible and who, on the other, ask for support for the democratic opposition in Serbia. I wholeheartedly endorse the proposal made by my colleague, Mr Cohn-Bendit, to set up an organisation uniting all political movements in order to help the opposition there.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall continue our discussions on the Stability Pact later, the Stability Pact for the entire region. I should like to make two comments which I believe will be of importance to the Finnish Presidency when it takes up the drafting and preparation of the Stability Pact. The location of the office is an important matter but the principles on which we are basing our work are far more important still. First and foremost, it appears to me to be of great importance that the countries in the region should themselves be given a major part to play in the implementation and development of the pact and that it should not be imposed from Brussels or other European capital cities. Secondly, we must also enter into honest and open debate with those countries clarifying what we mean when we say that the region must be integrated into the European Union as quickly as possible. That will not be a simple task. We must discuss this honestly with those countries. If we fail to do this then it will create new frustrations, and there is already frustration enough in the region.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It continues to be a bleeding wound in our continent. Despite international protests, including from this Chamber, the Turkish government continues not merely to refuse to recognise but also to systematically violate the basic rights of the Kurdish people. Thousands of people have been killed and maimed in the long years of this conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">The arrest and death sentence of the PKK leader Öçalan and the strong reactions caused by this have emphasised the need for a rapid solution. Both Turkey and the Kurds must demonstrate the will to sit down at the conference table and must, in a peaceful and democratic way, find a solution in order to end the suffering. Hopefully, the EU and the Finnish Presidency will be able to play an active role in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that all Members of the Parliament distance themselves from Öçalan"s methods and actions. I, nevertheless, believe that we are all ready to declare that capital punishment will <span class="italic">not </span> bring the problem closer to a solution. Capital punishment can never be the answer to any problem.</p>
<p class="contents">We Liberals will never cease to condemn this barbaric act wherever it may occur. In those countries which have applied for membership of the Union and where capital punishment still exists we are currently witnessing how it is being abolished.</p>
<p class="contents">Since we hope that Turkey also will be welcomed to the European Union within the next few years, we appeal to Turkey not only to suspend Öçalan"s death sentence, but also to work towards the general abolition of capital punishment in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to urge the Turkish government on behalf of the Liberal Group to go even further and to use this opportunity in order to take the initiative for negotiations and to implement those reforms which are necessary in order to guarantee the political, human and cultural rights of the Kurds.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our group condemned both the violation of human rights on the part of Belgrade and the war by NATO against Yugoslavia, as an illegal, unjust and immoral war. For this reason, despite the violation of human rights and the ethnic cleansing against the Kurds by the Turkish regime, our group does not request that the European Union nor NATO bomb Turkey. We are prudent and we are sensible. On the contrary, we believe that the two problems that you have mentioned – the death sentence and respect for the human rights of the Kurdish ethnic minority – require a peaceful, political solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The death sentence against Mr Öçalan must be lifted. In addition, the European Union must demand that the Turkish government maintains a dialogue with the Kurds, a dialogue which resolves the Kurdish claims for autonomy within Turkey, as well as respect for democratic rights. In the same way that there are Autonomous Communities in Spain, <span class="italic">Länder</span> in Germany or Communities in Belgium, etc., there should also be a similar solution in Turkey for the Kurds, so that they may enjoy, in the same way that you have indicated in Finland, the ability to speak their own language, a free press reflecting their problems and a regional Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, we believe that the European Union and the European Parliament should react speedily and thoroughly, so that Turkey may embark on a democratic path and participate in this greater Europe which stretches from Portugal to Russia.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The question is whether or not there is the basic political will throughout the whole of Europe to ensure its progress. Naturally, it is a welcomed sign that one of its long-term objectives is to advocate an Intergovernmental Conference which will deal with all institutional issues, in particular the hitherto largely unchecked issue of maintaining institutional balance.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, rebuilding Kosovo and intervention in the Western Balkans are matters requiring immediate attention but the question is: have we learned from past mistakes? I have the feeling that European intervention and investment in the Balkans has remained very much on an individual rather than an institutional level. If we fail to recognise our past mistakes, I do not think that we will be able to proceed in the future and it must be said that, from now on, it all boils down to whether we can deal with issues relating to democratic progress without the use of weapons. That is what is important.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the issue of the reconstruction agency and of Thessaloniki, I would like to say that, whilst the solution may be a simple and straightforward one, let us not forget that we are primarily talking about European<span class="italic"> </span> intervention. When there is a neighbouring country – and the same would be true, Mr President, if the situation were in Hungary, in which case the base for intervention would probably be in Austria – the question is not only whether the latter can and should benefit but also whether those neighbouring countries which border problematic areas really can share their experience about what is happening in the area. Therefore, this issue should be examined from a political, practical and commercial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">The security policy which the President referred to is, I believe, one of the most important issues but one which once again calls for political will. We have decided to narrow the gap between high-sounding proclamations and the practicalities of their implementation. Of course, all the organisations will work together and experience has it that wherever many international organisations are involved, we have had results. Issues concerning freedom and security are of utmost importance. Madam President, at the Tampere Council, we must decide to fight against drugs, organised crime and the threat to the safety of our citizens. We must also invest in the protection of citizens and not compromise with that ‘dark side’ which promotes closer links between terrorism, trade in arms and nuclear weapons and organised crime. Generally, our policy must not be one of compromise with the status quo, but of war against it. Only in this way can we ensure the protection of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The resignation of the Commission proves that we do not just need institutions – we also need the control mechanisms and the collective will to assign the European Commission the role it deserves. In addition, we have to fill the democratic void – not, as I see it, within the European Parliament but between the Council and the Commission. We must return to the fundamental principles which advocate real co-ordination between social and economic policies. We must intensify our social intervention, Madam President, since guidelines are not enough. I am afraid that the problems are getting out of hand and our way of tackling them is far too bureaucratic.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish, of course, to congratulate the Finnish Presidency for its ambitious programme. We know that the Finnish Presidency will do all that it can. The issue is whether the whole Council is determined, and if we are all determined for that matter, to meet the challenges of these difficult times of heavy competition and internationalisation, and to respond to all the problems, including Third World development, where the support of Europe is vital. We also need to ensure the success of enlargement which can only be made possible, Madam President, if we increase our existing pool of resources.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During a particularly dark period of my country"s history, when freedom of movement was effectively forbidden, Finland was the first country which I was able to visit using my journalistic immunity. It was the first European country where I saw with my own eyes what democracy and socialism mean and what it means for a nation to live freely and not under military rule. It was a great eye-opener for me and has remained with me throughout my life.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, Finland is a country with great experience of surviving peacefully under difficult conditions and with difficult neighbouring countries. It is the ideal country to lead our increasingly urgent endeavours for Balkan reconstruction and already President Ahtisaari has contributed a great deal to this process.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret that I cannot speak more on your very interesting programme, but unfortunately political issues have arisen here which I am obliged to comment on. Firstly, Commissioner Fischler"s attack on the decision to locate the reconstruction agency in Thessaloniki. He suggested that this was just a means of getting aid for the area, meaning Greece. I don"t know when he last visited Thessaloniki but I can assure him that it is a thriving city and the establishment of this centre there will not necessarily add anything to the city. Surely, however, it will be very economical for the European Union to establish the Centre in Thessaloniki. I don"t know if the Commission has done its home-work and realised that the alternative would mean higher salaries, that there is no infrastructure in Pristina and that it would have to pay out a great deal to ensure the safety of its staff who would be in danger in an area where there is little safety. So if you consider that, under these circumstances, Pristina is an ideal place to establish an international centre, a central administration covering not only Kosovo but also all of the Balkans, then I regret to say that your comments are not only insincere but are also politically motivated. It makes me wonder how a Commission which no longer has any political authority and whose ethical reputation has been largely discredited, particularly following the Bangemann case, dares to adopt such a stance and campaign against the decisions of the Council of Ministers. I am dumbfounded, Mr Commissioner!</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Turkey, Madam Minister, I personally wish to see Turkey heading in the direction of Europeanisation since that will be better for Greece. I would agree with the need for a special strategy for Turkey but please take into consideration that a similar strategy of guarantees for Greece is required by the European Union. Greece is the only country of the European Union whose borders are threatened and disputed by the very country which everyone – we Greeks included – truly wishes to welcome with open arms and to see become a European country.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Öçalan, now regarded by many as a terrorist – just as Arafat and the IRA were terrorists before we accepted them as leaders of their people – the least we can do for him, since the idea of political asylum seems to have fallen by the wayside, is, as our colleague so aptly put it, to save his life if that is what it takes to rid ourselves of the stigma that, up until now, has been attached to our conduct in the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam Minister, I apologise for not being able to stay for your reply as I have another urgent commitment, but I would like to send a few words of Finnish to your country: <span class="italic">Minä rakastan sinua</span> ( I love you).</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We heard Mr Fischer, the great general of the European Union, who is in command of the incursions in the Balkans, speaking about Turkey and the only thing he said was that in Helsinki Turkey should be upgraded to a preaccession state. What Mr Fischer seems to have forgotten, what he failed to recall, what just escaped him, was the Öçalan factor and, not least, the existence of 20 million Kurds in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">The Finnish government minister made reference to the Öçalan case which was most encouraging. But we must not limit ourselves to a few simple references in our speeches. There are two very good reasons why the European Union should intervene proactively. The first is that we were under the impression that it was interested in human rights both within the Balkans and further afield. So, there are 2 million Kosovars, fine – but what about the 30 million or so Kurds? The second reason is that the European Union is guilty of not granting asylum to Öçalan. In this case, we need actual intervention, not words.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end, Mr President, with a question to the President-in-Office of the Council of Foreign Ministers: If Turkey cannot give assurances for Öçalan"s life and if Turkey does not take steps to ensure the political rights of the Kurds, then does the Finnish Presidency believe that Turkey should proceed to the preaccession stage in Helsinki?

<p class="contents">I shall not talk about Kosovo, for my colleagues Doris Pack and Arie Oostlander have already done that. I want to say something about the rest of your programme, because there are a number of interesting points there too.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the problematic area relating to asylum seekers. I understand that you are to organise a special summit on this subject. For many years now, there have been calls for effective policies at the European level in this area and we too advocate improved harmonisation of our legislation in this field, both in terms of admission procedures and reception facilities. We advocate improved distribution of asylum seekers across the European Member States so that it is not a case of a few Member States, and there are four or five of them, receiving the vast majority of asylum seekers and the others doing far too little. If you see an opportunity to achieve something in this respect then I think you will have achieved something very worthwhile for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point on your agenda is a transparent Europe free of fraud. In my country, the Netherlands, we have a law on openness in government with maximum transparency and Finland has the same tradition. I understand that a number of international researchers have recently produced an excellent proposal relating to openness of government and transparency for the European Union. I shall see that you receive this proposal. It is a full regulation with explanatory notes, etc. I hope that we shall at last have the opportunity to implement something of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">Then I saw to my surprise that you have also put the subject of taxation high on your agenda. That is interesting, particularly with there being a new Commissioner from the Netherlands in that field. I should like to recommend that you concentrate above all on taxation pertaining to trade and industry, for there is a great deal that needs to be brought into line there. But I should also like to ask you to give attention to one particular area of income tax and that is the equal treatment of men and women. The Parliament has been asking for this for more than ten years. If you could make a first move in this respect and receive support from Mr Bolkestein then you will also be doing something very positive for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, the subject of human rights. I have seen that you wish to undertake a number of endeavours in this field too. Firstly, in relation to Yugoslavia. I sincerely hope, and concur with Doris Pack and Arie Oostlander in this respect, that you take the opportunity to exert such pressure on Yugoslavia that those who have violated human rights there are indeed handed over to the Tribunal in the Hague.</p>
<p class="contents">I also hope that you can prevent the death penalty from being carried out in Turkey for I believe that would be a disgrace for Europe. Lastly, a subject I am particularly keen for you to give a great deal of attention to is Burma. I hear that the Finnish Presidency has already organised a visit to Burma. Earlier this week, a request was made for attention to be given to the subject. I belong to the international committee that supports Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi. I hope to travel to Thailand and Burma in three weeks" time and to speak to all parties concerned. I sincerely hope that you will take the opportunity to at last bring about progress where Burma is concerned. I think that you would receive a great deal of support from this Parliament. I think that you would then have performed a valuable task for democracy in the ASEAN countries. I wish you a great deal of luck and success. It is your first Presidency but it appears to me that you really are going to do it well.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is a new Presidency, which does not resemble the last one very much, but shouldn"t we point out some similarities nonetheless? The German Presidency was concerned with putting together its key work, Agenda 2000, and faced two major crises, that of the Commission, and the much more serious one of the war in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">The Finnish Presidency has been entrusted by the European Council with a number of important projects which could be grouped together under the heading ‘Preparation for Europe"s Future’. Indeed, if it manages to bring to a successful conclusion the Tampere Extraordinary Summit, which concerns the security of Europe"s citizens, the preparation of a European defence system, through the integration of the WEU with the European Union, the launch of a new round of enlargement in December, and finally, the implementation of the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe, the Finnish Presidency will have been a great Presidency of transition for the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">Finland, thanks to the commitment and tenacity of its President, Martti Ahtisaari, caused a shift in the mind set in Kosovo from one of war to one of peace. Together with the German Presidency, the Finnish President clearly articulated Europe"s voice at the opportune moment.</p>
<p class="contents">In Kosovo, and throughout the region devastated by war, almost everything remains to be done: to guarantee an orderly return of the refugees, to build democratic institutions, to set up infrastructures, to reconstruct the economy and make it work. Well, in order to overcome all of these challenges, the international community, particularly Europe, will have to commit a huge amount of human and financial resources. Are we ready for that? The necessary funds have not, of course, been provided for in the financial projections. The sums of money which have been announced seem largely insufficient, and the ECO/FIN Council, as it has done many times before, is already questioning formal decisions taken elsewhere.</p>

The European Union could subsidise Kosovo for ever and hardly notice it. But surely this is not an acceptable solution. As soon as possible, we must aim to have Kosovo stand on its own economic feet. That inevitably means external trade. However, there is a problem in redeveloping Kosovo's trade. Its biggest trading partner in the past and almost certainly in the future must be its neighbour immediately to the north, Serbia proper. Not only that but its trade routes to much of the rest of Europe past through Serbia. And yet Serbia is a pariah, embargoed, its infrastructure largely destroyed, its economy shattered. Here we have a conundrum: how do we get Kosovo to stand on its own feet unless we can rehabilitate Serbia also?</p>
<p class="contents">The current international community's set purpose is that Milosevic and his regime must be got rid of and then everything is possible. Until he goes, not a penny – well, we heard earlier, hardly a penny. But what if Milosevic does not go? Let us hope that he does, but if he does not, have we begun to estimate the cost of restoring Serbia's infrastructure and productive economy? Remember, Serbia was a sizeable, developed industrial economy, a vital trading partner and transport corridor for Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, Greece, as well as Kosovo and all the former Yugoslav Republics.</p>
<p class="contents">So my question to the President-in-Office of the Council and to the Commission is this: how far have you thought through the political steps, the economic and financial commitments that are needed to bring about a free and democratic Serbia and reintegrate a free and democratic Serbia into the European economy and body politic?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In December 1998, the European Parliament adopted a statute with a qualified majority, a decision which was confirmed in May of this year by an overwhelming majority. We therefore have a statute, all that is now required is the approval of the Council. It is not enough that the Council submits an alternative draft. That is no solution. I would like to remind you that the European Commission has unequivocally approved the statute of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Permit me to make a few observations regarding the principles which will govern our actions. One thing is for sure; this statute will not be drawn up by the press, be it the Swedish press, the British press, the Dutch press or that of any other country. Not even the highly regarded French daily <span class="italic">Libération</span> will write this statute, nor shall we allow ourselves to be governed by a statute produced by civil servants. We are not children who can be taken to task; we shall not be harassed by civil servants.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I would recommend that the Finnish Presidency gently shelves the Council document. We will not place ourselves in the Babylonian Captivity of the Council. We will preserve the Parliament"s autonomy and reject any type of guardianship over the Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause) </p>
<p class="contents">We shall make constructive proposals to the Finnish Presidency. I look forward to initial talks taking place at the beginning of September. My request to the Finnish Presidency is that the talks, which will be necessary, be conducted at the highest possible political level. In this way, I believe the success we are after will be achieved as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we are pinning high hopes on the Finnish Presidency. We are also pinning our hopes on the Finnish Presidency as far as the European Parliament"s involvement in drawing up the catalogue of fundamental rights is concerned. The Council cannot seriously be considering the option that only two members of Parliament collaborate on this catalogue of fundamental rights. Without a minimum of 15 delegates, an imbalance will exist between the European Parliament and the national Members of Parliament, where such a balance is required.</p>

<p class="contents">The dynamic reaction of the Union"s governments has been supported by the large majority of European citizens. Public opinion can be congratulated for the fact that, for the first time in centuries, a war has been fought, not in the defence of national or private interests, but in order that what is right should triumph. If many of us feared seven years ago, that Europe had been killed in Sarajevo, our President is all the more right when he says this morning that a new Europe should be born in Pristina.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the political aim, which caused us to resort to force, is still far from being achieved. Peace needs to be rebuilt there. Allied soldiers, with their Russian partners, are on the ground to calm people"s fears and in time, to allow reconciliation to take place. They will only be effective if the whole of Europe, and its Parliamentary representatives at the highest level are up to the task of taking over from them. Nicole Fontaine committed herself this morning to contributing personally to this undertaking. I think that I am speaking on behalf of most of this Assembly when I say that we approve of this initiative, and that many of us would like to join her in this.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been said that Parliament should provide itself with the means for this action through its budgetary powers. This is the message that several of us were expecting, because we were worried to discover the absence of any specific funds and feared that in these circumstances we might be tempted to rob Peter to pay PauI by sacrificing steps which were considered essential at the time the budget was set. I am therefore repeating the request that our colleague, Mr Poos, has just made. We know that the healthy management of the budget during the last Parliamentary term has left us with sufficient means to deal with Kosovo"s immediate needs. We fervently hope that this will be done.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Another priority must be the promotion of enlargement in order to safeguard the peace and political stability of the continent. To this end I have heard, Madam President, with satisfaction, that both issues are political priorities of the Presidency, together with the creation of a catalogue of human rights.</p>

In the global world of today, job-creation measures, in order to be genuinely effective, must be adopted within a global framework. Hence the need for this Presidency to pay particular attention also to the preparation of the next Millennium round. Not only to continue with the deregulation of world trade, but also to provide instruments with which to fight fraud and dishonest commercial practices and to guarantee reciprocal compliance with the regulations governing international trade to achieve the simplification and generalisation of customs procedures under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation, in order, in a word, that the opening up of markets may constitute a genuine opportunity which will create jobs and contribute to the well-being of the citizens of the European Union.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to raise something with the Presidency which was in the small print of her remarks. It is something which affects millions of our fellow citizens in Europe, not once in a while, but every day of every year, and that is mental illness. I was so pleased when the Finnish Government decided to make mental health promotion one of their priorities for their presidency. That is welcome. It is important.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important because as the World Bank showed, this is the fastest growing area of health burden throughout the world. It is important because as the United Nations has declared, it is to be one of the priorities for the UN for the next fifty years, as declared by Boutros-Boutros-Ghali, Secretary General. It is important because, as the Harvard World Bank report showed, mental disorder accounts for some 10.5 % of the global health burden and that is forecast to rise to 15 % by the year 2020.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important because five of the ten leading causes of disability are psychiatric, with the first of those, unipolar depression, accounting for some 10 % of life with disability. It is important because psychiatric and neurological conditions cause 28 % of lives with disability. It is important because suicide is the tenth most important cause of death in the world – in the United Kingdom it is the ninth, ahead of road accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important because surveys show that one in three people visiting their doctors have a mental health problem but only one in six are diagnosed as such. It is important because one in seven of us have a mental health problem at any one time. One in three of us will during our lifetime. It is not a forgettable minority. Nothing is more important among all the Finnish pledges than their pledge to take up the cause of people and their families who suffer not just an illness or a disability but disadvantage and stigma too.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to encourage good mental health. We need to help prevent illness and we need to educate peoples and governments in Europe that mental illness is not to be feared, not to be ignored. It can be cured, it can be treated and millions of our fellow citizens can lead full and fulfilled lives if we...</p>

This issue is going to affect the lives of every citizen in the European Union. We have crucial decisions to make in the Union and in the regulation of information technology over the next five years.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very much hoping that the Finnish Presidency will give us the right framework within which those decisions will be taken. I would just like to set out some pointers for that.</p>
<p class="contents">The first pointer is that it is quite clear that technology runs ahead of politicians. I cannot resist pointing out, Mr President, that we do not yet have computers or Internet access in this splendid building. Indeed, I suspect that many of our colleagues are not as literate in technology as they should be, but that technology is going to have a huge effect on opening up the single market and we must make sure, first of all, that legislation does not restrict the ability of people to innovate and introduce changes and new forms of electronic commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must ensure that consumers powerfully use this technology. The information society is going to be one in which consumers have tremendous power to shop all over the world and particularly within the boundaries of the single market. I have to say that over the next five years the power of electronic commerce will act more quickly to create the single market than any amount of harmonising legislation that we might care to introduce in this Chamber or anywhere else. It will be crucial in creating the single market. Finally, of course, it will create jobs. Electronic commerce is giving small entrepreneurs access to global markets cheaply, quickly and effectively. It is encouraging the development of new forms of small business and we must continue to allow those new businesses to grow.</p>
<p class="contents">And so, in conclusion, Mr President, Finland with its great strength in computers and communications is ideally placed to lead us. There are three words I would leave you with if I may – openness, flexibility and innovation.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I apologise sincerely for not being able to respond to all the excellent, well-considered and immensely important speeches that we have heard here today. I have solved the time problem to some extent by addressing some of the issues that have been touched on by the majority of members in my response.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the situation in the Balkans. In September, when I come to the committee meeting here I shall certainly be once more engaged in the same discussion. However, I would like to answer two questions. Firstly, the position on the Commission"s agency in Thessaloniki, which has been expressed here, comes as no surprise. The Commission expressed the same position in the General Affairs Council. The General Affairs Council made a unanimous decision, which you are aware of, and which I mentioned in my speech.</p>
<p class="contents">We begin from the position that the European Union will approach the issue of stability in the Balkans on a regional basis. Accordingly, the headquarters will be in Thessaloniki. However, the centre of operations, the first of such, will be in Pristina and there will be more of them in other regions as and when facilities improve. I sincerely hope that we, the Commission and you yourselves will achieve consensus on this matter. As far as I am aware, we have a tradition that when the Heads of our Governments and States come to a decision on an issue at a summit, be it a regular or extraordinary meeting, we strive in the General Affairs Council to find a way of implementing that decision. This is what was done in the case of the Thessaloniki office as well as with regard to the broader plan and Hombach. As the country holding the Presidency, we shall strive to implement, as I said, all those decisions we need in respect of Sarajevo and the future. In every respect I agree that we have to avoid excessive bureaucracy. That is not the right way to provide employment for the citizens of the European Union. But we do need a sufficient number of skilled officials to take care of the operation. As for the other matters, I would just like to say briefly that despite all the help we shall give the region, ultimately the responsibility obviously lies with the people there themselves. We will only be providing them with support.</p>
<p class="contents">Serbia is a part of the Balkans. For this reason, we have looked at great length into ways of helping Serbia to achieve democracy as quickly as possible. One condition of the return to democracy is freedom of opinion. In this I agree with what has been said here regarding the safety of those who are speaking for freedom of opinion and also the proposal that we should create, through various means, a structure to support real freedom of opinion for this country.</p>
<p class="contents">The war is behind us, but the peace has to be built. For this, we shall also need peacekeeping forces. Finland is not a Member State of NATO, though you might perhaps have formed the opinion she was, from some of the speeches we have heard. But Finland respects the choice of those eleven EU Member States who do belong to NATO. Finland, which has a population of five million, is making its contribution by sending eight hundred peacekeepers to Kosovo. You may compare that figure in terms of the population of your own country. In my opinion, we should all share in the task of ensuring that the Balkan region is secure. But as I said before, for this we need a non-military option in addition to the military one. In this connection, I would like to acknowledge the role played by Denmark for being the first country to allude clearly to this issue in the resolution passed at the Cologne Council meeting. Denmark was the country to make the proposal, but Finland is the country which, as holder of the Presidency, will promote this worthy initiative as vigorously as possible in co-operation with others.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention that the International War Crimes Tribunal is, in our opinion, extremely important, and the tribunal dealing with war crimes in Yugoslavia is a special partner in co-operation for us. We have been co-operating together in Kosovo ever since the report was put together on the mass killings at Racak, when the expert opinion of Finnish coroners was used. We believe this policy is a coherent one.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, I will briefly mention the Tampere Summit again. We will strive to strike a balance, a very delicate balance, between human rights and the question of security. The Tampere meeting will be preceded by an independent meeting of non-Governmental organisations, and we, for our part, wish to offer them our support, while obviously respecting their independent status. The European Union must not be allowed to become a fortress: it must be both strong and open at the same time. This is the principle upon which we will operate, with respect to the Tampere Summit also. The rights of minorities are a weak area in established democracies also, whatever aspect of minorities they are concerned with. I wish to call attention to the fact that there is often room for improvement in all our countries when it comes to the status of ethnic minorities. The Roma are a European minority with no host country to speak up for them when their rights are being violated. I have been in touch with the foreign ministry in Slovakia, one of the applicant countries, and we have begun talks on how the issue may be solved from their point of view. But there is no cause for complacency: the status of the Romain Europe is by no means good. In addition, the situation regarding the rights of minorities in Turkey has been mentioned here. I spoke of it in my speech, and the Kurdish question will most certainly be a subject for debate here very often in the future, when we shall strive to find a way to improve the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">As for enlargement, we shall accept with seriousness the challenge this presents while Finland holds the Presidency. As I must respect the order of business I cannot go into this question in any great detail now as it would take up too much time. But I would like to assure you of two things. We shall treat the applicant countries as impartially as possible, on the basis of the Commission"s reports, and we shall try to make our decisions wisely so that the applicant countries will feel they have made progress according to their individual merits, believing the process to be fair, efficiently undertaken and conducive to the common good. For this reason, we Finns have never made promises in connection with timetables any more than we have regarding other matters. However, in our opinion, enlargement is a special issue, and we will do everything within our power in the area of institutional reform to move it along. Institutional reforms must be introduced in such a way that the Union can live with them even when the number of Member States has exceeded twenty.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have to commend the many here who have spoken of a socially and ecologically strong Europe. That gives me hope. I mentioned it today to a group representing young people in Europe, who met me, as a representative of the European Union, at a writing competition award ceremony. I assured them that we would be giving consideration to the issue of youth, although there is no longer any special portfolio attached to this issue. Issues of youth can be successfully dealt with by means of mainstreaming, just as effectively as, for example, issues of gender equality, aged people, as has been touched upon here, and other such matters. I believe that we have to discuss the matter again with the new Commission, and also with you here in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I have tried to be as brief as possible to keep to the schedule, and in keeping with the spirit of the new, efficient European Union.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
