<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Elmar Brok (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">author</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, it was in April last year that this House considered the treaties relating to the accession of Romania and Bulgaria and resolved that it would agree to these treaties being signed, the meaning of which decision is that it is the will of this House that Romania and Bulgaria should become Member States of the European Union, and that the date named in the treaty is 1 January 2007. That is indeed the case and it is not open to question.</p>
<p class="contents">There are questions, however – not about membership itself, but about the date. These treaties explicitly state that May this year – the Commission has specified the 16th day of that month – is the deadline for consideration as to how the two countries have complied with the requirements of the European Union’s laws and the content of the accession treaties, not merely in terms of the laws they have decided to adopt, but also in terms of the implementation, the practical putting into effect, of them. In saying this, I am, of course, perfectly well aware that we cannot expect them to have done this 100%, for 100% could be achieved only in a perfect world, and that is not, in these countries, going to be achieved at once.</p>
<p class="contents">The question therefore arises as to whether critical mass has been achieved, and it is to that that we expect answers. I hope, Commissioner, that, in your speech, which we can expect in a moment, we will get closer to those answers. The question also arises as to whether the deadline of 31 December this year is sufficient to allow the necessary implementation to be carried out, or whether the two countries need another year. Is this a suitable occasion for applying the super-safeguard clause, or would it be more appropriate to go for another option, that being that the Commission and the Council should take their decisions not now, but rather in October, in order to give these countries a couple more months’ time for implementation? Is it, alternatively, conceivable, that – as is indeed possible up to three years following the two countries’ accession – individual chapters might be set aside as a result of the insufficient transposition in them of the treaty and the European Union’s legislation? Might there be, for this period too, a monitoring process to determine whether this is or is not the case? Those are the questions that arise.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite clear to us from the report that you presented to this House on 3 April that there are issues relating to corruption and internal security, to organised crime and similar matters, as well as to certain aspects of the security of trade within the internal market. Has sufficient legislation been enacted in these areas? We can see, for example, that Bulgaria, is, only this week, taking legislative decisions relating to its justice system. Will it be possible for them to be implemented in a credible way by 16 May? These are questions that we have to consider objectively if this process is to be of benefit not only to the two countries in question, but also to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that you, Commission, will be able to help us in this respect. We do, in any case, believe that it is in the interests of both parties – the European Union and the candidates for accession, who will, in any event, join the European Union – that the treaties be complied with and properly put into effect before this happens.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pierre Moscovici (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">author</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, the process of Romania’s and Bulgaria’s joining the European Union has now reached a crucial stage, that of the decision that our institutions must take in order to confirm or postpone these two candidate countries’ date of accession, which is scheduled for 1 January 2007. Following the exchange of opinions that we had with Mr Rehn during April’s plenary, my fellow Members, Mr Brok and Mr Van Orden, and I thought that it would be helpful if Parliament were to keep itself informed, on the one hand, of the arguments put forward by the Commission in terms of setting the date on which these two countries will join and, on the other hand, of the nature of the monitoring process of which their reforms are, and will be, the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">From this perspective, the role of the European Parliament, that of the rapporteurs, and my own role as rapporteur for Romania could be supervisory roles that I would describe as rational and fair, in the context of which we will fully exercise our right to inspect. That is why, three weeks prior to the presentation of the Commission report on the state of progress of reforms in Romania and Bulgaria, we have come to an agreement to submit this oral question, and to do so in the spirit that Mr Brok was outlining just now: far from wishing to give a premature verdict on the two countries’ membership, we simply want to put in practice <span class="bold"></span> to implement <span class="bold"></span> Parliament’s right to be informed by the Commission of the latest developments in the monitoring process. It is in this spirit of openness that we are submitting this question, which is focused on points that are the subject of genuine concerns and of in-depth debates, as borne out by the previous progress reports, particularly in the crucial areas of justice and of the fight against corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, in the context of the support that we are giving to Romania during these months of accelerated reforms, we are establishing two important notions <span class="bold"></span> the rate and consistency of the progress made <span class="bold"></span> while remaining aware, however, that there is no such thing as a perfect political system and that a significant amount of progress has already been made. The fact remains that we are not weakening in our resolve. Our concern remains one of knowing whether or not the Commission – and this is indeed the crucial question – has discovered, throughout recent months, exceptional reasons for alarm that should be brought to our attention. I do not wish to anticipate the report - that is not the aim of our debate - but I will say that, from a personal viewpoint, it seems to me that the Commission has not made such a discovery.</p>
<p class="contents">There obviously remain points on which Romania ought to continue to make progress. That being said, the country’s current situation and the speech <span class="bold"></span> relatively optimistic in this regard <span class="bold"></span> made by Mr Rehn during the plenary session at the beginning of this month do not appear to reveal any major weaknesses that should be addressed with as radical a measure as postponing the date of accession. Allow me, moreover, to point out that a decision such as this could have a harmful effect on the Romanian authorities’ and people’s motivation to press on with the vast reform programmes that have already been embarked on, while accession – provided, of course, that we decide that it does not present any danger – would make it possible to stay within this virtuous circle.</p>
<p class="contents">It is from this angle that the postponement clause must, in my opinion, be considered. Its aim is clear: it provides an antidote to a significantly dangerous situation. In my opinion, it would be dangerous to overuse the postponement clause or to use it in order to voice various concerns, which are certainly understandable but which call for a different response. With regard to less radical concerns, the aim of our oral question was to highlight the other safeguard clauses, which are of an altogether different nature and are much less dramatic. They offer the possibility of continuous and more flexible supervision during the first three years following Romania’s accession to the European Union. It would therefore fall to the Romanian authorities to address the various anxieties that could remain in relation to specific points while keeping in mind two crucial points: not only that of respect for Romanian sovereignty, of course, but also that of the demands attendant on accession to the European Union.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Geoffrey Van Orden (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">author</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> First of all I would like to thank Commissioner Rehn and the officials DG Enlargement for the serious and assiduous way in which they have been guiding and monitoring Bulgaria’s progress towards accession. It is important that we get this right, both for the sake of the people of Bulgaria and for our own citizens. It would be unfortunate if there were any cooling of enthusiasm for enlargement at this stage. It would be quite wrong if the prospects of Bulgaria and Romania were damaged because of any mood change. After all, these countries complete the previous round of enlargement, the EU’s fifth round, and are not part of the next.</p>
<p class="contents">The Accession Treaty signed by Bulgaria and Romania on 25 April last year, and already ratified by 15 EU Member States, deliberately contains various sorts of what might be called ‘conditionality’. First there is the possible postponement clause allowing accession to be delayed by one year in very extreme circumstances. This is of course a political judgement. In my view, the consequences of postponement would be entirely negative: a slap in the face rather than encouragement; a bad signal to the Bulgarian people. It would encourage extremist forces and shake business confidence, and nothing would be achieved that cannot be achieved by other means.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there are separate thematic safeguard clauses. These were also included in the accession treaties of the last ten countries that joined the European Union. They are for possible use once accession has taken place. Two of them relate to economic and internal market aspects, the third to the justice and policing system, combating organised crime and corruption. This is perhaps the area of greatest concern and the focus of the oral question. There are of course other areas that need serious attention, not least the situation of children in care, the integration of the Roma and animal health and welfare controls.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of justice and home affairs I do not think we should be looking for a harmonised system across the European Union. That is generally undesirable, but in any case, what model would we take? But we do want a structure and process that give confidence and deliver the right outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Among other developments in Bulgaria there is now a new penal code, a new chief prosecutor, constitutional changes have been passed that allow the easier lifting of immunities, and the Judicial System Act is going through Parliament. But it is concrete results that we want, not just legislation. Yes, these have been a long time coming – too long perhaps – but they are there now. The clear-up rate for general crime in Bulgaria bears comparison with that in many current EU Member States. For example, the crime rate is lower than in Germany, the detection rate higher. We should recognise that Bulgaria and Romania are being subjected to an unparalleled degree of scrutiny. There is much still to be done and the process of reform will continue for many years.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should be prepared to give a clear signal to the Council: take the decision in June for accession on 1 January 2007; take the decision in December, in the light of further progress by the Bulgarian authorities and in cooperation with them, on any monitoring and other safeguard measures that may be necessary. At the end of the day, what is important is that the people of Bulgaria should have confidence in their administration and justice system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can assure you that the Commission is following the situation with the greatest attention and is ready to offer advice and support in tackling the impact of the floods once the damage has been assessed, as we did last year in the case of Bulgaria and Romania.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the first question as to whether the rhythm of reform in Bulgaria and Romania is such that they will be ready for accession by January 2007, the Commission is currently assessing the progress made in both countries and is not yet in a position to confirm the answer to this critical question. As I said to the Committee on Foreign Affairs on 3 April, the Commission will report on developments until the end of April, so the cut-off date is 30 April, the end of this week. The full factual basis will therefore be available in the first two weeks of May. The Commission will then provide an in-depth analysis on 16 May, and we will then be ready to discuss our assessment further with the honourable Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">However, let me underline the priority of all priorities. The completion and implementation of judicial reform and concrete results demonstrating that these have a real effect on the ground are of paramount importance for our assessment. Systemic conditions, structural conditions that show that the reforms are irreversible need to be in place. These are the critical yardsticks, since a fully functioning justice system underpins the functioning of the whole of society and the economy in its entirety.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of our objective and balanced assessment, the Commission will make a proposal on 16 May for a carefully calibrated decision that will maintain the momentum of essential remaining reforms up to and beyond accession of the two countries. I ask for the support of the Parliament and the Council for this rigorous and fair position.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the second question on the reform of the judiciary and the fight against corruption and organised crime, both countries have shown determination to undertake necessary reforms in this field. In Romania we note significant progress, as Romania has continued to pursue the implementation of its legal package of 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with Mr Moscovici that the rigorous monetary mechanism and the safeguard clause of postponement have provided very strong encouragement and an incentive, and these have produced very tangible results in the case of Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">In Bulgaria amendments have been made to the constitution, reducing the scope of the immunity of Members of Parliament and establishing the leading function of the prosecution service in most investigations. However, there remains ambiguity concerning the independence of the judiciary and there is a serious backlog in cases related to organised crime. As regards the fight against organised crime in Bulgaria, there are still very few investigations and prosecutions. The competent authorities seem in general to have a reactive instead of a proactive attitude. Therefore, urgent attention is needed in this area. The same is true concerning money laundering in Bulgaria.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on Mr Brok’s question concerning the safeguard clauses and monitoring, safeguard clauses are meant to tackle the possible negative consequences that may persist due to shortcomings in Bulgaria and Romania after accession. Safeguards may for instance involve temporarily suspending specific rights under the EU <span class="italic">acquis</span> which are directly related to the shortcomings of a new Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of safeguards are already provided in existing Community legislation, for instance in the area of food safety or transport. In addition, the accession treaty contains three safeguard clauses: a general economic safeguard clause, a specific internal market safeguard clause and a third one which relates to justice and home affairs. Without going into details of how they can be invoked, by way of example I will take the internal market safeguard, which is specifically designed to deal with cases where a new Member State fails to fulfil commitments made in the accession negotiations. If such a failure causes or risks causing a serious breach in the functioning of the internal market, the Commission may take appropriate measures to deal with that situation, even before accession, with entry into force upon accession. It is important to note that this does not require a unanimous Council decision; it requires a Commission decision based on our objective risk assessment of a candidate country’s possible shortcomings.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that, in order to have a meaningful system of safeguard clauses, we also need a monitoring mechanism and, in its role as guardian of the treaties, the Commission will assume this duty and will verify the implementation of EU legislation in the two countries.</p>

<p class="contents">Firstly, I would like to say that Romania’s progress towards accession is clear, particularly in areas that are of fundamental importance to this House, such as the reform of the judicial system and the fight against corruption. I can tell you that Romania has listened to what the European Parliament has had to say on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Romania’s efforts must continue, of course, but there is no question that progress has been made in the right direction, as you have just acknowledged, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">Passing on to other matters, my personal view is that, if possible, as has been planned for some time, Romania and Bulgaria should find out in June when they will enter the Union, that is, whether it is to happen on 1 January 2007, as we all want to see.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that to further delay a decision on the date of entry would create problems, principally for the countries in question. I therefore believe that the accession timetable should be set as soon as possible, preferably in June rather than in December, as Mr Van Orden said earlier. Furthermore, if it is confirmed in June that accession can take place in 2007, that should not mean that the Romanian or Bulgarian authorities would then abandon their adaptation and reform efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in your autumn report you will tell us whether it is necessary, as you have just mentioned, to adopt special safeguard measures, in accordance with the accession treaty, in order to deal with any problems, any deficiencies, that may remain in certain sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">There has also been discussion of the possibility — and this question is therefore contained in the more general question by Mr Brok, Mr Moscovici and Mr Van Orden — of monitoring during the post-accession stage. As you have just pointed out, Commissioner, as guardian of the Treaties, it falls to the Commission to carry out the task of control. Furthermore, the accession treaty provides for specific monitoring, since there are safeguard clauses which can be activated during the first three years. The coming reports will tell us what you have to say about this monitoring that may be necessary following accession.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, these are historic times for Romania and Bulgaria; we shall be completing the fifth accession. These countries have already suffered delays compared to the other 10 States that entered in 2004. They now want to prevent any further delays and I believe that we must encourage, support and reward their efforts. And we will of course study your report in May with great interest, Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They can be summed up in a single sentence. You answered the questions we put to you by saying that it is too early to give an answer. Fair enough: we will wait and see what you will have to say in May, but what I would like to tell you is what the Socialist Group in this Parliament wants right now; we want Romania and Bulgaria to be able to become full Member States of the European Union on 1 January 2007. We make no bones about that being our goal; these two countries’ governments represent different political camps, with one of them being ruled by our allies and the other by parties of a different political hue, yet we are firmly convinced that both governments – irrespective of their political complexion – are making enormous efforts to do the things that are being required of them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for that reason that I can say today on behalf of our group that, if you believe there to be no enormous obstacles that you would bring to our attention in May; if, then, there is no change in the view you take of the situation, then we are taking it as read that this goal can indeed be achieved, and that the substance of our oral question, namely ‘will these states meet the criteria on 31 December 2006?’ can be answered with a resounding ‘yes’.</p>
<p class="contents">If it cannot be, then we will certainly have to debate the matter again, but, as of today, we are working on the assumption that it can be, and that is the message from all the members of our group, the message that my colleague Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen will be giving this House on behalf of the whole family of social democratic parties. We would like to see both these countries join the European Union, we would like to see them do that because this will be the end of a long drawn-out process. We would like to see them do that, because they will be welcome in the European Union. I might add that another reason why we would like to see them do that is that we can see that this process of transformation, while it demands of them enormous efforts, is successful in that it makes them more secure, more stable and more democratic.</p>
<p class="contents">No bargains can be struck – we all know that – but we are confident that this process can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion, so let me say once more, on behalf of the Socialist Group, that, if the criteria are met, we will welcome these states into the EU.</p>

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have lost count of the number of debates we have devoted to Romania and Bulgaria over the past 12 months. The large number seems to testify to this House’s eagerness to show the EU’s citizens that we share their scepticism and concern about the enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate is ostensibly based on an oral question put to the Commission by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and comprising a number of questions along with direct and/or indirect suggestions. The text of this oral question has found its way into the Romanian and Bulgarian press and into <span class="italic">European Voice</span>, and has been the cause of great concern in Romania and Bulgaria. That is why we have taken the liberty of giving a quite clear response to it even before this debate, but I notice that Mr Brok has no interest in my reaction as he has now left the Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">The response I would like to give to this oral question is twofold, in that I would like to cover both the substance and the procedure. With regard to the procedure, I can only regret once more the fact that neither I nor the group had been consulted about the text. We would have been able to make it clear that the designation of – and I quote – ‘a close monitoring system’ is something we emphatically reject, because for many Members of this House, it smacks too much of Romania and Bulgaria being under guardianship, and hence, of discrimination between the Member States, with which we want nothing to do. I would add that neither Mr Brok, Mr Moscovici, nor Mr Van Orden have used the words ‘a close monitoring system’; they are only on paper.</p>
<p class="contents">In principle, I would repeat what I have said before on behalf of our group during the meeting behind closed doors of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. An overwhelming majority of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe takes the view that Romania and Bulgaria should be able to accede on 1 January 2007 and only if there were serious, fact-based shortcomings, would we agree to special safeguard measures being promulgated, which, in our view, cannot be decided upon until the autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is something I would ask my fellow MEPs to consider. It is not a good thing, in the run-up to a debate, to make sceptical noises about the enlargement out of a desire to meet our citizens halfway in their concern, and then to say that we agree to the accession on 1 January 2007 after all. We think that too much damage has already been done to the enlargement project. We therefore hope that all of this will end well and that Commissioner Rehn will suggest the date of 1 January 2007 to his colleagues, so that we can give that a joyful welcome during the June debate. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How, in the Commission’s view, is this best to be guaranteed? What do we think? Should we keep 2007 as the date, or should we move the accession to 2008 after all?</p>
<p class="contents">My group is still as united as ever in its support for further enlargement of the European Union. If, in future, the Western Balkan countries or Turkey meet the conditions, then, as far as we are concerned, they are most welcome to join. Nevertheless, if we take that as our starting point, there are two different possible answers to this central question. There are those in my group who claim that it is precisely because we are so strongly in favour of this enlargement that we should be extra critical and check whether the countries actually meet the conditions at the start of the accession process, so that neither the EU nor its enlargement strategy lose credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">If we then look at Romania and Bulgaria, with all the differences that exist between those countries, we have to conclude that, at the moment – and I would make a point of saying this – they do not meet a number of the prescribed conditions, and that we can justifiably be sceptical about whether they will make the grade in eight months’ time, on 1 January 2007. That is why some of my group think it justified that the pressure should be kept on until the very last minute, until 1 January 2008, in order to guarantee that all countries meet those criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Others in my group, among whom I would include myself, believe that there is a clear difference between Romania and Bulgaria. Looking back on last year in Bulgaria, we have noticed that reforms are taking place at a superficial level, that implementation is limited, that reforms are being introduced more slowly, and that some vital ones were not carried out until the very last moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at Romania, on the other hand, it is evident, not only to us in this House, but also – or so it appears from their reports – to many national and international NGOs and experts, that that rate has gone up and that there is definitely tangible progress, not only on paper but also in practice. Judges and public prosecutors feel free at long last, free from the burden of political influence. There are real guarantees of an independent campaign against corruption, and, fortunately, a number of initiatives have been taken in respect of cases of it in high places. That is why it is also justified to reward this tangible progress in Romania by saying that we abide by the accession date of 2007 but – and I am saying this to Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck – only provided that there is a strong monitoring mechanism in place, not in the general sense as the Commissioner suggested, but specifically in the areas of justice, reform and the fight against corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in that area that we believe it to be necessary to monitor those positive developments even beyond the accession date, and we think that, in the unlikely event of those developments not being sustained, there should be financial implications. The message we want to send by this to the people of the EU, but also to candidate countries such as Croatia and Turkey, is that if you really try your best to carry out reforms, you will be rewarded for this as a candidate Member State. If, on the other hand, you believe that the EU will look the other way, you will be penalised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the last quarter, Forum 18 News Service has published a number of reports on this topic which give me cause for great concern about how Bucharest and Sofia are implementing something that is one of the fundamental political Copenhagen criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to know, Commissioner, where you stand on the proposals that are being made in Romania and Bulgaria concerning the mandatory registration of religious societies, which is something to which my Dutch Government is, in line with international standards, opposed. I do not, in the context of this debate, expect a comprehensive response from you, and so I will give you the Forum 18 documents in a moment. I would be much obliged if you, in your reports in mid-May, could refer to this topic.</p>
<p class="contents">I would make the same request of you in respect of the long-drawn-out issue of the restitution of Hungarian church property illegally confiscated by Romania’s Communist government between 1945 and 1989. According to the information available to me, this involves a total of 2 140 church properties, of which the churches are as yet in full possession of only 54. It would not look very promising, Commissioner, if Romania were to join the EU with this burden from the past distorting its relations with its Hungarian minority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Giving more time to the reform processes that have already begun would, however, be as much in the interests of the EU as of the candidates. Past experience has taught us that welcoming, out of political – or what are claimed to be political – considerations, a country into a club for which it may well not yet be ready can have devastating consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">It is always the public who have to pay the price when the political nomenklatura want to press on towards something for which the time is not yet ripe, and this is something that we have to bear in mind when considering the possibility of enlarging the EU to include Romania and Bulgaria, even though they do, of course, belong to the family of European peoples and must become Member States. Not only is it questionable whether the Romanian and Bulgarian economies can currently take the strain of accession to the EU, but it is also nothing like clear how the funding required for the first three years – which can potentially run up to EUR 24 billion – is to be arranged.</p>
<p class="contents">It is possible that we will be left with no other option but to delay this enlargement by a year, or in any case by a certain period of time. Any other course of action could well send the wrong message to other candidates for accession and would, in the final analysis, be detrimental to the people of Romania and Bulgaria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But let me draw your attention, Commissioner, to some important factors when you prepare your report.</p>
<p class="contents">One is that, despite the huge steps taken, reform of the judiciary and the fight against corruption are still of major concern as regards Romania and Bulgaria. Dozens of emails and letters inform us that the mere adoption of laws is far from satisfactory in solving the problems or in changing existing practice in this area. The implementation of these laws and their reflection in everyday reality should also be taken into account by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it is often questioned whether the situation of minorities is an important factor in this process, their inclusion among the Copenhagen political criteria, as well as the fact that they were monitored during the accession process of the ten previous new Member States, clearly indicates their significance. Although several problems of the Hungarian minority in Romania were identified in this process and formulated by the Community itself – also reflected in Parliament’s resolutions and previous Commission reports – they are still left unresolved.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the situation, despite the fact that the Hungarian party is part of the ruling coalition. This is presented as a solution in itself, which is not the case, despite the nice promises made by the government. In reality, few things have changed and, in any case, far fewer things than expected within the community. No minority law has been adopted and there are no signs that this will happen in the near future. Neither the requested necessary institution-building nor developments in mother-tongue higher education have taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask you, Commissioner, to include a reference to the unresolved questions that reflect the real, present concerns of one of the largest minorities in Europe with special roots and tradition in this region. Neglecting these specific concerns, as well as the others regarding the judiciary and corruption, would bring the EU’s credibility into question, both within the acceding countries and within the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My group’s opinion has already been stated by our leader Mr Schulz. During our recent visits to Bulgaria and Romania, we had a great number of meetings – not only with government members and officials but also with opposition members, representatives of trade unions, NGOs, academics, representatives of the business community and the EU Member States’ ambassadors – and no one we spoke to came to the conclusion that there is a serious risk of either country being manifestly unprepared to meet the requirements of membership on 1 January 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">As you, Commissioner, have very correctly pointed out in numerous exchanges of views in this House and in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Bulgaria has shown continuous progress in all relevant areas, including regional cooperation, modernisation of the Bulgarian police, development of social services, reintegration of persons and minorities, labour and social policy and childcare. I could go on and on, but let me assure you that in Sofia they have got the message and all the progress that has been made so far or is currently being made has always been progress and always in the right direction. The Governments of Bulgaria and Romania know that the reforms have to be continued and more progress has to be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you said in a recent interview that Europe’s borders are defined by values rather than by the geographical guidelines. You said the values defined the borders. Well, I fully agree and I strongly believe that Bulgaria and Romania share our values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, and their place from 1 January 2007 should be inside our European Union. Their borders from 1 January 2007 should be our borders. And there the dynamic concept of the EU will move to new borders. I do not want to repeat what a previous speaker was saying, but I fully share Mrs Gál’s opinion on the minorities in Romania. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Successive governments in Romania and Bulgaria have made superhuman efforts to comply with the advice and recommendations of the European Union. Much of this effort is not easy to see by outside observers. Structural, economic and social reforms are by their very nature unglamorous and not of any interest to the media. However, in Romania, for example, both the former Nastase government and the current Tariceanu government have shown remarkable commitment to the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, as well as playing a steady hand in spite of the cut and thrust of national politics.</p>
<p class="contents">Legal reform and the fight against corruption have to be carried through very carefully in order to succeed, so they are always slow to bring results. If too many high-level politicians are sued it may begin to look like a witch-hunt. However, in Romania, Minister Monica Macovei, backed up by her Prime Minister and her President against considerable opposition within the system itself, has made dramatic steps.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, to delay accession by one year would bring no real benefit to the European Union, Romania or Bulgaria or to their electorates, as one year is not a significant timeframe in accession terms and no significant reforms at all could be expected in such a short twelve months. However, it would send a very damaging signal to these two countries, both of which have bent over backwards to accommodate the Union’s advice and requirements in a spirit of real partnership and openness. The risk would be to alienate public opinion in these countries against the Union and that would risk us being seen as vacuous and vacillators.</p>
<p class="contents">Currently both countries are strongly pro-European Union. It would be a real shame to risk the high level of trust that those nations have shown – among both the governments and the people – being lost. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Last year I visited Rafo, the third biggest oil refining company in the country, and by far the biggest firm in the poor Moldavia province. The company is trying to overcome major financial problems that have been accumulating since its privatisation in 2001. Members of its administrative board made me aware of the pressures and obstructions they get from the Romanian Government to continue with the company’s activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Although in July last year a new investor clearly expressed its willingness to clear Rafo’s nominal debt to the Romanian authorities, until now the Government has not shown any interest in this offer. Moreover, the Government’s demand for advanced VAT payments for imported raw materials – which makes Rafo the only company in Romania to have its operation conditional on paying VAT in advance – poses a serious threat to the company’s viability. This discriminatory treatment, which is against free market rules and which questions the impartiality of the Romanian Government towards the companies competing in the market, is still maintained in spite of the solvency and serious intentions of the new investors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commission and Parliament documents about the progress made by the two countries towards accession confirm that both have put a great deal of effort into preparing for membership. Despite difficulties, they have carried out, and continue to carry out, significant reforms to their political and economic systems. Recently, though, there has been increasing talk, particularly with regard to Bulgaria, of postponing accession, of vague protection clauses and of ‘other means’.</p>
<p class="contents">Bulgaria and Romania are struggling with the legacy of the Communist regime. Just like the Member States that joined the European Union in May 2004, they have a huge amount of ground to make up in all fields. This makes it all the more imperative for us to avoid delaying what both countries see as their chance for more rapid development. We should not divide Europe once again into the better-off and the worse-off. I am in favour of keeping 1 January 2007 as the date for Bulgaria and Romania to join the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would be even more glad, though, if it were even now clear that all conditions for their accession had been fulfilled and hence that conditions were ideal for these two countries to become Member States of the European Union. I can, then, do no other than urge Commissioner Rehn to do, as regards the report, what the Commission is required to do in its role as guardian of the treaties, in which capacity it has to ensure that all those things that are agreed are actually done, and to consider whether the period left, which now runs until the end of the year, is sufficient to get those things done that have not yet been. That is the Commission’s task, and, having performed it, the accession treaty requires that it draw the necessary conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last few days, I myself have had the opportunity to travel with a delegation to Romania, and I would like to say that what we were able to see and experience both in Bucharest and in other parts of the country was very impressive. I can do no other than urge all those in positions of political power – not only in Romania, but also in Bulgaria, where recent days have shown that there is some catching up to do where reform is concerned – to maintain their zeal for reform and not, once 16 May dawns, to fold their arms and say that everything has been sorted out. This is something we have to do together, and we will not be able to unless the process is continued with determination.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying one thing, namely that the reason why these reforms have to be carried out in Bulgaria and Romania is not in order that these countries might pass muster in the eyes of Commissioner Rehn or of the European Union; on the contrary, they are necessary in order that their peoples may live in countries in which they may be certain of the law’s protection, with their interests served by stable and democratic institutions. If that is understood, then we will be on the right track. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As my group chairman has already said, we assume, hope, and expect that both the countries under discussion today will be able to join on 1 January of next year. This is something we have always said, and we also believe that we should not create an atmosphere of competition between Romania and Bulgaria. That is not what this is about at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst we should discuss what is yet to be done, we must also, and above all, take stock of what has been achieved so far. Over the past few years, it has been our constant refrain that both countries still had a lot to get done; now, we can look back and say that both of them have achieved a great deal. There is also a little coda to this, on which the Commissioner will be reporting in a few weeks’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">As my colleague has already stated, we, as a group, did the same thing that Mr Ferber has apparently done and launched our own monitoring initiative. We went to Bulgaria and Romania, and noticed that much progress has been made in both countries. In all talks, we get the strong impression that both governments, including the Bulgarian Government, recognise what is yet to be done. I am convinced that the talks that are still underway about a number of problems will reach a successful conclusion. That is why I am optimistic about the outcome on 16 May.</p>
<p class="contents">We also insist that the Council, in June, should base its decision on Commission’s proposals and Parliament’s verdict. I think – as do many others – that there are a number of areas in which work will continue until the end of the year, that the pressure should be kept on in terms of the process and that we cannot indeed rule out a time when a number of safeguard clauses will need to be put in place, although I would urge both Romania and Bulgaria to do everything in their power to avoid this.</p>
<p class="contents">In the final analysis, what matters most to us in the assessment after 16 May is what the Commissioner said on 3 April, namely that we can postpone the debate only if it turns out that one of the two countries is clearly unprepared in one or more areas. I assume that this conclusion, that those words, will not be used in the Commissioner’s reports, but we will have to wait and see.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, if you will allow me to comment on the Commissioner’s opening remark, I should like to draw your attention once again to the floods, particularly in Romania, but also in Bulgaria, and appeal to the Commission to make every effort in order to help those two countries, along with Serbia, and also to examine what can be done to prevent such disasters from striking in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It may be difficult for a German social democrat to imagine, but there are such things in Europe as Liberal Prime Ministers – there are, indeed, several of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, as has already been made clear by Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck and Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, we Liberals want Bulgaria and Romania to join the European Union, and they will do that on 1 January 2007, subject to all the national parliaments ratifying the accession treaty, which is what it currently appears likely that they will do. Not everything, of course, is as yet exactly as it should be, and much remains to be done. What representatives of the Bulgarian Government have to say about the attitude of the country’s justice system to reform is contradicted by what is reported by German judges who have been there, and it is for that reason that I myself think it right that the Commission should give serious consideration to whether sensitive areas such as justice, the economy, and the internal market need to be monitored, and report back on the subject either in May or in the autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">When our counterparts in the national parliaments vote on the accession of the two candidate countries, many of them will be able to rely on the latest report from the Commission, but we voted at a time when it looked as if Bulgaria was outstripping Romania in the reform stakes. What has happened since then is evidence of the unsurprising fact that we do not possess the gift of prophecy, and so we should not act as if we did. What we must do in the case of future enlargements is to take care that we vote on them close to the date of accession rather than a year and a half beforehand, and I want to make it clear that that is our fault and not the fault of the candidates for accession.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission cannot recommend that an accession be delayed; so it says in today’s <span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, and the newspaper is right, for what would happen if its recommendation, for want of a few votes in the Council, was not complied with? There would be two countries sitting in the Council, a majority of which would previously have been against either of them being present at all. No, that is not on, and it shows that Article 39, the treaty’s deferment clause, is, in the final analysis, toothless.</p>
<p class="contents">That Bulgaria and Romania will accede is not a matter of doubt; both countries have achieved a great deal. We, too, though, have much left to do in order to improve our enlargement policy, and I would like to add that I am very glad that we are having this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe every effort should continue to be made, because any deferment, any delay, would have a serious negative impact on public opinion in the acceding state and only encourage those interests most opposed to reform.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, one area in which the Commission should maintain its vigilance, and that concerns provision of care for orphans. It is the experience of many charities working in the field that they remain hampered by the failure to enact and implement envisaged legislation which would allow the Government and the charities to enter into contractual relations, thereby permitting the charities to receive matching funds.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also the case that the charities are receiving different advice from government inspectors about the provision of services and the necessary technical standards of equipment from that which pertains in state orphanages. Would the Commissioner impress upon the Romanian Government the continuing need to improve the provision of care for orphans? Would he emphasise the need to enact the envisaged legislation, enabling charities to have proper contracts with the government and allowing them to have financial support?</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of achieving the successful future enlargement of the EU it is essential that humanitarian conditions play a central role in the continued cooperation between the Commission and the acceding states. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having visited both countries, I do think that both governments and both parliaments have made significant changes in this respect, and it is this pressure that has induced them to make them.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is simply human rather than something negative for us to give thought to in which areas we should, once the decision is taken – which, it is to be hoped, will favour 2007 – to some extent monitor and exert a certain amount of pressure. It is the NGOs in both countries that are constantly recommending that we combine a decision in favour of 2007 with – where necessary – ongoing monitoring processes. This would prevent any ‘second-class member’ situation arising, for monitoring of this sort has been done in the past; it is going on even now in some areas, and it is also necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one other consideration I would like to add; you, Commissioner, have constantly taken a more critical line on Bulgaria, and have indeed done so just now. Now it may be that the earlier negative assessment of Romania has put that country under greater pressure, but, having discussed this yesterday with the Romanian minister of justice, I would like to point out that neither the number of MPs whose parliamentary immunity is suspended nor the number of them who are charged can be taken as evidence of a country getting better or worse.</p>
<p class="contents">What I believe matters is substance, that proceedings should be embarked on where there is real reason to do so, and I do believe that Bulgaria, like Romania, is endeavouring to make charges stick and take hard-hitting action where corruption is to be found. As we have seen from various peer reviews, too, opinions can differ as to which reform is the right one. I agree with you that we have to ensure that the independence of the judiciary is guaranteed in both countries, while at the same time pressing the justice system to speed up proceedings, and I am in complete agreement with what Mr Schulz said: ‘We want it to be possible for both countries to accede in 2007, for that would be, for all of us, the greatest possible success.’ </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What is at issue, though, is the application of the Treaty and whether or not the postponement clause can be used, and hence the credibility not only of our enlargement policy but also of the European Union itself. Does the European Union meet its own requirements and conditions? You, Commissioner, stressed that justice and home affairs are at the heart of the assessment, and told the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs that there had been much progress, but that there were still serious deficiencies. You said – with specific reference to Bulgaria – that the independence of judges was not guaranteed, and that, while the first steps to combat corruption had been taken, nobody was being sentenced for it; that not enough was yet being done to combat organised crime and that trafficking in human beings was a problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to tell you, Commissioner, that, if all these problems can actually be sorted out, then I will be all in favour of both states acceding in 2007, but if the Commission’s report, presented to us as the fruit of close scrutiny, confirms the presence of deficiencies that cannot be remedied, then we should consider the possibility of allowing these countries still more time in order to enable them to actually meet the conditions for accession.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that, if there are serious deficits in justice and home affairs, and we still do not avail ourselves of the options contained in the accession treaty – by which I mean the application of the postponement clause – then I am persuaded that that gives the wrong impression of what the enlargement process is about, and both the enlargement policy and the European Union as a whole would have lost all credibility. I take it, then, that you, Commissioner, are aware of what your responsibility is when you draft the report and present the conclusions to Parliament in May. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No new claims, no extra demands, but exactly the same claims and demands as we have asked from all our Member countries, I take that for granted.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as our group chairman Mr Schulz said today, it is our common feeling that we have passed that critical mass where we can say that Romania and Bulgaria are capable now to come into the European Union. They are not perfect in all aspects. There are still problems ahead – you have mentioned some of them and we have mentioned some of them, but our common judgement is that we are on the road, the direction is there.</p>
<p class="contents">To tell you the truth, as you know Commissioner, I can still see corruption problems in some of the existing Member countries within the European Union. Even in my own country I can see some types of crime which we can see also in other existing Member countries. So please, Commissioner, do not make your judgement – and I know you will not, but I am just saying it – based on the number of cases in Bulgaria or Romania. It is about direction, reform, legislation and decisiveness to implement. I can assure you that both in Bulgaria and Romania immunity has been now moved away as an obstacle for bringing cases against Members of the Parliament or other personalities within the societies. That is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as President of the European Socialist Party, I should like to point out that I totally agree with my group colleagues Mr Schulz and Mr Swoboda. We find that it is best to take the two countries in now. Over the next few months – until November and then the European Council meeting in December – we should look into how and whether we should formulate some transitional claims at the top of membership as of 1 January.</p>

I have spoken on one specific issue at each of these debates and I do so again, and that is the case of abandoned babies and children in care in Romania.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that great progress has been made there. I have seen some progress. There are new laws in place. We need to make sure that the laws are fully implemented so that the children abandoned and in care receive the proper treatment they deserve. Unfortunately, we still have a debate about children who are apparently trapped, waiting for adoption out of Romania. I know that there is a ban in place and I would ask the Commission to give us the decisive view on this, because we have received conflicting information from both sides of this debate. I think our care for the children involved is central to it, and that must be the beginning and the end of this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">My view concerning Romania and Bulgaria – particularly Romania – is that membership of the European Union would be good for those children who find themselves abandoned or in care. Within the European Union these issues will continue to be raised and progress will be made.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that we are having this debate today if only to raise this issue again. I would ask you, Commissioner, because the Commission has observers there, to give us accurate information on what is happening in relation to the numbers of abandoned babies.

In my view there is lots of common ground for such a Commission recommendation on 16 May that complies with Parliament’s views that I have heard today. I will not be able to respond to all your questions now; I have done so on numerous occasions in the last couple of weeks and months, both orally and in written form. I am glad to continue to respond to your letters concerning Bulgaria and Romania and the progress made in these two countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just sum up the view and position of the Commission as regards the accession date and conditions regarding Bulgaria and Romania. My goal is that both countries could join in January 2007. However, my duty is to ensure that when they join, they truly meet the criteria and join as fully prepared members of the European Union. In that regard, the jury is still out, at least until 16 May.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to add that safeguard clauses and continued monitoring can address certain sectoral shortcomings if need be. We will also outline this in May and, if necessary, specify in greater detail in our October progress report. However, at the same time let me underline that the real critical task for both countries is not to lose any momentum as regards the reforms and their implementation. The essential yardstick will be the progress both countries can still make as regards the reform of the judiciary and their fight against corruption and crime.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with those who say that this is not a quantitative matter, but the critical thing is that there needs to be a critical mass moving the reforms further so that they become irreversible. For that we need to have clear proof that the structural conditions to fight corruption and organised crime are in place in both countries, because these issues underpin society and the economy in their entirety.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I can assure you that the Commission shall present a fully objective and balanced assessment on 16th May and I can assure you that we make a proposal for a carefully calibrated decision that will maintain the momentum of essential reforms and their implementation on the ground up to and beyond the accession of the two countries.</p>
<p class="contents">That is our task as the guardian of the Treaties and for this I will ask for your support on 16th May and in the coming debate following that report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to stress that the Polish Parliament voted almost unanimously in favour of accepting these countries into the EU, with only one vote against. This is because we believe that expanding the Union to include new countries will on one hand be an expression of solidarity among European countries, while on the other hand creating new opportunities and prospects for both the new countries and the whole of the Community. I would be delighted if the remaining countries were able to offer this expression of European solidarity in the same way as Poland.</p>
<p class="contents">It is to be welcomed that the Commission lays down strict requirements for candidate countries, in this way encouraging them to implement efficiently the reforms that still need to be carried out. I hope, though, that the Commission will be equally active in encouraging EU Member States to be as open as possible to Romania and Bulgaria when it comes to implementing the freedoms enshrined in the Treaties and renouncing long derogation periods with regard to the labour market, for example. If we set a high level of obligations, we must also allow new countries to benefit in full, and as soon as possible, from the rights to which they are entitled on the basis of the Treaties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
