<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jacques Barrot,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on 14 July 2004, the Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation on the implementation of the deployment and commercial operating phases of the European programme of satellite radionavigation. You are going to debate this proposal in a few moments. I would like to thank the European Parliament for having supported the Galileo programme from the very start. I would particularly like to thank Mrs Barsi-Pataky for her excellent report and for also having supported, with a great deal of intelligence, the Galileo programme.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to set up, at European level, the first worldwide satellite radionavigation system specifically for civilian purposes, a project that ties in with the European Union’s growth strategy as defined by the Lisbon European Council in 2000. It truly is the first great European industrial and space project. This is a technology that is developing and being applied at a tremendous rate. The capacity developed as part of this programme also means that the European Union will now be first in line to benefit from what is shaping up to be the great technological revolution, following the IT and telecommunications revolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The development phase of the programme is running smoothly. The first experimental satellite is expected to be launched in December 2005. This will be followed by the construction and launch of the first four satellites in the Galileo constellation. The current development phase will be followed by the deployment phase, and then by the commercial operating phase. The system will be brought into operation progressively between 2008 and 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">The institutional framework retained for the deployment and commercial operating phases differs significantly from that of the development phase. During those two phases, the construction and then the management of the system will be entrusted to a private concession holder working under the control of the Supervisory Authority, a Community agency created by the Council regulation of 12 July 2004 to act as the licensing authority. The choice of a concession contract emerged as the most appropriate way to ensure the success of the programme in the framework of a Public Private Partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal submitted to you aims to provide financing for the Community contribution to the Galileo programme during the deployment and commercial operating phases. It provides for a financial contribution from the European Community amounting to EUR 1 billion for the period of the new financial perspectives for 2007 - 2013. This amount will be transferred to the Supervisory Authority, which will make use of it in line with the provisions of the Council regulation of 12 July 2004. In addition, the proposal bases the programme on a specific legal instrument, consistent with the future European space programme and better able to respond to the need for good financial management.</p>
<p class="contents">We will need to create a specific budget heading for the deployment and commercial operating phases of the programme, for three reasons. Firstly, the programme has now reached maturity. It has taken on a dimension that goes far beyond the sectoral policies pursued by the Commission. Secondly, the scale of the activities imposes requirements of transparency and budgetary rigour, as well as scrupulous supervision. Thirdly, the institutional and budgetary frameworks must be clear and consistent from the point of view of the concession holder for the system, on whom the Community will impose comparable requirements of transparency and consistency.</p>
<p class="contents">I would stress the fact that the financing of the Galileo programme by the Community budget will be time limited. The commercial revenues generated by the operation of the system should ensure financial stability over time. I would remind you that many third countries  China, Israel, India and Ukraine  plan to participate in the programme. I would add that the Commission will ensure that the future concession contract provides for the repayment of public financial contributions if the profit earned by the concession holder exceeds a certain threshold over time.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the proposal for a regulation put before you responds to the requirements arising from proper implementation of the deployment and commercial operating phases of the programme, to the requirement for good financial management and to the need for a grand European project that has reached an advanced stage of maturity.</p>
<p class="contents">That, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, is what I wanted to say to you. I very much hope that Parliament will follow Mrs Barsi-Pataky’s lead and give us all the support that this great project needs. It will indubitably bring the European Union many technological successes, and will make it possible to create many jobs connected with its various applications. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the basis of the Galileo programme, a Community infrastructure will be created that truly deserves to be called a project ‘made in Europe’. This new global-scale infrastructure differs from its predecessors (the GPS and GLONASS systems) in that it is designed for civil and commercial (and not military) purposes, and as a result has become a joint project of all 25 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The legislation before us concerns the financing of the deployment and initial operating phase in the period 2007-2013. We could, of course, have placed this regulation on the agenda of the plenary sitting, after agreement was reached on the Financial Perspective. I will give you the following reasons as to why we did not do this. Galileo is a PPP project involving both Community and private finance, and having a concession holder. Negotiations on the concession contract have begun, and so I felt that Parliament needed to make all the decisions that it wants taken into account in the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">1. It is important that Parliament should state, in its Opinion, that it supports the inclusion of a contribution of EUR 1 billion as a specific budget line in the Financial Perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">2. The Community will not only provide financial support for the project, but will also allow the concession holder to retain the revenues from the licences and other related rights, although the Community will retain ownership of these licences and rights.</p>
<p class="contents">3. Parliament recommends integration of the EGNOS programme, which ensures compatibility with the American GPS system and is a precursor of the Galileo programme (rather like introducing marketing).</p>
<p class="contents">4. Parliament expects the concession contract to contain provisions relating to the sharing of profits or revenues (from such a time as the project begins to generate profits or revenues, of course).</p>
<p class="contents">5. Since this is a PPP project, Parliament is willing to undertake financial guarantees and to share liabilities (but of course only when it is familiar with the concession contract and able to discuss this issue).</p>
<p class="contents">6. In the interests of the programme’s success, Parliament expects the implementers of the Galileo programme to keep to the deadlines. Parliament will check and monitor this constantly, in its annual budget debates.</p>
<p class="contents">7. Parliament supports the inclusion of research on GNSS satellite navigation in the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, and at the same time recommends also including development of Galileo user applications in the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, specifically with the involvement of small and medium enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">8. Parliament explicitly welcomes the PPP form of implementation. However, given that this is the first Community PPP project, Parliament recommends that it should have observer status on the Administrative Board of the Supervisory Authority, which will be on a one-off basis and will not include implementation tasks. This recommendation was also made by the previous Parliament, but I would like to point out to my fellow Members that the European Commission does not agree with it. The report was also discussed by the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Transport and Tourism. Their opinions are an integral part of the report. I would like to point out that I will be tabling an oral amendment tomorrow on the basis of the interim agreement reached with the Committee on Budgets, and the ‘shadow rapporteurs’ are already aware of this. The amendment is technical in nature and concerns the withdrawal of the reference to 2004 as base year.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express my gratitude for this excellent opportunity for conciliation and cooperation with the European Commission. To conclude, I would like to inform Parliament that the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy discussed the report several times, and adopted it unanimously at its June sitting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I recently moved to the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and I have also served for many years on the Committee on Transport and Tourism. So this evening, although I have to apologise that Mr Lewandowski is unable to participate in the debate, I want to give this project our full backing.</p>
<p class="contents">In the early years, we had reservations. We thought that the American system did not need a European alternative. However, the British and the Conservative Party have been brought round. I pay tribute to the rapporteur and the constructive attitude of the Commissioner on this subject, which is extremely important because of the added value that Europe is bringing to it. We have managed to achieve a great deal of progress to date and we need all 25 countries to pull together to achieve success in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I also admire the way that accountability is uppermost in this proposed regulation. Parliament and the Council need to be fully convinced at all stages that the proper steps are being taken and that accountability and transparency are the order of the day.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcome the involvement of the small and medium-sized enterprises, because they see this as a huge opportunity for them to increase their knowledge of technology in commercial concerns and to back up the very large operating body that will provide overall supervision. I also agree with the method by which they were appointed; it was slightly contentious at the time, but the results have been successful.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish the project every success. I hope we will make sure that accountability is always the order of the day and that any financial guarantees that have to be given by the Council or Parliament are most carefully adhered to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also optimistic that, in taking the Galileo programme to its next two phases, this unique European plan will be able to fulfil its full operational potential.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, allow me a word of criticism. The Galileo joint undertaking, which will continue up to May 2006, made provision in its statutes for the facility for undertakings in the western sector to invest in its capital to the sum of EUR 5 million for large undertakings and EUR 250 000 for small and medium-sized undertakings.</p>
<p class="contents">This was obviously to give the original political agreement between the two administrative members, the European Community and the European Space Agency some sort of corporate form; a corporate form which, supposedly, would be able to attract private capital. Unfortunately, not one single undertaking has subscribed to the capital of Galileo. However, this was only natural and only to be expected, given that there were no incentives for any such investment.</p>
<p class="contents">It would therefore appear that we have a problem between public/private partnerships in theory and in practice. I call on Parliament to address this weakness and to control the Commission accordingly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have been familiar with this subject area for a number years and it is one I have often had to handle. Mrs Barsi-Pataky has got to grips with it with astonishing speed and her cooperation with the shadow rapporteur has been very frank and transparent. The result of that has been a very solid vote in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, with no votes against the report. What that also shows is that this House is still backing this project, albeit with misgivings here and there.</p>
<p class="contents">Buying a project, a device, or a system is one thing, but it is just as important to develop one’s own systems and perfect one’s own technology. That I see as being the most important thing about this project.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been said, the civil project in the European Union is meant to be set up as a public-private partnership, and the experts believe that it will create up to 150 000 jobs. For once, I believe them: their prognosis may well be accurate if we manage to get the project up and running relatively quickly, to find applications for it and produce this solution in Europe rather than importing it. If the forecasts are to be realistic, we simply have to succeed in this.</p>
<p class="contents">Having a third of the EUR 3.5 billion subscribed from public funds and two-thirds derived from private sources gives Europe the chance of getting this project on its feet. I am optimistic about the prospects for the capital being put up once the projects and the concession contracts are in place. What is, of course, important is that we make the public funds available, and that is where I think we may still come a cropper, for the Council has not yet been able to agree on the Financial Perspective, one of the items in which is – of course – this EUR 1 billion for this project.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already done our homework, but if the Council cannot manage to make these resources available and to secure funding by the end of the year, then it will be possible neither to get the concession contract signed nor to put any satellites into orbit. If nothing happens by December, then the frequencies are lost to us.</p>
<p class="contents">We have, I think, had more than one moment of decision with regard to Galileo in the past; it is unfortunate that it was always the Council that put the brake on developments for a while. I hope we will make it this time. My group is giving this proposal its wholehearted backing and will be voting in favour of it. I am aware of Mrs Barsi-Pataky’s oral amendments; having conducted negotiations, I think we can go along with what she proposes. I do very much hope that the Council’s mind will not be as narrow as the checks on the shirt I am wearing today, and apologise for not having had the opportunity to change. I will look more respectable tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to thank the rapporteur for her efforts, not only on my own part but also on behalf of my group. There is one point on which I would like to give her very strong backing, and that is her demand that the European Parliament, as the budgetary institution, should have a seat on<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>the Administrative Board. Our institution’s budgetary role does indeed mean that we should be fully informed about the financial aspects of the Galileo project.</p>
<p class="contents">There are very practical considerations behind this, for third countries have acquired smaller holdings – China in particular, which bought a share in our project on 30 October 2003. Having wanted to invest a total of 20 million in what is a 3.5 billion project, it gave notice of the intention to buy 5 million but paid only 2 million. This amount – 0.06%, a thousandth, of the total – puts China in full possession of the know-how that Galileo has to offer and gives it unrestricted access to it.</p>
<p class="contents">I have conducted my own inquiries in Oberpfaffenhofen and seen how our know-how and intellectual property are not secure. I ask you, Commissioner, to do everything in your power to prevent our technology from being sold off to others. While we want third countries to be involved and markets to be conquered, we must also see to it that our intellectual property is protected. Let me particularly draw your attention to an amendment – No 22 – tabled by my colleague Mrs Hall, which is aimed at ensuring that, at a later date, when commercial operations begin, the European Union gets its contribution repaid, in other words, that there is a real distribution of profits.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate is a significant one, and deserves to have more people observing it and listening to it. That is something we cannot change. I wish the rapporteur, Mrs Barsi-Pataky, every success in getting her report through. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As well as attracting a great deal of interest, the programme has therefore also provoked a variety of opinions and reactions. On the one hand, there are those who believe that the project makes Europe more competitive compared to the rest of the world, including the United States. In most other respects we are lagging behind the latter, for example in scientific and technological fields, but Galileo is superior to its American counterpart, or in other words GPS, which was originally conceived as a military system. What is more, at a time such as this, when the European Union is competing for public support against a background of debates on the fate of the Constitutional Treaty, this is an opportunity for us to develop a project that will enable the creation of thousands of new and much-needed jobs, to say nothing of its other benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, however, I entirely understand the concerns that have been voiced over the enormous financial costs of the Galileo Programme, and the risk that this money could be wasted. It is not only members of my own group that have raised such concerns, and they are entirely legitimate, given that worrying examples of money being wasted in this way can be found in the day-to-day practices of the different Member States. It stands to reason that the European Parliament must ensure that it has opportunities and instruments for monitoring, and that it must ensure that money is spent transparently and effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Questions have also been asked over whether it is appropriate to exclude the Galileo Programme from funding cuts, in view of the debates being held on across-the-board cuts to the EU budget. The Galileo Programme is currently moving out of the development and testing phase, which has been a success, and into the implementation phase. Heeding calls for savings, and imposing arbitrary cuts in order to make savings at any price, would be akin to expecting a rocket carrier that originally consisted of three stages to carry an object into space, even if you remove one of its stages. The end result will be that we are left with nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">One final comment; I am delighted that the bodies responsible for such matters in the Czech Republic share my views on the future of the Galileo project, namely that it should be seen in terms of a wide variety of possible civilian applications. I am also delighted that they are not only in favour of the system being built, but are also taking the relevant practical steps to implement it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU is removing Europeans’ national self-determination in area after area. The various debates this evening are revealing. No one in this Chamber seems to ask themselves whether what we are debating is a task for the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s political legitimacy is therefore in constant decline. This may be seen from opinion polls, but rarely in democratic elections. Established party structures do not give people the opportunity to express their opposition to the shift in power to the EU. It is therefore only in referenda that this popular opposition finds expression in the democratic process. This is something we have seen in Denmark, Ireland and Sweden and now most recently in France and the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a political mandate from my electors to resist this concentration of power in the EU, but not in <span class="italic">all </span>areas. There are cases in which I and those like me welcome common efforts at EU level. The Galileo project is one such area. We are concerned here with developing a European infrastructure in a very important area of high technology. The individual countries cannot manage this task successfully. With Galileo, we shall make Europe independent of an American system that, in times of unrest, may be interfered with and unilaterally closed down by the United States for military reasons. I therefore welcome the Galileo project and recommend that the Chamber support the proposal to implement its deployment and operating phases. For once, the EU is on the right track. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Via the Galileo programme, and in line with the Lisbon strategy, Europe is in the process of creating the first satellite positioning infrastructure on a global scale. This will bring us economic and strategic autonomy with respect to the US-owned GPS. This autonomy, however, seems to be incomplete, as it reveals a flaw in terms of political autonomy. Indeed, even though the intention is to secure personal data and to make the provision of information more reliable, this project, although it respects national sovereignty and strictly follows the subsidiarity principle, is purely for civilian purposes. It therefore leaves Europe dependent on the US military system for defence applications, and there is no real guarantee that the service will continue in the case of crises similar to the Gulf War, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the risks involved in the transfer of technology via extra-European international cooperation do not seem to have been taken into account. Indeed, in the case of China, a financial partner in the Galileo programme, we cannot ignore the political origin and the potentially dangerous military interests, a field in which space technology can also be used by missiles. The same is true of commercial practices that may be reprehensible or else incompatible with European interests.</p>
<p class="contents">In the circumstances, we call on the Commission to present a proposal that aims to safeguard the independence and room for manoeuvre of this programme in order to make Europe truly independent and to limit, or even to avoid completely, the risks of technology transfer in cases regarded as potentially dangerous. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When we consider how long it took the Council of Ministers to reach a decision <span class="bold">–</span> almost a decade <span class="bold">–</span> the European Parliament can be proud of having recognised the true importance of the Galileo project.</p>
<p class="contents">European cooperation with regard to satellite radionavigation is an innovative project for the future in view of its public-private partnership, which should be able to create, we are told, 150 000 new jobs in the field of new technologies. This is a project for the future that will be able to prove that the countries of Europe are capable of stimulating the growth of new industries, of creating employment and of improving their citizens’ quality of life.</p>
<p class="contents">The management methods of this project raise an important question and we would like Parliament to be informed of the initial results and of the operating methods in this matter. Commissioner, not everyone is certain that the management method chosen is the most appropriate one. With regard to the heel-dragging demonstrated by the Council of Transport Ministers, I would suggest that the Commission should now initiate projects to benefit from satellite navigation by drawing up alternative itineraries to sensitive points on our motorways, in order to improve the mobility of citizens and to make the most of this new facility as soon as it is available to us.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of this project for terrestrial research and observation must encourage us to fully exploit it and to encourage space research projects, whether as part of the seventh framework programme or at the EASA. To this end, an observer’s position for Parliament on the Administrative Board would enable us to be better informed and to coordinate activities in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, one last question, Commissioner: do we have the human resources needed to implement this project? Are we sure that the 150 000 jobs will be filled by qualified persons; and what will our future needs be? How should young people prepare themselves so that they can have access to these jobs? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is to be hoped that this useful invention will be used to enhance our well-being rather than to wage war. Were such a system not yet in existence, it would have been a good idea to examine at European level whether something like this were technically feasible and could be put into production. There would then be a good reason for not farming this project out to accidental inventors and to entrepreneurs who hope to cash in on it, but instead making a joint effort and using Community funds in the process. It is now too late in the day for this. Europe can no longer be the first one. Such a system, originating from outside the EU, is already in operation and has conquered the European market. The Galileo plans add not much more than a competitive battle involving existing systems. Community funds are now mainly used to subsidise enterprises in the electronics and aviation industries. This will cost the European Union and its Member States increasingly more money to the detriment of more useful tasks. That is why there are those in my group who have never supported this project. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I consider a package of EUR 1 billion for 2007-2013 to be justified for three main reasons. Firstly, the nature of what is at stake: this programme involves nothing less than ensuring Europe’s independence in space, while at the same time offering a host of new services to professionals and to private individuals. Secondly, with Galileo, the EU is fully committed to financing investments in the future. Thirdly, this sustained budgetary commitment is justified by the expected return on the investment: according to various estimates, Galileo should be exceptionally profitable, with an expected cost-benefit ratio of 4.6.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, the EU must make an ambitious commitment to this programme, and I hope that the Council and particularly the UK Presidency, which talked a great deal a few months ago about the benefits of future spending, will go down this path. As it is very late, I will not tell you about all the assets, which are real and important, that the town of Toulouse can bring as the headquarters of the Galileo concession. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to thank Parliament for the support it is giving to this great programme. It is true that the financial perspectives will have to be discussed but, in any event, I think that we must give priority to the billion intended for the Galileo programme. The Galileo programme, as Mrs De Veyrac has just said, confirms the European Union’s true independence, and will make possible a number of applications. Clearly, these applications must be within the reach of as many people as possible and will provide our small and medium-sized enterprises with many new opportunities. There is no doubt that we need to focus on providing the human resources to make full use of the new opportunities provided by this programme. I can well understand that Parliament particularly wishes to be involved in this programme.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to thank Mrs Barsi-Pataky for her report to which you have responded. It is a comprehensive and high-quality report. I would also like to thank your Committee on Transport and Tourism and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for their support for the European Commission’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, I support Parliament’s concern to feel fully responsible for the implementation of this project, which will be developed within the framework of a public-private partnership in which businesses will have a full part to play. It has just been said that there were no private businesses involved in the development phase. This is true in the development phase, but during the deployment and commercial operating phases it will be European businesses that, in the context of synergies, will carry this project; and that is the interesting aspect of all this. The Supervisory Authority will, of course, ensure that the objectives pursued by the European Union are achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Barsi-Pataky’s report goes in the direction wanted by the Commission, which can accept all the amendments proposed by the rapporteur, with the exception of Amendments 13 and 25. I am not going to respond to all the points raised. Most of the amendments significantly improve the text and make a positive contribution to the programme. Amendments 9, 10, 20 and 21 specify that the budgetary authority will be asked to give its approval in cases where financial guarantees or commitments arising from the programme exceed the budgetary allocation provided. I give my approval. I would also remind you that the Commission has promised that the future concession contract will provide for repayment of public financial contributions if the profit earned by the concession holder passes a certain threshold. It therefore accepts Amendments 11 and 22, which provide for a profit-sharing mechanism, while specifying that the Community contribution will not automatically be repayed in full, but that repayment will depend on the profit earned by the concession holder.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the EUR 1 billion, I would stress that it is the result of a precise assessment of the costs of the programme and of the desire to get strong financial involvement from the private sector. However, the Commission accepts the indicative inclusion of that figure at this stage by means of Amendment 19, while the discussions on the new financial perspectives are underway.</p>
<p class="contents">In contrast, the Commission cannot accept Amendments 13 and 25, giving Parliament observer status on the Administrative Board of the Supervisory Authority. It would appear difficult for Parliament, which is the main budgetary control body for the Community as a whole, to both exercise this control and sit, even simply as an observer, on the administrative board of a body over which it has control. I would add that there is currently no precedent for this in the other Community agencies. The experts appointed by Parliament within some of these agencies are simply <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> experts appointed for their qualifications and do not represent Parliament as an institution. I think that Parliament must retain its power of control and must in no way be linked by its presence, even as an observer, on the administrative board. I can assure you that the Commission is keen to provide the European Parliament with all the necessary information, including, as some have mentioned, with regard to the protection of our patents and of the most sensitive technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I hope that we will clearly confine ourselves to our mutual responsibilities and that Parliament will fully assume its responsibility for control. I think that, for this reason, it is preferable not to retain Amendments 13 and 25, the spirit of which I well understand but which do not seem to follow the spirit of our institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I am delighted at Parliament’s work. I am convinced that the final point, based on a general interinstitutional approach, will in no way diminish the importance of Parliament’s role and will not hinder the rapid and positive progress of the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for originating this great project that, we hope, will give the young generation a very positive and dynamic image of Europe. I thank you and I hope that Parliament will support this great project by a large majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is vital for:</p>
<p class="contents">- technological reasons: this is an innovative project and is an improvement on the guarantee of services provided by the US-owned GPS.</p>
<p class="contents">- economic reasons: the sector needs to retain an appropriate level of activity. There will be a large number of direct or related jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">- strategic reasons: Galileo improves the autonomy of our defence systems.</p>
<p class="contents">- political reasons, because the project keeps the EU to its purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has limited itself to creating the conditions for the emergence of the necessary new activities. The amendment requiring the concession holder to repay the investment illustrates this spirit.</p>
<p class="contents">The autonomy of nations is strengthened. The PRS goes in this direction and enables each country to gain access to a technology that would be unattainable for them on their own.</p>
<p class="contents">This cooperation also includes countries outside the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, this project shows that true cooperation does not need a Constitution. This is a good project; let us hope that it will soon find its place in the budgetary plan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
