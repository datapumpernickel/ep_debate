It certainly is not the best time to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I should first like to say that the Commission’s communication describes the current state of the marine environment. It refers to the pressures and threats the latter is under. In particular, it highlights the dangers posed by industry, fishing, agriculture, transport, the exploitation of gas and oil fields and the accidental introduction of species. All these activities can have very serious consequences. I would remind you of the recent <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster and the <span class="italic">Erika</span> accident three years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, this communication recognises the lack of an integrated policy for the protection of the marine environment at Union level. The Commission sets out 14 objectives and 23 actions. In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy we endeavoured to define these objectives more clearly and to broaden the scope of certain actions. In general, we tried to work towards a strategy for the protection of the marine environment consistent with European legislation and with the present condition of European waters.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication reiterates that the two key references are the Sixth Community Environmental Action Programme and the Johannesburg Summit. Section 10 of the Johannesburg action plan emphasises the importance of sustainable development. It states that oceans, seas, islands and coasts are key components of our planet’s ecosystems and essential to food safety. The loss of biodiversity as a result of accidents and the social and economic consequences of this loss have yet to be quantified.</p>
<p class="contents">The Sixth Programme contains an important chapter calling for the protection of the marine environment to be strengthened. It also calls for environmental issues to be integrated into all other policies, and for commitment to a clear plan of action to curb the negative impact on biodiversity. It also appeals for more sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources. In addition, it recalls the Montreal Declaration on the Protection of the Marine Environment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to describe the relationship between the strategy for protection of the marine environment and all other policies. These include policies relating to fisheries, agriculture, transport and chemicals. To this end, environmental impact assessment and strategic environmental assessment should be used when developing activities, plans and programmes, as they are much more appropriate instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">Objective 9 concerning transport and maritime security is of particular importance at the moment. The Committee on the Environment was of the opinion that it should be strengthened. This despite the fact that in the wake of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> accident, and particularly after the more recent disaster involving the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, two reports on the subject were adopted in the last plenary. A further two reports were adopted in the Committee on the Environment this week. Nonetheless, further directives and communications are still being debated. There is a very important report on the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and this chapter needs strengthening.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in European seas is not good, even though it has emerged from monitoring and assessment programmes that information on the marine environment is insufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, we are recalling that the principles that should inform this new marine strategy must include the precautionary principle, the ‘polluter pays’ principle, a clear concept of sustainability, an integrated approach to management of both the coastal and offshore marine environments, strategic environmental assessment and a regional approach taking account of regional diversities. In addition, account should be taken of all the relevant existing international initiatives such as OSPAR, HELCOM and ICES. They must not be seen as substitutes, however. We also believe that the notions of sustainable fishing, the interaction between fishing and sea birds, the balance between fish stocks, fishing effort and the environment are crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we realise this is only a first step. We await a Commission proposal on an effective strategy for protection of the marine environment. Nonetheless, I would like to thank all members of the Committee on the Environment personally for their effective input. It is thanks to them that the quality of this document is as good as it could possibly be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr President, I should like to thank the European Parliament and, of course, in particular, the rapporteur, Mrs González Álvarez for the work that has gone into this report and the motion for a resolution. I welcome the overall positive tone and the fact that the report broadly endorses the approach and objectives set out by the Commission in this communication. I am particularly pleased that Parliament explicitly recognises the need for an integrated approach, a robust environmental assessment and the application of a regional approach, underlined now when the marine strategy is being implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that, without a regional approach with full stakeholder input, we will not be in a position to deliver on the commitment we entered into in Johannesburg in this regard. The Commission will therefore continue to work closely with Member States, the marine conventions and the Arctic Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we can have common principles and objectives, we must recognise that the situations differ between the European seas from the Baltic to the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. I would also like to stress that the Commission intends to develop the so-called ecosystem approach to human activities and this will definitely be one of the main pillars in the strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I would like to underline that I consider Parliament's resolution to be a positive signal overall, and that the Commission will closely consider your suggestions. It will help us to move forward on a solid basis to the next phase in the development of a marine strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The main environmental damage is caused by overfishing of depleted stocks of commercially valuable fish, not to mention damage to non-targeted species including fish and damage to the marine habitat such as coral beds.</p>
<p class="contents">When you actually look at the Commission's approach to the whole issue of fisheries over the last few years, you will see that the Commission in fact used to be the most progressive of the EU institutions, pushing very hard for conservation and reasonable management of fish stocks with, of course, the obvious exception of third-country agreements. But over the last year there have been a number of developments which actually cause me and many others to doubt the commitment of the Commission. Take, for example, the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy: despite all the fine words and the good proposals put forward by the Commission, it is clear, when you actually look at what has come out, that this is really a shadow of what was proposed. While there are some good possibilities in there, most of it basically requires an effort of political will on the part of Member States. One just has to look, for example, at the negotiations over cod and other TACs during the December meeting to see that there is no political will there.</p>
<p class="contents">It is interesting that the Swedish Commissioner is here. Take the recent decision by Sweden, seeking to bring in more conservation measures in relation to cod: they were prevented from doing that. This sends out a very bad signal. If a Member State is willing and progressive enough to take more stringent measures then surely it should be allowed to do that. It is a regrettable decision and it is also unjustifiable. Consider, too, a Member State's commitment in relation to the basic regulation which was reviewed last December: again, they took out the opportunity which was used by the Spanish in the past to ban driftnets. This possibility was removed and I cannot understand why.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also look at the issue of, for example, blue whiting. Over the past number of years the European Union has been doing the right thing by trying to convince other countries to be reasonable in relation to the kind of quotas they set for themselves. But if you look at what the Commission is actually doing now, it seems that it is changing its approach to this. It seems that it has basically decided to participate in the overfishing. It has indicated that it is going to abandon the idea of restraining other fishing countries and is going to dramatically increase the Union's own fishing activities. That contributes to the depletion of stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a major contradiction in what the Commission is doing and I wish the Commission would revert to its previous approach of being extremely progressive on the conservation of fisheries. It should try to pull the Member States along, because the Member States are being dictated to by the industry. We are going to end up with a serious problem in relation to the marine environment. It is already there and we need to be a lot more progressive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Keyser (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster cast a harsh light on marine pollution. It was a dramatic event that figured prominently in the media, and it highlighted institutional and political malfunctions. But it was in fact only the tip of the iceberg. Marine ecosystems are threatened by many other polluters besides single hull ships, and their biodiversity, be it marine flora or marine fauna, is at risk. There are many predators. First, overfishing and illegal fishing, which exhaust fish stocks, but also discharges from land, fertilizer and agricultural pesticide residues, clandestine degassing of ships, products from oil platforms, all of them human activities that have taken nothing into account apart from immediate gain, which have no prospects for sustainable development and have no concern for the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is to the Commission’s credit that it has drawn up an inventory of these risks, recorded the state of knowledge about them and reviewed the conventions and various laws that might control those risks at different levels: international, European, national or regional. On the basis of that inventory, the Commission has built a very goal-oriented strategy for protecting marine resources, with clear objectives and an action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs González Álvarez’s excellent report welcomes this effort, but it also suggests, first of all, that the Commission should go beyond analysis and be tougher and more precise about the action to be taken and, in particular, the time scale for that action. Especially when there are still gaps in our knowledge of a particular field, the precautionary principle must be followed for rapid intervention, to which we should add the polluter-pays principle and that of sustainable development. In this context, there is a need for a radical change to the legislation governing international shipping and a review of the old conventions that do not include these principles. The report’s second suggestion to the Commission is that it should expand its communication by stressing various aspects that were perhaps not sufficiently developed. Examples include areas of particular vulnerability (the Baltic, Mediterranean and Black Seas have been listed), dangerous substances that have not yet been mentioned (such as the various nitrogenous substances, hydrocarbons and discharges from land), activities that have remained in the background, such as flags of convenience, or species that are more particularly endangered, such as posidonia.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy received both the Commission communication and Mrs Álvarez’s report very warmly indeed. Fundamental opposition from Parliament will certainly not emerge tomorrow. But while we can hope that the Commission will be firm and vigilant in the matter, we may be forgiven for having more fears about the Council, where there will have to be a real political will to implement this integrated strategy for the protection of marine resources. The past has shown that internal resistance, sometimes linked to national interests, can hinder the best thought-out European strategic policies. Hence the González Álvarez report’s justified insistence that concrete steps be taken right away as part of an integrated strategy at all levels of power, but also at all geographical levels, including local authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Thors (ELDR).</span></span>   <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, the European Convention proposes that the conservation of the sea’s biological resources must be the exclusive competence of the EU, while fishing should be an area in which the EU and the Member States have shared competence. This issue has been sidelined in the major debate about the future. Anyone familiar with issues relating to fisheries will find it very hard to understand that the Convention has proposed separating these areas. Rules concerning the way in which fishing is conducted are the very rules through which we enact decisions concerning the conservation of biological resources. Through provisions concerning mesh sizes, fishing periods and permitted gear, fishing can be regulated and the marine environment conserved. What, moreover, is really important for the marine environment is that aid to the floating fish factories should cease.</p>
<p class="contents">For myself and many others, it is unclear how the Convention’s proposal would work in practice. What, for example, would it mean for seals and for the fishing industry? Where these matters are concerned, I hope that, for example, the Commissioner would explain to those who fish in the Kvarken straits, the Gulf of Finland and the archipelagoes what the outcome of this decision would be. I appeal to the Commission to clarify its positions on these issues too.</p>
<p class="contents">If EU measures in favour of the marine environment are to produce results, there must be closer compliance with the rules, fewer exceptions and more effective international cooperation. We are successful internationally when we cooperate on matters such as the Oil Fund, to quote just one example. It also means, however, that the Member States must be prepared to take a stand on important proposals, such as the most recent one to impose penalties in connection with deliberate discharges of oil. Unfortunately, we see, however, the way in which legal hair-splitting constitutes an obstacle to the directive in the Council. Despite the fact that a Directive on oil reception facilities has been adopted, there has been no reduction in deliberate oil discharges.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I would finally appeal to you to get a firm grip on HELCOM – the Helsinki Commission for Baltic Marine Environment Protection. It must not be a relic from the Cold War, merely issuing recommendations that do not lead to any measures being taken. Following the EU’s enlargement, it will be possible for HELCOM to be a body attending to its task in accordance with the Water Framework Directive. If it is to be reformed, HELCOM needs the support of the Commission, especially when, for the first time in history, the new boss, who takes office on 1 August, is a woman. This organisation can implement the regional way of tackling things that both Parliament and the Commission wish to see.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also ask Commissioner Wallström to convince her colleague, Mrs de Palacio, that the Commission must be more active in supporting Finland and Sweden when it comes to ice classification. Unfortunately, it was only Italy and the Commission that opposed the Nordic proposals concerning clearer shipping rules in this part of the EU too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why, moreover, it is hard to organise any sort of viable programme of protection. Stocks of some monitored, familiar species, that is to say mainly economically important species, have in many places diminished drastically. How can we protect species, therefore, about which we still do not even know anything? Protection is nevertheless the starting point for the EU marine strategy. Consequently, I too have proposed that we should grant sufficient appropriations to enable us to carry out an investigation and draw up an inventory of submarine species.</p>
<p class="contents">The Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission, HELCOM, has made more than 200 recommendations for improving the state of the Baltic. These are not binding on the Member States but the Commission might examine them and propose rules based on them that are. In the same way, EU investment is needed for the protection of nature in the northern seas. This would come about most effectively if the EU joined the Nordic countries, the United States of America, Canada and Russia as members of the Arctic Council. That would promote shared Euro-Atlantic understanding of environmental problems.</p>
<p class="contents">There are environments in the European Union, such as many areas of the Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, where the natural environment would not necessarily recover properly from a large-scale oil disaster. That is why we must have more talks with countries such as Russia to develop stricter common standards for merchant vessels. It is vital that oil tankers sailing in the sort of difficult icy conditions there were last winter are immune to risk.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should propose an amendment, within the framework of UNCLOS, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which would allow intervention with regard to merchant vessels from third countries sailing through or close to EU waters if they are thought to be a potentially serious threat. In addition to oil disasters we should also consider, for example, the loud noise made by equipment used in mapping the location of natural resources to be a pollutant.</p>
<p class="contents">I would furthermore like to draw the attention of the Commission, and the Council too for that matter, to the Member States’ unsatisfactory capacity for tackling oil spills. I myself looked into the situation recently when I sent out questionnaires to those authorities in the Baltic countries responsible for this matter. The replies made disappointing reading. The situation was best in Finland and Sweden, where the equipment they have would be sufficient in practice for clearing the oil coming from a broken fuel tank on a large passenger ship. If there were a major disaster the equipment in these countries would be insufficient even if it were used in combination. Around 40 million tonnes of oil a year already pass through the Gulf of Finland, for example, and it is supposed that this volume will have doubled in 10 year’s time. The Commission should initiate a survey of capacity for tackling oil spills and adopt rules for sufficient minimum capacity based on regional conditions and volumes of traffic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr President, thank you for this valuable input towards developing a marine strategy and special thanks to Mrs Thors because she provided me with an action plan supplementing my own Commission action plan which I also find very interesting.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the deliberations of the Convention, I cannot really know the answer as to why this became the end result of trying to establish a list of competences because, as you rightly say, this looks very curious and very strange to most people. Maybe, however, there is a deeper legal meaning to it and maybe it will prove to be helpful. However, I cannot give you a clear reply to that.</p>
<p class="contents">You have made a number of important points which we have to follow up and you have also demonstrated the whole width of this issue. It encompasses, of course, many different aspects of the marine environment and this is what we must now continue to work on very practically. I have taken note of everything you have said. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
