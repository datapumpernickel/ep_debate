<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Haarder,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, I should like firstly to congratulate Parliament on the ‘catch the eye’ form of debate we have just tested in practice. For a former parliamentarian, all these debates with planned speaking times have been a misery. Relief was at hand, however, and the delightful experience of real debates with spontaneous contributions in which people respond to each other instead of reading from pre-prepared scripts.</p>
<p class="contents">Where Afghanistan is concerned, I should like firstly to draw attention to the fact that, a year ago, Afghanistan was a country in ruins, which initially suffered under an occupying power and a succession of warlords and then under an extreme Islamic revolution which forced through the de-modernisation of society and introduced mediaeval methods. Finally, the country became the domicile of fundamentalist terrorists.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what makes it that much more significant and that much more of a pleasure to be able now – nine months after the Bonn process was set in motion – to report on a country in which the situation is gradually being normalised. There is nonetheless a long way to go before there can again be talk of a stable Afghanistan. There continues to be inadequate security in the country. In July, Vice-President Haji Qadir was killed openly in the street. Conflicts between local warlords continue, and serious infringements of human rights continue to take place.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusion of the Bonn Agreement of December 2001 between Afghan groups under UN leadership marked the start of the positive development we are now seeing in Afghanistan. The Bonn Agreement lays down a process for the re-introduction of democracy. As a first step, an interim government was established which governed the country for six months until a hastily convened council of elders, Loya Jirga, met in June and appointed a transitional government headed by Mr Karzai who is to lead the country for two years until elections are held.</p>
<p class="contents">The convening of this Loya Jirga and the formation of the transitional government were essential steps forward. The Loya Jirga process and the regional and district elections showed that Afghans throughout the country have the desire and the courage to participate in the process of democratisation. Afghan women played a striking role.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been attempts to mediate in the conflicts in Afghanistan. If the Bonn process seems to be a success, this is particularly due to the fact that it is founded on traditional structures in the country, based upon the need to secure a broad representation of the various ethnic and religious groups. It is precisely the securing of representativeness and the protection of minorities that are the keys to long-term stability in the country. Afghan ownership is another code word. Even though the UN has operated as an essential catalyst in the process that is now developing, it has played its role with full respect and support for Afghan ownership of the process.</p>
<p class="contents">The re-establishment of an Afghan state that can secure unity, peace and stability in the country and guarantee the observance of human rights is absolutely crucial. Progress is slow and the transitional government still has difficulty controlling large parts of the country where, as a result, local warlords and bands of robbers have an easy time of it. Central to the efforts to promote security is the establishment of an Afghan army and police force in which the population has confidence and which operates with respect for human rights. In that connection, the EU has expressed great satisfaction with the setting up of Afghanistan’s National Defence Council. Just as important a factor is the state’s ability to deliver development, including access to health services. A large number of Afghan refugees have returned, and those who have done so need international aid to secure their permanent reintegration.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of the return of refugees, I am delighted to note that, according to the UNHCR, the situation in Afghanistan has now improved in such a way that the great majority of Afghans are able to return voluntarily without risking persecution.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the UNHCR that their return should be supported by relevant relief measures put in place by the international community and that individual Afghans should be offered ‘realistic repatriation packages’.</p>
<p class="contents">Seville gave high priority to adopting measures to promote an accelerated return to Afghanistan. In cooperation with the Commission and the Member States, the Danish Presidency will make efforts to comply with the Seville Declaration. I myself also had a meeting with Ruud Lubbers a short time beforehand.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still forces that are seeking to knock developments in Afghanistan off course. There are still various ethnic groups that, with the support of groups in neighbouring countries, do not believe that their own particular viewpoints are adequately represented. There are various warlords who, for long periods, have become accustomed to a high degree of self-determination in those areas they control and who have resisted the establishment of a central government. There are also different points of view as to how quickly and how far Afghanistan can move in the direction of a modern Islamic state with close contacts with the West.</p>
<p class="contents">The hope is that, by setting up a democratic process, opportunities will be created for solving these conflicts through political negotiations rather than through a return to the pointless fighting of the past.</p>
<p class="contents">The relatively encouraging development is also due to the fact that the international community has committed itself to Afghanistan. The United States played a decisive role in the rapid removal of the Taliban government through Operation Enduring Freedom. The American-led forces are still present in the country, combating the last remaining pockets of al-Qa’ida fighters. In and around Kabul, the International Security Assistance Force, ISAF, is helping to ensure stability so that the interim government is able to operate.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU also attaches importance to helping promote stability in Afghanistan and in the region. The country must not again become a seedbed of terrorism and of drugs production. We wish to support the Afghan people in their efforts to secure peaceful development.</p>
<p class="contents">Together, the EU Member States contribute the larger part of the ISAF force and are the largest international providers of aid. The Commission’s and the Member States’ combined promise of aid amounts in 2002 to more than EUR 550 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently – or, more specifically, on 22 July – the General Affairs and External Relations Council adopted conclusions concerning the situation in Afghanistan. It was stated that, in dialogue with the transitional government, the EU would proceed on the basis of the key principles agreed by the Afghan parties and the international community. The principles are stated in the Bonn Agreement, the final declaration from the Tokyo Summit in January and UN Security Council resolution 1419. The principles include the formation of a broadly constituted, multi-ethnic and representative government, in which women too participate.</p>
<p class="contents">Through its special representative, Mr Vendrell, the EU is maintaining a close political dialogue with the government in Kabul and other Afghan parties. The purpose is to help developments proceed in the right direction. Dialogues are also being conducted with the countries neighbouring Afghanistan in order to ensure their cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">International commitment to Afghanistan will in the last analysis depend upon whether the Afghan parties really make efforts to achieve the stated objectives. The EU will therefore attempt to promote a process in which, in partnership with the international community, Afghanistan’s transitional government develops verifiable criteria and monitoring systems in connection with the considerable aid that is being given.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU will promote the allocation of aid in a way that strengthens the central government and weakens those who are not involved in, or who are directly opposed to, the Bonn process. At the same time, it will be ensured that the population as a whole shares in the aid as a visible peace dividend. The financial situation in Afghanistan is characterised by a serious budget deficit, and the government will soon be in no position to pay out wages. Direct budgetary aid will therefore also be necessary to ensure political stability in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community and the EU can therefore strengthen the peace process. Whether those steps in the right direction we are now witnessing in Afghanistan can be translated into genuine and sustained improvements of the situation will, when all is said and done, depend upon the Afghan people’s own desire to support the process that has been set in motion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was certainly intending to say something myself, which I do not imagine will be very different from the presidency's remarks. Indeed it would be a cause of considerable diplomatic anxiety were we to be saying anything very different on this subject. I am sure we will not.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Parliament for this timely opportunity to review the situation in Afghanistan. It is almost a year ago that the events of 11 September catapulted a country which the European Commission’s humanitarian office had labelled a 'forgotten crisis' at the beginning of that year, into the limelight of world attention.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then we have witnessed remarkable changes for the better: the Taliban regime imploded more rapidly than some expected, leading to the installation of an interim authority which soon established its credentials around the world and – even more importantly – managed to develop a balanced relationship with its neighbours. In June this year, an Emergency Loya Jirga brought to power a Transitional Authority which has more democratic legitimacy than any of the previous regimes over the last two decades. By and large therefore, the Bonn process is on track.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is still a pretty bumpy road ahead. As Afghanistan moves into the post-Loya Jirga phase, a number of key challenges need to be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">The most imminent is internal security – or rather, to be more accurate, the lack of it. So far, President Karzai has found it extremely difficult to extend the authority of the central government to the regions, despite his own formidable efforts. This challenge is linked to the difficulty of turning warlords into politicians. Some of them continue to thrive on drugs and other illicit trade; some profit from their involvement in the Operation Enduring Freedom; others are attempting to openly challenge the leadership of President Karzai.</p>
<p class="contents">In this fluid environment, concerted long-term international support for the central government is more crucial than ever. This brings me to my second point.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless President Karzai manages to show that the trust he generates among the international community in its turn generates tangible economic benefits and improved security, he will not find it easy to convince his rivals that he is the best man to lead the country through this difficult transitional period. As the going gets tougher, he needs even more of our support. The Commission is therefore pursuing – along with other donors – a two-pronged strategy: delivering a tangible peace dividend to the population as swiftly as possible, while ensuring that most of this assistance flows through the central government.</p>
<p class="contents">In turn – and this is my third point – we insist absolutely on the conditionality of our assistance. In a nutshell, this means strict adherence to the letter and spirit of the Bonn process as well as to sound macroeconomic and financial management.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn briefly to the Bonn Agreement. The appointment of the Constitutional Commission is due very shortly. This Commission’s work paves the way for the general elections due by mid-2004. It will have to make difficult decisions on the future centre-provincial structure, the question of secular versus Islamic society, gender issues and the role of minorities, to name but a few thorny questions. This Commission, together with the Judicial Commission, will also have an impact on the dealings with war criminals, both past and present. It will take time to find lasting solutions to many of these issues. The important thing, however, is that we see this country progressing, with our assistance, towards peace and long-term stability.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue which was raised earlier about human rights atrocities is of very considerable concern to the international community. Among other fora, it was discussed by the Security Council in a meeting on 28 August. The UN, I am pleased to say, is prepared to assist the government in a future investigation. At the moment it is important to keep the grave site protected and to protect potential witnesses before an active investigation can be carried out. In my judgement, the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan – UNAMA – is best placed to handle this delicate issue, supporting the key role of the Afghan Human Rights Commission in taking future steps. We totally accept that it will be necessary to take future steps and to be as transparent about the process as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The need for steady, long-term progress must not distract us from the huge and immediate humanitarian challenge. Since March this year, 1.5 million Afghans have returned from Pakistan to Afghanistan under the UN repatriation programme. A further 116 000 have returned from Iran. This is an impressive number but it is creating a large problem for the aid agencies. The same is true of the large number of internally displaced people. The international community is now faced with additional demands, both on the humanitarian and on the security front. These bills come on top of the EUR 1.8 billion pledged for 2002 in Tokyo in January. In such an environment, it is important to get priorities right, since it is unrealistic to assume that all the additional funding requests are going to be met at once.</p>
<p class="contents">One such issue is the funding for the increased rate of return of refugees where some international agencies have claimed Europe has not been generous enough. I can speak for the European Commission. We have more than doubled the humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan this year – from EUR 25 million initially earmarked at the beginning of the year to EUR 60 million at present. However, I believe it is a mistake to look at this issue solely in quantitative terms. The foremost challenge is – and this has been our line from the start – to ensure that this summer’s returnees do not become again this winter’s refugees. Our interventions are therefore carefully linked to the overall sustainability of the return programme. For our rural recovery programme, the migratory flows are one important criterion for the selection of areas of intervention. Another important selection criterion is dependence on poppy production. Together with a few other donors, the Commission is leading the debate on how best to develop alternative livelihoods.</p>
<p class="contents">All these issues throw up one unavoidable conclusion: Afghanistan needs partners who are prepared to be there for the long haul.</p>
<p class="contents">This, however, is not to say that we cannot point to early achievements in our aid effort. Let me give you a few examples.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the Aid to Uprooted People’s programme, the Commission is funding the operation of 450 primary schools around the country in Afghanistan. We are now supporting over 200 clinics, three district- and three provincial-level hospitals. Our rural recovery and urban rehabilitation programmes are providing over 3 million person-days of work this year alone. Under a contract with Habitat, we are cleaning up five cities around Afghanistan, preventing diseases like cholera. We are co-financing a massive mine-clearance operation. We are contributing more than any other donor to the operating costs of the government (EUR 50 million from the Asia and Latin America budget and EUR 2.5 million from the Rapid Reaction Mechanism). While less visible, these sums finance the salaries of essential government servants, including nurses, doctors, policemen, teachers and civil servants.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding performance, I am pleased to say that Afghanistan proves that the reform of the management of external assistance produces results even under the most difficult of circumstances. Of the EUR 120 million available so far for recovery and reconstruction, EUR 100 million has already been contracted. This figure does not include the EUR 45 million in humanitarian aid under the ECHO programme, which has already been committed, or the further EUR 15 million due to be committed under the same programme before the end of the year. I understand that Parliament will vote on a draft supplementary amending budget for the remaining EUR 70 million pledged for 2002 in October. It is intended for further support to the public administration, for much needed infrastructure projects and for a primary health care package. Preparations for implementation of this programme are well advanced. I can assure Parliament that these funds will be put to immediate use once approved.</p>
<p class="contents">So we will have committed in Afghanistan this year – committed and largely spent – almost EUR 250 million – a good step forward in discharging our pledge to spend EUR 1 billion over 5 years.</p>
<p class="contents">That, the House will recall, has been achieved almost from a standing start. It was, of course, only possible because of the understanding of the budgetary authority – Parliament and the Member States. But it has also been achieved because of the outstanding work done on the ground by our delegation and our ECHO staff. I cannot speak too highly of their cheerful dedication and professionalism in very tough circumstances. I much enjoyed meeting them during my visit in May and look forward to making a return trip. We in the Commission have good reason to be proud of those, like our team in Kabul, who do such a first-class job. They will, I know, work as well with our new, experienced EU representative Ambassador Vendrell as they did with his committed predecessor Ambassador Klaiber.</p>
<p class="contents">I am determined to ensure that the European Commission remains fully engaged in Afghanistan even if world attention shifts to other places of conflict and post-conflict rehabilitation. Let me again thank the European Parliament for its very constructive attitude in dealing with additional budgetary needs to underwrite this commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that as the months and years pass, Members of this Parliament will be able to go to Afghanistan – as they have been going to the Balkans in the last few years – and see European assistance being provided generously, efficiently and wisely, as it should be everywhere.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Morillon (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mr Haarder, Commissioner Patten, thank you for giving us the opportunity to review the situation of this ruined country – as Mr Haarder described it last year – of this forgotten country, as the Commissioner so accurately described it.</p>
<p class="contents">No one here, however, has forgotten the opinions of those who considered themselves, not so long ago, to be experts on Afghanistan and who recommended reaching an agreement with the Taliban regime, on the pretext of implementing a realpolitik which would mean that only the Taliban would be able to guarantee some semblance of peace in this ill-fated country which has been torn apart for so long – you mentioned this, Mr Haarder – by tribal feuds. The risk was that the country would once again fall prey to various warlords once the Taliban regime had been eliminated.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we can only welcome the fact that, despite these forecasts, Afghanistan is not being torn apart today and that the progress we have already made in restoring order in the country is, on the contrary, encouraging. The progress made is, of course, encouraging, as you have said, Mr Haarder, but it is far from satisfactory. The fight against terrorism waged by al-Qa’ida and Mullah Omar is far from over, security in Afghanistan is not, therefore, guaranteed, the reorganisation needed in Afghanistan – which involves creating institutions to ensure the representation of all ethnic groups and respect for international law and human rights – has only just got underway, and, lastly, because the large-scale<span class="bold"> </span>return of refugees has only served to exacerbate the already disastrous humanitarian situation caused by the war and the drought which have been raging for years.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall return to all these points in order, if I may. The fight against terrorism waged by al-Qa’ida and Mullah Omar is far from over because we have no idea what has happened to them, for it is unlikely that they could have found refuge in areas bordering on Afghanistan, in the uncontrolled territory of the Pashtun tribes in Pakistan, but there is nothing to prove either, as far as I know, that they are not still hiding somewhere in the very heart of Afghanistan. The security of the country is, therefore, not guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Patten and Mr Haarder talked about the murders. They quite rightly emphasised the difficulties caused by these attacks for our representatives on the ground, and I join you, Commissioner, in praising the dedication and bravery of these representatives. This may be the reason for the demand made by the transitional government, by President Karzai, to all donor countries, and to the European Union in particular, to extend the mandate granted to the peacekeeping force to outside Kabul and even to the whole territory. Like the French Minister for Foreign Affairs, I do not think that this is desirable. I do not think that it is desirable for the Afghans to entrust the responsibility of maintaining order on the ground to others. It is far more desirable, to my mind, to speed up the training of the national army and police force, which has already begun, so that the Afghans themselves can take responsibility for security in their country, as they have begun to do within the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I mentioned the reorganisation that is needed and which has been carried out by setting up institutions which ensure the representation of all ethnic groups. You are well aware that there are on-going difficulties with the Pashtuns. I would also point out that we are expecting a great deal, and rightly so, from the work undertaken within the framework of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs seeking to make it possible to enforce international law and respect for human rights in Afghanistan. I welcome the news that I received yesterday that a<span class="bold"> </span>class has begun at the French High School in Kabul which is open to women and where female students do not have to wear veils.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I mentioned the humanitarian situation. In this respect, and I shall conclude on this point, we can only welcome the fact that, when examining the 2002 supplementary budget, the European Union has agreed to increase aid to Afghanistan, bringing it up to EUR 250 million. What we shall ask for is greater transparency in the way this money is used. That is why, when examining the budget, we asked for a line indicating all the transactions made with respect to Afghanistan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There was a really broad consensus on the points we discussed, and I do not just mean humanitarian issues and reconstruction in Afghanistan, but also other political issues. I would like to discuss that here, but I would like to specifically mention that my colleague Mrs Gröner will be dealing with the position of women in Afghanistan, which is a very special issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Our motion for a joint resolution starts with a clear condemnation of terrorism, stating that Afghanistan's historical problems also contributed to the need for intervention of this kind. I do not want to say any more about that intervention. It was very broadly-based and it at least attracted support and could be justified. We believe that the role of the United Nations – and I am now returning to the same discussion that we had earlier – is not being given sufficient weight at present. The United Nations needs to decide not only about peacekeeping measures, but also about the future of this intervention. The United Nations also needs to define the objectives of this intervention, the time required for it, and it should also decide when this intervention should come to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the moral justification we had for this intervention should also apply to the treatment of prisoners from this war, either in Afghanistan itself or outside Afghanistan, in Guantanamo. These prisoners deserve to be treated in accordance with international law and the international conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the international community bears an important responsibility for investigating and establishing the position as regards the human rights violations in northern Afghanistan that have been mentioned, and in particular those in the Dasht-e-Leile region which have been reported by the UN. In reply to Mr Wurtz, who mentioned this point just now, I would say that we in this House should make a very clear request for the United Nations to carry out an investigation and to bring those guilty to justice once they have been tracked down. Mr Wurtz, I regret that your group feels unable to sign this motion for a resolution, but you can at least vote for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicholson of Winterbourne (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, I congratulate the Commission and the team led in the Commissioner's office by Mr Fotiadis and those on the ground for the amazing work they are carrying out.</p>
<p class="contents">I attended the Tokyo Pledging Conference and was proud to see the way in which European Union leadership in nation rebuilding was exemplified by both the Commission and the presidency. I congratulate the Commissioner himself and the presidency at the time – the Spanish presidency – for the way in which they conducted the business of the European Union there.</p>
<p class="contents">But the Commission's subsequent work has proved my view to be correct: amongst the international community blocs claiming to be able to rebuild nations, the European Union is standing alone. And we are working in a tough and dangerous situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Afghanistan is a very difficult country to help. For example the main message coming from the Afghan Government at the moment is that international pledges made in Tokyo are not being fulfilled and the government therefore cannot conduct its business.</p>
<p class="contents">Last Saturday I had the opportunity to speak in Tehran with the new Afghan Ambassador to the Islamic Republic of Iran. He made this very point. I pointed out to him that the one partner on which he could firmly rely was the European Union. I commend the priorities the Union has set itself, as the Commissioner has outlined today, because, as I said, it is not a simple matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Water. One Member – Mr Morillon – has already mentioned the acute drought. The acute drought is so widespread in the south-west of Afghanistan – it feeds across from the plain in Iran. There are 26 major water projects under way in the Islamic Republic of Iran to try and provide the local population with water. Over the border in Afghanistan, I have seen no water projects at all on the ground. Yet this is the largest drought for at least 300 years. It has hit many hundreds of thousands of people. Of course in a drought the farmers cannot grow alternative crops. The south-west of Afghanistan is not particularly heavily mined. They can grow opium poppies in this drought. Unfortunately, poppies grow extremely well in drought. Until we put water projects in the south-west region, we cannot complain as much as we do that opium production is not being contained. Of course it is not being contained. The figures provided by the Afghan Government have been unintentionally misleading to the international community. Water ought to be one of the topmost priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">On health care, the population is virtually at the lowest ebb. Life expectancy is 46 years – the lowest in the world apart from Somalia. All the health indicators show that health has been abominable for the last 23 years and there is a lack of education.</p>
<p class="contents">May we insist that other international donors focus on small-scale health projects to implement the World Health Organisation master plan on health. Not large hospitals, for which there will not be enough staff or resources, but more mass immunisation, more primary health clinics, more mobile health clinics. Could we please press other donors to focus on those areas?</p>
<p class="contents">Then, of course, women's rights. I must tell you that women's rights have gone downhill, not up. Only last week, for example, the government passed a law stating that women would not be allowed to perform music on the radio.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is not easy. I congratulate the Commission and I urge it to persuade other donors to adopt the same approach as our team in Brussels and on the ground. We are doing wonderfully well; others, I fear, are not being nearly as successful.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wurtz (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, when my group invited the director Jamie Doran to show his film at the European Parliament on 12 June, we had three objectives in mind. The first aim was to gain as much recognition as possible for the overwhelming validity of the war crimes allegations made by the people interviewed by the British journalist in Afghanistan. Next, we wanted to give as much backing as possible to the idea of sending, under the auspices of the United Nations, a committee of enquiry to the region in question, with a view to establishing the truth of events. This would enable us to stop, hunt down and bring to justice the possible perpetrators of these atrocities, whoever they may be. Finally, we wanted to use this opportunity to reaffirm the need to respect the law and international conventions, in any situation, and this also applies to the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The joint resolution which will be submitted to us tomorrow explicitly fulfils these three desires and this is an exceptionally encouraging outcome, even though, to achieve it, it will have taken a leading US magazine to confirm our statements and, in addition, the State department, the UN and, if not the Council, then a number of European leaders to speak more openly. We must now bring this episode to a conclusion and, furthermore, my group believes that we must learn some strategic lessons from it for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally speaking, I have no doubt whatsoever regarding the need for a consistent fight against terrorism, and I have never had one ounce of sympathy for the Taliban regime. It must be pointed out, however, that the military operations carried out by the United States or the West in Afghanistan, like the random detention of alleged Islamic extremists in Guantanamo or the compilation of ever-expanding lists of suspect organisations, have not enabled us to stamp out the al-Qa’ida criminal network. To some extent, this observation is based on the report that the anti-terrorist monitoring group formed by the UN sent to the Security Council today. On the other hand, the actions mentioned above have brought about inhuman and often traumatic consequences for the population, have without a doubt reinforced the most radical and extremist elements and, lastly, have increased insecurity throughout the world. That is why my group deeply disagrees with the passages of the resolution which seek to justify war as part of the fight against terrorism. If these paragraphs were to be adopted, many of use would unfortunately be unable to support this text.</p>
<p class="contents">We must bear in mind that the subject of war has once again become a major concern in most of our countries. Unlike the sorcerers’ apprentices who, not so long ago, supported Islamic extremist networks in their attempts to destabilise whoever their enemy happened to be at any particular time, we are calling for responsible, on-going management of security issues; I am thinking, in particular, of the need to improve civilian conflict prevention and, if necessary, civil crisis management. The fact that al-Qa’ida cells still exist in at least 40 countries, according to the UN report that I mentioned earlier, also reminds us that terrorist networks are drawing their resources from the troubled waters of the international financial market. When will we finally adopt drastic measures to clean up and lend greater transparency to the international financial circuits where speculative – let us call it traditional – capital now mixes, if not crosses paths, with dirty money from organised crime? This is one of the costs of a genuinely effective fight against terrorism. For the time being, Mr President, it is clearly vital, as many of my fellow Members have said, that the international aid promised to Afghanistan at the Tokyo Conference be provided immediately so that the deeply scarred population – these people and, especially, these women – can, at last, begin to live once again like human beings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my first point, I should like to comment on Mr Wurtz's contribution and the indications he has given, in combination with, in my view, strong clues in the article in <span class="italic">Newsweek</span>, as well as in the footage which he and his fellow MEPs showed last time, that hundreds, possibly even more, Taliban have been killed under suspicious circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not quoting this to indict the Americans in any way for something which may be completely unrelated to them. I am quoting this because, in my view, it is extremely important finally to put an end to lawlessness after 20 years of civil war. This means that a serious inquiry must be mounted into this and, unfortunately, similar cases. We are all agreed without much hesitation that this inquiry falls within the remit of the United Nations. The only problem is that the UN's special representative, Mr Brahimi, has already made it clear that the United Nations is unable to carry out this enquiry because it cannot guarantee the safety of, for example, witnesses and researchers. My very explicit question to the Commission and the Council is whether they would make every effort to enable the United Nations to look into this and similar cases, and to sufficiently protect witnesses and researchers.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the comment I made earlier in the debate on Iraq. The much vaunted regime change can only be effective if there is support for it in the country itself. Militarily speaking, such support was in place in Afghanistan, in the form of the Northern Alliance. If a regime change were to depend on the construction of civil society or the existence of NGOs, then this would be extremely difficult. These have all but gone in Afghanistan, and the European Union is at the moment trying its best – for which all credit to it – to develop these. Nevertheless, I am very anxious about the way this is going and the resistance that is met along the way. There are large groups in Afghan society that reject what they call Western, but in my eyes, crucially democratic, values. As Baroness Nicholson already mentioned, there is what I see as a setback where the role of women is concerned. Although I welcome the fact that the <span class="italic">Loya Jirga</span> included many women, there are now all kinds of signs that the role of women is being repressed. I think that this is a sign that nation building does not happen overnight. I am also addressing this statement to the Americans: nation building does not happen overnight. Building a democratic society is a long-term commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is, in my view, politically speaking, the most important point at the moment and I would particularly ask the Council to address this matter. It is about extending the mandate of ISAF, the peacekeeping troops currently based in Kabul. We as the Parliament and also most Member States have been insisting for months that the mandate should be extended beyond Kabul because that is where chaos is escalating. Although the United States seems able to permit this, it will not supply a single soldier. It will be up to the European Union, the European Member States, to extend the mandate of ISAF by sending more troops to Afghanistan. My question to Mr Haarder is the following: is the Council prepared to send more troops to Afghanistan in order to control the chaos outside Kabul and to keep the peace?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, the lesson I have drawn from this situation is that we ought to think twice, if not more, before we decide on military intervention. Once we are there, however, we should acquit ourselves of our tasks effectively for as long as this proves necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new government is faced with severe difficulties and we must provide more than just economic aid. Over 1.5 million refugees have returned from the places they had fled to during the many wars and upheavals which have afflicted their country in recent decades, but they have neither houses nor work and are prey to the ongoing dangers caused by the lack of security in the country. With a view to bringing greater security, the US Special Forces advisors are working together with the Karzai government to set up a national army in Afghanistan, but if, on the one hand, the soldiers of the new army lack weapons, on the other, there appear to be 750 000 armed Mujahideen belonging to the various<span class="bold"> </span>ethnic groups. All this means that there will be further difficulties and that there is a need for especial political and diplomatic mediation between the national government and what are known as the ‘warlords’.</p>
<p class="contents">No progress has been made as regards the situation of women: the only woman elected a minister in the new government had to resign after receiving death threats for declaring her opposition to the <span class="italic">Sharia</span>. The recent attacks, the recent discovery of a chemicals laboratory for producing explosives and lethal materials and the existence of an area under tribal influence between Afghanistan and Pakistan are further indications of a dangerous situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Afghan government is proceeding, one small step at a time, to bring a return to law and order and respect for human rights, combating the extremist fringe groups which have combined terrorism and Islam to make a single religion. However, the international community must also continue to discharge its responsibilities through technical, humanitarian cooperation which will give Afghanistan the economic and structural support it needs to eliminate drug cultivation, and through more unambiguous measures to combat the <span class="italic">Sharia</span> and discrimination against women.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has a particular responsibility: for too long, our democracies were deaf to the cries for help coming from the Afghan people oppressed by the Taliban regime and by the cultural and physical violence imposed by their dictatorship. This new, specific undertaking by the Union will also be an – albeit posthumous – tribute to the appeal made by Commander Massoud, who, on 5 April 2001 here in Strasbourg, called upon Europe for help, although Europe, I am sad to say, was insensitive at that time to the afflictions of a country oppressed by Taliban fundamentalism and which al-Qa’ida had made the cradle of international terrorism. In a few days’ time, it will be the anniversary of the assassination of Commander Massoud, who was murdered a few hours before the tragedy of 11 September. It is our hope that the men and women in Afghanistan too who believe in freedom and democracy will respond to Commander Massoud’s call and work together to defeat fundamentalist violence and secure peace for their people.</p>

What we can say about the situation in Afghanistan is a mere extension of what we were saying earlier about Iraq. In both cases, we are witnessing the unleashing of an empire, which is using every possible excuse to inflict on a nation – and, there is no doubt, via this nation, on the whole world – a display of its military capability.</p>
<p class="contents">In Afghanistan, the excuse is not plausible. One does not destroy a whole country because a terrorist is hiding there. As Mr Gollnisch said earlier, we will have to bomb London until the British Government extradite to France Rachid Ramda who masterminded several terrorist attacks that were carried out on the Paris underground in 1995. Although he spoke in an ironic manner, Mr Gollnisch has simply made a logical point.</p>
<p class="contents">Due to the fact, ladies and gentlemen, that the empire and its propaganda are so deeply engrained in our minds, we are losing sight of the most basic logic and even the most basic common sense. Who, if not the empire, is flouting the law, and as I said earlier in relation to Iraq, the UN Charter, to which we are all bound, in the war that it unilaterally decided to enter into, first in Kosovo, then in Afghanistan and now in Iraq? Who if not Washington is guilty of war crimes, which I, like Mr Wurtz, would like Mr Haarder to speak to us about this afternoon. And who, if not Washington, is using weapons of mass destruction in Kosovo, in Afghanistan and in Iraq, as proven by the numbers of deformed children being born in these countries as well as the condition of many American soldiers themselves? The American people are themselves victims of the unleashing of the empire.</p>
<p class="contents">Open your eyes, ladies and gentlemen. The great warlord is no longer Saddam Hussein – it is George W. Bush. The Hitler of today cannot be said to be the remote, sectarian ‘hashassins’<span class="bold"> </span>– it is Bush and the pathetic, militaristic gang with their aspirations to dominate the world. They should know that although they will not find wretched Europe standing in their way – Europe which is so divided now and becoming increasingly divided – they will at least hear the voice of the freedom of the Nations, and above all, the voice of France. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bonino (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, it is certainly true that considerable progress has been made in the situation in Afghanistan and anyone who has visited the country recently can see that, despite the huge problems, there is hope and life. You are quite right, however, Commissioner, that the problem in Afghanistan is the lack of security and that the current government, led by President Karzai, has little power outside of Kabul. This is why, unlike Mr Morillon and the decision of the Security Council, I think that we are wrong not to respond in the positive to Mr Brahimi and Mr Karzai’s request to step up the presence of the international peacekeeping force, to extend it temporarily and to widen its territorial jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally speaking, I think that we perhaps have won the war, but there is a risk we might lose peace. Currently, 4 800 soldiers from the international peacekeeping force are stuck in Kabul. You are right, General Morillon, it would be better for the Afghans themselves to be responsible for the security of their country. However, to put together an army and a police force takes time and, in the meanwhile, the tribal leaders are becoming more organised, as is evident from the attacks carried out in recent weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am saying that reconstruction is a good thing. The Commission and our staff are, in my view, making miracles happen in Afghanistan, but I sincerely hope, Commissioner, Mr President, that the next time Mr Brahimi and Mr Karzai ask us to step up the peacekeeping force, we might have the courage to say yes. There are 7 800 American soldiers in Afghanistan to combat terrorism and 4 800 soldiers to maintain peace. I think that we have done the wrong thing. It would have been much wiser and perhaps more useful if we had had the courage to invest as much in peace and security as we have in the fight against terrorism.</p>
