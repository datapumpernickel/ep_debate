<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jean-Claude Juncker,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council.</span> <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, 60 years have passed since the end of the Second World War. Remembering 8 May 1945, the date that marked the surrender of the Third Reich, is a profound duty, and I should like to congratulate the European Parliament on not failing to remember 8 May 1945 here today.</p>
<p class="contents">The duty of remembrance is a profound duty, and I believe that it is particularly profound for those who were born after the Second World War, the men and women of my generation. When we set about remembering 8 May 1945, the surrender of German democracy in 1933 and the dreadful period separating those two dates, as the younger generation, we must remember with a great deal of restraint, at least as regards the generation of men and women involved.</p>
<p class="contents">People who, like me, were born after the Second World War – in 1954, 1955 and later – must remember with restraint because we were not witness first-hand to the tragedy that descended upon the European continent. We did not see, as those before us saw, the concentration camps and the prisons where people were killed, tortured and humiliated, to the point of complete debasement. Unlike them, we did not see the battlefields, because we did not have to cross them with our souls, and very often our bodies, carrying the weight of death. We could not, nor had to, observe, like those who could and had to do so, the long processions of prisoners who crossed Europe from every country, in fact forming a single European funeral cortege. Those of us who were born after the Second World War have not been confronted with tragic choices, whether individual or collective. We did not have to say either yes or no; we were able to bask in the glow of the post-war, having been spared such tragic choices.</p>
<p class="contents">Remembering 8 May 1945 is an act that stimulates our collective memory. It is extremely significant when first-hand memories and first-hand experience of the war and its immediate aftermath – real-life knowledge with a host of personal experiences and noble feelings – are about to become part of history, with all that history entails in terms of distance and supposedly objective interpretations with regard to memories. Today, the first-hand witnesses of this dreadful period of European history are leaving this world behind. It is moving to witness Russian war veterans on their lorries in Red Square and the long procession of people who went to war for themselves and for us, and whom today can no longer walk. We, on the other hand, all know what they are walking towards. The duty of remembrance is a profound duty.</p>
<p class="contents">For the men and women of my generation, the act of remembering not only means remembering with restraint but also with a great deal of gratitude. Above all, gratitude must be shown to our fathers’ and grandfathers’ generation who, upon returning from the battlefields and concentration camps, and once freed from the prisons, had every reason to give in and do nothing but bemoan their fate. Instead, they rebuilt Europe and made Europe the finest continent in existence. Let us show our gratitude for the extraordinary achievements of a generation of men and women who had no choice but to go to war, and who wanted to make peace!</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">In remembering and in feeling this profound duty of remembrance, we must also speak the truth. For Europe, 8 May 1945 was a day of liberation. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> 8 May 1945 was also a day of defeat. By this, though, I mean the defeat of fascism and of National Socialism, as well as the end of democratic capitulation in the face of the terrible events that had taken place since 1933. Above all, however, it was also a day of liberation for Germany.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I should like to tell the elected representatives of the German people present in this Chamber that the Germans are better neighbours to us now than they have ever been.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span> </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span>In truth, in remembering 8 May, 9 May and 10 May we are also showing our gratitude to the people who combined their strength and energy with that of Europe to liberate the European continent. With 60 years having passed, rather than 60 years late, I should like to state the extent to which we, as Europeans, must show our gratitude to the young US and Canadian soldiers who came from the other side of the ocean to Europe in order to liberate it, and we do not even know the number of other countries they helped to liberate. We ought never to forget.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I am also thinking of the soldiers of the Red Army. What losses! What an excessive number of interrupted life stories amongst the Russians, who contributed 27 million lives to the liberation of Europe! No one needs to harbour a great love – although I do – for the profound and eternal Russian State to acknowledge the fact that Russia deserves well of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I should like to pay particular tribute to the people of Europe who were able to say no whilst others were all too often tempted to give a faint yes. I should like to pay tribute here today to the people of Great Britain who were able to say no, and without whose contribution nothing would have been possible.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The restored freedom at the start of May 1945, however, was not enjoyed in equal measure throughout Europe. Comfortably installed in our old democracies, we were able to live in freedom in Western Europe after the Second World War, and in a state of restored freedom whose price we well know. Those who lived in Central and Eastern Europe, however, did not experience the same level of freedom that we have experienced for 50 years.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">They were subjected to the law of someone else. The Baltic States, whose arrival into Europe I should like to welcome and to whom I should like to point out how proud we are to have them amongst us, were forcibly integrated into a group that was not their own. They were subjected not to the <span class="italic">pax libertatis, </span>but to the <span class="italic">pax sovietika</span> that was not their own. Those people and nations that underwent one misfortune after another suffered more than any other European.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The other countries of Central and Eastern Europe did not experience that extraordinary capacity for self-determination that we were able to experience in our part of Europe. They were not liberated. They had to evolve under the regime of principle imposed on them. It is with great sadness in my heart that I mention the harsh words said today on the subject of enlargement. With the Second World War finally coming to an end, however, I say today, long live enlargement!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This post-war Europe which, without the War, would never have become the Europe that we know today; this Europe, risen from the ashes of the War, would never have come into existence if it had not been for the so-called founding fathers of Europe – people such as Schuman, Bech, Adenauer, de Gasperi and others – who, from the post-war phrase ‘war, never again’ gave birth to hope, prayer and a programme for the first time in the history of the continent. Today, we must remember with emotion and gratitude those people who had the courage to say yes after having first said no.</p>
<p class="contents">They could not have done so if they had not felt overjoyed by the noble and profound feelings of their people. We say nothing against the will of the people. We have been able to build Europe as we have done after the Second World War because the people of Europe wished never again to relive the tragedy experienced by the European continent twice over during the 20th century.</p>
<p class="contents">There are the founding fathers of Europe who are well-known; there are the peoples who evolved in the shadows and who shared these noble feelings, and then there are the philosophers, the thinkers and the politicians whom we all too often forget: Leon Blum, who dreamt of Europe from inside a French prison, the great Spinelli who was incarcerated on an Italian island by the Italian Fascists, and others who are nameless but to whom we owe a great deal. I should like to pay tribute to those people, whether forgotten or anonymous, who made it possible to create what was created after the Second World War.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">There was the free part of Europe and the part of Europe that was paralysed by the disastrous historical decree, the Yalta Agreement, which sought to divide Europe into two forever. It sought to divide it into two parts which very often stood glaring at each other and between which we have all too often been unable to build bridges. The Cold War – the term lovingly used to describe the other tragic period of European history – paralysed Europe’s greatest powers and prevented its foremost talents from expressing anything of benefit that they might have expressed if given the opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally speaking, I was born in December 1954, but I prefer to say that I was born in 1955. First and foremost – if I may digress – I grew up respecting the achievements of my father’s generation, which experienced an awful two-fold fate. Firstly, because the people of Luxembourg born between 1920 and 1927 were forcibly enlisted into the German Wehrmacht, and secondly, because they wore a uniform that was not their own, and which served ambitions other than theirs. It is an awful fate to have to wear the uniform of your enemy. The same comments apply, moreover, to the people of Alsace and Lorraine, to whom I pay homage.</p>
<p class="contents">I grew up in the Cold War environment in which the world, it seems, was easier to understand. There were those who were with us and those who were against us. We did not know why we liked those who were with us, but we knew that we had to bear hatred towards the others. We knew that the threat was coming from the other side, and those on the other side believed that the threat was coming from our side. How many lost opportunities! How much time was lost in Europe as a result of those foolish analyses during the immediate post-war era.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us rejoice, today, at no longer having to refer to the uncompromising logic of the Cold War and at being able to make peace between the two halves of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I often think about the wise men of Europe, such as Churchill – doubtless because I myself am not one of them. In 1947, when the first congress of the European Movement met at the Hague, giving birth to the idea of creating the Council of Europe in the face of the refusal by the Soviet Union to allow the other countries of Central and Eastern Europe to take part either in the Marshall Plan or in the creation of the Council of Europe, the great Churchill declared with his own prophetic offering: ‘We are beginning in the West a job which we will complete in the East.’ Ladies and gentlemen, let us take pride in having achieved that.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I recall the words of Victor Hugo who, in 1949, wrote: ‘A day will come in Europe when the only field of battle will be minds opening up to ideas; a day will come in Europe when the bullets and the bombs will be replaced by votes.’ Let us take pride in having achieved that today.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take pride in being able to say this to the European Parliament, the elected representative of the people of Europe, whose Members are the heirs of those who were able to say no when no needed to be said, and of those who were able to say yes when yes was the only remaining option. Let us show our gratitude towards those who said no when no needed to be said and let us take pride in all those who, today, are saying yes to a great Europe, and to a Europe that has seen its history and its geography reconciled. Let us take pride in those who do not wish for Europe to become a free trade area, and let us take pride in those who, like us and like millions of others, believe that Europe is a complex continent that deserves more than a free trade area. Let us take pride in the Europe built by those who were there before us, and let us conduct ourselves in a manner becoming of their heirs.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Manuel Barroso,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, honourable Members, dear friends, it is a great honour for me to represent the Commission in this ceremony in this Parliament that represents Europeans. Today we are looking back at the past and looking forward to the future. We are here to remember, to acknowledge and to build.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us first look at the past. The greatest worldwide conflict was the source of mixed feelings among all those who survived it; a source of relief for many, a source of emptiness, for sure, and often a source of fear of the future, fear that the post-war world might not be better – and might in fact be worse – than what went before.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore remember. We remember the scale of destruction that particularly ravaged Europe. Hardly any country emerged unscathed. What some have referred to as the ‘European civil war’ was witness to the inhumanity that man is capable of visiting on man. We Europeans often feel proud of the great achievements of our civilisation and our culture, of the great triumphs of the European spirit, yet we must humbly acknowledge that some of the worst horrors that the human race has ever perpetrated took place in Europe during the 20th century. </p>
<p class="contents">However, we should also remember the great stories of triumph over adversity, the personal journeys which so many Europeans made to find a better life, some crossing mountains and seas to reach their goal of a happy, peaceful existence. Some found it simply by returning home. We remember those who did not have that chance, those for whom the light of freedom went out almost as soon as they saw it; those for whom one nightmare was replaced by another.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us recognise that something remarkable came out of the ruins of Europe in 1945. Let me give you a quote from one of the visionaries of that time, speaking in Zurich in 1946. He said: ‘I am now going to say something that will astonish you. The first step in the recreation of the European family must be a partnership between France and Germany. In this way only can France recover the moral and cultural leadership of Europe. There can be no revival of Europe without [...] a spiritually great Germany’. Churchill was right. It is easy to forget now the courage it took to say those words at that time. What he said was astonishing.</p>
<p class="contents">Even more astonishing were the deeds that turned those words into reality. We should remember the extraordinary determination shown by Robert Schuman, Jean Monnet, Konrad Adenauer, Alcide de Gasperi and others and what they achieved, reconstructing rather than retreating into retribution. We should also remember and recognise the vision of transatlantic leaders who helped shoulder the burden of reconstruction rather than turning their backs on it.</p>
<p class="contents">Before we get too carried away, let us pause, because what the founding fathers started was remarkable but incomplete. As the Commission said in its declaration of 9 May: for millions, true freedom was only to come with the fall of the Berlin Wall, not the end of the Second World War. After 1945 they lost their liberties and opportunities almost as soon as they had regained them. In some cases they lost political control of their countries; in others, they lost their independence. For many people in Europe the end of the war meant peace and freedom; but for some it meant only peace, not yet freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not forget what Europe was. Sixty years ago here on this continent we experienced the Holocaust. About 30 years ago several countries in southern Europe, including my own, were still living under dictatorships. Until about 15 years ago half of Europe did not enjoy freedom and democracy. That is why I have difficulty in understanding how we can fail to be optimistic about the future of Europe when we see where Europe is now compared to where it was only a few years ago.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">However, that, luckily, was not the end of the story. What European leaders of the 1940s and 1950s constructed was a light and a magnet: a light through dark years for those who had no prospect of the peace, prosperity and stability that other Europeans enjoyed, and an extraordinary, powerful force of attraction for those peoples and countries that were breaking free and saw the European Community – as it was called then – as a catalyst for the transformation of their countries.</p>
<p class="contents">For my generation, Europe was always synonymous with democracy. As an 18-year-old, I, with others, was determined to set my own country free from a deadening, authoritarian, backward regime. That is why I and many people of my generation especially admire the extraordinary efforts of the peoples of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Romania and Bulgaria to fight for democracy, and how they relate the very idea of Europe to that of democracy. It should be, and is, with enormous pride that the European Union and its institutions embrace those new Members and peoples, as well as those of Malta and Cyprus.</p>
<p class="contents">So this transformation is worthy of recognition and commemoration. Why? Because it appears at times to be almost forgotten. Today it is too easy to take for granted the firm foundations of the new Europe in which we live, a Europe of freedom and shared values. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span><span class="italic"> </span>That is why we must state: the European Union cannot be the victim of its own success. Integrating such a variety of Members, which are united by a common project, is a truly extraordinary achievement. The challenge that we are all facing is an extraordinary one. I am convinced that implementing this tremendous project, which will soon incorporate 27 countries and 500 million people, will take place in spite of the stormy periods that will inevitably occur from time to time.</p>
<p class="contents">This implementation sometimes takes place so peacefully, however, that we run the risk of forgetting what preceded it. From now on, the accounts of murderous conflicts ravaging Europe appear to be confined to the history books. They were making the headlines as recently as 10 years ago, however, when massacres were taking place in certain Balkan countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We can say ‘never again!’ on our continent. It is easy to say, but the history of Europe proves that we have to work towards peace and not take it for granted. This is without doubt hardly a cheerful outlook, as today in Europe, problems and fears exist. In Berlin, in the large building that once housed what the Democratic Republic of Germany called its Parliament, is inscribed the word <span class="italic">Zweifel</span>, which means doubts. Doubts and fears exist, particularly amongst young people. Their fears are serious: the fear of finding or not finding a job, and the fear of a more competitive world that is sometimes perceived as a challenge. The fear, however, is that of finding or not finding a job, and not the fear of finding or not finding one’s own country.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, it is sensible to find an effective means of solving the difficulties linked to the integration of markets, whether the difficulties are real or only perceived as such. It is not a question of armed conflicts between competitors who become adversaries or enemies. That is why in confronting these fears, we have to follow the example of the generations before us; we have to show the same imagination and the same courage. Let us recall that the ambitious partnership that we concluded in Europe has been the source of peaceful revolutions, which have brought freedom and democracy to millions of Europeans!</p>
<p class="contents">The European example – the Europe of the Six, of the Ten, of the Twelve, of the Fifteen and now of the Twenty-five – has been the true driving force behind democratisation in Southern Europe, in Latin America and later in Central and Eastern Europe. Let us remember that liberty is the driving force which stimulates growth, employment and investment, and which offers a greater number of Europeans the chance of a better life.</p>
<p class="contents">The spirit of democracy and modernity in our societies is testament to our capacity to reinvent our continent. From its internal market to its external borders, from the promotion of internal cohesion to the protection of sustainable development and the environment, from the solidarity dimension to that of justice in all four corners of the globe – as we are not seeking a Europe that is closed in on itself – the European Union is constantly building Europe. It does so in concrete stages that improve the everyday lives of our people. Ratifying the Constitution will strengthen these undertakings and will lay the foundations for ever more significant advances in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us therefore remember today that appalling war and its consequences. In our work focused on the future, let us take our inspiration from the visionary ambition and the determination of the leaders and the citizens who preceded us, from reconciliation to cooperation and from cooperation to the European Union!</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hans-Gert Poettering, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE-DE Group</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the European Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, in 1945 – 60 years ago – Europe was a ruined battlefield. A barbaric war had claimed the lives of over 55 million people, millions more – untold millions – were uprooted, millions were made refugees or driven away from their homes; parents lost sons, wives lost husbands, children lost fathers. By the end of March 1945, my own father, a private in the Army, was missing. It was only a very long time later that we learned that he was among the dead. I never saw him.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1945, many of Europe’s cities were laid waste; its economy was in ruins. In the world at large, the mention of the name of Europe brought fear and dread. Where responsibility for the outbreak of the Second World War lay is not a matter of doubt: the illicit National Socialist regime in Germany whipped up its racial delusions and claims to power into an inferno of aggression against all the other peoples of Europe. The attempted extermination of the Jews was to be the worst of its crimes. National Socialist totalitarianism led the whole of Europe into ruination. When the end came in 1945, the German people themselves were among its victims, at a time when victors were thin on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of victors, there were survivors, some fortunate, some unfortunate; the former in the West, the latter in Central and Eastern Europe. Far-sighted American support made it possible for new life to resume in the west of the continent, enjoying freedom, respect for human dignity, democracy and a market economy founded upon the law. It was Winston Churchill, as we have just been reminded, who sketched out the vision of a United States of Europe – and let me add that Europe could never be complete without Great Britain. After 1945, starting with its Atlantic coast, Europe was resurrected; its peoples, exhausted but rejoicing that they could start again in freedom, drew together. Robert Schuman will always be remembered and honoured for reaching out to the Germans and inviting them to join in this new beginning. Without French magnanimity, Europe would again have remained no more than an insubstantial idea – and let me add that, now that the European Union is making another new beginning with a single constitution, Europe in future, too, will need France, more than ever, to be constructively involved.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In 1945 the peoples of Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe, too, were filled with the hope of a new beginning, of having, as those who belonged to the same European culture in which we all share, a new chance of life in freedom and peace. They had to learn from bitter experience that peace without freedom amounts to only partial liberation from the yoke of totalitarian injustice. Their hopes were crushed by the Soviet seizure of power. Although National Socialist totalitarianism was vanquished in 1945, Stalinist totalitarianism divided Europe and imposed its unjust rule on the peoples of Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe. Hope, though, did not desert the less happy survivors of the Second World War – the hope of a shared Europe, intellectually, morally and politically renewed, with the prospect of prosperity for all its citizens. To this hope they eventually gave shape in a peaceful revolution, the watchword for which was <span class="italic">Solidarność</span>. It would take decades for the wall to be broken down.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Having been a member of this House ever since the first direct elections to it in 1979, I see our debate today – a debate that we are holding together in a dignified fashion, and with the gravity it deserves – as a time to rejoice that Europe is now united, a time of rejoicing, too, in the presence among us of Members from eight Central European countries, who enjoy the same rights as we do.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It was in 1989 that the double burden of totalitarianism was lifted from Europe. What 1989 taught us was what power Europe’s values have for all of us and how much, if we want to retain our freedom, we rely upon the example of courageous men and women. After 1989, Europe could again begin to breathe with both lungs, to quote the words used by that great Pope of immortal memory, John Paul II.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The peoples of Western Europe had done valuable, indispensable, work in preparation for that day, and what they did will last. The establishment of the European Union with common values centred upon human dignity, the supranational union in a free community with its own binding laws were the consequent response to the opportunity presented by the end of the war. European unification is a project of peace and freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">All Europeans now have the chance, and the duty, to go down the road presented by a reunited Europe. We are now, together, engaged in building a Europe that defends its values for the sake of all its citizens. Europe can now give one single response to warfare and totalitarianism, by pressing on along the road of the one European Union of peoples and states, with perseverance, inner conviction and an acceptance of the diversity that is Europe’s strength and splendour. The current debate on the European Constitution is a great opportunity for us to remind ourselves of these fundamental things, because, for the first time in European history, our values and ideals are set down in a constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Europa is not merely a political construction, but an intellectual living space. It is for that reason that the response to the terrible war, whose end we today commemorate with gratitude, had to be a moral one, a ‘never again’ to the unfreedom that leads to war, a ‘never again’ to the war that robs men of their freedom. That sums up the motivation behind building a new Europe, a Europe that repudiates totalitarianism, nationalist arrogance, and egalitarian inhumanity, a Europe that refuses to allow any one of its state to dominate the others, a Europe that affirms the unmistakeable dignity of every individual human being, the balancing of the interests of social groups and peoples, a Europe of respect and diversity, from which diversity, indeed, it derives its strength, a Europe of democracy and law.</p>
<p class="contents">A great deal of progress has been made in terms of internal reconciliation – reconciling the peoples and states of Europe with one another. We want – as we must – to complete this work of internal reconciliation, as we also wish to be reconciled with the people of Russia and the peoples in the Russian Federation. In the period of our history that is now beginning, Europe, though, will have to seek reconciliation in the world and with the world around us to a greater extent than ever before. Europe’s wars became world wars. Europe’s unification must benefit the world. We can be grateful to the Members of this House – and I wish to thank my colleague Elmar Brok in particular – who have drafted a resolution that will, tomorrow, express our values.</p>
<p class="contents">In this hour, we remember all the victims of the Second World War, and all the suffering and destruction. We recall how much peace and freedom belong together and the need for our work to serve mankind, not least in promoting dialogue between cultures.</p>
<p class="contents">Where this dialogue with the world bears fruit, we will defend the values that sustain us on our way into the future. It is thus that this day of remembrance can give us a new mission, bidding us work together to build a better world – a world more at peace, and a freer world.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martin Schulz, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PSE Group</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when thinking of 8 May 1945, and remembering what happened on it, we think of the period that preceded it, and also of the period thereafter. It is impossible for any German Member of this House to think of that date without at the same time recalling his or her own nationality. The group on whose behalf I speak includes MEPs from Germany, representing the country that wanted this war, that prepared for this war, that waged it and was merciless in organising it.</p>
<p class="contents">I also speak, though, on behalf of Members from Poland, the country that was the first to be overrun by the German army, as well as of Members from the countries – the United Kingdom and France – that were foremost among the Allies, without whose combined might Hitler could not have been brought down. Next to me sits Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, for many years Prime Minister of Denmark, a country that Hitler’s Germany overran and occupied overnight – one of the occupying soldiers being my own father.</p>
<p class="contents">I also speak on behalf of Members from countries that suffered under dictatorship long after the Second World War was over. My group includes a lawyer who defended victims of the Franco regime, and another Member who was a victim himself, having been tortured in the dungeons of the secret police. Some of my group colleagues are from Portugal and Greece, men and women who – like you, Mr President of the Commission – in their younger days rejoiced to see the dictators driven from their countries. My group includes my friend Józef Pinior, who will be the next to speak for the group, and who spent time being tortured in Communist jails for being a trade unionist and a social democrat.</p>
<p class="contents">For me to be able to speak on behalf of all these people is a privilege, a privilege I owe to the European Union. It is something for which we can all be grateful to the men and women who had to take on responsibility, after 8 May 1945, for the work of unification that they achieved. As the President-in-Office of the Council said, on that day, 8 May 1945, lessons had to be learned, and the right ones were. The history of the European Union, the post-8 May 1945 history of Europe, is a success story. It is the history of the firm determination that grew out of the ruins, the history of a ‘never again!’ This ‘never again!’ was not said to the empty air. It took on shape and form, forms in which we work today, from which we benefit today, forms that enable me to represent Members of the Jewish faith, that make it possible for my group to include Muslim MEPs, for there to be in my group Members who have suffered, and those who have learned from those who suffered. They make it possible for us to find common ground by affirming one thing: the lesson of 8 May must be that, if this ‘never again!’ is to be permanent, it must be fought for anew every day. For our democracy, for our Europe, our fight goes on day by day.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us, today, remember the causes, the period that went before, marked as it was by one insight. It is unique in the history of the human race for a state to define itself and its purpose in terms of the extermination of other peoples and races. Neither before nor since has there been a state that justified its own existence by saying that it existed as a state in order that the Jews, the Slavs, the Roma, the Sinti and the handicapped might be wiped out. Such a thing is unique in the history of the human race. That is the extraordinary thing about the Third Reich; the Nazis wanted not a trace to remain behind of the Jews of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">A few weeks ago, I was at Yad Vashem, the memorial site in Jerusalem. I descended into the corridors and hallways below ground in which the fates of the millions of victims are depicted. The Director of Yad Vashem, who guided me around, said to me: ‘Every day, I descend into this hell and see them – the pictures, them alone. It is a hell.’ Then I went up the steps and through a corridor into the new museum, which has a wide glass frontage, and there, in the sunlight, is the city of Jerusalem. ‘Every day,’ said the director of Yad Vashem, ‘when I come out of that hell and see that sight, I know that they did not succeed. We are alive. We made it; the Nazis did not.’</p>
<p class="contents">Every memory, every day of remembrance, every name that we read out, is a victory over the criminals who wanted nothing to remain. If we remember them, the Jewish people remain, as do the Roma and the Sinti, as do those who were murdered for political reasons, as do also the people with disabilities. They remain in our recollection, and hence they live.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">So many victims, so many names! Anne Frank was a little Jewish girl, whose only crime was to be a little Jewish girl in Amsterdam. On such a day, let us remember Anne Frank. Sophie Scholl was a young German student, whose only crime was to be an upright person, and who was beheaded at the age of 18 for distributing leaflets denouncing the Nazi regime. I also think of Krzysztof Baczynski, a young Polish poet, shot dead in Warsaw by a German marksman. Three names out of 55 million victims! Three names, yet enumerated to represent all the other victims. Let me repeat: three names which we call to mind, and which stand as representing all those whom we should remember.</p>
<p class="contents">Over past weeks, we have often asked about the point of this European Union of ours, and we have been asked what it is for. What this Union is for is described in our speeches today. The continuance to this very day of this work of unification, which is still overcoming division, still holding racism in contempt, still excluding from the community of democrats all anti-Semites, racists and Nazis, still holding these criminals up to scorn, still enumerating their deeds, and still remembering them – that is the basis, the moral and intellectual foundation of our European Union, the Union built up by our fathers and our fathers’ fathers.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, Europe has a heritage; the EU is no longer a novelty. It is now 60 years old, having, in principle, been born on 8 May 1945. Right now, we have a heritage to manage if we are to pass it on. If we care for this heritage, knowing ourselves duty bound to remember that the Third Reich represented the moral nadir of the human race, from which we have drawn the right conclusions by creating this Union, then we European politicians will enable the young men and women who sit in this Chamber’s galleries to have a brighter future to look forward to than did their fathers and grandfathers in the past.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Graham Watson, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the ALDE Group</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, the British poet John Donne observed: ‘No man is an island, entire of itself, but a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less’.</p>
<p class="contents">That was in 1624, yet for over 300 years peoples and states continued to wage war across our continent. Tribalism and hatred are Europe’s ugly legacy. If we had not learned it earlier, the ‘war to end all wars’ should have shown us the futility and the trauma of organised warfare. Our awakening from that nightmare led to the League of Nations, yet we continued to distil the fruits of scientific advance into the firewater of the weapons of mass destruction. By the time World War II ended in Europe, on 8 May 1945, more than 40 million people had lost their lives.</p>
<p class="contents">A cynic might say that 20th century Europeans were slow learners. It took two bloody wars and a continent in ruins to teach us that a united Europe is worth more than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p class="contents">Not all of us were able even then to realise our aspirations for peace and freedom. While for most Europeans May 1945 marked the liberation of their countries from Nazi tyranny and the beginning of a new path to freedom and reconstruction, for those who found themselves on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain, one tyranny was quickly replaced by another. A further two generations were denied the liberty we now enjoy. As a student at the Karl Marx University in Leipzig in 1976, I saw this at first hand.</p>
<p class="contents">Our historical perspectives are inevitably different. But this must be a debate about the future, not the past. Let us rejoice that Europe is united in peace and that we can sit together in the same debating chamber with a set of common supranational institutions of government deciding on matters of mutual concern.</p>
<p class="contents">It was the imperative of <span class="italic">inter</span>dependence that brought the European Union into being and saw the Soviet bloc finally crumble. We started with coal and steel, the building blocks of post-war Europe; we built the common market, the basis of prosperity undreamt of by my parents; we made the single currency a reality for 300 million Europeans at the dawn of this new century.</p>
<p class="contents">As we mark the 60th anniversary of a lasting peace, we see that Europe has come a long way, through gradual steps to build solidarity between our peoples. There is no doubt that the European Union has been a success: <span class="italic">liberté, egalité, fraternité</span> have become part of our common legislative and social fabric. But there is no guarantee it will always be that way, and we stand now at a watershed, represented by the constitutional treaty. Can we move forward and consolidate this unprecedented era of peace, stability and prosperity, or will it melt before our eyes and be replaced by a new national rivalry and brinkmanship?</p>
<p class="contents">A <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> columnist reminded us last week how thin is the veneer of civilisation, how weak the voice of human conscience when tempted away from the rule of law and respect for our fellow human beings. This is the challenge before our Member States as they are called upon to ratify the Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">A peaceful and prosperous Europe was always based on the premise that strength lay in convergence and shared mandates. Cooperation has grown from trade to encompass social policy, employment, immigration, justice, policing and foreign policy. The revolutions in central and eastern Europe have lifted from our shoulders the yoke of Yalta, but we are confronted with new challenges. The challenge, for example, of feeding, clothing and housing a growing world population, while more and more are pushed into migration by war or hunger or sheer desperation. The challenge of dealing with a hole in the ozone layer, melting ice caps, rising sea levels and climate change. Or the threat of internationally organised crime, where some criminal gangs are now more powerful than some national governments, bringing misery to many though the trade in drugs and small arms and the trafficking of people, and working hand-in-hand with terrorists. None of these challenges can be faced by our countries acting alone. To provide the security, prosperity and opportunity which our fellow citizens expect government to deliver, we have to work together. And work together, too, with the United States and Canada, to whose people we owe so much and whose values by and large we share, not only to confront with them common challenges but to make them feel more comfortable with a new and more powerful Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has the potential to be a beacon of hope, a model of tolerance, diversity and stability, in a world where these attributes are still rare. We can insist on a bill of rights, or we can see our rights eroded. We can ratify the European Constitution and put our faith in democracy and accountable government, or we can continue to leave too much power in unelected hands. We can hold out the hand of friendship to the dispossessed, or cocoon ourselves in an illusory haven of prosperity. We can welcome Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey and the western Balkans and accept that Europe should be plural and diverse, or continue to treat each other with hostility and suspicion. Convergence is not just an ideal, it is an economic and political necessity. It is time to move beyond national self-interest towards greater convergence. Cooperation is the way forward, enabling us to face global challenges together.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has a leading role to play in the era of global governance. It is a stabilising force and a benchmark for other countries and peoples. Trade and cooperation can bring to others the fruits it has brought to us, and for that reason my Group welcomes greater contact with Russia and the People’s Republic of China. But history should teach us not to be an instrument in supporting authoritarian regimes. Liberals and Democrats view with concern the direction of some of the Council’s policies: to undercut the Americans in some downward Dutch auction of human rights standards would be an affront to the dignity for which Europe’s people have fought so hard.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as no man is an island, no country is an island either. We are joined together in our custody of a fragile world and our stewardship of its inhabitants. Let Europe exemplify the dignity of difference and grasp the challenge.</p>

My parents left Germany 72 years ago. In 1933, my father was a lawyer; he defended the Red Assistance and he should have been arrested. I was born exactly nine months after the allied landings in Normandy. I am a child of the liberation, of a military invasion that liberated European soil and allowed my parents to have a child, a ‘child of liberty’.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why our remembrance – my remembrance – is paved with horrors. The horror of Auschwitz, the <span class="italic">anus mundi </span>that demonstrated the worst that mankind is capable of. Kolima, the <span class="italic">anus mundi </span>that demonstrated what the most barbaric political ideology is capable of doing. Oradour-sur-Glane, which demonstrated what a military occupation can give rise to. Katyn, which demonstrated that liberation and destruction can take place at the same time. The entire Polish elite was massacred by the Red Army in order to prevent the Polish people from joining together and creating their own independent State. We then continued to commit massacres which were beyond compare, but which were nonetheless comparably lethal and cruel. There were the massacres of the colonial wars, and Srebrenica, which took place 10 years ago now, to the very day.</p>
<p class="contents">It is as a result of these massacres that men and women, who do not belong to my political party, but whose importance I acknowledge for having succeeded – because they did succeed – in building this Europe, be they De Gaulle or Adenauer, Willy Brandt or Helmut Kohl, François Mitterrand – little does it matter – did something extraordinary. For our part, those of us born after 1945 are the children of Europe, but we are also the children of anti-totalitarianism. This Europe was created to prevent totalitarianism from ever resurging, whether from the left or the right. To quote a song familiar to some: there is no supreme saviour, neither god nor king nor leader nor Communism nor Neo-liberalism. There is no liberating ideology of mankind. There is only one small and very fragile thing that many people mock and which is simply called ‘democracy’. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> My dear friends, ladies and gentlemen, it is always either easy or difficult for a German to talk about ‘the war, 60 years on’. Germany, though, experienced both National Socialism, with all its barbarity, and Communist totalitarianism. Germany, then, is also a symbol of Europe, and if there is any obligation incumbent on our generation, then it is the obligation to speak the truth. My concern is not to set out to the House what Europe’s political tasks are, for we can do that day in and day out. My concern is solely with how seriously we take this anti-totalitarian obligation. If we really do act upon it, we may not, we cannot, disregard human rights and respect for human dignity for the sake of <span class="italic">Realpolitik </span>of any kind.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We have to talk to the Russians, but we also have to talk about Chechnya. We have to talk about crimes. We have to talk to the Chinese, but we have to talk about the way in which the Chinese people are oppressed. We cannot simply say ‘so let’s just lift the embargo’, and pass on to the next item on the agenda. So the Chinese get a few weapons. So they are sold a few Transrapids. With a history like Europe’s behind us, we simply cannot do that!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is because we are obligated to truth, because we believe in Europe, that we all, when shaping and organising the Europe of the future, have to remember what Europe once was and what it must not be allowed to be again.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in times such as these that I – as one of those who think of Europe’s history in those terms – am proud to campaign for a constitution that embodies the heritage of the anti-totalitarian Europe. I am convinced that we will win; this constitution will become real in Europe. That is what I believe; it is an obligation upon us for the sake of our children, who will inherit what our parents gave us for safe keeping.</p>

I am convinced that in the majority of political groups represented within our Assembly, men and women will feel a sense of unease when faced with this text, which is more or less a revision of history.</p>
<p class="contents">When an institution such as ours evokes that founding event of Europe and the world today that was the victory of all the allies – US, British and Soviet of the anti-Hitler coalition, every word counts. Let us wager that in a declaration of this type, many men and women expected to read lines such as the following: ‘8 May 1945 was a day of liberation for Europe’. Why not, since it is the truth; it was a day when the Soviet army contributed in a decisive manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Without choosing to overlook Stalinist oppression in any way, a number of Europeans, when confronted with various demonstrations of nostalgia for the Third Reich, would without doubt have also hoped to hear us say that excusing the Nazi atrocities by pointing the finger at Stalinist crimes is unacceptable from an intellectual and moral viewpoint, and indeed that – in view of the war of remembrance that is currently bringing the Baltic republics and Russia into conflict – we should keep in mind Nazi Germany’s share of the responsibility in the tragedy of the Baltic States.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I will clarify a point: all the arguments that I have just put forward were in fact taken from an article published the day before yesterday in the French daily <span class="italic">Le Figaro</span>, under the name of Michael Mertes, a former adviser to the ex-Chancellor, Helmut Kohl. That is your political family, members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats! Thank God! We lost that war, it concludes, adding a line which I suggest you contemplate: the way we envisage the past teaches us more about our current attitudes than about the past itself.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when the European Union is consulting its citizens on a draft Constitution, how will these citizens interpret the concept of an enlarged Europe that starts by questioning the cornerstone of the vision of Europe and the world, born on 8 May 1945, namely that Nazism was neither a dictatorship nor a tyranny like any other, but rather the complete break with society as a whole?</p>
<p class="contents">As far as we are concerned, we are ready for a debate that leaves no stone unturned, whether it focuses on the crimes of Stalinism, on the German-Soviet Pact of bleak memory, or further still on the history of the Baltic States. Nothing, absolutely nothing, however, should allow us to trivialise Nazism, the intended aim of which – should we need reminding – was to exterminate sub-humans and to enlarge the essential space of the superior race through mass warfare. That is the reason why we had a right to expect a text on 8 May 1945 from the European Parliament with a completely different focus. Might it not even have been too much, furthermore, to pay tribute to the anonymous soldiers on this occasion, who, with no other ambition but to live and act as upstanding men and women, became involved in the resistance at risk of their lives, which so many of them sacrificed for our freedom. One word – just one word – on the horror of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and their tens of thousands of dead in a defeated country would likewise not have been too much.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has truly failed to reconcile itself with history on this occasion. In addition, my group unanimously refuses to back this resolution, which is far removed from our concept of the Europe of 25, 27 or 30.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall leave the final word to a European leader who, 20 years ago, found the appropriate words to speak about 8 May 1945, and in a country where it was most difficult to speak them openly. I am talking about the former German President, Richard von Weizsaecker. If I may quote him. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic"> (DE)</span> ‘We have the strength to look the truth in the face as best we can, without embellishment and without distortion. <span class="italic">[...]</span></p>
<p class="contents">With every day, something became clearer, and this must be stated today on behalf of us all: 8 May was a day of liberation. It liberated us all from the inhumanity and tyranny of the Nazis.’</p>

This partition of Poland came about as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which had been signed a week earlier in Moscow. Poland was not conquered by the fighting squads of the Nazi or Communist parties, but by the regular armed forces of its neighbours, or in other words by the German <span class="italic">Wehrmacht</span>, <span class="italic">Luftwaffe</span> and <span class="italic">Kriegsmarine</span> and by the Red Army. It should be added that the National Socialist Party, with Chancellor Hitler at its head, ruled over Germany at the time, having come to power on the basis of a democratic decision by the German electorate. Stalin and the Communist Party governed Russia, having been swept to power by the revolution.</p>
<p class="contents">We are currently celebrating the 60th anniversary of Germany’s capitulation, which took place on 8 May 1945 and has come to symbolise the end of the wrongful acts committed by Nazi Germany in the occupied countries. Yet it did not mean the end of the wrongdoing that began with the Soviet Union’s invasion of Poland in 1939. We won the war against Germany, but we lost the war against Russia. This meant that a foreign power, a foreign economic system and a foreign ideology were forced upon us.</p>
<p class="contents">We fought on all fronts in the Second World War, and we were there when the first and last shots were fired. As of 1941, our allies in the war against Germany included the Soviet Union. We acknowledge the role played by Russia in defeating Nazi Germany and the huge loss of life the country suffered in the process. Yet this does not alter the fact that Russia acted as though it had conquered Poland. What is more, our Western allies in the fight against Germany were also allies of the Soviet Union, and gave their consent to our enslavement in Yalta. We were forced to liberate ourselves little by little, firstly by decollectivising agriculture, then by setting free the Church, then by gaining acceptance for small and private businesses and finally by achieving the freedom to form trade unions, as well as freedom of speech and political freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">The only help we received from the rest of the world in this process came by way of the arms race, which was won over time by the USA, and, in particular, through the success of Reagan’s ‘Star Wars’ programme, which weakened the Soviet Union. The presence of American troops in Europe and the existence of NATO meant that Western Europe has been able to enjoy peace for the past 60 years. Now the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, which are either members of NATO or have formed partnerships for peace, are also reaping the benefits. Each and every one of us shares a desire for peace and freedom, and for a future shaped according to our wishes.</p>
<p class="contents">The members of my generation, who experienced the Second World War at first hand, will not be with us for much longer, and we must ensure that future generations remember the truth about this war. We Poles find it a source of great distress that so many Western media outlets continue to use phrases that we find insulting, such as ‘Polish concentration camps’, or even ‘Polish gas chambers and crematoria’, which was how the British <span class="italic">Guardian</span> had the temerity to refer to them in print. It is the case that some of these factories of death were located on Polish territory, but the fact remains that they were German, not Polish. Not all Germans bear the responsibility for such things, and we acknowledge that the German nation has distanced itself from its shameful Nazi legacy, but we are keen to ensure that future generations do not associate Poland with the crimes committed by the Nazis, as Poland was not responsible for them.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the Russian people are not responsible for the crimes committed during the Stalin era, or in other words for the deportations, the gulags, the genocide that was committed in Katyn and the subjugation of Central and Eastern Europe. It was the Communist leaders of the Soviet state that were responsible for these crimes, and the Russians themselves also suffered enslavement. We wish to be reconciled with the Russian people and state, but we expect them to distance themselves unequivocally from their Communist legacy. The current leaders of Germany and Russia, or in other words the countries that started the Second World War, however, have given a joint interview to the German newspaper <span class="italic">Bild</span> in which they attempt to divert attention away from anything other than their mutual relations and the losses they suffered.</p>
<p class="contents">We are currently seeking to establish neighbourly relations with both Germany and Russia. As long ago as 1961, the Polish bishops sent a famous letter to the German bishops, which included the phrase; ‘we forgive and ask forgiveness’. We take the same approach to our current relations with Russia, yet forgiveness and reconciliation do not mean that we should forget. We would therefore call for there never again to be a repeat of such things as genocide, the subjugation of one nation by another, aggression and war. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we genuinely wish to join together to form a single European spiritual community, we must all endeavour to gain a full understanding of the historical experiences of Europe’s nations. In order to do so, there are certain issues about which we must speak quite frankly.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution to mark the 60th anniversary of the end of the war has come about as a result of a hard-won compromise, and on the whole it is an accurate portrayal of the consequences of the war. What is missing, however, is any reference to the link that exists between the start and the end of the war, or to the views on the war that are currently being touted in Russia. Munich and the partition of Czechoslovakia were Hitler’s first acts of aggression, but there is no denying that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was the real call to war. Poland fell victim to the cooperation between the Third Reich and the USSR in September 1939, and this was followed by Germany’s invasions of Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland, Luxembourg, France, Yugoslavia and Greece, as well as by the Soviet invasions of Finland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Stalin did not join the Allies in their fight against Germany of his own free will. In fact, quite the opposite is true, as he refused to cooperate with France and Great Britain. It was only after Hitler’s attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941 that he secured the assistance of the British and the Americans by entering into a new coalition, which was ultimately to defeat the Third Reich.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet even though it was the Red Army which bore the main brunt of the war, no changes were made to the Soviet system. The Gulag Archipelago continued to expand, and the number of lives it claimed can be compared to the number of Soviet citizens that fell in the war. The cooperation between the Big Three was therefore based on a mere semblance of common values, which was why it proved impossible to maintain after the end of the war. Just before his death, Roosevelt admitted that America could not do business with Stalin, as the latter had broken every one of the promises he had made. Yet this admission came too late. Europe was divided, and Eastern Europe was driven into the arms of Stalinist totalitarianism. The countries affected included Poland, which was the first to put up any resistance to Hitler, even at a time when his ally was Stalin. The Polish armed forces constituted a quarter of the Allied forces, and in relative terms the country suffered the greatest loss of lives during the war.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, Russia is reluctant nowadays to acknowledge the ambiguous role played by the USSR during the war. President Putin has reverted to a Stalinist interpretation of the Second World War and its aftermath, and claimed that the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was a normal international treaty. Russia has officially denied that Stalin attacked Poland in 1939, that genocide was committed in Katyn and that the USSR occupied the Baltic states. It has even said that the Yalta Conference brought democracy to Poland.</p>
<p class="contents">Viktor Yerofeyev, a well-known Russian writer, recently wrote that Russia is enlightened enough to make no distinction between Stalin’s totalitarianism and Hitler’s regime. If Russia were indeed enlightened, there would be every reason to hope that it could be reconciled with Europe. Any signs of a rehabilitation of Stalin should serve as a warning to all of us, however.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is this so important right now? President Putin has said that reconciliation between Russia and Germany could set an example to Europe. Unfortunately, any reconciliation that is based on a Stalinist interpretation of history sets the warning bells ringing, and they are ringing particularly loudly in Warsaw, Vilnius, Riga and Tallinn.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the Polish people and the other nations of Central Europe believe that it will be impossible to achieve peace and reconciliation in Europe if the nations situated between Germany and Russia are left out of the equation in this fashion. What the House needs to understand is that we in Poland and Central Europe feel too cramped for comfort whenever the superpowers of Western Europe and Russia shake hands over our heads. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also a good thing that on this occasion, it is underlined once again that freedom and democracy should not be taken for granted, and have to be actively upheld. The atrocities of National Socialism are a black page in Europe’s history and the previous speakers were right to point out that there is little, if anything, that can be added to that.</p>
<p class="contents">It is regrettable, though, that Western Europe is devoting so little attention to the historical fact that 60 years ago, the official go-ahead was given for handing over the Eastern European peoples to Soviet occupation, to dictatorial Communist regimes that were certainly a match for the Nazis in terms of horror and crime. The Red Army was already at Warsaw in 1944, simply waiting until the Nazis had suppressed the uprising. Sixty years ago, there was praise and honour everywhere in the West for Joseph Stalin, a tyrant who had by then already killed millions of people and who, with the connivance of the liberated West, would go on to kill many more millions, in and outside of Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, in fact, high time that Russia should follow Germany in putting the past to rights. Officially, countries such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were liberated by the Red Army. Vaira Vike-Freiberga, Latvia’s President, pointed out that 1945 did not bring the Baltic States liberation of any kind, quite the contrary. Let me quote her: ‘It meant slavery, it meant occupation, it meant submission and Stalinist terror’.</p>
<p class="contents">The European leaders who were in Moscow a few days ago hardly took the trouble to broach that reality, and what meant liberation for the Western Europeans 60 years ago, was another calvary for Eastern Europe, the difference being that the new dictatorships could count on the active support and sympathy of so many Western European politicians, media, intellectuals and many others, some of whom, in fact, appeared to be on the payroll of the Soviet secret services. It is perhaps apt, 60 years down the line, to look at those issues. Maybe Europe will not be able to fully put the past to rest unless a kind of Nuremberg Trial of Communism is held, not in an attempt to open up old wounds but with the intention never to forget, with the future of our children and grandchildren in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">I am shocked when a European Commissioner includes photos on his website on which he demonstrates his admiration for one such as Fidel Castro. I am shocked when intellectuals and policy-makers continue to deny or play down the advent of Islamic extremism. Jean-François Revel already spoke of <span class="italic">la tentation totalitaire</span> – the totalitarian temptation. If there is one lesson to be learnt from the atrocities of the Second World War, it is that totalitarianism should not be given another chance, wherever it may appear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When we celebrate the end of the World War in Europe, we must not forget that the end of the war brought something different for each of the European nations. In the case of more fortunate nations, it marked the end of long suffering and immeasurable destruction sixty years ago. We bow our head before all who made a sacrifice for peace. Another evil dictatorship, however, awaited the other half of Europe with no less suffering and destruction. Night after night without daylight, occupation after occupation without independence, inhumane dictatorship after inhumane dictatorship without freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">Slovakian representative, Zita Pleštinská, sits here behind me among us, whose Hungarian father, István Kányai, was equally hunted by Nazis and Fascists, and then later suffered nine years in the hells of Soviet concentration camps. The one, who frees the innocent captive from one prison and locks him up in another, is a prison guard, not a liberator. And the prisoner will not see him as someone who granted his freedom, but one who took it. For many European nations, their much-coveted freedom came fifty years after May 8, 1945. And the last step was taken May 1, 2004, marking the ending of the Yalta world order. In reality, the Second World War ended on May 1, 2004. Therefore, the end of the war should more appropriately be celebrated here, in the capital of reunified Europe instead of Moscow.</p>
<p class="contents">The nations of Europe looked at two sides of the same wall: the barbed wire divided us in two for half a century. We bore the unbearable, endured the system established by the Soviet Red Army, who stayed after the liberation, genocide, class and ethnic-based cleansing, the killing, torturing, deportation and disenfranchisement of innocent people committed in the name of the progressive socialist idea. The system forced upon Central European nations by Soviet Communism was a direct consequence of the plan that Stalin spoke about on August 19, 1939 before the Politbüro, when giving an explanation for the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. I quote: <span class="italic">‘The experience of the last 20 years has shown, that in peacetime it is impossible to maintain a Communist movement throughout Europe that would be strong enough for a Bolshevik Party to seize power. The dictatorship of such a Party will only become possible as the result of a major war.’</span></p>
<p class="contents">Our nations rose up against such dictatorship from the Bolshevik Parties many times: 1956 in Berlin, October 1956 in Hungary and Poznañ, 1968 in Czechoslovakia and 1980 in Poland. The West welcomed our revolutions, sympathised with us, then tolerated it when the Soviet Union quashed and bloodily stamped out these expressions of desire for freedom. Dear colleagues, our history is your history too. Nevertheless, we, the nations freed from Soviet occupation a decade ago, find no compassion when it comes to our recent history. After the war, Western Europe proudly straightened itself up and started to prosper in peace. Although it was not our fault, we got left out of this process. This gives ground to the current situation, in which there are people on the luckier side of Europe and even here in Parliament, who want to generate capital for themselves by frightening their own population with the cheap citizens of the new Member States, with people, whose country fell into an economic crisis because of the ineffectual socialist economy forced on them.</p>
<p class="contents">But many people in Western Europe do not understand either why the five-pointed red star, like the swastika, has become the symbol for hatred and oppression. Our history is your history too. Sixty years ago, Nazi powers were jointly defeated by nations of Europe. The discredited political class disappeared. There are no squares named after Hitler, and no statues erected to commemorate Nazi killers. Half a century later, the Soviet Union and the Communist regime also collapsed. Similarly, Yugoslavian Communism that went on its separate way without Soviet occupation suffered a disgraceful defeat. The successors of the fallen Communist system are eloquent business people demanding respect, responsible politicians, so to say. In Russia, statues of Stalin have been erected again, and the Soviet occupation, once again, is referred to as liberation. It seems that they wanted to hear less and less about the atrocities of the Communist dictatorship.</p>
<p class="contents">Dear Parliament, we must not think with a double standard. Auschwitz, the Katyn forest massacre, the Nazi and the two-time Soviet occupation of the Baltic States, unjust dictatorships dismembering Europe’s spheres of interest, borders drawn by force and pacts, deportation of whole nations, murdering, torturing, crippling of people, disenfranchising population exchanges, walls dividing nations, trampling on human and minority rights, these are all gross injustices, regardless of who committed them.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixty years after the military end of the war, it is time to face these issues. The enormous sacrifice of the Soviet army demands respect and honour. The occupying army, however, does not deserve our respect; it forced its own oppressing dictatorship on one part of the European nations. As long as we are unable to call an atrocity an atrocity, adjudge murder as murder, as long as we measure one sin with another, war will continue to rage in our head and wounds will not heal. Jesus says that the truth makes us free. The reuniting of Europe gives opportunity for a new beginning. Once winners and losers, oppressors and oppressed, we can build a joint, democratic Europe together based on the virtue of human dignity rooted in the Christian tradition, with hope for a brighter future and happier generations to come. Let us listen to Attila József, let us listen to the poet, and create order in our common matters! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It claimed the lives of millions of people and led to the annihilation of the Jews, as well as plunging Europe into the depths of savagery, economic devastation and moral decay. We should bow our heads in memory of this time and commemorate the victims of this war.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, even though there are certain key moments in our collective memory that allow us to join together in building a political community, each of the European nations remembers the 20th century in its own way. The reason for this is that our states and our peoples have experienced different historical and political events. There is, however, one thing that unites us, as we all remember the victims claimed by the war and the struggle for freedom and democracy. It is the memory of these things that provides a basis for our common European identity. Today we are commemorating the victims of the Nazi terror in the countries occupied by the Third Reich. We are also honouring the victims of the Holocaust, or in other words the genocide committed against the Jews in Europe during the Second World War, which was a crime that has no parallel in human history. We are commemorating the victory of the Allied nations over the Third Reich, and in particular the part played by the United States of America in liberating Europe. We are remembering all the soldiers who died in order to rid the world of Nazism, and the 14 million soldiers who fought in the Red Army. We are commemorating the losses suffered by all sides in the Second World War, as well as those who fell victim to Stalin during the war. The massacre of around 22 000 Polish citizens and prisoners of war in Katyn, and in other camps and prisons in the Soviet Union in the spring of 1940, has become a symbol of the latter. We are paying homage to those who fought for freedom, democracy and human rights, and we are particularly remembering the heroic resistance movement, which fought against fascism and occupation in the various countries. The ideals of this movement, and the willingness of its members to sacrifice themselves in a one-sided war, are now a true legacy to us, as well as something of which we can all be proud and a fine example for Europe’s young people.</p>
<p class="contents">Today I should like to commemorate the resistance movement in the Warsaw ghetto, and those who belonged to the Jewish Military Organisation and who took up arms on 19 April 1943 to defend the Jewish ghetto that had been created in Warsaw by the occupying powers. Although in military terms they had no chance of winning, fighting as they did in the midst of the war and in the heart of a Europe ruled by the Nazis, their fight did in fact have a deeper meaning. Nowadays we regard their heroism as the most powerful testimony to human spirit ever seen, and one of the moral foundations of the Europe that we have built. To echo the sentiments found in a manifesto of the Jewish Military Organisation, we are fighting for your and our freedom, and for your and our human, social and national honour and dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we are remembering that the end of the war did not bring true liberation, independence and democracy to all the nations of Europe. The end of the war meant new forms of oppression and a lack of sovereignty and democracy for Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic states. It also meant violations of fundamental human rights under the totalitarian <span class="italic">status quo</span> that was imposed on this part of Europe by the Soviet Union, the loss of independence for Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, and their incorporation into the Soviet Union. Throughout the 20th century, the Socialists, the Social Democrats and the Democratic Left adopted a stance of opposition to all forms of dictatorship and to all non-democratic regimes. We are a political movement that has always been on the side of democracy and human rights, whether in the Baltic states, in Central and Eastern Europe or in the countries of Southern Europe in which dictators came to power after the Second World War, namely Portugal, Spain and Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking today in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, on ground that bears the scars of wars and the downfall of Europe. Our forefathers met on this ground as soldiers on opposing sides. We now meet each other as citizens and as MEPs representing a uniting Europe. Since the 1950s, European integration and the construction of a European Community have been our response to the war. The conflicts between Europe’s nations were overcome in the process of setting up the European institutions, and this continues to be the case today. The European Union we have today is the product of three major democratic processes, namely the defeat of fascism in the war, the fall of the dictatorships in Southern Europe in the late 1970s and the victory of democracy in Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic states.</p>
<p class="contents">A model of international order is being established in Europe on the basis of peace and cooperation, and a community is being set up in accordance with the principle of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and human rights, including the rights of minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The various peoples that go to make up the European Union, which now has 25 Member States, have a variety of historical experiences behind them. Ratification of the Constitution for Europe will mean that a united Europe can be established, the goals of which are peace, justice and solidarity throughout the world. This Europe can also become a special area of human hope, to borrow the phrase used in the preamble to the Constitutional Treaty. Together we have travelled a long road, from a Europe overwhelmed by war, totalitarian regimes and human misery, to a democratic Europe in which free nations within the EU are jointly creating a European future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first of these is that the history of the events that occurred during the Second World War be generally acknowledged, and the second is that a common vision of European integration be brought about on the basis of this history.</p>
<p class="contents">The way in which people remember history can differ according to whether or not the end of the war amounted to genuine liberation for them. Poles remember a number of key dates that sealed the fate of the Second World War as a tragic event. The first of these is 1 September 1939, when Hitler attacked Poland. This date marked the beginning of a nightmarish time of occupation, repression and concentration camps, when the occupying forces did their best to annihilate the Polish nation and people. It was, however, also a time of heroic deeds by the underground state and society. Another date Poles remember is 17 September 1939. Although this date unfortunately has less resonance in Western Europe, we find it both distressing and highly significant, as it is the date when the Soviet Union attacked Poland. This attack took place following the conclusion of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between Hitler and Stalin, which provided for another partition of Poland. Other dates include 1943, when the crimes committed in Katyn in 1940 were uncovered, or in other words the slaughter of tens of thousands of Polish officers and officials on Stalin’s orders, merely because they served the Polish state, and 1943 and 1944, when two heroic uprisings took place. The first of these was Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, which ended in bloody defeat, or rather extermination, and the second was the Warsaw Uprising, which Soviet troops watched from the right bank of the Vistula without taking any action. The final date that Poles remember is 1945, as this is when the Yalta Conference took place. The latter led to the creation of the Iron Curtain, which divided Europe for 44 years, cutting off my country, Poland, from European democracy and integration. That is all I wish to say about how we remember history.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the matter of a common vision of European integration, I should like to highlight a fundamental point. What we remember are the crimes that were committed by systems, and the victims these systems claimed. These memories should not and must not under any circumstances divide nations and peoples. This is the message behind Solidarity, the Polish social movement which triggered the liberation of Eastern Europe and which is also celebrating its 25th anniversary this year. This movement was the driving force behind the resumption of relations between the two parts of Europe that had been divided by the decisions made in Yalta. Taking my cue from it, I should like to state quite categorically that solidarity must be the guiding principle of our common future.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish by calling upon all Members to vote in favour of this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this reason, I cannot vote for Mr Brok’s resolution. A number of its assertions would create a legal basis for the violation of human rights and lead to huge injustices in my country, Latvia, as well as in neighbouring Estonia.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution states that the countries of Eastern Europe were under Soviet occupation for many decades. In the case of Latvia and Estonia, such an approach would have dangerous consequences for the more than half a million people who settled there during those decades. Mr Toomas Ilves from Estonia recently explained in the <span class="italic">Baltic Times</span> what this assertion would mean: ‘hence, the protection of minorities in the Baltic states will become senseless’. Moreover, two weeks ago, the Latvian Parliament approved further consideration of the declaration asking the European Parliament for exemption from the obligation to accept foreign citizens and their descendants who were moved to Latvia during the time of occupation.</p>
<p class="contents">My father was a naval officer in the Soviet army and participated in the defeat of Hitler’s army and of his local allies, Arājs, Cukurs and others, responsible for the liquidation of 80 000 Latvian Jews, including my father’s grandparents. Moreover, my father was thrown out of the army, in accordance with Stalin’s orders, for being Jewish. I will never accept that my father was an occupier, nor will I ever agree that my mother, a Russian Orthodox, who came to Riga from St Petersburg in 1950, should be subject to repatriation, as the draft Latvian declaration says. The assertion made in this European Parliament resolution will encourage Latvian law-makers to accept this declaration in the very near future. I do not want the Baltic states to become a second Balkans. We parliamentarians are fully responsible for the words we are saying. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On that day, Europe liberated itself from the spectre of authoritarianism, and that date also heralded the beginning of a Europe aspiring towards peace and social justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe was liberated by the resistance of men and women, partisans who built the institutional and moral foundations of this Europe. Europe was liberated by those who fought at Stalingrad; it was liberated by American and Canadian Allied troops, and equally by the Soviet army. That date can be regarded as the foundation stone upon which a new Europe was built.</p>
<p class="contents">That page of history is, unfortunately, all too often subjected to revisionist plunder and attacks, and even this debate is marred by an unmistakeable revisionist impetus. By indistinctly muddling 8 May 1945 with the crimes of Stalinism, we do a disservice to the commemoration of the Liberation of Europe. I should like to be clear on that point: in terms of political beliefs, personal data and cultural development,<span class="bold"> </span>myself and my group have no problem in firmly condemning the horrors of Stalinism; however, in this debate, people are seeking to surreptitiously bring to life the theories of Nolte, which equate Nazism with Communism, and not only with Stalinism.</p>
<p class="contents">In truth, the values of peace and social justice were, in that short century, threatened not only by Stalinism, but equally by colonialism, by imperialism, and by neo-liberalism: from Algeria to Vietnam, from the shelling of Belgrade to the massacres of Sabra and Shatila, up to the events of 11 September 1973 in Santiago del Chile.</p>
<p class="contents">We must do right by history: the memory of the past is a crucial gift in enabling us to contend with the future and to build the horizons of this Europe. There is only one way to strengthen Europe: we must ban the term war from our vocabulary. Europe must play an active role in building a peaceful world, stretching from Iraq to Afghanistan, and to Palestine. To conclude, Europe has to be more courageous and authoritative; we must reverse the famous Latin saying and forcefully assert <span class="italic">si vis pacem para pacem, </span>or ‘if you want peace, prepare for peace’.

They certainly cannot be economic, because we do not live in a world of huge trade tariffs and certainly there is now a global economy. They certainly cannot be democratic, because this Parliament is the only democratic element within the European Union and it is almost as good as useless.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if there were one argument for the European Union that would make me change my mind, it would be the argument that the European Union would give us, and would guarantee, peace. However, all of this is based on a series of false assumptions. It was not democratic nation-states that caused the First and Second World Wars. If you look back through history, you find that mature democracies do not go to war with each other.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also wrong and quite false to claim that the EU has kept the peace in Europe for the last 50 years. What war has it stopped? Was Portugal going to fight Italy in the mid-1970s? What possible war could it have stopped? If there has been a guarantor of peace over the last 50 years, surely it must be NATO, an example of intergovernmental cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">President Borrell goes on about the reunification of Europe. I wonder sometimes what he is even talking about. The important thing is: will the EU guarantee peace? Does federation guarantee peace? It did not in Yugoslavia or in the USSR and it did not in the United States of America, which, you remember, had one of the bitterest and bloodiest civil wars in the history of mankind. If we go on selling this project to the peoples of Europe on a lie, we are more likely than not to stoke up and cause bitter resentments and extreme nationalism. What we must do is tell the peoples of Europe the truth about our ambitions and give them free and fair referendums, otherwise we are heading for disaster. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Europe, dialogue has replaced wars, and yet reconciliation, deep understanding of historical truth and the mutual intertwining of the interests of states and politicians has still not been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, at this time we commemorate together one of humanity’s greatest victories over Nazi ideology. We remember the victims of fascism and bow our heads in memory of the combatants who died. Yes, it is satisfying that the whole political spectrum of the European Parliament has been able to unite on the resolution about the end of the Second World War and for the first time is simultaneously assessing and condemning the crimes of both the Nazi and the Communist regimes. Ladies and gentlemen, our joint declaration stated unambiguously that there can be no reconciliation without historical truth; that only a strong Europe can provide solutions on how to overcome the legacy of the past, at the foundation of which lies injustice and the 50-year long social, political and economic degradation of nations that were kept imprisoned. Unfortunately, our declaration did not say everything. Neither is what Jean-Claude Juncker said in Moscow yesterday acceptable. He said that the resolution of these problems is a question for future generations. Only the powerful call things by their true names. A few days ago in Riga, George Bush said, quite unmistakably: ‘‘the Yalta agreement followed in the unjust tradition of Munich and the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Once again, when powerful governments negotiated, the freedom of small nations was somehow expendable. Yet this attempt to sacrifice freedom for the sake of stability left a continent divided and unstable.’ The real cold war in Europe that lasted for nearly 50 years confirms what he said. Everyone in the European Parliament knows that NATO, the North-Atlantic union, was created to promote European security in the climate of fear of an invasion by the totalitarian, cynical and aggressive Soviet regime. This confirms the fact that for the West, following the Second World War, there was no trust in an ally such as Stalin. The evil empire created by Stalin was unacceptable, even though before then the victory over Nazi ideology had been jointly celebrated.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, when we are thinking about Europe’s future, what I have just said should be borne closely in mind. Sixty years have passed since the Second World War, and Europe together with its allies is shaping its future. Unfortunately, Russia, inheritor of the mantle of the USSR, is still making statements denying its influence over the countries of eastern Europe, and the occupation of my country, Latvia, and of Lithuania and Estonia. This disowning of historical truth, the deliberate upholding of the crimes of the Communist regime, is humiliating. It amounts to contempt for the victims and casualties of the regime, yet it is happening today. Russia is trying to hold on to opportunities to manipulate public opinion worldwide. Russia is keeping the problem of non-citizens in Latvia in the public eye and exaggerating it, but at the same time it is continuing to violate the human rights of victims and casualties of the totalitarian Soviet regime, and their immediate families, by denying their suffering and losses. Such an attitude by Russia does nothing to foster reconciliation between Russia and the states of eastern Europe and the Baltic which have regained their freedom.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jana Bobošíková (NI).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(CS)</span> Ladies and gentlemen, the history of the EU nations has very definitely not been an easy one. It has seen these nations fight against each other, betray each other and commit atrocities against each other. It was Europeans who came up with the idea of the supremacy of the Aryan race, the Final Solution for other races and the gas chambers. What is more, the rest of Europe initially sat back and did nothing while this was going on.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret to say that a line has still not been drawn under this period. Sixty years after the end of the Second World War, there are Members of this House who refuse to vote in favour of resolutions condemning the Holocaust, who persistently put the suffering of the victims of the Second World War on a par with that of its architects, and who distort the past and fail to differentiate properly between the causes and the effects of the most horrendous conflict of all time.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent speeches by a number of leading representatives of the Member States and of the European institutions to mark the 60th anniversary of the end of the war have revealed that they are infatuated with the idea that our golden age of prosperity and peace is a direct result of the European Union’s history. For the sake of future generations, we should not forget that this is very far from being the case. Peace in Europe can just as well be attributed to the presence of American troops on European soil, and prosperity can be explained by economic growth in Asia and the United States and the increase in global trade. As far as freedom is concerned, revolutions took place in a number of European countries, including my own, without any help from Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a matter of some concern to me that the democracy and prosperity we have succeeded in achieving are now under threat. Europe’s potential to act as a global player will be reduced by the incomprehensible and unjust European Constitution, which benefits certain countries at the expense of others. The distance that exists between politicians and the real world is a further factor jeopardising Europe’s future, as the citizens of the individual Member States understand ever less of the language spoken by the European institutions and their representatives. Where will Europe end up if its public does not understand its leaders? Will it become easy prey for the worst kind of populism, simply because no one can understand it?</p>
<p class="contents">It is my firm belief that no media campaign will ever succeed in boosting public confidence in the idea of a common Europe. The only way this can be done is by implementing practical and easy-to-understand measures that provide solutions to real problems. The inability of European leaders to promote growth and the cowardly, Euronationalist approach to economic matters are a far from adequate response to the hard facts of the global economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I represent the citizens of a country that suffered as a result of the Iron Curtain, which fell 15 years ago. Today, however, we are seeing attempts to build new ‘curtains’ around Europe to keep out the United States, Chinese textiles, a cheap workforce and many asylum seekers. Shutting ourselves off from the world will not solve the problems that Europe is facing.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the lack of public interest and the economic slowdown, it is becoming apparent that the way in which the European Union is currently governed will be unsustainable if Europe is to be competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that EU leaders should have the courage to admit to themselves and to the public that the revitalised Lisbon Strategy and the unjust European Constitution are nothing but a dead end, and will not result in more justice, freedom or prosperity. The only correct response to the current state of the global economy and global politics is to be open, to limit our interference in economic matters, to lower taxes, to enable the nation states to operate more flexibly and to coordinate matters at EU level in a sensible fashion, and only in instances where it proves necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Far from being naïve, this dreadful falsification of history sets out to meet some very specific objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim is to wipe out the key contribution made by the Soviet Union and its people’s glorious struggle to destroy the brutal killing machine of the Nazi Fascist armies and regimes, along with its decisive role in reining in imperialist aggression during the post-war period.</p>
<p class="contents">This motion for a resolution seeks to silence and defame the glorious and heroic role played by the communists in the anti-fascist struggle.</p>
<p class="contents">It seeks to airbrush the Nazi horror, its millions of deaths in concentration camps, the millions of men, women and children killed, and the systematic destruction of entire countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It seeks to gloss over the fact that Hitler’s rise to power was aided by German capital and by the complicity of the large capitalist interests, which fed the hope, right until the end, that the Nazi war machine would destroy the main enemy, the Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It seeks, just like 60 years ago, to defend the indefensible, namely imperialist and militarist aggressiveness and the aggression perpetrated against the sovereignty of peoples.</p>
