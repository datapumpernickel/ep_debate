<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, first of all, I feel in many respects that I should be taking second place to the honourable Member, Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, in discussing this subject, because he has played such an important role in achieving what we are discussing today. He is in a sense - if this is not regarded as blasphemous - the John the Baptist for this agreement. We have both had the pleasure in the past of addressing conferences on this subject, speaking on this subject in Santiago and elsewhere. It is extremely important to recognise the role that he and other Members have played in this important and happy occasion.</p>
<p class="contents">We are considering today a very important proposal on the adoption of the Association Agreement that we signed with Chile in November last year. This agreement is not only crucial for European Union-Chile relations, it is also extremely important in the context of Latin America as a whole. Indeed, the agreement is a very tangible expression of the European Union’s willingness to establish a strategic partnership with that continent, despite its present economic problems and its political turbulence and the violence which some countries in the region are still suffering, not least from terrorism - a subject about which the honourable Member has understandably expressed considerable concern. We both come from countries that have suffered from mindless and vicious terrorism in the past and our sympathies go out to those countries, like Colombia, that are suffering from terrorist madness today.</p>
<p class="contents">It is more important than ever for us to send a positive signal of support to the region - from the European Union to Latin America.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has played an active and supportive role throughout the negotiation of this agreement. In November 2001, Parliament adopted a resolution inviting the Commission to conclude the negotiations of the EU-Chile Agreement at the second EU and Latin America and Caribbean Summit in Madrid in May 2002. I am pleased to note that the Commission met this objective and managed to negotiate a very ambitious agreement. We worked very closely with the Spanish presidency in the first semester of last year to achieve this, and it was a very important step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">This association agreement is firstly a political agreement – indeed it is important for the European Union to establish privileged links with those countries like Chile that share common values and objectives. Chile, as we know, is a constructive player on the international stage and endorses the same values and policies that we defend in the European Union. For example, it is not surprising that last year Chile ratified the Kyoto Protocol. There are many other examples. We certainly want to deepen the political dialogue with Chile and to define converging positions on issues of common interest.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that Chile is keen on closer political relations with the European Union. This is shown in the almost unanimous support that the Chilean Congress gave to the agreement in January, less than two months after the agreement was signed in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union-Chile Agreement is also a comprehensive free trade agreement which, according to the very important sustainable impact assessment study carried out by the Commission, should generate additional growth for Chile’s GDP of about 0.5% and which should contribute to raising the standard of living of the Chilean people. The European Union has been for a long time Chile’s first trade partner; this agreement should further consolidate and increase our trade relations. Let me point out as an example that after only two years of implementation, the EU-Mexico Agreement - which in many respects set the pattern for the EU-Chile Agreement - has already led to an increase of 28% in bilateral trade.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement should allow us to overcome obstacles and to build an operating framework for entrepreneurs which allows more predictability, confidence and bigger trade flows. Not only did Chile and the European Union agree to liberalise gradually over 97% of our bilateral trade in goods, but we also agreed on a whole set of rules to facilitate trade, on the establishment of a free trade area in services, on the liberalisation of investment and on the reciprocal opening of government procurement markets. The bulk of the trade chapter entered into force on 1 February; I trust that entrepreneurs and consumers on both sides will soon reap the benefits of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the EU-Chile partnership will extend well beyond politics and trade: it will intensify our cooperation in a number of areas and stimulate social, economic and environmental development. The cooperation strategy devised jointly for the period 2000-2006 with the Chilean authorities may need to be adapted so as to take into account rather better the recommendations of the sustainable impact assessment study and to accompany the implementation of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say a final word about the institutional framework of this association agreement. The agreement singles out the need for an increased involvement of civil society - this should materialise through regular meetings of representatives of Chilean and European civil societies so as to allow an exchange of views on the implementation of the different parts of the agreement. I would also like to highlight the establishment in the agreement of an Association Parliamentary Committee, which will be a discussion forum for Members of the European Parliament and Members of the Chilean Congress. I hope that honourable Members of this Parliament will participate actively in this committee. Judging by the enthusiasm with which they have pressed us to make this agreement, that should be no problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I would like to thank Parliament for the leadership it has shown in this issue. I am sure the beneficiaries will be not only the people of the European Union and Chile but also the overall relationship with such an important and dynamic continent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to thank the political groups in this House for their cooperation in the production of this report, which has been unanimously approved by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and I would like to stress this cooperation since it does not happen very often.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would congratulate the Commission on its impeccable negotiation of this association agreement with Chile – as Commissioner Patten has pointed out – taking up the suggestions of the European Parliament in relation to the timetable and overcoming the difficulties caused by the negotiation guidelines. Commissioner Patten asked us to trust in his judgment in order to overcome the problems relating to the timetable and he has been proved right. The result, Mr President, is that we have the most innovative, ambitious and global agreement the European Union has ever concluded with a third country which is not a candidate for accession. An agreement which has been described by the Commission – correctly I believe – as an agreement for the twenty-first century, a fourth generation plus agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we must be pleased that this agreement has been concluded with a country such as Chile, since in a way this agreement is a recognition of the great civil maturity of the citizens of that country and their decisive desire for openness and trade.</p>
<p class="contents">As Commissioner Patten said to us a moment ago, this agreement also represents a message of hope to a region which is currently experiencing a difficult situation: instability in Venezuela, crisis in Argentina, the hopes and challenges arising from the election of President Lula da Silva in Brazil, poverty on the subcontinent and the phenomenon of violence in Colombia.</p>
<p class="contents">I would particularly express my gratitude for the words of Mr Patten, who, on behalf of the European Parliament, is also going to communicate a message of solidarity to the Colombian authorities in relation to the attack which killed many people in Bogotá last weekend.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement – as the Commissioner quite rightly pointed out – takes a similar approach to the Association Agreement with Mexico which has lead to an increase in commercial transactions since its entry into force and which is an agreement which goes much further than these requirements, since it provides for the liberalisation of 100% of transactions, many going much further than the forecasts established in the negotiations of the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight an aspect which I believe to be particularly important, and that is that Chile has concluded this association agreement with the European Union before concluding its agreement with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also stress that the Commission has stated that this agreement goes beyond mere commercial thinking, since association agreements try to establish a strategic partnership based on the principles and rights contained in the democratic clause for both parties.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement is very rich in terms of commercial liberalisation. It involves almost 100% of products, not just agricultural products, but products of every type, it establishes stipulations relating to agreements and technical clauses, it lays down the greatest degree of liberalisation ever to have been created in an agreement on the services sector and also establishes, Mr President, the most generous treatment Chile has ever given to a third country, and, for the first time in negotiations with the European Union, it lays down accessibility for foreign investors in an agreement of this nature.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this agreement completes the network of agreements being negotiated at the moment. The only one remaining is that with Mercosur, and we are awaiting negotiation guidelines for agreements on political dialogue and cooperation with the Andean and Central American Community, which we hope – as Parliament has requested on many occasions – can become association agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way, Mr President, I believe we will be able to respond to the difficult situations being experienced by certain Latin American countries and create an extensive range of relations between our two regions which should culminate – and this is what Parliament wants – in the coming summit of Heads of State in Mexico, and we hope that these agreements can lead the way to a strategic and bi-regional partnership which will result in this global partnership we want to see.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore this agreement, Mr President, represents a geographical consolidation of the existing links between both regions, which are destined to be political, commercial and strategic partners, and increases the tools at our disposal for responding to the challenges and uncertainties we are faced with in this globalised world.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank all the political groups for their positive and constructive cooperation in the issuing of this favourable opinion on the association agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would like to, and must, congratulate Mr Salafranca on the work he has done in order to realise this work and the Commission on the efforts and guidance it has contributed to the conclusion of this Agreement, which began as soon as Chile had recovered its rights and freedoms, which would not have been possible without the political vision and tenacity of the Chilean leaders, from President Elwin to the current President, President Lagos, and which reflects the will of Chile and of the European Union and its Member States to establish privileged relations in the political, commercial and cooperation fields which the agreement encompasses and to strengthen links, as a result of the shared values which unite them.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the framework of the liberalisation of the markets, the benefits in terms of economic growth and sustainable development which may result from reciprocal economic and trade relations is unquestionable, as are the benefits of a political dialogue aimed at promoting democracy and the formulation of common responses to the great challenges of this millennium. That is why I am convinced that this agreement – which my group will support resoundingly – is a very positive step not only for relations between the European Union and Chile, but also for the economic and social well-being of the Chilean people in their democratic journey, which has so far been recovered in such an exemplary fashion, and which must serve, and in reality does serve, as an example to Latin America during these difficult times for some of its countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There were reasons for this Agreement's problem-free progress through the committee and the unanimous support it received in it, for we worked together very well, not only on this Agreement but generally, and Chile's concerns have found a worthy rapporteur in the person of Mr Salafranca.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been mentioned, this is an Agreement with a large number of objectives, a complete Agreement intended to cover a great deal and to bring us closer together. The Commissioner has stated that, even while the Agreement was being worked out, bilateral trade increased by 28%, and, whilst I believe that there is room for further increases and greater cooperation, I would like to point out that the actual reason Chile deserves this special new Agreement is that it currently represents an atoll of stability in Latin America, which is so turbulent economically, politically and in other ways. It is in our interests to maintain this stability and help to make it even more secure.</p>
<p class="contents">My principal interest is in the political dimension, and there are two points I would like to address at this point. The first, the ratification of the treaty on the International Criminal Court, initially appeared to be something of a problem but has been resolved by cooperation with the Chilean embassy in Brussels and by the government's assurances. We attach great importance to Chile's ratification of this treaty. We are aware of the constitutional difficulties that exist at present, but, having satisfied ourselves that the government is working on it, we have hope of it being ratified soon.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is that Chile is currently a member of the Security Council. In these very difficult times, it will be very important that Chile should, in consultation and coordination with the relevant Member States of the European Union, help to achieve a peaceful solution to the present conflict. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is a very broad agreement which will undoubtedly increase commercial transactions between the European Union and Chile and this is positive at a time when many countries in Latin America are in a particularly difficult situation.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be stressed that the total of tariffs on imports from Chile, relating to industrial products, will be restricted in 2006 and that in the agricultural field this will take place in 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement also offers great possibilities in the fields of services and financial services, as well as on all aspects relating to investments. It is also positive that it includes a protocol on fishing enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">I have read the report of the International Human Rights Federation on the indigenous populations in Chile. These represent 4.4 % of the total population, or 13%, depending on the source of statistics.</p>
<p class="contents">Of these populations, the Mapuche people, in percentage terms, are the most significant. The problems of the indigenous population relate to forest exploitation and the construction of large hydro-electric projects.</p>
<p class="contents">We must remember that these problems were exacerbated enormously during the dictatorship of Pinochet. We are glad that the report contains explicit references to the protection of human rights and specifically mentions the rights of indigenous minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that this Agreement will create greater transparency and mutual understanding, and that it will also recognise the rights of the indigenous peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, while on the subject of Chile, as a citizen of Catalonia, I must acknowledge Chile’s reception in former times of Catalan exiles fleeing the Franco dictatorship. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such intense dialogue should, of course, be encouraged with the greatest possible number of third countries in order to support economic development and emphasise the ecological values and democratic clauses of the European Union. Furthermore, we feel this far-reaching agreement has taken place too quickly, in particular given the impact assessment unveiled at the same time. It is a shame that the impact assessment did not really act as a basis for this association agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union negotiations, which are very strong with regard to trade and, in our opinion, excessive with regard to liberalisation, should now also be based, in a balanced manner, around human rights and the environment. Following Chile’s dark history, all our vigilance should be focused on political rights, in particular the fate of the Mapuche Indians.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to fisheries, the Union’s interests for Chile should be balanced and only have meaning and a future within the perspective of development and sustainable management of fisheries resources. Let us spare the Chilean fishermen the overexploitation of their resources that has destroyed our own European marine resources. In particular, let us spare Chile from being relegated to the role of ersatz fishmonger for our Community ports.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we think the scope of this agreement should have given rise to a prior discussion of the same magnitude. This agreement, which aspires to be a model for the twenty-first century, is being dealt with too cursorily. Although the agreement is interesting because it integrates the human rights dimension and consultation of civil society, it nevertheless deserved a more extensive debate on its possible impact, both positive and negative. We submitted an oral question in this regard to allow a debate worthy of the agreement, but the proposal was dismissed.</p>
<p class="contents">Far from constituting barriers to the implementation of the agreement under consideration, these observations – and we would emphasise this – are an attempt to increase its relevance and durability. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would like this twenty-first century agreement to become a beacon for a new kind of trade based on fair trade, respect for the environment and human rights.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lang (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, according to the Commission, the new Association Agreement between Chile and the European Union is the most ambitious, most innovative, most far-reaching agreement ever negotiated with a non-candidate country. Classed as a fourth-generation agreement, it should even, we are told, constitute a model for future association agreements with the other Latin American countries.</p>
<p class="contents">These grandiose perspectives are, however, more cause for concern than for celebration. In the economic domain, the agreement provides for the total removal of customs borders, but, contrary to what free-trade extremists claim, borders are not a barrier to trade. Quite the opposite. They play a role similar to locks in a waterways system, allowing regularisation between countries with differing standards of living. Many of our industries have already paid the cost of customs disarmament. The World Trade Organisation agreements, accepted by Brussels, thus forced them to delocalise production in order to counter competition. Enlargement to the East, which has been decided in haste, will aggravate this phenomenon. The fourth-generation agreement extended to all of Latin America will make millions more men and women unemployed. As for our last remaining farmers, there is little chance that those who survive enlargement to the East will survive the process of opening up to the West, because the agreement stipulates almost total liberalisation of agricultural imports over the next ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">In the political domain, it is common to wax lyrical about the creation of a transatlantic Euro-Latin-American assembly. Having built a bureaucratic super-State in Brussels, having swallowed up an Eastern Europe that has only just escaped the Soviet empire, the Euro-federalists are still not satisfied. When and where will they stop? In a kind of political gluttony, they want to integrate into their economic plans not only Turkey and Asia minor but the whole of Latin America as well. Of course, there is still natural solidarity between our nations and those of Latin America. Just as we want a Europe of free nations, however, rather than an antinational, antisocial Europe, we want the nations of Europe to base their cooperation with the nations of Latin America on the principle of national sovereignty and economic realism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Living standards have gone up, Chile's growth rate is far higher than that of other Latin American countries, and I just hope that this policy catches on in them as well.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would like to say to Commissioner Patten is that we are already engaged in active cooperation with members of Chile's parliament. We had a meeting with them here in Strasbourg as long ago as the autumn – even before the Agreement was ratified – and had, surprisingly enough, an extraordinarily lively debate with the Chilean Congress and House of Deputies. The problem we now have is not with the treaty. The treaty is excellent, and I also wish to congratulate Mr Salafranca on his superlative report. There is a treaty, but it must not be allowed to remain an empty form of words. It has to be filled out – with something real. Let me, by the way, remind you of the fact that we also have a scientific agreement with Chile. If that is not to remain a mere formality, it too has to be filled out, and that is what I want to urge us to do. Money is needed if that is to be done, but money is not the most important thing. If that is to be done, the main thing we will need is will, the will of the European institutions, but also the will of enterprises and organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">What I hope at the end of the day is that this Agreement, whose objective is also very strongly political, will contribute to Latin America growing together, will contribute to stronger relationships between Europe and Latin America, and, above all, that cooperation with Chile will help to overcome the conflicts in certain Latin American countries, some of which conflicts – in Colombia, for example – are raging openly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to be able to add my voice to this almost unanimous choir, but I must admit to being perplexed.</p>
<p class="contents">The real question, the only one that deserves to be asked, is this: thanks to this agreement, will the people of this State be less poor, better educated and better cared for in the future? Will they be able to surf the Internet or travel if they wish to? I am not sure. There is one people, in any case, that shares my doubts, and that is the Mapuche people. First of all, the Chilean Government has not yet ratified International Labour Organisation Convention 169 on indigenous peoples. Many arbitrary acts of violence committed by the police against the indigenous communities go unpunished. Next, this agreement states that one of the principles on which it is based is sustainable development, while the Mapuche territory is experiencing blind exploitation of its natural resources: deforestation and construction of dams that flood the ancestral soil, as a result of national hydrological plans. Lastly, I am not convinced that the wholesale liberalism of the agreement allows for harmonious development of the economies of this State. Economic and monetary dependency might lead to the ‘Argentinisation’ of the country. Those are the risks and those are my doubts. I shall abstain from voting on this agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The effect of this fisheries protocol is that EU-subsidised companies will now be allowed to invest in Chile with up to 100% ownership rights. It will allow them direct access to Chilean fish stocks. There are several aspects of concern for Chile's coastal communities: unfair competition with the local artisanal sector and the unknown impact on marine resources, for example. We have only to look at the Argentinean case.</p>
<p class="contents">EU companies will be able to buy up Chilean fish quotas on fully exploited fish stocks; they will also have free access rights to Chile's under-exploited fisheries resources. The opportunities provided by this protocol for EU fisheries companies, combined with the process of privatisation in Chilean fisheries, threaten the sustainability of the artisanal fisheries sector. The protocol will be used to transfer part of the EU's overcapacity to Chilean waters.</p>
<p class="contents">I am fed up with this irresponsible and exploitative approach to the problems of overcapacity of EU vessels. Is it any coincidence that this protocol was attached during the Spanish presidency and forced through? It seems to have been used as a bargaining chip, and it has taken no account of a sector that employs more than 60 000 fisherman and provides for some 400 000 jobs in the industry in that area.</p>
<p class="contents">The artisanal fisheries contribute over 90% of fish consumed locally and provide 25% of export earnings for the fisheries market. So it is unacceptable that this aspect has not been properly assessed and taken into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would associate myself entirely with Mr Linkohr's remarks in response to Mr Lang, who may be living on the right planet, but it is certainly a different planet to the one I live on. Speaking for the bureaucratic superstate, I should like to respond firstly to Mr Sakellariou on the important point which he raised about the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p class="contents">He will know that Chile participated actively in the preparatory work on the Statute of the International Criminal Court. On 22 January last year the Chilean Chamber of Deputies approved the text with a large majority, but the Senate asked for the opinion of the Constitutional Court in Chile. That court indicated that it was necessary to modify the Chilean constitution before approving the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Since modifying the constitution is a lengthy procedure, as it requires a two-thirds majority in Congress, the Treaty cannot yet be ratified. However, ratification of the Treaty remains high on the political agenda of the Chilean Government, since it is entirely consistent with its external policy of promotion of respect for human rights. If there is one country which should understand the arguments for the International Criminal Court, as the honourable Member and I would agree, it is Chile.</p>
<p class="contents">He also said that he hoped that as a member of the Security Council the Chilean Government would try to coordinate its response to the crisis in Iraq with European Member States. I hope he does not regard it as <span class="italic">lèse-majesté</span> on my part to say that I hope the Member States of the European Union will try to coordinate their policy in the Security Council in dealing with this terrible crisis in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">There is Article 19 of the Treaty and there is the Maastricht Treaty, but perhaps I should not be drawn down these boulevards. It is interesting that in the Convention we are discussing how much further we can go in coordinating a common foreign and security policy when we are not even using and implementing the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty. In any case, I am using what he said about Chile merely as a trigger to fire off some of my thoughts on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Several honourable Members raised the question of indigenous peoples, which is always a particularly important issue on these occasions. Difficult as these issues are, the Chilean Government is trying to handle them in a sensitive and democratic way. They have set up a public agency to try to handle some of these challenges. They have taken at least 16 concrete measures to help deal with some of the problems, of which Members have been informed.</p>
<p class="contents">My view is that we can help with the efforts that the Chilean Government is already taking through, for example, co-operation projects that are paid for by the funds voted by this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of fisheries – and I realise what a controversial issue this can be – I should like to remind Members who have spoken that the association agreement does not include a fisheries agreement, although we would be interested in concluding one. There is the protocol, which has been referred to. Community fishing companies will be allowed to own up to 100% of Chilean fishing companies. However, that is under exactly the same conditions as Chilean investors. That implies that they will have to respect, for example, the catch quotas defined in Chilean laws. There is an elaborate regulatory framework in Chile to address the issue of stock depletion since a serious decline in catch levels of certain species, mostly due to over-fishing, was registered toward the end of the 1990s. It is not right to say that the implementation of the agreement will lead to over-exploitation of fishing resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The current dynamism of the artisanal fishing sector in Chile is something all of us should recognise, and it needs to be underlined in debating these matters. This sector is the main supplier of seafood products to the domestic fresh fish market. It currently provides 25% of export income from fisheries products. A significant increase in the artisanal fishing sector has been recorded over the past years, and the interests of the sector have been preserved in the recently adopted fisheries law. If there is to be a loss of artisanal fishing employment in the long term – and this may well happen since artisanal fishing is a highly labour intensive, but not capital intensive business – it would probably occur with or without the agreement we are discussing today.</p>
<p class="contents">Without any reservation whatsoever, I commend this agreement to the Chamber. I am sure that the Vice-President of the Commission would also warmly endorse all that we are trying to achieve with this important agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I wish to thank Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra and his colleagues, Mr Linkohr and others, who have taken such an active interest in this matter. This is a model of this sort of agreement. It is the sort of agreement that will not impoverish the world, that will not bring people the 'joys' of North Korean economics – which some people endorse – but that should make the world a more prosperous place, that should ensure that we better protect our environment and that we have greater political stability than would otherwise be the case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
