<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martens (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Article 3 of the Treaty stipulates that the European Community wishes to eliminate all inequality and promote equality between men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1995 in a resolution, the Council specified gender equality as the foundation for development cooperation. Also in 1995, a ten-point action programme was adopted at the International Women’s Conference in Peking to promote gender equality. This action programme was signed by all the countries attending the conference.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the situation still leaves a great deal to be desired, certainly in the area of development cooperation. There is a lack not only of projects for women but also, and above all, of projects that are implemented in consultation with women.</p>
<p class="contents">During the previous part-session, we adopted the very controversial Izquierdo Rojo report on women and fundamentalism. This report was approved unanimously in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities. The problem in this field is obvious to everyone. We are also largely agreed on the directions which the solutions should take. Development cooperation is still too much a matter that involves men only.</p>
<p class="contents">Seventy percent of the approximately one and a half billion people who live below the poverty line are women. This means that they are greatly lacking in financial resources, but there is more to the matter in practice. In many cases, there is also a lack of fundamental human rights and social rights, such as the right to proper food, drinking water, education health care and work.</p>
<p class="contents">People who live below the poverty line often have too little control over, and access to, services, sources of aid and goods and are barely involved in the decision-making process. Interestingly, there are increasing indications that there is a link between poverty and gender inequality. Countries which struggle with a high level of gender inequality, such as Sierra Leone, Niger, Burkina Faso or Mali, also suffer the highest levels of poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">In countries where there is less gender inequality, there is also less poverty. Moreover, it appears that development projects, for example in the area of health care, literacy or agriculture, are more successful if women are also involved. Investing in girls seems to result in lower levels of child mortality and mortality among women, creates better food safety and means an improvement in the fight against poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Not for nothing, therefore, is development policy based on the principle of sustainable, fair, human and social development based on participation. Human rights, democracy and the rule of law are inextricably linked to this, and this is why women should also be involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Council defined gender mainstreaming as a point of departure for development cooperation policy six years ago, disappointingly little has actually happened. This is why I am pleased with this Commission communication. The action programme can provide an additional boost to the implementation of gender equality in the EU’s development cooperation policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I can identify with the three main points which the Commission outlines, namely the analysis and integration of the gender aspect within the priority fields of Community development cooperation, the horizontal integration of the gender aspect in projects and programmes, and the development of an internal gender capacity in the European Community itself. These three points, and particularly the last one, are extremely important. For a change in mentality is also required in the bodies of the European Union itself. If the staff who are to assess, implement and evaluate the programmes do not take this sufficiently into account, how can the situation ever improve? It is necessary to train our own people, as it is to provide adequate financial support for the policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unfortunate and disappointing in my view that the Commission is once again opting for an economic approach and describing women mainly as a means of achieving economic growth. The fact that women are people who are entitled to quality of life in their own right and, as such, can, and should, be able to lay claim to civil rights, political rights and human rights, is still too much overlooked in my view.</p>
<p class="contents">The five-year action plan is there to implement the good intentions which the Commission formulates. Indeed, the intentions should not remain merely good intentions. This is why the plan also requires the further development of a work programme with clearly defined working methods, deadlines, financial resources and indicators.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the intention of deciding in favour of an interim evaluation, and I hope that the Commission will involve the European Parliament in this in good time. I should also like to note the importance of cooperation with non-governmental organisations and other related organisations at international level. These can often be of major significance.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Regulation in question lapses in 2003. It forms the legal basis for the budget line which promotes the integration of the gender issue in the development cooperation policy. In my report, I therefore call for a renewal of this Regulation, thus allowing the work that needs to be done in the field to be continued.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Avilés Perea (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, we have here the annual report, presented by the Commission, to analyse the progress made with regard to equal opportunities for men and women in the European Union in the year 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">We are pleased to see that the employment rate for women has risen, albeit only slightly, but we still notice that women’s jobs are, on the whole, part-time, unstable and offer less opportunity for promotion.</p>
<p class="contents">We have not been able to achieve equal pay for the same jobs. The differences are still very significant, and although we have made some progress in reconciling professional and family life, we have not been able to achieve greater task sharing within the family, which would allow women to dedicate themselves more professionally to their work.</p>
<p class="contents">When we consider that women need help, our thoughts turn to mothers, young women with small children, and we believe that we can resolve these problems by setting up crèches. Another very common phenomenon is that older people are now increasingly living with the rest of their family, people these same women have to care for, disabled people, perhaps, which means that housewives, these same women, have an increased workload. We do not on the whole take into account the fact that social assistance is also needed, such as day centres, that would make it easier for women to go to work.</p>
<p class="contents">We notice that women have not made great progress with regard to the society of the future, that is to say, new technologies or the information society. Only 20% of women participate in this sector and this is something that we should promote, making sure that they can have access to lifelong training in this area, since the jobs of the future will rely heavily on the society built around these new technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a very noticeable absence of women in managerial positions, in companies, associations, political parties and in public institutions. We repeatedly call for increased participation of women in these jobs, a better balance between men and women, but we still notice a difficulty in achieving the presence of women in decision-making posts. Therefore, we call for innovative measures and specific actions aimed at better representation for women in all areas of employment, in the professional field, with better task-sharing between men and women, and improved reconciliation between professional and family life.</p>
<p class="contents">We must monitor compliance with the Community objective of equality between men and women in programmes financed by European funds, pursuant to the Treaty, and to promote a greater participation of women in decision-making posts. These objectives will also be taken into account in the EU enlargement process, monitoring the incorporation of the Community acquis into the national legislations of candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Domestic violence and poor treatment and exploitation of women is still a very serious problem and an area in which we need to continue working in order to help victims and eradicate, where possible, the causes of these phenomena, such as poverty and insecurity.</p>
<p class="contents">As we can see, there is still much work to be done. There are still very few women working in managerial positions, little representation of women in the labour market and, most importantly, we are not yet at the stage where women get equal pay for the same work.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, therefore, that we need to call on the Commission and the institutions to closely monitor this situation in order to ensure that the objective of equality is realised as soon as possible.</p>

The first is the report on the European Commission's final report on equal opportunities for women and men in the European Union in 2000, a subject of prime importance to the quality of democracy in the European Union and of prime importance if we are to achieve the development objectives set in Lisbon. The second is the report on the action programme to include equal opportunities in cooperation with third countries. This is crucial to harmonious development throughout the world, even though we have been so slow to realise it; it is six years now since the Council first included the equality dimension in the Community's development policy and the action programme was published. To be perfectly honest, it was the situation of women in Afghanistan, which unfortunately came to light after the terrorist attack on September 11, which woke us up to the plight of women's rights in various parts of the globe.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the first report is concerned, which deals with matters closer to home, Mrs Avilés Perea points out – and I agree with her – that the report has improved this year in comparison with previous years and contains a more in-depth evaluation of the policies applied on equal opportunities. I too should like to point out that the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has expressed its dissatisfaction at the fact that the European Commission is unable to monitor the material application of Community policy on equal treatment for men and women. We need to find and apply ways of monitoring these policies. This is also immensely important to the new countries which will be joining us. As far as the Lisbon objective is concerned, there may have been an increase in the employment rate, but the Member States still need to continue and step up their efforts to set more specific objectives in their national action programmes if they are to have both more efficient policies and monitoring policies.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur that we need to voice our concern about the lack of job security, the lack of quality jobs, the poor career prospects open to women in Europe and the lack of infrastructures. We are not just talking about nurseries, we are talking about care for the elderly and the sick. The conference on people with disabilities organised by the Spanish Presidency has already stressed the immense importance of infrastructures for people with disabilities, both to allow them to retain their dignity and to relieve women of some of their responsibilities. I agree with the rapporteur that we need to step up efforts to compile gender-based statistics which reflect the real situation of women on the job market and in other sectors and to apply more efficient policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gröner (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, my heartfelt thanks are due today to Mrs Martens and Mrs Avilés Perea for their reports on the programme of action for mainstreaming gender equality in development cooperation and on the annual report for 2000. I think there are a number of parallels between them, and Social Democrat members can note with satisfaction that yet another building block has been added to implement the platform of the Beijing Conference on Women.</p>
<p class="contents">The framework strategy of gender mainstreaming is being implemented consistently. We are facing a thorough analysis of the problem and see here clear instructions as to how it is to be implemented on a regional and national basis. Gender awareness is in the meantime becoming accepted among some decision-makers, and we know that sustainable development must first begin with women. We also know that sustainable development cannot be had for free, and so it is appalling that the Budget allocation for gender-specific development cooperation, which was EUR 5 million as recently as 1998, was cut by 60% in 2001. How is a change in thinking to be brought about? Incidentally, I recall that the Member States had undertaken to utilise 0.7% of their gross national product for development aid. We are nowhere near approaching that. If we do not act without delay, the credibility of the so-called developed countries will be at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">I also ask the Commission what became of the ‘gender desk’ in development cooperation. How are we to improve reproductive health and family planning, improving access to contraception – which includes ensuring the prevention of HIV/Aids – and, moreover, get these things into rural areas, if we do not replenish Budget resources to a marked degree?</p>
<p class="contents">Political discussion may well have enabled us to rescue from the realm of taboo practices which demonstrate contempt for the personal value of women, such as genital mutilation, public floggings, stonings, violence and sexual abuse, to blow the whistle on them on the international stage and also combat them politically, but there is also a need for practical implementation. We need consistent annual reviews such as that in Mrs Avilés Perea's report, in order to be able to examine the facts. That is why my group supports both reports. We can do no other than back them up entirely and call on the Commission to make these noble objectives a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The methods required are, of course, completely different, however, and I should like to thank the two rapporteurs, precisely because it is clear from the reports that it is different initiatives that are required.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with the developing countries, I would highlight paragraphs 10, 11, 12 and 14 of the report which indicate, for example, the need to look more closely at religious, cultural and socio-economic traditions and the role they play in relation to women in the developing countries. It is all very well talking about ‘mainstreaming’, but this must not cause us to forget practical action programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the EU, I think that an article in today’s ‘<span class="italic">Guardian</span>’ has a headline that is very much to the point: ‘Women can have it all – with a little bit of help’. The background to the article is research in the United States showing that 42% of high-salaried women are childless. They simply start too late and are under the illusion that women can have it all. They cannot. That is something we cause them to believe. They cannot have both careers and family lives with children. The next headline therefore says: ‘A female-friendly state can make a significant investment in the future’. I believe it has to be said that, in a number of Western countries, we are labouring under an illusion concerning equality. Illusion it is, however, and illusion it remains, and we must not therefore imagine that we have obtained equality until men too begin to make demands about wanting to have it all. It is the subject of men’s demands that it is necessary to bring up now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is every reason to welcome the Commission’s programme of action for the mainstreaming of gender equality in Community development cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I have to state that it is remarkable and quite frustrating that it took six years from the Council’s making its decision to the Commission’s presenting its programme of action.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now important for the prioritised areas in the programme of action also to be coordinated with the objectives of the Community framework strategy<span class="italic"> </span>on gender equality, in which development is of course a recurring theme. Economic equality, equality on issues of employment and political representation, equal social benefits and the promotion of human rights relating specifically to women are important aspects of these objectives. In reality, the objectives concern the dignity of both women and men and, in actual fact, the very value of human life.</p>
<p class="contents">If these objectives are to be achieved in the developing countries too, there must be an undertaking to include issues of equality in all future programmes and documents concerning the country strategies, as well as in strategies for reducing poverty. It is also important that compliance with the equality aspects be required for funding from all budget headings within the field of development policy and not only from the HIV and AIDS budget heading, commendable though it is in itself, of course, that equality is required in the latter area.</p>
<p class="contents">As soon as possible, the Commission must also table a proposal on the work programme and specify the funding for, and rules governing, its implementation so that it can be implemented quickly. We know, as a result of countless studies, that democracy and development can only take place if women in the developing countries are fully involved. I therefore also support the proposal in paragraph 26 to the effect that, in a meeting with the joint parliamentary ACP-EU Assembly, the important issue be addressed of ensuring that the Cotonou Agreement is also complied with in this area. My group will support the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to agree with the other speakers who have highlighted a few specific points in these reports.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I think that they share common ground, and particularly when they demonstrate that the question of poverty, just like the question of violence, are gender-related questions wherever they arise in the world. We are all too used to this, and I have recently heard so much debate on violence in my country, but no one has pointed out that violence is not meted out in the same way by men and by women and on men and on women. I believe therefore that the gender aspect of poverty and violence are important points.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that given this difficulty – and there are many other difficulties – but if I think about this particular one, I think that what is in the pipeline in the future directive, Commissioner, which will be based on Article 13 and which will deal with all the questions other than that of employment, the question of the individualisation of rights will be key. What do I mean by the individualisation of rights? These are rights that we give, independently of marital status, to a person. I think that this is our future. And it is important to emphasise that these reports allude to this and that we must, in my view, defend this particular point. We must also defend ourselves at a time when, in my country, a candidate standing in the presidential elections is contemplating making women stay at home – he has said this and he has written this. I think that the question of what we often refer to as conciliation – which I myself do not like to call conciliation – in other words, the organisation, the relationship between what we do at home and what we do with our children, as a family, and what happens in public, whether it be political or professional life, we have a genuine need to organise this.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that it is also important to highlight this point, whichever country we might discuss. Perhaps all we need to do is to think about the future with the individualisation of rights and the interaction between professional and public life, and then think about this directive as well. Of course, I expect the Commission to put forward its proposals in the very near future, and then we can consider enlargement. We hope that the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> will be transposed into national law. We want the transposition of the <span class="italic">acquis</span>. We know that it is very difficult. The Baltic countries will soon start the transposition of some Community legislation into their national law and we know that this will be difficult. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A few days ago, someone asked me if I really believed that women's rights are violated in Europe. Naturally I did not need to think long or hard before replying that, compared with other parts of the world, Europe is a paradise for women's rights. Without doubt it has made a great deal of progress over recent years, as we can see from the European Commission's annual reports. However, serious problems persist even in democratic Europe, such as violence against women in its various manifestations, domestic violence, sexual violence, violence in the workplace. And it is to the Spanish Presidency's credit, I say it again, that it has put these issues at the top of its agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that some 500 000 women are bought and sold in the European Union every year is a blatant violation of fundamental rights; the European Union has still not woken up to this and, more to the point, it has still not taken specific measures to combat this phenomenon. The fact that 3 000 women in the United Kingdom alone are sexually mutilated every year, in the name of cultural traditions which immigrants from fundamentalist and anti-democratic regimes bring with them together with their baggage is also a violation of basic rights, as was the recent crime of honour in Sweden.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is, the European job market is still fragmented along gender lines, women's salaries are much lower than men's, only 25% of businesses belong to women and women are kept below the glass ceiling and out of responsible managerial and decision-making positions; all examples of violations and discrimination against women. Furthermore, the standard which is the idea at the core of the guidelines for the European strategy on employment should also be the objective for women's employment, as should stepping up measures to reconcile working and family life and individualising rights, as Mrs Fraisse quite rightly points out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is of course precisely the same as in the EU Member States. Perhaps the degree of discrimination is not as great in the EU but, as we say in Sweden, ‘there are differences of degree in hell’.</p>

I would, however, like to focus in particular on Mrs Avilés Perea’s report, for I feel that, as has already been said, the annual report is a genuinely important instrument which allows us all to follow up, assess and monitor the initiatives undertaken by the Union and the Member States and the coherence of these initiatives with the global legislation and strategy defined at Union level.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteurs have already said, although the 2000 report does record some progress, it reveals a Europe which is still a hostile environment for women and which is, in many respects, a long way from achieving the goal of equal opportunities: the female unemployment rate is higher than the male unemployment rate, the employment rate is still a long way off the goal set at Lisbon, the labour market is still segregated, women continue to be heavily under-represented in positions of responsibility and, above all, there is a pay gap which is frankly scandalous considering that this is Europe in the third millennium.</p>
<p class="contents">With the Community framework strategy on equal opportunities, the mainstreaming of the gender dimension and the Community equal opportunities policy as a whole, we are heading in the right direction. In particular, I feel that the 2002 employment guidelines and the amending of the directive on access to employment and training, which were successfully completed in conciliation last week, the directive on gender equality based on Article 13, in the context of which I, like Mrs Fraisse, feel that we should call more strongly for the individualisation of rights – a directive which the Commission is to present shortly – and the programmes combating violence against women and trafficking are new, important elements which fill gaps in the overall strategy. However, we need to do more. With regard to the pay gap between men and women, the under-representation of women in positions of responsibility and the balanced participation of women and men in decision-making processes, we need to be more forceful in making everyone – the social partners, the political organisations, the institutions and the Member States – shoulder their responsibilities, and we should maybe introduce more effective instruments that provide better incentives than those used hitherto. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe we are familiar enough with the problem. The Commission is pursuing the implementation of the principle of gender mainstreaming – and, indeed, so is Parliament, as the two rapporteurs have reiterated. Looking, though, at the resources that are made available for this purpose, I ask myself how it is to be achieved. Gender mainstreaming is a top-down process, one that presupposes that the necessary raising of awareness and opportunities for training take place or are present within the organisations or authorities in question – in this case, the Commission. We are well aware, though, of the substantial personnel shortage that exists in this field of work. Unless there has been significant change in the meantime, we only have one national expert from Sweden who is at all involved in the area of women and development cooperation. This is a lamentable state of affairs, one that we have been complaining of for years, and we have, unfortunately, seen no changes in it to date.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not weary of emphasising that the key to development is in the hands of women, but we have not the remotest possibility of being able even to start to put that into practice. Commissioner Schreyer, please take note of how those very people who are responsible here for development cooperation are profoundly disappointed that what we have described in many papers – and on which there is, as is well known, a programme – stands not the remotest chance of being implemented in a truly satisfactory way. There really have to be some changes here. It is also, let it be added, in Europe's interest, for if we support the empowerment of women in the developing countries, that forms part of the emancipation of the European area and will also in part alleviate the problems we still have to deal with today. If women are not empowered, if they are not given the tools for development, then development simply will not happen! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That I do very gladly, as a policy on gender equality is indeed one of the pillars of European politics. I would like to start by referring to Mrs Avilés Perea's report.</p>
<p class="contents">The annual report on equal opportunities for women and men in the EU has, ever since it first appeared in 1996, been to some extent our flagship publication in the area of gender equality. The report informs the public about progress made in the field of equal opportunities, and is of course at the same time a means of monitoring the Commission's strategy of involving gender issues in all the EU's policies and in all its programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad to be able to note that the present resolution by Parliament sees our report this year as marking qualitative progress and confirms it as a systematic and critical evaluation of the initiatives at Community and national level. Parliament's resolution contains, in addition, new and highly constructive commentaries and proposals, which will prove very useful in the drafting of future equal opportunities reports. I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Avilés Perea, most warmly for her report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission gives a ready reception to her call for improved and more up-to-date statistics on equal opportunities, including the development of an index on equal opportunities for both genders. I am able to inform you today that the 2001 annual report will incorporate a statistical annex on this subject. Equal opportunities experts are already working on developing an equal opportunities index, which then, I hope, can find its way into the next annual report.</p>
<p class="contents">Another topic of core significance is the balanced representation of men and women in decision-making processes. We need no further confirmation of the fact that women continue to be under-represented in essential fora. Looking at the Convention, we again cannot but note that adequate representation can still not be taken for granted. I would like, though, to point out that the Commission took the step of setting up its Equal Opportunities Group in order to make equal opportunities a primary issue in our institution as well. The Commission agrees that equal opportunities for both genders is a prerequisite for a functioning democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Three further issues arose from Parliament's resolution: equal opportunities policy in the Structural Funds, the position in the candidate countries and all the forms taken by violence against women. Let me take the first point. The Commission intends this year to adopt a communication on gender mainstreaming in the Structural Funds, which will incorporate the contributions to and conclusions from the third conference on gender mainstreaming in the context of the Structural Funds. The conference, which is to be held in Spain on 14 and 15 June this year, is being organised by the Spanish Presidency in close cooperation with the Commission and with financial support from it.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the second point. Over the past year, positive developments in the area of equal opportunities have been noted in the candidate countries, although not all the necessary conditions have as yet been met. Transposition of this integral part of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> will not only continue to be closely observed by the Commission, but we have also made it abundantly clear that transitional periods in respect of equal opportunities and rights or for the relevant directives and legal framework cannot be permitted and there will therefore not be any. The President of the Commission and my fellow-Commissioner Verheugen have made this clear on their respective travels in the candidate countries, in discussions with which this point is one that I always raise myself.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I turn to the third topic, the extremely difficult one of violence against women, which includes domestic violence and the problem of the trafficking in women for the purposes of sexual exploitation. Here, even more than in other areas, the issue has to do with raising public awareness and exchanging information on innovative measures. The annual report may well also contribute towards this, and the programme of action also makes available resources for measures to raise awareness.</p>
<p class="contents">Gender mainstreaming is not just of the greatest topical interest for the Community's internal policies, but also of course for development cooperation – something which your contributions have highlighted. The programme of action presented by the Commission for the mainstreaming of gender equal opportunities in the Community's development cooperation work is intended to promote the putting into practice of this approach to politics. Mrs Martens' report is helping Parliament to adopt today a position on this communication, and I would like first to congratulate her and also the draftsman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation's opinion on this thoroughly constructive and trenchant report. Here in this House, you are calling on the Commission to give the plan of action more tangible form and to submit a formal proposal with a detailed work programme, containing qualitative and quantitative indicators. I am able to assure you that we will use the resources available to us to work purposefully on incorporating this ambitious agenda in our programme of action. We will be giving appropriate training to our staff and to those with whom we deal in our chosen partner countries, and will be clarifying roles and competences within the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We will be improving the analyses within the frameworks of the programming cycles of the various programmes, revising the sectoral and political guidelines and devising indicators. We have agreed to produce reports on the progress made and submit mid-term and final evaluations of the Community measures in the area of gender equal opportunities for the 1995 – 2001 period, the results of which will be available at the end of this year, and on which basis the proposal for a new Regulation will be worked out. It will enter into force when the current Regulation expires.</p>
<p class="contents">Gender equal opportunities, being a mainstream issue in our action programme, covers all six priority fields of development cooperation by the European Community. This means that every development cooperation agency has to take the issue of equal opportunities into account in its day to day work. The nine months since the Commission's adoption of the action programme have seen the introduction of various measures for the programme's effective implementation, most of which deal with points addressed in your report. For example, you have proposed that part of the administrative budget should be earmarked for compulsory staff training on equal opportunities issues. I am able to inform you that these training schemes are already up and running in, among others, the Directorates-General for development and employment and also in the Meda teams in the field of external affairs policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In item 13, you call for gender analysis of the country strategy papers and of future poverty reduction strategies. I am able to inform you that a large number of country strategy papers have already been examined from this angle, and that the results of this will find their way into the programming cycle and into improved manuals and training documents for staff.</p>
<p class="contents">In item 16, you call for gender auditing of the Budget, that is, the assessment of public budgets in terms of their effects and influences on one or other gender. This is an important point for me personally, among other considerations. Let me point out that various measures have been set in motion in this area as well. I hope to be able to give you further information and reports on the International Women's Day next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to your item 8, I am glad to be able to inform you that, in March, the Commission adopted a communication on the fight against disease and poverty in developing countries, one of the core points of which is improved access by women to basic health care, which also includes improved provision in the area of reproductive health. Indeed, the Commission is making a great contribution to the Global Health Fund,<span class="italic"> </span>and that is something else that I would like to mention in this connection.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that gender equality, the realisation of equal opportunities for women and men, will still be one of the great challenges at the various political levels over the coming years. It is, though, particularly important, and should be seen in a very positive light, that Parliament, the Member States and the Commission are pulling together on this and, let me add, being supported by many organisations in civil society. I would like at this point also to put on record my gratitude for the contribution the women's movement has made towards the idea of equal opportunity being firmly established in our societies.</p>
<p class="contents">I have exceeded my speaking time somewhat, but I believe that this issue, even when it is discussed so late in the evening, does in fact demand much attention, time and energy if we are to make progress in this area.</p>
