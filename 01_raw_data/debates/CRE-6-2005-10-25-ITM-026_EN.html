We are helping to update very important legislation on food safety and thereby promoting the health of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that this is a technical amendment and the idea is to keep the authorisations for food additives up to date with innovation incentive developments. Of course, the requirements are there: the food additives have to be safe, there has to be a need for their use and consumers must not be misled by their use.</p>
<p class="contents">I will mention a few specific points, very briefly, concerning nitrates and nitrites. After the advice we received from EFSA, we proposed changes to the authorisations, so that we now have more control over the amounts of these additives. Nevertheless, it is important to recognise that this approach is not appropriate for certain traditional national meat products and allowance is therefore made for derogation in order to keep those traditional products on the market. There is also a measure to allow new food additives, to help the food industry benefit from innovation and remain competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">A package of compromise amendments was put together following close contact between the institutions. COREPER has already agreed to this compromise package and I am very happy to add the Commission’s support to these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">On the use of sweeteners in sports drinks, we felt that it was more appropriate to address this issue not in this specific directive, but in the context of future work relating to sports foods, including sports drinks, where such products can be properly defined.</p>
<p class="contents">An issue that I know is of concern is that of aspartame, nicin and nitrosamine. These have been evaluated in the past and approved for use as food additives. They are not covered by the current proposal. However, I know that a recent study on aspartame has cast doubt on its safety and the Commission has already asked the European Food Safety Authority to proceed without delay to a full evaluation of the new data. As soon as this evaluation is completed, EFSA will advise the Commission accordingly on the safety of the product.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also asked EFSA to evaluate nicin and nitrosamine, two antimicrobial agents, as a matter of priority. In that connection, we have also asked EFSA to address the issue of anti-microbial resistance.</p>
<p class="contents">On these three issues, EFSA has already written to the chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and I would like to say here in plenary that the Commission will make full use of its competence to adopt emergency measures under Chapter IV, Section 2, ‘Emergencies’ of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 on food law. Should the European Food Safety Authority advise that a food additive is not safe for consumers, we will immediately take all necessary steps, using the power given to us by the regulation, if any of the additives are judged by EFSA not to be safe.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, given the concerns expressed by Members, this commitment by the Commission should reassure them that we will deal with the issue with due regard for the safety of the public. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mojca Drčar Murko (ALDE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, manufacturers respond to ever greater demand by steadily developing new food products. Their variegation is achieved mostly by adding additives. At the same time, the awareness of consumers is growing. Additives are increasingly assessed on the basis of their necessity. The main motive of this directive, amending two current directives, was the revision of the use of salts of nitrates and nitrites, that is, preservatives permitted for use in meat products, cheese and certain fish products.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission took account of the ruling of the European Court of Justice, according to which the level of nitrosamines must be kept at the lowest possible level, and of the opinion of EFSA in that regard. However, the derogations granted to the UK as to the permitted residual levels of nitrates and nitrites in traditional meat products have opened broader debate on the subject, particularly on the definition of traditionally-manufactured products.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety agreed that the derogations are acceptable in special cases but must not distort the final aim of the revised directive. The rule of lowering the levels of nitrosamines must be maintained and exceptions must be permitted only when the traditional products are adequately specified and identified.</p>
<p class="contents">The second major issue was the maximum level of sulphur dioxide and sulphites permitted in food. They probably have a hazardous potential for asthmatics and should therefore be kept at the lowest possible level. The Environment Committee agreed with the Commission that the aim should be to limit in general the use of sulphur dioxide. The exemptions must be carefully evaluated.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I welcome the statement by the Council in the annex to this directive regarding the need for an examination of all additive uses of sulphites as soon as possible, to ensure that acceptable daily intake is not exceeded.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem was the evaluation of intensive sweeteners in general, some of them in particular. Are intensive, non-caloric sweeteners recommendable if consumed in significant amounts and for a long period of time? What relation is there between intensive sweeteners and sports food? Some aspects of this theme could not be dealt with on this occasion. They demand a broader scientific debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the statement by the Commission that, in the context of the work on the specific directive relating to sports foods, including sports drinks, the question of sweeteners will also be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the aforementioned issues were confirmed in committee, yet three amendments that addressed special concerns have been defeated by a very narrow margin. That was the case in dealing with EU strategy to combat the threat posed by anti-microbial resistance, that is, with the authorisation of antibiotics – nicin and natamicin – and aspartame, a widely-used intensive sweetener.</p>
<p class="contents">The Scientific Committee on Food updated the information on the safety of aspartame two years ago and found that there was no evidence to suggest that the outcome of the earlier risk should be revised. As for nicin and natamicin, the risk assessment by EFSA is under way or will begin soon. However, new evidence on the safety of aspartame might bring about a further update as regards its safety. I am therefore pleased that, in a letter to the Chair of the Environment Committee, Mr Kyprianou has given his assurance that the Commission will make full use of its competence to adopt emergency measures if the European Food Safety Authority advises that food additives are not safe for the consumer. That form of assurance regards the prolonged intake of aspartame as well as the intake of antibiotics – nicin and natamicin.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of some outstanding issues, differences between the Council and Parliament were not insurmountable. With the substantial contribution of the Commission, the first-reading deal was therefore within reach. All political groups have announced their interest in reaching that deal, so negotiations continued and today we can present an overall compromise package co-signed by the majority of political groups in Parliament and agreed by the Permanent Representatives Committee of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank all shadow rapporteurs of the political groups, representatives of the British Presidency of the Council and the Commission for their cooperation and the political advisors of all three institutions for their contribution, which was substantial in reaching an agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Both the rapporteur and the Commissioner have explained the content of these proposals more than sufficiently. These proposals are intended to update and supplement the existing Community legislation, adapting it to recent technical and scientific advances and also to the judgments of the Court of Justice. I therefore believe that the compromise we have achieved is a good one, which fulfils the objectives of those judgments.</p>
<p class="contents">I should, however, say that this revision ― a technical amendment, as the Commissioner has called it ― only plays a role that we could describe as a temporary fix. I therefore believe it is important for the Commission to present its proposal for a general revision of the legislation on food additives and sweeteners, and also that announced on sports drinks. Sports drinks are sold with little control, both in gymnasiums and in supermarkets; you can find sports drinks all over the place.</p>
<p class="contents">Food additives are the result of constant technological advances that do not just allow us to enjoy better quality food products, but also offer the consumers a high degree of food safety. Nevertheless, it is necessary to prevent inappropriate use and to keep reviews up to date, in order prevent a lack of knowledge and media pressure from having a negative impact on consumer confidence and harming the image of foods containing these additives, despite the fact that they are not harmful, but rather are an improvement in food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say, finally, that I do not agree with the amendments presented by the Verts/ALE Group and, in particular, those which call for the Commission to present a report revising all of the existing authorisations for additives. This amendment reproduces the requirements of framework Council Directive 89/107/EEC on food additives, Annex II of which stipulates that all additives will be kept under constant observation and will be evaluated whenever necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Socialist Group in the European Parliament obviously welcomes the Commission’s proposal to limit the use of those substances in what are known as jelly mini-cups that have led to tragic accidents involving choking. We also welcome the Commission’s proposal to establish the level of nitrates and nitrites on the basis of added values in, for example, meat products instead of, as at present, on the basis of residual levels. We believe that this will lead to safer monitoring for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">We want these restrictions to enter into force as quickly as possible, and we have therefore been anxious to reach a rapid agreement with the Council. We are also pleased that, under the agreement with the Council, the use of soybean hemicellulose is to be limited so as not to make life more difficult for allergy sufferers. We should, however, have liked to have seen lower upper limits for nitrates and nitrites. We should also have liked to bring about a ban on the use of antibiotics in foodstuffs since such use may lead to increased resistance, and we should have liked to have seen a more thorough investigation of the risks associated with the sweetener aspartame, but on these points a majority of the committee was opposed to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that the Commission has, both in writing and orally here in the Chamber, stated that it takes our concern about the long-term use of aspartame and antibiotics in foodstuffs seriously, we shall support the compromise with the Council and so vote against the other amendments. We wish, however, to call on the Commission to return as quickly as possible to these issues, thoroughly to revise these directives on the basis of the need to limit the use of additives in foodstuffs, and to take greater account of the situation of vulnerable groups. More and more people are rightly expressing concern about the level of additives in food and about the long-term consequences of their use. We in the EU must take this concern extremely seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also a somewhat complicated and controversial piece of legislation in places, and therefore much credit should go to the rapporteur for achieving a valuably balanced report.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to pick up on a couple of aspects that I feel need to be noted further. First, it is right to ban jelly mini-cups with gel-forming food additives in order to prevent choking in children, but the banning of gel-forming food additives in general is unwise because these substances are only hazardous when used in jelly mini-cups. If used in other products, they are perfectly safe; so I fully support the principle that we should not place a blanket ban on all substances, and should only ban unsafe products.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the newly authorised sweetener erythritol, I agree with the rapporteur that its laxative effect, even if at very low percentage levels, should be made known in the form of product labelling. As a matter of principle, I believe that it is an unquestionable right of the consumer to know exactly what he eats or drinks. That right surely supersedes any marketing tactics or side-effects.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank the Commissioner for staying so late with us. The use of antibiotics is very unwise in any foods because of the danger of microbial resistance and allergenic reactions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, scientific developments and technical progress have to be taken into account. New substances are being authorised and, very importantly, the positive list of permitted additives needs to be revised. We have discovered that what is really needed is a fundamental revision of food additives. Unfortunately, that is not possible at the present time, however, and so we have to make corrections.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, of course, a healthy exercise to strive to market foodstuffs that are as pure as possible, free from additives. Yet modern society is very demanding when it comes to foodstuffs: they have to be good, look fresh, taste good, and retain these characteristics for as long as possible. We are seeing increasing consumer take-up of the semi-prepared and prepared products on offer.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many reasons why the modern housewife can no longer get by without these convenience products; chief among these being lack of time for housekeeping and lack of knowledge of cooking and nutrition. Who still knows nowadays how to make a stew, potato dumplings or mashed potato? The foodstuffs industry fills these gaps. It has to use the auxiliary substances needed to meet the demands of consumers. We have come a long way in this regard: long shelf lives and instant products enable a wide variety of fast, time-saving meals.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumers also make demands as regards food safety, however. That is why we are standing here today, on behalf of the consumer, demanding safety by means of equivalent standards and lists for the whole of the EU. I support the report by my colleague Mrs Drčar Murko and thank her for her careful treatment of the issue. Nevertheless, I should like to make a plea, late in the day, for consumers to visit a farm once more – in spite of all the modern achievements – to buy and sample food in its original form, as it were. Let us give our children the chance to learn cooking and housekeeping, then they can decide for themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
