<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Elles (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, I rise to introduce my report on transatlantic relations. It is a timely debate with the rapidly changing transatlantic relationship today.</p>
<p class="contents">As many will know, I have always been a strong supporter of closer transatlantic relations. It is logical, in an area of globalisation, for Europe and America to think of a strengthened transatlantic partnership based on shared values and common interests. But logic is not necessarily sufficient. There are real grounds for concern, the traditional transatlantic ties are now weakening, without new bridges being built; increasing numbers feel that NATO may not exist in five years' time; and certainly the NATO-Russia Council, as we see published today, is fundamentally changing our whole security relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to examine why this is happening, what the concerns are and what we should do about it. NATO inevitably is changing, no longer is it a defensive organisation against a country which no longer exists. It is becoming more political, more international. After 11 September quite clearly one partner, America, feels that it is a nation under attack. We in Europe do not have that feeling. It gives a much clearer focus on what should be done in military matters. Finally, America perhaps is a country which is certainly not used to, and may not wish to, share sovereignty and multinational institutions, as we have become more used to in Europe. It therefore sees things in a very different light when participating in international institutions, even if it is aware that for market access global rules of governance are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">What then are the concerns? My report is very clear on this. A number of different concerns have been raised by colleagues, of a political nature: the lack of US participation in the Kyoto Protocol, the biodiversity convention, the Ottawa Convention on land mines and, recently, the refusal to sign the treaty establishing the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, economic concerns. We have seen two recent instances of American action on steel and now American action to increase agricultural subsidies. In many ways, these show that they are living in a world of their own, detached from reality outside. Finally on foreign policy, where the US seems to wish to continue its ideas for action against Iraq, this is seen by many as not perhaps the best way to deal with that problem.</p>
<p class="contents">What then should we do? The report I am submitting to the House, together with my colleague, Mrs Mann, shows that we have many good ideas, but we have perhaps not paid sufficient attention to what we should be doing. The key element of the report is that we need to continue to update NATO, update the new transatlantic agenda to develop a sustained and strengthened transatlantic partnership based on a new confidence pact and concept of mutual recognition in which our respective roles can be clearly defined. There are a lot of examples, but I will give a few here to the House.</p>
<p class="contents">NATO remains not only the fundamental guarantee of Euro-Atlantic stability and security, it is the essential framework for coalition operations. NATO needs to respond to new global challenges, realising the form of political and military structures is shifting from collective defence to collective security.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential for adequate defence budgets to be combined with courageous steps towards coordination and greater rationalisation of defence procurement. Modernisation instead of marginalisation of partnership requires the US to open its defence markets and us, in Europe, to coordinate where possible. We need to develop a common and comprehensive definition and concept of security and risks to security. We also need to understand that NATO and the EU need to work closer together, by bringing together the non-military tools at the EU's disposal, combined with the decisive military capabilities available to NATO. We need a reinforced political dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague Mrs Mann will deal with the economic aspects, on which there are several excellent proposals. We need to engage the US in constructive multilateral dialogue and to strengthen parliamentary involvement in this whole dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">What does this mean? We have made one or two small steps at the EU-US summit on this positive agenda, but there is one major element missing and that is the strategic view of the long-term destination of this transatlantic partnership on which we have no real ideas. We in this House have always supported a longer-term, deeper transatlantic partnership, that is why we are calling on the Commission to produce a report. Its own communication is lacking in strategic thinking, and we need to make great progress on that issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true, we need more strategic thinking and vision. This is a very, very difficult situation to deal with. Only if we try and put transatlantic relations on a new footing and make the quantum leap to strategic thinking will there be any permanent rapprochement between us in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">I have focussed, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Relations, Research and Energy, on investigating the economic implications. I came to the following conclusion, which my fellow Members supported and which I should like to thank James Elles for including in his report. Basically, we started from the premise that the transatlantic market already exists; you can see that for yourselves in several sectors. However, this has consequences because politicians and the public barely even notice this.</p>
<p class="contents">We basically start from the premise that we are competitors. We are, however, also well aware of the fact that there is a closeness between us and that we are partners. But this very often finds relatively little expression in political action. So we need to take more note of economic realities and translate them into political thinking. That should also give us food for thought for strategic planning.</p>
<p class="contents">The consequences are considerable. We have found evidence of increasingly frequent frustration between us and of alienation setting in. We have found evidence of segregation and of harping back to national policies – mainly on the American side but, to be fair, we are not completely innocent of this – and an upswing in so-called American and European values. This leads to more and more trade disputes, which feed on these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is: what can we do? As James Elles rightly says, we need to update the new transatlantic agenda and transatlantic economic partnership. How can we do that? I think we need a radical paradigm shift. We need to move away from mutual observation. We can achieve this paradigm shift in three ways: first, through a sectoral analysis of economic interdependence, secondly, by strengthening bilateral methods upstream of the WTO dispute settlement procedure and early warning system and, thirdly, through greater rapprochement. The Commission already set this out at the summit in the form of a positive agenda which the Council confirmed. And we shall welcome it on Parliament's part.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not intend to go into any further detail right now. The details are there in the report and I trust that the Commission and the Council will support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">de Miguel,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I have listened carefully to Mr Elles’ presentation of his report and also to Mrs Mann’s speech. In my view, their assessment of the current state of our relationship with the United States and in particular of the Transatlantic Agenda and the future of our relationship merit careful study by the Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Elles stated, in recent years circumstances have arisen resulting in changes in our relationship with the United States. Clearly too, the United States has adopted attitudes which are at variance with a number of common principles we felt had been accepted in the context of the Transatlantic Agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, I believe these are mere blips in what is essentially a strong relationship we trust will prove very significant. In fact, relations with the United States are already established and important, regardless of whether it is incumbent on us to reflect on strengthening them. Of all the Union’s external relationships, the transatlantic relationship is surely the closest one between the European Union and a third country.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union/United States Summit was held in Washington barely two weeks ago. There can be no reservations in declaring that its outcome was excellent. Both parties maintained a commendable constructive spirit across the whole range of issues discussed. This exemplifies what I stated earlier. It shows that regardless of some frustration on our side because of our aim of maintaining a more intense relationship with the United States, the fact is that due to the intensity and closeness of the transatlantic relationship the United States is currently one of the Union’s very special partners.</p>
<p class="contents">We are working together in a number of areas such as the war on terrorism and the joint effort to resolve regional conflicts, notably in the Middle East. The significance of the fact that a meeting of the so-called Quartet was held immediately after the summit should be noted. We are also engaged in drawing up and debating a positive agenda on issues related to trade. It is therefore appropriate to focus on the more important aspects of our mutual understanding rather than keep highlighting those areas where we disagree. The latter mainly involve minor trading issues and, incidentally, amount to less than 5% of the volume of trade between the United States and Europe. There are therefore many good examples of this transatlantic relationship based on common values and on the close cooperation President Bush himself deems to be unique and important.</p>
<p class="contents">From a global perspective and as stated in the press conference following the Summit, a number of conclusions may be drawn from this event. I should like to mention the main ones as I feel they encapsulate the current state of our relationship with the United States. In the first place, there is a clear recognition of the density and significance of the relationship between the European Union and the United States in economic terms. After all, together we account for almost half of the world’s economy, 40% to be precise. Only 5% of this is giving rise to dispute, as I stated earlier. This represents the greatest bilateral relationship in the contemporary world in terms of trade and investment. There is also recognition of the importance of this relationship in political terms with the renewed joint impetus in the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the existence of common strategies and challenges was again highlighted. This means the European Union and the United States are strategic partners. Terrorism is the main case in point. Negotiations opened on agreements for extradition and legal aid in criminal cases. The Justice and Home Affairs Council adopted the relevant mandate on 25 April. Cooperation regarding freezing the assets of terrorist organisations and non-proliferation was strengthened. The updated list of organisations of this nature was finalised on the eve of the meeting to bear witness to our commitment and keep alive the struggle against such organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, concerning foreign policy, the close cooperation and concerted action on regional conflicts and reconstruction processes was highlighted. Examples of these are the agreement on security in the Middle East on the principles of the end to violence, recognition of states and recognition of the Palestinian Authority as a legitimate participant along with support for the Mitchell and Tenet plans. The improvement in the situation in the Balkans was also noted. Cooperation between the United States and Europe in areas such as Macedonia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro was cited. Mention was also made of the close cooperation in the reconstruction of Afghanistan and of the political solution achieved in the framework of the Bonn conference.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, both parties stated their position regarding the World Trade Organisation’s regulations on all trade issues. They endorsed the principle underlying the positive agenda and the qualitative leap involved in identifying areas suitable for cooperation in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, and still in the same vein, the wish to cooperate in other fora and international processes was declared. Specific reference was made to the Doha Agenda and the run-up to Johannesburg, that is, the Conference on Sustainable Development.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it was noted that internal changes within the Union had made themselves felt in all these spheres of cooperation. Two such changes are the enlargement process and the establishment of a common foreign security and defence policy, the consequences of which have been felt in a strengthening of the relationship with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">These, Mr President, are the main conclusions to be drawn from this meeting. As is usual practice, the meeting began with a closed session. This was followed by a plenary session devoted to the more political issues. This was in turn followed by a lunch at which the trade issues were dealt with.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you will now allow me to present a detailed analysis of the specific content of the negotiations on each of the agenda items, whilst still bearing in mind the ideas I just outlined.</p>
<p class="contents">The war on terrorism comes first. As stated on previous occasions, both parties believe it is a key issue and a priority, especially following the events of 11 September. In this connection, the draft agreement on extradition and legal aid in criminal cases was considered. As already mentioned, this followed the approval of the mandate by the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 25 April and was welcomed by the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Efforts to cut off sources of funding for terrorism come second. This led to a reference to the point concerning extending the lists of terrorist organisations in order to bring the European Union’s in line with the United States’. There was also discussion on updating the Union’s measures with a view to applying United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373. Parliament is doubtless aware that the Presidency made a considerable effort over this item, to the extent of calling several Clearing House meetings and an extraordinary Coreper to deal exclusively with this issue. The extended European Union list was eventually formally adopted on the very day of the Summit. As expected, the United States welcomed this further effort. Nonetheless, a degree of disappointment at the omission of Hamas and Hezbollah from the list was expressed. Both sides undertook to make a greater effort to come up with more consistent lists in anticipation of future amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, there is the question of non-proliferation. In this connection, the United States focused mainly on what is known as the ‘ten plus ten over ten’ programme. This is a ten-year scheme aimed at reducing the amount of radioactive and chemical material in Russia. The estimated cost is USD 10 billion. The United States emphasised the importance of the role the European Union can play in this regard, given its relationship with third countries such as Iran. The European Union undertook to include non-proliferation as one of the issues to be dealt with in the political dialogue within the framework of the negotiating mandate for the free trade and cooperation agreement the Union hopes to adopt with Iran. Furthermore, the European Union took advantage of the opportunity to announce measures aimed at strengthening multilateral instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to move on to comment on the various issues of mutual interest in the field of regional cooperation dealt with at the Summit. I refer to the Middle East, the Balkans, Russia and Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Middle East, Prime Minister Aznar recalled the need for urgent action not only to achieve a cease-fire but also to give a political dimension to efforts to find a solution. For the United States, President Bush and Secretary of State Powell recalled that the message of the President’s speech on 4 April remained valid. The need to take account of the constructive spirit currently displayed by Saudi Arabia, Jordan and by other moderate Arab states was recognised, however. The High Representative, Mr Solana, and Commissioner Patten reiterated the need to rebuild Palestinian infrastructure. They also recalled the conclusions of the <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> Contact Group in Oslo concerning the need to avoid a security vacuum in the Palestinian Territories.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be mentioned that Mr Solana drew attention to the unfairness of the accusations of anti-Semitism levelled against Europeans by American public opinion. President Bush admitted these accusations were unfair.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also worth noting that the Quartet, as mentioned earlier, met on the fringes of the Summit, and that the United States felt it was a landmark meeting. The value of concerted international action in achieving a negotiated solution to this particular conflict was therefore recognised. Basic agreement was reached on the need to develop the political, economic and security dimensions in parallel. Furthermore, both sides expressed their determination to maintain pressure on both the parties concerned. The United States expressed its appreciation of the efforts made by the European Union in this field and stated that it would always invoke the precautionary principle to avoid compromising American credibility in the area. To sum up, the Washington Declaration strengthens and reiterates the Madrid Declaration of 10 April.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the Balkans, the European Union placed particular emphasis on the importance of the association and stabilisation strategy, and also on the common interest in the deployment of the APTF police mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina from January 2003. The Union reiterated its willingness to take charge of operation <span class="italic">Amber Fox</span> in the Republic of Macedonia. The United States praised the joint initiatives in the area. In addition, the United States declared its willingness to bring pressure to bear on Serbia to ensure the latter cooperated with the Tribunal at The Hague.</p>
<p class="contents">The exchange of views on Russia took place in anticipation of the United States/Russia Summit of 24 to 26 May, the NATO/Russia Summit on 28 May and the European Union/Russia Summit on 29 May. The European Union highlighted the positive elements of the political dialogue with Russia. Nonetheless, it also referred to politically sensitive issues such as Belarus and Moldova, and expressed its concern over the situation regarding human rights in Chechnya. The United States welcomed the way concerted action is developing in the area, as this represents tangible evidence of President Putin’s Western leanings. In addition, the United States declared its commitment to reach an agreement with Russia on the reduction of nuclear weapons prior to the next summit. It was reported in yesterday’s news that such an agreement has been achieved. The European Union added a reference to the economic dimension and to the steps Russia is taking with a view to achieving full market economy status. The latter is a requirement for Russia to join the World Trade Organisation. It is not, however, envisaged that it will become a member before 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The consensual position adopted by both partners over Afghanistan was again much in evidence. The need for bilateral cooperation in the task of rebuilding the country was emphasised. The United States also recognised the European Union’s significant financial contribution for that very purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to matters relating to economics and trade, the principle of avoiding further discussion on ongoing contentious issues was retained. Revisiting such issues often only results in overshadowing the significance of the strong economic links between the European Union and the United States. We dealt first with the Doha Agenda, then with the Monterrey Summit and finally with the forthcoming Johannesburg Summit. This item was raised briefly to restate both parties’ wish to achieve a consensual position within the multilateral framework of the Monetary Fund, in line with the Presidency’s approach. The Nepad initiative was raised as an item to be dealt with within the framework of the forthcoming G8 summit at Kananaskis. There was also reference to the scope provided at Johannesburg for the development of joint cooperation programmes regarding agriculture and drinking water for example.</p>
<p class="contents">More specifically, as regards trade disputes, the exchange revealed the United States’ willingness to negotiate. This was evidenced by its commitment to abide by World Trade Organisation rules, in particular regarding the contentious issues involving the Foreign Sales<span class="italic"> </span>Corporation and restrictions on the import of clementines.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning steel, as is already known, the United States envisages the possibility of reaching a negotiated solution to the issue of compensation in the medium term, without prejudice to the complaint the European Union is to lodge with the World Trade Organisation. Each party presented a clear statement of its position. However, both sides reiterated their intention of complying with the World Trade Organisation’s regulations. Nonetheless, the European Union continued to argue in defence of its intention to pursue compensation further as the key to protecting its rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The item on the Foreign Sales Corporation was dealt with in a positive way, thanks to the favourable climate generated by postponing the panel’s decision until June. President Bush undertook to adjust internal fiscal legislation in the United States to bring it into line with the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of clementines was dealt with in the same spirit. The United States maintained its commitment to speed up procedures so as to avoid damaging consequences for the coming harvest. Clearly, this all dates back to before the advent of the new law adopted recently. The latter increases aid to American growers. This move could prove to be another bone of contention between the United States and Europe. It does seem that the United States is failing to send out a positive signal at the very time when we are all jointly committed to reducing agricultural subsidies with an eye to the Doha negotiations. I do however feel that we must draw our own conclusion on this matter, with a view to our negotiating position at the Doha round.</p>
<p class="contents">In the positive agenda we have brought together under this heading all those issues on which agreement is likely to be reached in the medium term, and for which the basis of agreement by both parties already exists. In principle, the following items are to be included: reciprocal access to trading on the stock market, the approximation of regulations for organic farming and its monitoring plus the development of a joint prototype for electronic customs inspections.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I must again emphasise the Presidency’s positive assessment of the Summit between the European Union and the United States in Washington on 2 May. The Summit’s effects will be far-reaching. In conclusion, the transatlantic relationship is important and we are indeed concerned about it. Nonetheless, the fact remains that it is a cornerstone in the structure of the Union’s external relations, and will, I believe, remain as such. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Few could have imagined then the horror of the terrorist attacks on the United States of 11 September , which have dominated international affairs and have greatly influenced the relationship between the United States and the European Union ever since. Those attacks brought home the vulnerability of open and democratic societies. But they also strongly underlined their enduring strength. The attacks demonstrated the extent to which Europe and America are united by the values we share, as the scale of the outpouring of grief and sympathy in European countries in the weeks after 11 September made very clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has displayed practical support as well as emotional solidarity. Our cooperation with the US in the months after 11 September in the campaign against terrorism testifies to that. We have made significant progress in the field of police and judicial cooperation – through the US/Europol agreement signed last September, the mandate for a US/Europol data protection agreement and for a mutual assistance/extradition agreement, and through the decision to adopt a European arrest warrant. We have worked together to strengthen border controls, and we have made progress within the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the International Maritime Organisation to strengthen aviation and maritime security. We have worked together to seize terrorist assets. The European Union has played a full part in stitching together the coalition against terrorism. European troops are heavily engaged in Afghanistan, both as the largest component of the International Security Assistance Force, as well as in combat operations. And the European Union is making a formidable contribution towards the reconstruction of Afghanistan, which I am looking forward to seeing myself when I visit that country next week.</p>
<p class="contents">On all these matters, we are working closely with the United States, and to good effect. We are showing how much we can achieve when we operate together with each other, and in partnership with other nations.</p>
<p class="contents">We are doing so too in the Balkans and, more recently, within the so-called Quartet to try to seek a peaceful solution in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">All of that demonstrates that the world is a safer and better place when the European Union and the world’s most formidable power work in harmony.</p>
<p class="contents">But, as honourable Members are well aware, there has been for some time in Washington a debate about whether the US – now so powerful – should focus on its own rather narrowly defined interests, the so-called unilateralist approach, or whether it should continue to give a lead to multilateralist efforts, at the head of the international community’s concerted drive to deal with common problems. This is not a new debate, though it has perhaps grown in intensity. I only want to say this about a debate whose existence is not an exaggerated figment of our European imagination. Europe will necessarily be on the multilateralist side in this debate. That is in the nature of how we see the world and of our experience. No one has to apologise for that. But when we disagree over what seem to us to be unilateralist policies, what is the correct European approach?</p>
<p class="contents">Not to keep quiet, in my opinion. But, equally, not to stand around on the sidelines whingeing. Where we disagree with the US – for example on their decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol – we should take the lead ourselves and press ahead with ratification, encouraging others to do so as well. Similarly, we are opposed to the recent US decision on the International Criminal Court. But opposition is not enough, we will work hard to make the court a success.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we will not get the disagreements out of proportion and that we can move to a relationship in which we are better able to celebrate the considerable areas in which the EU and the United States are working as one, and to find better ways both to manage our disagreements, and, where we fetch up agreeing to disagree, to do so in as sensible and as reasonable a manner as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">It helps, in that context, to take a balanced view of events. For example, our disagreements on trade sometimes seem to overshadow our relationship. Europe and the US are the largest trading partners. Our conflicts account for a fraction of total our trade. The trade flow increases, but the number of disputes does not.</p>
<p class="contents">Too little attention is paid to the close cooperation we enjoy in protecting and developing the international trading system. EU-US cooperation was crucial to the success of Doha in launching a new WTO Round focused on growth in developing countries. Our cooperation to help developing countries has gone beyond trade; we have both substantially increased development assistance; we have agreed on a financing for development strategy in the "Monterrey Consensus"; we are now working very closely in preparation for the Johannesburg Summit on Sustainable Development. I hope we can cooperate as well there, too.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not repeat Pascal Lamy’s recent words in this Chamber on trade issues, but would only like to remind the House that the Transatlantic Economic Partnership (TEP) framework has continued to do what was set up to achieve. The partnership aims at preventing disputes from escalating and at accelerating activity in areas of mutual interest. These are precisely the results of our recent cooperation, in particular: first, the launching of a Positive Economic Agenda; second, the reasonable management and prevention of disputes in the framework of the Early Warning Mechanism (recent cases include Spanish clementines and hushkits); third, a firm commitment at the highest level in the US on the necessary compliance with the WTO decision on Foreign Sales Corporations (FSCs).</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth keeping these points in mind – while not glossing over our profound disagreements on issues like steel and our new concerns about the impact of the New Farm Bill. I can assure Parliament that we will continue to deal with the steel dispute and other disagreements entirely according to the WTO rules and procedures. We do not intend to lose the high ground on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe, against this background, that the appalling events of last autumn call for an entirely new framework for Transatlantic Dialogue and Cooperation. The 1995 New Transatlantic Agenda (NTA) is still valid. It has given us a strategy for the broadening of our relationship, which generally has been very successful.</p>
<p class="contents">What has been lacking is a strategy to make our cooperation as results-oriented as we would like it to be. To establish such a strategy and to streamline an overly bureaucratic process was the objective of last year’s communication. The approach we suggested, which aimed at more stringent priority-setting, was endorsed not only by Member States, but also by our US counterparts. I might add that – ironically, perhaps – counter-terrorism was one of the priorities identified at last year’s Summit. This is not a structure set in stone, the priorities are reviewed on a regular basis, and it does not limit the overall scope of our dialogue. The Positive Economic Agenda, which was agreed at the Summit in Washington early this month, is another good example of this approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The report before us calls for the transatlantic dialogues to be strengthened and for a greater involvement for the European Parliament and the US Congress in the NTA process. I am a strong believer in the role of Parliament and of civil society. The Commission has been supporting the transatlantic dialogues and listening to their recommendations. We are discussing with our US colleagues how to re-launch the Transatlantic Environment Dialogue and how to give greater impetus to the Consumer and Business Dialogues.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been working closely with the European Parliament in the past and will continue to do so. The Transatlantic Legislators’ Dialogue and the inter-parliamentary meetings are important instruments and I would certainly encourage greater use of them.I will not add to the very full report on the recent EU/US summit by the presidency, save to note with pleasure that President Bush promised to seek the necessary changes to US legislation to comply with the WTO ruling on Foreign Sales Corporation. And I emphasise once again that we were able to focus some discussion on those areas, like the Balkans, like the Middle East, like Afghanistan, where we are working very closely together to produce a safer world.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make one final point. Occasionally, when an important relationship in international affairs hits a few problems, the reaction of critics is to say that what is required is a new vision or a new strategy. I have to say that I do not think that the problems we face in managing the European-American relationship result from a lack of vision. We have a pretty clear vision that we are better off on both sides of the Atlantic, and the world is safer and more prosperous, when we cooperate and give the international community a clear lead in confronting the challenges of a new century. There are always likely to be problems, even in an important partnership, when national interests collide. National interest has not simply been erased in today’s world. But those differences will be magnified if we start to disagree too frequently about how "national" the national interest really is. It is our profound judgment in Europe, the product of our history and experience, and not of some flabby prejudice, that the national interest is invariably pursued best through international cooperation, and we should not be ashamed to make that point loudly and clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">One last point: Mr Elles has done a great deal to promote, to deepen our transatlantic dialogue and our transatlantic relationship. But I see from him an amendment on the order paper which causes, I am bound to say, and I am not a notoriously thin-skinned old hack, a slight <span class="italic">frisson</span> in the Commissioner for External Relations. The honourable Member deplores the absence of strategic thinking from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member's profundity as a strategist may be greater than mine and it may even be greater than Dr Kissinger's,</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">but I just want to say one thing to him: the steel dispute with the United States is not a result of a lack of strategic thinking on the part of the European Commission. The lack of agreement on the Kyoto protocol is not the result of a lack of strategic thinking on the part of the European Commission. The Farm Bill, and I direct the honourable Member's attention to this current edition of the Economist magazine, is not a result of a lack of strategic thinking on the part of the Commission. The biological weapons disagreement; the disagreement over small arms; the disagreement over the International Criminal Court are not a result of a lack of strategic thinking on the part of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say something else. The view which is very strongly felt in the United States that Europe does not do enough to defend itself, it does not spend enough on its own security – that is not a result of a lack of strategic thinking on the part of the Commission. I stood here in this Parliament a few weeks ago and asked whether there was anybody in the Chamber who would tell me that their political party would fight an election, pledged to the sort of increase in defence spending that President Bush recently announced. Even the party to which Mr Elles and I are proud to belong would not commit itself to that. It is no problem of the European Commission's making.</p>
<p class="contents">Where I agree passionately with the honourable Member, is that the relationship between the European Union and the United States matters profoundly. I deplore, as he does, anti-Americanism. I deplore, as he does, those who seek to define their Europeanness in terms of how hostile they are to the United States. If Mr Elles would like to see a development of that argument, I commend to him next Saturday's edition of the Guardian and the review by the Commissioner for External Relations of a recent book by Will Hutton. I equally deplore the mirror image of that: the visceral contempt that one sometimes reads about and hears expressed in the United States about Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The relationship between the European Union and the United States is of enormous importance to the future of the world. Maybe some would argue that geostrategically the relationship between China and the United States is going to be more important in this century – over a fifth of humanity and the world's leading power – but our relationship is also important. What makes the relationship so difficult is that we are not just dealing with a superpower, we are dealing with what a recent US ambassador to London, Ray Seitz, has called a "super duper power". A "super duper power" which was responsible for 40% of the world's growth between 1995 and 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">For all of us, managing this relationship with the world's greatest power is going to be enormously important. I do not think that we, in the Commission, show an absence of strategic thinking in considering the importance of that relationship. But the problem is today that there are rather too many issues on which we disagree, and we want to work to reduce them and ensure that where we do disagree, we in the European Union can fulfil our responsibilities of international leadership without that aggravating our relationship with our friends in the United States.</p>

I wish to thank them because transatlantic relations are currently going through a very difficult phase. We must admit that this community of values has been the most successful alliance in the history of mankind; it has brought prosperity, democracy and human rights not just to Europe and North America, but to many other parts of the world too and it has brought about much that is good in this world.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also admit, however, that a great deal has gone wrong since this triumph. There is an excess of unilateralism causing difficulties on the one side and there are weaknesses on the other side, namely our side – mainly our inability to make a military contribution – which generate the difficulties we see on a daily basis, some of which have already been mentioned. The International Criminal Court, Kyoto, trade issues or the fact that the fight against the fallout from 11 September is making NATO look like it no longer has any teeth; all this gives us great cause for concern and, although it is true that progress is being made in the Middle East, we still have no joint presence in Jerusalem or Ramallah and I think that this is where the starting point must be.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that there is no point in starting with individual problems, such as the question of hushkits or bananas, because this is a race you can never win. Just as you think you have got one problem sorted, another two spring up. So this starting point alone gets us nowhere, which is why I am so grateful to the rapporteur for including mainly structural improvements in his proposals, for suggesting that we move the discussion in a new direction, that we develop structural relations with the United States over and above NATO, which was one of the intentions of the transatlantic agenda in the early and mid-1990s.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is: can we find solutions using bilateral trade dispute settlement mechanisms without disturbing multilateralism, do we discuss these issues in connection with the transatlantic market place or do we conclude an agreement between the United States and the European Union, a master agreement as to how relations can be improved here, because this sort of agreement has the incalculable advantage of involving the American Congress. The European Union has agreements with almost every country on earth except our closest allies, the United States of America. We run from administration to administration, knowing full well that it is only ever half the game and that the American Congress is immensely important in this game. That is why we need to find a framework which allows American politics as a whole to be involved, a structural reference framework, and I hope that the Council and Commission will adopt more intensive initiatives here than has perhaps recently been the case.</p>

I was mistaken, as were others. The laws of physics do not normally apply to politics, with the possible exception of the Archimedes principle. I do not think I would be dramatising the present situation in saying that disagreements between the European Union and the United States are both new and alarming. So too is the tone of the disagreement between the European Union and the United States, by which I mean the present government of the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">We all, or nearly all, bemoan the American unilateral attitude. We do not however accept that this is due to Europe failing to assume its global responsibilities in full.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Commissioner Patten that we do not need new ideas. We must, however, give up the old ones, including the notion that Member States, or certain Member States, can play a leading role in world affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not just desirable but essential to promote a return to the old multilateral attitude adopted by the United States in the forties and fifties. This can best be achieved by the European Union’s adoption of a single common foreign policy. The latter would help to restore the political balance of the Transatlantic Agenda. Such a new relationship cannot depend on readjusting military capabilities. This issue still poses a challenge for Europe, however. We do not have to restrict ourselves to exercising our enormous so-called ‘soft power’ is we do not wish to do so. Europe can also have a genuine common defence policy. This would not, in the first instance, involve a budget increase. Instead, it would require the forging of a single policy, and a great deal of work remains to be done in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must support our ally in its time of need in the same way as America came to Europe's aid twice in the darkest hours of the last century. Yet, this support need not be uncritical. True friends and allies must talk to each other and, more importantly, listen to each other. Sadly, as the Commissioner has said, there have been too many examples recently of poor communication and the turning of deaf ears in transatlantic relations.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner demonstrated admirably to Mr Elles, candour is sometimes an obligation of friendship. We must say candidly that on some issues Europe believes the US has got it wrong. Claims that the International Criminal Court would have untrammelled power to prosecute members of the US military are simply not true. To disown the body will not prevent it from going ahead, the US will simply lose all influence over the way the rules develop.</p>
<p class="contents">American arguments at the UN summit on children against safeguards – because they would prevent judicial execution of minors in Texas – offend the European concept of justice, just as US treatment of Taliban prisoners in the Shibarghan camp in northern Afghanistan seems to us to violate the Geneva Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Staying out of the Kyoto agreement on climate change means that the US is free-riding on the efforts of others to tackle global warming. How can we expect the developing world to make its industries environmentally sustainable when the world's leading economy passes the buck so shamelessly?</p>
<p class="contents">On steel tariffs also, US policy is misguided. Rather than re-structure its steel industry, the US risks losing the moral high ground in the global campaign for free trade.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the breakdown in communication across the Atlantic is due not only to errors of judgment on the US side. It does not help that the European Union is at sixes and sevens. Mr Prodi and Mr Aznar looked distinctly uncomfortable with each other at the summit. The failure of Member States to back the Commission in its response to the steel tariffs dispute undermines the credibility of the Union and weakens our negotiating hand.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union's failure to speak with one voice, from Iraq to India, makes it mighty difficult for the US to know where we stand. For the Union to have a credible foreign policy we need a common security policy. It is no use establishing a 60 000 strong rapid reaction force if we cannot get it up and running in practice or reach agreement on a common arms procurement policy. In other areas too, from policing on the ground to a single European sky, we will not be taken seriously by the Americans until we get our own act together.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Union could take a leaf out of the US book in its policy towards China over Taiwan. It is disgraceful that Taiwan, a fully-fledged democracy since 1987, is made a pariah by EU governments which claim to represent democratic values. It is high time that Member States stood together behind the EU flag to open normal relations with Taiwan and take a stand at the UN Human Rights Committee in Geneva against the PRC's human rights abuses.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the European Union would be better placed to engage in a real dialogue of equals with the US, if we displayed more unity and demonstrated more backbone. Liberal Democrats look to the Convention on the future of Europe to deliver a federal European Union with a real common foreign and security policy, so that Europe can use active diplomacy to strive for a new approach to global development and convince our American friends to follow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am not referring to political, economic or military power; I mean that the EU and the United States are not equal. They do not have the same level of awareness, they do not have the same definition of security and of their role in the world. Do not get me wrong, I welcome this difference. The world does not need two United States, the original and a copy. The European Union differs, deviates and should continue to do so. Needless to say, there are common values, common roots and common goals, but there is also a difference in terms of insight into how these goals can best be achieved. In this area, a European model of some kind is certainly taking shape. Let me spell it out quite clearly: there is no room for a sense of moral superiority. The EU is not always right, and the United States does not always come up with the worst response. Despite this, the EU would do well to highlight this response, this difference, with confidence and force in a discussion, a debate with the United States. Also because the United States is no monolith. Debate is most definitely taking place in the United States, and Europe can influence this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">What does this mean in concrete terms? In my view, this specifically means three things. One: the EU must consistently adhere to multilateral agreements in the area of security, the environment and international criminal law. This is different from multilateralism <span class="italic">à la carte</span>, as is sometimes displayed by the United States, for example their behaviour in NATO. Two: the EU should further develop its strong points in areas where it has been successful in the past. As I have already said, these include talking, diplomacy, mediating, conflict prevention and, once conflicts have arisen, tackling reconstruction. This is not a poor apology, this is increasingly the real thing in international relations. Third point: the EU must – more so than in the past – be able to solve the problems in its own region, using military means if necessary. But this does not mean, and I am particularly addressing the rapporteur here, that the EU should spend more on defence, but that it should spend more efficiently. I often get impatient when I see the silly mistakes the United States is making, for example in Iraq or Iran. I also get impatient, however, when I notice that the EU is unable to come up with alternatives. It manages to do so occasionally, for example in the Balkans. Let us continue along this path, with growing confidence, criticising the United States if necessary. If this could be done, I am hopeful of a better future for the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as I am concerned, there is no doubt that the United States is aiming to achieve total global military dominance – something which it probably already possesses. The question, then, is what role the EU is to play in relation to the United States. Are we to be the United States’s puppy or a group of fully paid-up yes-men who cheer the US on whenever it wants us to? The second possibility is that we tag along as competitors, and that is what we shall do if we launch ourselves into an arms race or suddenly embark upon an attempt to match the United States’s military capacity. The third possibility is for us to choose a quite different role, namely that of being the civilian and global power that can intervene before crises arise and before weapons become necessary. What we see as primary in the case of the United States is the capacity and need to solve conflicts with the aid of military power. They have this capacity and need because, in my view, they are quite unable to conduct a proper foreign policy, that is to say a sustainable foreign policy capable of forestalling crises and preventing war. The EU, on the other hand, has demonstrated an ability to maintain multilateral contacts and so also has the ability to lay the foundation for a more sustainable foreign policy. That is the best prerequisite for a civil security policy, and we are therefore better placed than anyone to become that particular civil and global factor. Mr Elles’ report does not make for encouraging reading, and I understand that the Commission gave it a mixed reception, but I do not understand the desire to throw all but the first of the EU’s options overboard and turn the EU into the United States’s puppy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite this, the school friends seem to be growing apart a little. There has been growing irritation over the past few years. Disagreements between the US and EU are on the increase.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament plays a modest role in the transatlantic relationship, but that does not stop the House from holding strong views. The criticism levelled at the United States for adopting a unilateralist, hegemonic attitude is widespread and is also included quite expressively in Mr Elles' resolution. It is true that the behaviour of our partners on the other side of the Ocean sometimes gives us cause for concern. Especially in the area of trade, the US attracts the criticism that it takes little notice of international agreements. In addition, I hope that the United States will change its mind about the Kyoto Protocol. I can support the resolution on these scores.</p>
<p class="contents">The criticisms levelled at the States by this Parliament, however, go further. In all kinds of ways, the EP is hauling the United States over the coals, the alleged unilateralism displayed by the US being designated as the main culprit.</p>
<p class="contents">It does not befit the EU, however, to play the role of moralist if the EU itself is unable to pursue an effective and consistent foreign policy. The EU may have extremely high ambitions, but they still hardly ever materialise in practice. Pleas for more integration have never been fruitful; the interests of the Member States are simply too diverse for this. In this light, the criticism in the resolution loses some of its essence. Indeed: what real alternative does the European Union offer? And why should this alternative be attractive to the United States? These questions remain unanswered.</p>
<p class="contents">Additionally, it is questionable whether the European Member States always sail the right course. All we want to do is enter into consultation, thereby avoiding the root of the conflict, as is illustrated in the background to those fatal events of 11 September last year. Delaying until everyone can strike a weak compromise; is this always preferable to taking action? The criticism of unilateralism ignores the fact that in many cases, the United States only has the choice between acting on its own or not acting at all. Especially in the light of the fact that the current threats may require vigorous action. I gladly refer to the ongoing danger which the regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq represents for us.</p>
<p class="contents">Even a friendship that goes back many years is not immune to deep rifts. This would be very detrimental to transatlantic relations. This is why I regret, finally, that the resolution does not have a good word to say about the different forms of transatlantic dialogue. Precisely in situations where there is a difference of opinion, these dialogues can help foster mutual understanding and work towards solutions. I will therefore support the amendments that moderate this criticism, for it is important to nurture friendships. After all, friendship can never be taken for granted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I too feel that attempts are, in effect, being made in Europe to develop a European identity based on totally unfounded and purely rhetorical anti-Americanism, which is ultimately just irresponsible.</p>
<p class="contents">The only way to bring about a more balanced situation is for Europe, for we Europeans, to decide to shoulder a few more responsibilities such as, for example, in the field of common foreign and defence policy, which we are failing to do. I therefore place great hope in the Convention and the new Treaty and I believe that we must concentrate intensely on that. It is too easy to use a scapegoat all the time to attempt to conceal our differences, which remain so very obvious to the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, therefore, just two points I would like to stress. Firstly, I support the position adopted by the Council and the Commission with regard to the International Criminal Court, for example, but I also see this position as an example of differences in mutual respect, which, however, do not prevent us from proceeding on the basis of a position on which we are united. I trust, therefore, rapporteur, that you will accept the amendment tabled by the socialist Members to paragraph 14 on the International Criminal Court, which we feel is extremely comprehensive and appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to Afghanistan, I feel, Commissioner, Council representative, that both Europe and the United States are mistaken in their analysis of the situation; in my view, having won the war, we are in danger of throwing away peace; if we do not step up the UN forces ensuring the country’s security, restricting ourselves just to making Kabul secure, quite frankly, we will be paving the way for another war and fresh instability in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">I call upon Europe to make this position quite clear in its dialogue with our US friends and for much more durable stability to be achieved in the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given the fact that our relationship with the Russian Federation has undergone so much change, there is a need to review our relationship with the US. For a very long time, there has been talk of the European pillar alongside the American one. Unfortunately, the European pillar is not much of a pillar. In some respects, it is more like a pile of loose bricks. As the meaning of national sovereignties is overrated and this concept is used incorrectly, the Member States are bound to remain satellites of some kind. Despite this, our ambitions go further than this. The report deplores American unilateralism. However, there is hardly any way in which this can be broken, other than by reinforcing the other arm of NATO and of European-Atlantic relations, namely the EU structures. If we do not strengthen these, we will remain a disconnected bunch. We will never be able to take a stand; we will simply remain divided.</p>
<p class="contents">The lack of a Community approach affects many areas. Where this Community approach is in place, for example from an economic point of view, as the President-in-Office of the Council illustrated with examples a moment ago, the European Union can most definitely be a strong partner that also prescribes requirements and takes initiatives itself. This is thanks to the power of the Community approach. In the case of European security and defence policy, this is still very much lacking. That is why the report calls for bold steps towards integration. In my opinion, this is an important position in the report. As has been stated before, these steps are far more important than the increase in the Member States' defence budget. After all, as long as the return on our defence expenditure is only 15% of that of the Americans, far more progress can be made by a full-on Community policy. In addition, I should like to congratulate Mr Patten for his counter-attack.</p>

I feel we must emphasise how paradoxical this situation is, because, as Commissioner Patten said, the expression of European solidarity following 11 September was indeed absolute and exemplary and Europe expressed this solidarity using the resources at its disposal. We can, of course, always criticise Europe for the disparity between its international ambitions and its defence means or the coherence of its common foreign policy, but the fact remains that Europe did display its solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">There are lessons to be learned from the weakness of our resources and I support Mr Obiols i Germà’s comments on this point. I also believe that we must recognise that the task of the Commission and the Council is made more difficult by the attitude of a US Administration which, whilst continuing to make demands in terms of solidarity, is totally indifferent to the effects of its own policy on its partners, and on developing countries as well, when you consider the consequences that its decisions might have for the agricultural or steel industry.</p>
<p class="contents">We all want to strengthen our relationship with the United States, but let us hope that we will not have to sacrifice our European positions to achieve enhanced cooperation. I do not think that we can criticise the Commission for a lack of strategic vision, as the Commission is defending European positions in the transatlantic relationship. Given the intransigence of the US Administration, however, the response is certainly not to sacrifice our values but perhaps to state more generally, at international level, the strategic vision that Europe is adopting to contend with the sizeable problems of collective security and co-development and with the problems of the future of the planet and the environment. This should encourage us to bring an end to the confrontation with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">A further reason for our current difficulty is the fact that the United States is finding it hard to accept that the European Union naturally aspires to be an equal partner and on friendly terms, but also to be treated as equal in return. It is up to us to affirm our European identity, as Mrs Bonino said. I think that this will greatly contribute to more balanced relations with our American partner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are – and I make no claim that the list is complete – the Kyoto protocol, the biodiversity convention, involvement in the International Criminal Court and a complete ban on atomic weapon tests. Even the atrocious crimes of 11 September must not be used as a pretext for aggressive nuclear arming in the USA, which has even admitted it is planning to carry out pre-emptive attacks using mini atomic weapons.</p>

This debate has certainly stimulated interest in what the Commissioner described as one of the most important relationships that exists: the relationship between the European Union and the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur was right to state that there was no long-term view. At this moment in time we must appreciate how difficult it is for Americans to achieve that long-term view because of the events in the United States on 11 September, which, to some extent, meant they turned their attention to other issues, such as their "homeland" security. At times we Europeans do not understand the effects that 11 September had on the people of the United States. That does not mean that we cannot move forward in cooperation, indeed, we must cooperate and pursue our dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there are many issues that we will always disagree on. However, we must pursue our dialogue to try to resolve those issues. No doubt there will be other issues, such as the situation this week with the new Farm Bill, which will cause tremendous problems for the European Union in the longer term. The steel issue will be resolved eventually.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus we have to continue the dialogue and face the challenge. We must not allow the issues as they come forward to distract us in any way from this vital relationship between the European Union and the United States. There is a challenge here for us. Parliament has a modest role to play. I am pleased that the Commissioner recognised that. We have to take up that challenge and work together with the Commission and the Council to ensure that we have a long-term view. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They rightly assume that we need a proper partnership between Europe and the USA. And partnership means that both partners have equal rights, although they need not and perhaps should not be identical. For example, we have different concepts of security and security risks. We place greater emphasis on the economic, social and ecological aspects of security and security risks and we need to introduce this into the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">But we Europeans must admit that security does not come cheap and that perhaps we need to spend even more in order to achieve it. However, it would be a mistake to say that we need the same level of military spending as the United States of America. No, what we need most of all is more efficient spending. What we need is more efficient civil spending which accounts for a higher and probably more significant – by which I also mean materially significant – proportion.

It seems that this was the approach taken on 3 May, when the specific economic programme was adopted at the Washington Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">The controversial topic of agriculture, which so often occupies centre stage at multilateral trade negotiations, should be the subject of in-depth debates and not only, as planned, in the area of mutual recognition of standards for organic farming. European citizens should not simply regard the new farm bill as an instrument that will disrupt trade, since its objectives, scope and length also acknowledge each country’s right to support its agricultural industry, given the practical challenges, such as social, territorial and environmental balance, which cannot be left to the mercy of free trade mechanisms alone.</p>

Furthermore, this debate has not proved controversial.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it has been useful to review our position on the important issue of transatlantic relations. As this relationship is a very intense one, almost a ‘family relationship’, it is sometimes very complex, because we demand so much from ourselves and also from our partners. We believe that in its dealings with us the United States should adopt the same demanding standards we impose on ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall not to be able to solve this problem as we each have different shortcomings. We have spoken of America’s tendency towards unilateralism and of its unwillingness to make commitments in the context of international mechanisms. On the other hand, we have also stated that we are aware of our own failings. We do not invest enough, we do not keep up to standard and we often fail to reach agreement on the implementation of certain policies.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been said that it was evident that Mr Prodi and Mr Aznar were not of one mind when they met with President Bush. I think that this is an exaggeration of the truth. In fact, there has always been a broad measure of agreement between the Commission and the Presidency. This is certainly true of the current Presidency and will probably also be true of future ones. I must say that I could not express the European Union’s feelings on relations with the United States better than Commissioner Patten has already done in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Therein lies our weakness, however. We lack a common policy on many issues and there is still deep disagreement over foreign policy. The independent Member States of the European Union continue to make their own decisions. We need to bring our position on major international issues more closely into line with each other.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, there really is consensus between the Council and the Commission on a strategy for our future relationship with the United States. One really does exist. In addition, there is a willingness to retain the special nature of the relationship. We must have all this constantly in mind as we deal with the usual blips in the relationship. We should also be mindful of it as we continue to work on this warm, fruitful and vital relationship every day that goes by. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was at the heart of the report adopted by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy by 40 votes to 5.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind the Commissioner not to personalise debates in the way he did – although there was an element of humour about this – because I represent the views of the committee and the amendment he referred to was adopted unanimously by my group. We hope that in time the Commission will fall into line with most of this House and the Council in understanding that there is a need for a longer-term review. That is what we have requested, and we expect a strategic report to be presented by 30 September 2003. I hope the Commissioner can produce that for us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
