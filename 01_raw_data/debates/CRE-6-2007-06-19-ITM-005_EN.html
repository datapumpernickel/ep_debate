This document can leave my desk and come to your desk, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, in preparing for today, I was asked by a journalist whether I would buy a financial services product cross-border. That rather set me thinking, because I hesitated in my answer. I said, ‘Well, perhaps I know too much’. I know too much as a result of this inquiry and it makes me somewhat concerned – indeed, more than somewhat concerned. Would I even, after this, buy a financial services product at home, in my country, the UK, where all this occurred? And that is a financial centre that is meant to be among the best in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This whole issue of the sad crisis of Equitable Life goes very much to the heart of the issue of consumer confidence in our internal market. It goes to the heart of the issue of whether we will have confidence as European citizens to save for the future, for our pensions and other investments. If we, as legislators, cannot get the regulatory regime right for the internal market, then we are storing up huge problems for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">So, what happened here with Equitable Life? One and a half million policyholders from 15 Member States were victims of the crisis at Equitable Life. This is truly a crisis on a European scale and one that also has to be dealt with at a European level. I think we all understand and appreciate the importance of financial services companies – and indeed other companies – being able to trade and do business across the European Union on the basis of what is sometimes called home/host country of control, or country of origin control. But if we are going to do this – and it is clear that we are – we have to be absolutely crystal clear who is responsible for what. It certainly was not clear in this particular case.</p>
<p class="contents">A few weeks ago, Commissioner, I was involved in a conciliation where we spent several hours on another piece of legislation known as Rome II, trying to get right the relationship between country of origin and other Community instruments. But this is not just a semantic or a drafting exercise for us. Somebody said to me at the end of the process, ‘Well, every side can read into this what they would like’. That should not be the case. We have got to be clear where responsibility lies, for the sake of the people whose lives are affected by this.</p>
<p class="contents">What I and my colleagues saw in this Equitable Life case were victims, say in Germany or Ireland, going to the regulators in their countries and the regulator there saying, ‘Sorry, not us, not our responsibility’. Then those victims wended their way to the UK regulator, who said, ‘Sorry, not me, you are not my problem’. That must reveal either a fault in our primary legislation or a fault in the way it has been implemented in the UK or other Member States. We have got to sort this out. We have got to have clarity in the future as to who is responsible for our citizens who end up suffering at the end of this.</p>
<p class="contents">So, we found that there was failure in the UK regulatory regime combined with a lack of clarity about home/host problems, perhaps; about being too deferential to a financial institution which had existed for hundreds of years; about a regulatory regime that was, perhaps, in the general parlance, too ‘light touch’. We know that we cannot eliminate all risk but we can certainly do better.</p>
<p class="contents">We have opened up the market, but let us be clear: no mobility without liability. There has to be this balance. There has to be the protective side. And what have we put there, on the protective side? We have a European group of regulators, CEIOPS, who meet. It is getting better but it is a kind of voluntary meeting or early-warning system. It is not the hard black-letter law that allows the entry into the market. So, we know that cross-border cooperation is getting better, but we believe that there is still more that can be done and that, when they look at this in renewing the Siena Protocol, they can do better.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, of course, we are meant to have systems of alternative dispute resolution to help our citizens when things go wrong. I am a great fan of ADR, but, frankly, what we have put in place, up against an open market, is pathetic. The Irish and the UK systems are meant to be the best! I do not doubt that they are, but it worries me about what happens in other Member States. Let us get FIN-NET, the network of ADR in financial services, working properly in every Member State so that our citizens can be assured that there is something there to help them when things go wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">Where is the coherent system of cross-border access to justice in the EU? Well, it might be there for those with deep pockets to understand the complexities of what goes on, but we feel that in order to answer this, you need to allow citizens to act collectively, cross-border and that we need a mechanism to do this. I know many people get scared about this, but it was quite clear to us that at the moment there is inequality of outcome and lack of access to justice cross-border. We must do better.</p>
<p class="contents">The petitioners in this case who came to us originally were persistent, patient, dogged. They did not give up, although they knew that they were taking on the UK state. Indeed, at first the Commission told us that nothing could be done here. But we have learnt a great deal in this journey about the implementation process. In the future, it must be much more proactive, not just about checklists and tick boxes. We know it is getting better. The quality of our legislation must be more transparent. We must have citizens’ summaries, so that citizens can understand what is about, and correlation tables so that we know where our legislation has gone in the Member States. Better implementation means a proactive Commission combined with a watchful Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank all my colleagues and the Secretariat who have worked together with us on this report. We have had a once in a lifetime opportunity as parliamentarians. I believe this report will assist the victims in a pincer movement with the UK Parliamentary Ombudsman, perhaps finally to deliver compensation. More importantly, I hope it will deliver a huge jolt to our institutions about our lawmaking processes and the European system of justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, this is now yours – but not just yours, I hope. It is also for the Commissioner for Justice and the Commissioner for Consumer Affairs. We are waiting for your answers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many have suffered serious financial loss and much anguish.</p>
<p class="contents">Equitable Life was said to be the world’s oldest mutual life assurance undertaking, dating back to 1762. It enjoyed a very high reputation. How could such an illustrious insurer run into such serious difficulties? What conclusions should be drawn for the EU insurance single market and for the internal market as a whole?</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Parliament’s Committee of Inquiry, which is before you today, is a very valuable aid for answering those questions. I would like to pay very sincere tribute to the exemplary work carried out by the Committee of Inquiry. The Chairwoman of the Committee, Mrs McGuinness, and the rapporteur, Mrs Wallis, deserve the highest praise. The Committee worked hard to find the truth and give all concerned, the victims, the regulators, academics and the Commission, a chance to make their views known.</p>
<p class="contents">The report concerns the supervision of Equitable Life. It also highlights that the way in which transposition and implementation checks were carried out in the mid-1990s was, in retrospect, insufficient. The Committee finds that the Commission could have done more to make sure that the EU insurance rules were properly implemented and applied. I do not contest the report’s finding.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the report is fair in recognising that was the way things were done in those days. At that time, the Commission did its best with the means at its disposal. I also note with satisfaction the report’s agreement that the Commission is not and cannot be the regulator of the regulators.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, it is most noteworthy and positive that the report’s main concern is to look forward to the future rather than back to the past. So, how can we improve the situation and prevent another Equitable Life affair in the future?</p>
<p class="contents">The report makes 47 recommendations. Some are addressed to the United Kingdom Government, some to the Commission and others to all Community institutions. They cover transposition and the regulatory system, remedies, the role of the Commission and the role of committees of inquiry.</p>
<p class="contents">These are all carefully considered recommendations, which merit very serious examination. I can assure Parliament that the Commission will give most serious consideration to all recommendations addressed to it. We will, in accordance with normal procedures, give a response to Parliament in writing.</p>
<p class="contents">Permit me just to say a few words as regards the insurance sector, which is at the heart of the Equitable Life affair. In July I intend to present our Solvency II proposal to the College of Commissioners. It will reform comprehensively and update insurance supervision and regulation in the European Union. A key element of this project is the aim of linking the capital requirements for insurance undertakings much more closely to their precise risk profile. This will not be a zero-failure regime but will, I believe, make a collapse, such as that of Equitable Life, much more unlikely in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also addresses the wider issue of how to ensure that Community law is correctly applied and how transposition is monitored. The Commission will shortly be setting out ideas on how to improve the application of Community law. Your recommendations provide very valuable ideas in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me once again thank Parliament and the Committee of Inquiry for its work on this sad affair and record the Commission’s commitment to making sure that the necessary lessons are learned at EU level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At my behest and with the support of many colleagues across the political spectrum, Parliament set up an enquiry into Equitable Life under the distinguished chairmanship of my honourable friend, Mrs McGuiness. We heard from some of the thousands who suffered financial and emotional stress in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany and many other countries. We questioned officials, advisers, journalists and even – unsatisfactorily – the Chief Executive, but representatives of the British regulators and the British Government were conspicuous by their absence.</p>
<p class="contents">We discovered the incorrect implementation of EU law by the UK Government; structural weaknesses within, and failure to communicate between, the UK and other Member States’ financial regulatory systems; the failure of the European Commission to monitor adequately the implementation of EU law by individual Member States; the dubious actions of the staff and senior management of Equitable Life; the ineffectiveness of the financial redress system available to victims; and dereliction of duty and the failure to respect policyholders’ reasonable expectations by those regulators.</p>
<p class="contents">We made a number of recommendations, which, as the Commissioner said, amount to some 47. Chief amongst them is the belief that the transposition of the Third Life Directive was inadequate and, therefore, action needs to be taken in that respect. We need to ensure that citizens of the EU have redress for grievances throughout the EU, not just in the country in which the company is based.</p>
<p class="contents">But, above all, I demand, and my colleagues in the Conservative Party demand, that the British Government make recompense to those policyholders who have suffered because of the failure of the regulatory system and of the ministers involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it is an important step on the long road which policyholders have travelled in terms of trying to find a solution to their difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank the rapporteur and the chairwoman for their work, and the Committee staff and members, who worked carefully to analyse the Equitable Life affair and to draw conclusions and issue recommendations. Perhaps even more importantly, they looked at how better to protect European citizens in a single-market environment.</p>
<p class="contents">This important and reasoned report concerns the plight of 1.5 million European citizens who had invested for their pensions in Equitable Life, one of Europe’s oldest and most respected and trusted mutual life assurance companies. Hundreds of thousands of people have suffered real hardship because of the failure of national regulation in the UK and in other countries where Equitable Life operated.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist Group supports this report, but not everyone is equally happy with our committee’s findings, as will become clear from some of the contributions here this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">Some argue that the criticism of the UK Government is overstated and that insufficient credit is given to the progress made since this crisis emerged. Be that as it may, the overwhelming value of this report is that Europe’s citizens know that they can come to this Parliament and have their case heard, and we have learned as a result of listening to them how we can better defend citizens’ rights to fair play in a single market.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no doubt that the UK’s so-called ‘light touch’ regulatory approach encouraged the company to oversell over an extended period, thereby undermining its solvency, which led, in large part, to this disaster. No amount of special pleading or niggling over detail can hide that stark fact. It is equally clear that the company management bears an enormous burden for its irresponsible actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing this in mind, it is legitimate that Parliament should call on the UK authorities to examine the possibility of providing recompense to those who have in some cases lost their life savings.</p>
<p class="contents">It is equally clear that the Commission has neither the will nor the resources to ensure the proper transposition of EU law, nor to follow up on its application in the real world of business. In addition to this, we have found that the Third Life Directive itself has serious deficiencies which need to be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to refer to the situation of the 8000 or so Irish policyholders, many of whom lost substantial sums. Their difficulty in obtaining redress was twofold. They were led to believe that they were investing in a so-called Irish fund, which, they discovered, was non-existent. They also discovered that the Irish regulator took no interest whatsoever in the operation of Equitable Life before the crisis and had negligently failed to avail of the option under the Third Life Directive to implement conduct of business rules. This effectively left policyholders at the mercy of a UK regulator who denied any responsibility for non-UK policyholders.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to draw attention to the 70 or so conclusions, recommendations and remedies contained in this report, which are the distillation of what we found. While national regulation has improved, there remain large gaps on how we ensure that financial services are passported to operate outside their country of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I want to conclude by drawing attention to the proposal for collective litigation by consumers in national courts. This would make it possible for people who do not have millionaire bank accounts to seek justice in the courts. Collective actions in national courts against transnational companies or national regulators are essential if the principle of ‘no mobility without liability’ is to have any real substance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, I am very glad that this Parliament has examined the circumstances surrounding the demise of Equitable Life and I hope that our conclusions give some comfort to policyholders in that many of their suspicions and allegations appear well founded.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to the frankness of some – unfortunately not all – of our witnesses. Some of the evidence we have taken is astonishing and an eye-opener for the future. Perhaps we had suspected so, but is it enough that the Commission’s check on implementation of directives is just a tick-box exercise? I am glad that it is acknowledged now that it is not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">We were told frequently – and in many respects I can agree – that the supervisory environment is already very changed and will become more so with the Solvency II Directive. However, we also heard that it is not certain that all supervisors are immune to bullying, which was an issue in this case. As the Commissioner has said, Solvency II is not a zero-failure regime, nor is it intended to be.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is clear from this inquiry that consumers and policyholders expect their investments to be safe and for there to be accountability and liability when something goes wrong. Any less than that and it is a futile wish to see growth in the uptake of personal pensions.</p>
<p class="contents">So, whatever the risk of failure, this means we cannot duck the issue of compensation, and while it may not be appropriate to make Solvency II into a Christmas tree with baubles for everything, it is certainly necessary to have parallel work under way on compensation mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside that, we have the shameful hiding of facts because of the changes in the UK’s supervisory regime from DTI to Treasury to the FSA, and now we have a so-called independent FSA without liability for negligence. Looking forward, that has implications for the supervised businesses, as well as for policyholders, and it requires attention. Maybe all the more so, as changes push other supervisory structures in other countries towards the FSA model and this links us back again and into wider issues of compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">So, looking to the future, we must take very seriously, in its widest interpretation, paragraph 14 of the remedies that states: ‘There should always be a fully liable chain of responsibility for regulation. The chain of accountability should not be broken including when there is reform of regulatory procedures/bodies’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It gives the 1.5 million insurance customers in the United Kingdom and in other European states new hope of financial compensation for the losses they have sustained. The conclusion is beyond doubt: it is that the United Kingdom was negligent in transposing the EU’s insurance directive, which applies in cases such as this, but the report goes on to criticise not only the structural deficiencies of Europe’s system of supervision and regulation, but also the German supervisory authorities’ failure to do enough to protect the interests of Germans who had insurance policies with Equitable Life.</p>
<p class="contents">Investors outside the UK in particular found themselves, when seeking legal remedies and demanding compensation, caught up in a veritable game of ping-pong between the authorities in the respective countries, none of which saw themselves as having responsibility for the matter. There were considerable problems – and not only in the United Kingdom – where financial supervision and the regulatory framework were concerned, and what is even more serious is that there were undoubted defects in the system for supervision and financial control, not to mention shocking problems in communication between the national supervisory authorities. This will have repercussions right across Europe, since the Equitable Life was able to offer its services in other EU Member States under the third life assurance directive, which was itself founded on the country of origin principle, of which we Greens have taken a critical view. That principle provides that a company’s financial health and the adequacy of its reserves should be monitored only by the authorities in the country in which that company’s registered office is situated.</p>
<p class="contents">The Equitable Life case is a textbook example how, if one takes out a policy with an insurance company whose registered office is in another European Member State, loopholes can occur as regards legal safeguards and financial supervision. It is not acceptable that consumers should have to suffer legal uncertainty of this kind in as sensitive an area as the cross-border market in financial services, which is constantly growing, and so I am glad that the committee of inquiry is making the specific demand for legislation to emerge from the work currently in progress, as part of the Solvency II project, on future equity capital requirements for insurers.</p>
<p class="contents">It also calls on the Commission to submit before the end of the year the planned legislative proposal on the introduction of guarantee funds for insurers in order to impose Europe-wide and binding requirements in respect of financial services, the creation of reserves for liabilities and guarantee schemes for domestic and foreign customers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But then, towards the end, party politics inevitably kicked in and this report is a pale shadow of what it might have been. It has few teeth and it does not bite hard enough. The British Parliamentary Ombudsman has deliberately delayed her report on the same subject to trump this one, as the committee was warned would happen. Instead of directly helping victims, this one will be discredited and undermined by a deceitful ploy of the British Government that is afraid to face up to its obligations. This report should have categorically insisted on full compensation for all victims, regardless of their status. It should have called for the British Government to reimburse them for their hardship and the damages they have suffered. Above all, it should have demanded that the British Government implement such a scheme without equivocation and without delay. Tragically, it does none of these things.</p>

There are many individuals for whom the losses through the collapse of Equitable Life were quite devastating. Promised returns and anticipated comfortable retirements evaporated overnight, and to this day it is these individuals who remain the losers.</p>
<p class="contents">This report makes a number of pertinent points, but on its own it can do very little to ease the plight of those who have lost money. Perhaps that is no surprise, because the Committee of Inquiry was unable to compel witnesses to appear and thus it was never going to be able to do more than highlight the issues and, at best, perhaps help others in the future. Only the United Kingdom Government, through a compensation scheme, can bring meaningful relief to the policyholders, of whom there are many in my constituency.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that more EU control over financial services or meddling in domestic legislation is the answer. Robust controls and supervision of the sector with paramount protection for investors are required, and that must come through national legislation and strict regulatory oversight.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I trust that the forthcoming report by the UK’s Parliamentary Ombudsman will grasp the issues and will resist the pressure that it is under to whitewash the Equitable Life scandal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mairead McGuinness (PPE-DE). –</span></span>   Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur Mrs Wallis for her dedicated work on Equitable Life, all the members of the committee, who worked really well together and left politics outside the door – perhaps not all the time but most of the time – and particularly the Secretariat, who are with us today, for their diligence.</p>
<p class="contents">I took on chairing this committee 18 months ago. It was a great honour to take on that job and I think that by listening you learn a lot. I am glad to hear from the Commissioner this morning that we are learning from our mistakes. I acknowledge his comments that he does not contest the findings of this report and I also welcome his plans for the future in terms of better regulation and application of EU law.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are over a million people who will hear about this debate and who are directly affected by it. The one thing you would have to say is that this debate, and our work, have brought the work of the European Union closer to the citizen, because we have in our midst two of the original petitioners – Paul Braithwaite and Tom Lake – who came to the Committee of Inquiry. I welcome there here today. They have stuck with it. I worry, if they had not done so, where would we be? I reckon we would still be rubber-stamping and ticking boxes and nothing would have changed. Therefore, even if we do not succeed in compensation – although I stress we will try – they have done a great service not just to their own case but also to the general regulation of financial services.</p>
<p class="contents">What are our conclusions after 18 months of work? Well, that the UK was flawed in its implementation of the Third Life Directive. Yes, it ticked the boxes, but its day-to-day application was deficient and inadequate. It failed on a number of different issues, including challenging the dual role of the appointed actuary, focusing too narrowly on solvency margins and other very important issues. The whole light-touch regulatory policy, the disproportionate deference to the Equitable management – all of this pointed to lack of control and regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Too often, we discovered that the home and host state authorities were able to shift responsibility from one to another, leaving non-UK policyholders in a vacuum. For example, the inquiry concluded that both Irish and German regulators pursued an unjustifiably passive approach in respect to Equitable. I find it particularly regrettable, as an Irish MEP, that no Irish authority assumes responsibility for the inadequate actions undertaken by the Irish regulator in relation to Equitable Life prior to 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, when we look at redress mechanisms, when things went wrong, we discovered a pattern of confusion and much inequality of treatment, as already dealt with by my colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">So, I turn to our recommendations. We never misled our petitioners and those who came to the committee and who listened to our work. We never promised compensation, but we strongly believe that the UK Government is under an obligation to assume responsibility for this affair and we recommend that it compensate Equitable Life policyholders within the UK, Ireland, Germany and elsewhere. In addition, the UK must accept and implement any recommendations of the UK Parliamentary Ombudsman that she may make in her second report on Equitable, which is eagerly awaited.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to tighten up on many issues around regulation. However, there is a question that needs to be asked following this debacle: if the cross-border dimension of consumer protection is not properly taken into account, can we blame consumers in the EU for not shopping more across borders? As to the question put to our rapporteur by a journalist of whether we would buy these products across borders, the answer is still not particularly clear.</p>
<p class="contents">We have the recommendations in front of us; we have this major report of almost 400 pages; the Commissioner is to take it on board and I appreciate that. I would ask this House to support this report and the recommendations fully and I thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am the appointed rapporteur for the House on Solvency II. Some of these points, particularly on home/host supervision, will not be lost in this debate. In fact, as I am sure most people know, this is one of the things we are taking forward. There are also considerable changes to the laws and to the apparatus of financial supervision which have occurred during the time of the Equitable Life crisis. Indeed, the company still exists today. It was not a failure as was first suggested in the report, but only a crisis – a crisis enough, which actually affected a million people.</p>
<p class="contents">But, as everyone knows, there is still a process to continue, which of course means that British, Irish and German claimants will be able to look to the Ombudsman’s report – as somebody has already said – later this year. I hope the issue of compensation and other issues will be settled there, where they should be.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, there were some errors in this report and it is not to my great pleasure to have to point them out. Firstly, there was no compliance – or little compliance – by the British Government as regards the issues surrounding whether or not it should appear before the committee. Ministers attended the meetings they said they could, not, as the report suggested, maybe by avoiding them. I was there. I met the British Ministers at the same time as everybody else. They even supplied correspondence which was missing from other governments, which frankly, in my opinion, should have been taken into account. Thirdly, I totally disagree that the implementation of this particular directive was a failure, if you look at the process. If it was a failure, then perhaps Sir Robert Atkins can explain how that failure actually occurred, which was when he was in government.</p>
<p class="contents">I am afraid that this report is weak where it should be strong and could deliver, and strong where it is unable to deliver. For example in the area of supervision, where it could do something and where it will do something. I, as the rapporteur in Solvency II, promise that we will be doing something on the coordination of home/host supervision across Member States, so that victims will never be bandied about pillar to post by regulators. I look to the Commissioner to help me on that issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to draw your attention to the fact that there has been a whole series of cases involving hundreds of thousands, or even millions of victims. There was the case of excise tax on cars in Poland and the Lloyds case, which was similar to the one being discussed today.

<p class="contents">The investigations by the Committee of Inquiry on the crisis of the Equitable Life assurance society have brought to light the harmful consequences of incomplete implementation of European legislation, which was itself insufficiently precise. Policyholders must therefore be compensated for their losses, and procedural obstacles to their compensation must be removed.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree, therefore, with the report’s conclusions, whereby the British Government is enjoined to assume its responsibilities and devise an appropriate system for compensating the policyholders of Equitable Life in the United Kingdom and abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">This dismal affair must prompt us to improve insurance legislation so that the consumer retains confidence in insurance products and, more generally, in financial services. Parliament will be able to play its part in protecting investors during the debates on Solvency II. This directive, which will deal with the prudential rules applicable to the insurance sector, must, to this end, put in place early-warning systems for national regulators and for the European regulatory body for insurance.</p>
<p class="contents">In this kind of directive, Parliament, the Council and the Commission must, as the report recommends, make as little use as possible of the options of exception or derogation or even, if they can, refrain from using them altogether. For their part, the Member States must avoid imposing additional national requirements when transposing Community law and so avoid ending up with excess regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The transposition of directives, in the field of insurance as in other fields, should also be better monitored. This means that the Commission must be proactive with regard to monitoring the quality and effectiveness of the transposed legislation. Furthermore, closer collaboration between the European Parliament and the national parliaments would be a real factor for progress in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can learn a number of lessons from all this about how things could be done better when subject to better regulation and monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">The insurance company itself – which is in fact the sole cause of the damage and the predominant characteristic of whose business practices was obfuscation – is touched on almost only peripherally. Commissioner McCreevy nevertheless went so far as to tell the committee that this was the free market economy that we were talking about, and if the consequence of that attitude is that people think they can leave provision for the twilight of their lives to a market as uncontrollable as that, then our sense of common political responsibility is in a damned poor state, and I say that with reference to the legislator, to the Commission’s failure to implement controls and to the sloppy transposition of the regulations by the government in question equally. If there is any point to this report, it is that we, together with the Council and the Commission, must put in place accompanying and monitoring legislation – and I say this as the person responsible for ‘Solvency I’ – that will enable consumers to plan for the latter years of their lives with greater confidence and safety.</p>
<p class="contents">It is above all for this reason that I am voting in favour of a report that will send out a signal, believing as I do that it will also make the so-called free-marketeers more willing to learn from Europe as a whole and that we therefore have to take the necessary actions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And in this specific matter, there is clearly no doubt that the British Government has not fulfilled the requirements of the third directive on life insurance, nor has it ensured the appropriate legal appeal measures. As a result, the committee of inquiry judges the British Government to be at fault in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must remember that the Equitable Life crisis affected a strong, extremely respected company. This crisis could, therefore, affect any other company, not necessarily in the insurance sector, in nearly any Member State. Therefore, the European Commission’s current evaluation of the Member States’ capability to implement and apply European Union legislation is, in my opinion, insufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">I wholly agree with the conclusions of the committee of inquiry, namely that the European Commission should pay more attention to the quality of legal provisions at a European Union level and at the level of the Member States. A formalist and statistical approach to monitoring the transposition of Community law is already seriously inadequate. The European Commission’s recommendations to Member States are based on the assumption that European Union legislation will be effectively implemented when there are enough sufficiently qualified employees available and once the appropriate resources have been assigned for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not entirely share this view. Staff numbers and the amount of resources at our disposal are not a comprehensive yardstick. We need to be determined and actively involved in the implementation of European Union legislation. These actions will only be credible if countries delegate the implementation of Union legislation to authorised, competent and responsible institutions whose effectiveness will be assessed. The correct handling of the challenges facing the Member States requires three factors: knowledge, competence and readiness.</p>
<p class="contents">The first factor, namely knowledge, is not a problem today. The second factor, namely the ability to implement the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire, </span>is based on allocating suitable resources for the purpose and hiring the right staff. This is what the Commission is currently stressing the most. However, the third factor, namely preparedness, is the most important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a number of difficulties arise in this report and in the debate. The citizens, the consumers and the insured must be given realistic, rather than excessive or groundless, hope, and I do not feel that the position towards the British Government has been sufficiently thought through.

<p class="contents">The United Kingdom did not adequately transpose the third life assurance directive; the Commission did not adequately monitor that; the supervisory authorities in several Member States did not perform their function in the manner in which they should have done; the company’s management abused the trust of the people who had policies with it; it lied to them, acted in a negligent fashion and checks were not carried out.

We have a responsibility to create the necessary framework conditions and to exercise control, with as much of the market as possible, but as much state control as is necessary, and that sort of tension means that this report needs to be used as a means of drawing the necessary political and economic conclusions as regards occupational retirement provision, pensions, guarantees and hence also the issue of what is done with the public’s trust in political and economic measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this respect, we have here a textbook case. Obviously, the transposition was not equal to the quality of the legislation. We must improve this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I understand that, in the United Kingdom, conclusions have already been drawn from this situation as some monitoring bodies have been modified following this affair. No doubt we need to go further still.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, progress in Europe has to be made where cross-border activities are concerned. We shall make no progress in this area unless we give consideration to what exactly we mean by monitoring those involved in offering financial products in several Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we must improve the strategy for product placement. Selling just any old financial product under any old conditions is unacceptable. There will also be no integrated market for financial services without an improvement in the way financial products are offered to clients. Otherwise, there will be more and more cases of misselling.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, the Committee of Inquiry has asked the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to honour its conclusions. Without even waiting for the conclusions of this Committee of Inquiry, it is a fact that the issues of implementing the directives, of improving the solvency of financial companies and of ensuring high-quality supervision of financial markets are at the heart of our daily concerns. Having said that, it goes without saying that this textbook case will serve only to increase our determination in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, my last point is the issue of victims’ right of appeal. Of course, this is not a matter of authorising the opening of a class action. For all that, if we wish to be serious, we must also, in the context of legislation for the protection of investors and savers, improve European legislation in terms of defining the remedies available to victims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank Mrs Wallis for all the work she has put in as rapporteur on a very complex case. Of course, these are real people who have lost real money. Many had set aside this money for their retirement, for their families, and they have had real hardship due to this crisis. I pay tribute to them for bringing their case here.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, of course, you have to remember that Equitable Life was a very long-standing company, so people had great faith in this financial institution. Our own House or Commons in Westminster actually had pensions systems tied up with Equitable Life, so how can you blame anybody for actually putting money into their policies? We had evidence before the committee where there was no doubt that the with-profit policies that were being offered were being offered at too high a rate, and the company could not carry on paying out this money. We had actuaries coming to tell us that the company was basically becoming insolvent if it carried on paying out at such a rate. But yet of course everybody changed at the right time so that when the new company came in and the new management came in, they were not responsible for what happened before.</p>
<p class="contents">In a single market people expect recompense when they buy policies in Ireland, Germany or the UK, and does it actually matter whether it is the EU or the Member State that is responsible? What matters is for the people who have had those policies to be recompensed. And that is where I join with Sir Robert Atkins and others in demanding that the British Government look very seriously at recompensing people that have lost real money. Like I said, there is no doubt that we have found that the proper regulation was not carried out.</p>

He said that the committee of inquiry was set up at his behest. Those who worked in the Committee on Petitions will remember that it was at my behest, but I will share that equally with him.</p>
<p class="contents">He said, and I have to correct him, that the British Government was conspicuous by its absence and so was the Regulator. Where was he when we met with the Chief Secretary of the Treasury and the Regulator? Sadly, he was conspicuous by his absence. We need no lectures from previous Conservative governments, which actually twiddled their thumbs whilst people’s pension policies burned.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome this report, but sadly I cannot fully support it. I believe it strays into areas where it should not go. It fails to properly recognise the measures and provisions which the Labour Government has put in place since 1997. The report strays into areas such as the role of the rapporteur post-Parliament, the role of the rapporteur at EU Member State level, and I do not consider this appropriate. It is intervening in the sovereign Member State parliaments and their legal obligations under the Treaty. Yes, it makes helpful suggestions regarding the single market and responsibility of the host state with regard to financial services, but does it alter the plight of the victims, two of whom are sitting in the gallery today? Sadly, it does not. They are victims of mis-selling, and it was because of their plight that we set up this temporary committee of inquiry. I also commend the work of the chairman of this committee of inquiry. Sadly, it will not help the victims. It is full of promise and no guarantee.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I have urged all along that we ask that the parties involved, including the UK Government, adhere to any recommendations that may come from the British Parliamentary Ombudsman. If there is compensation, let us be clear: it is the British taxpayer who will pick up the tab.</p>
<p class="contents">The Labour Group will not vote against this report but it will abstain because of the reasons I have already outlined. Sadly, I must agree with an earlier contribution that party politics has crept into this and it will not serve the victims of the Equitable Life crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To do so shows a lack of respect for one’s fellow Members and also for the people who are following the debate. I might add, Mr President, that I think you were wrong not to have intervened earlier on.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the matter in hand, this point is in many respects a learning exercise. We in Parliament have entered a new dimension. We have received petitions and are now on the brink of publishing the findings of a committee of inquiry. I should like to make a heartfelt request to Mrs Wallis and Mrs McGuinness, particularly as we are already receiving the first letters saying, if nothing happens in the wake of this parliamentary report, then we will despair of Europe and we will despair of this Parliament. I should like to ask Mrs Wallis and Mrs McGuinness to consider prefacing this report, which is to be published, with a brief overview of what this Parliament can and cannot do. As you know, we are not the most powerful of the institutions, and this needs to be explained in simple language with the aid of diagrams.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not true that the United Kingdom does not have compensation arrangements in place or that it does not have a compensation scheme. More salient is the fact that the United Kingdom has a different standard for liability. In the United Kingdom you are held liable for your intentions, but not for negligence, mismanagement or other failings for which you are certainly liable in other Member States. This is the nub of the matter. In the European Union we will have to find a way out of the old entrenched positions of the country of origin principle and the country of destination principle, because neither extreme is appropriate and we have not yet managed to identify a system that is midway between the two. As a result we have so many irregularities. We need to try to find a new system, particularly for complex areas such as financial services, otherwise we will continue to fail.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that when the British Government finds a way to compensate the victims all victims throughout Europe will be included, because the British taxpayer did in the past benefit from the success of Equitable Life, success which it owed not least to its presence on the internal market. It was this presence on the internal market that led to citizens in other Member States suffering losses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The difference in the case of Equitable Life was negligence. The actuarial function was neutralised, and the business model was akin to riding a wobbly bicycle: so long as they kept selling they could just keep upright. But when the music stopped, what then? It amounted to a selling machine cashing in on centuries of respectability but which was in fact a house of cards, built on shifting sand and known to be such by Equitable Life management and by the regulator.</p>
<p class="contents">So how did Equitable Life get away with it? They were operating under an EU Directive which was supposedly policed by the responsible UK Regulator. The Regulator knew the foundations of Equitable Life were ramshackle but hoped against hope that all would come right with time, or else a white knight in shining armour would buy them out. Therefore, the selling was allowed to continue long after it should have been stopped.</p>
<p class="contents">Why did they allow a management structure where the statutory actuary was also the chief executive? Why did they allow Equitable Life to go on selling at home and into other Member States when they were the responsible home regulator and were fully aware of Equitable Life’s condition?</p>
<p class="contents">This is not just a sad tale; it is a tale of negligence. It is just not acceptable for Member States to exonerate their regulators from negligence if the country of origin and the home/host system of regulation is to work in the European single market for financial services.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you must insist in future, in particular in Solvency II, that Member States and their regulators are fully liable for negligence. Member States cannot be allowed to exonerate them from this liability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am personally pleased that the committee of inquiry went beyond the specifics of the Equitable Life case and took a broader look at how transposition and implementation checks are done more generally. The recommendations, based on real-life experience, are important to make sure that in the European Union of 27 we keep sight of what is happening in reality, on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">Your work is vital for our ongoing work on the application of Community law, and the suggestions you make should be reflected in our forthcoming communication. Your work is also crucial for the many victims who have seen their savings disappear. Clearly, direct redress is a matter for the UK authorities and the UK judiciary. The UK Parliamentary Ombudsman’s report, due later this year, will address this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot rule on this, but what is vital for us and for the internal market and consumer confidence, is that policyholders are treated equally, irrespective of their Member State of residence. The Commission also notes broader recommendations on redress; those that call for an answer at European level are being studied. Good transposition starts with good legislation, but questionable compromises with texts in which everyone can read what they want is fruitful ground for poor implementation. This is a joint responsibility – all institutions bear responsibility for this.</p>
<p class="contents">In concluding, may I congratulate the committee of inquiry and the rapporteur, Mrs Wallis, on a job well done. All parties received a fair hearing. We have learned important lessons and take this on board for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
