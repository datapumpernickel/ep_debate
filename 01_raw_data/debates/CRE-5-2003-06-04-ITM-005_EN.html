It is imperative that we think seriously about how to foster and strengthen the transatlantic relationship today. That is the thrust of our questions to the Council and the Commission: the development of the transatlantic partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our view that our shortcomings in common security and defence policy have been ruthlessly exposed by the Iraq conflict and that, in consequence, has badly damaged the transatlantic partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that intergovernmental action still has the upper hand, and that is at the expense of the <span class="italic">méthode communautaire</span> in the transatlantic relationship. Joint structures which we could develop with institutions in Brussels, perhaps under the European Convention, will assist in greater coordination. But unless the Member States demonstrate a political will to pursue joint action, the development of the common defence and security policy in the context of the transatlantic alliance will not have the force that it both demands and deserves.</p>
<p class="contents">As President Bush said earlier this week in Poland, the common values that underpin that transatlantic relationship are the common foreign policy element that can bring the European Union together with the USA. However, we cannot afford to behave in an erratic, inconsequential and fragmented manner. The USA is such a strong partner that if the European Union cannot speak with one voice – if not a common voice, perhaps a single voice, but at least a coordinated voice – then we will continue to fall behind in the transatlantic partnership. The European Union in this context is facing its most serious crisis of the last decade.</p>
<p class="contents">The question today, which we look to the Commissioner and to the Council of Ministers to answer, is whether or not we can return to a real partnership with the USA. Can we give that partnership the new dynamism that the Committee on Foreign Affairs believes it demands and deserves, and can we be a full partner of the USA, or must we always feel that we are falling behind? We see that there is potential for a dramatic renewal of the transatlantic alliance, and here the partnership between the EU and the USA plays the most fundamental role.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we see a stronger Europe as a condition for the very survival of Nato. It is not just the European Union that has been damaged by the conflict in Iraq and by the outfall of that conflict; Nato and the United Nations have also been seriously damaged. Most Member States of the European Union are an integral part of Nato, and even those who are not still believe that Nato is the fundamental guarantee for European Atlantic stability. We, therefore, seek reassurance this afternoon that the Council of Ministers and the Commission share our view on this and that they too feel that a stronger Europe will mean a stronger Nato. Can we from the European Union – those of us who are members and non-members – strengthen the Nato-Euro-Atlantic Alliance, since it is still a fundamental guarantee for European stability? We therefore seek to discuss what purpose the Atlantic Alliance now serves, how the Atlantic Alliance should be structured and what means should be placed at its disposal. Indeed, Nato itself needs reform, in particular with regard to military restructuring.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had many discussions lately in the context of the common security and defence policy, including with the Commissioner himself last night in the Western European Union-European Parliament joint dialogue on military restructuring, focusing in particular on full cooperation between EU Member States and our heavy investments in the modern technologies. But how can we achieve that most effectively within the Nato context, and perhaps in a less costly way? Institutional reform of Nato is also something we see as imperative.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, we seek a coherent performance for the European Union both at home and abroad, based on consistent strategic thought and action. We look forward to a full debate this afternoon to enable us to kick-start, with the real dimension it deserves, a proper transatlantic relationship in the post-Iraq context. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Yiannitsis,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council shares the honourable Member’s deep concern about the state of relations between the Union and the United States. Although these relations basically remain strong, it is clear that their <span class="italic">modus operandi</span> needs to be re-examined by both sides. The Union has made it absolutely clear that it is dealing with relations with the United States as the main priority for its foreign policy. Working together, we can help create a better world for everyone. The issue for the Union is how this objective will be adopted on the basis of the already very broad cooperation taking place in the western Balkans, Afghanistan, the Middle East and in connection with North Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">Focusing attention on issues on which the Union and the United States differ very often conceals this cooperation, which is appreciated by both sides. As the honourable Member of Parliament knows, the High Representative will submit a document to the European Council in Thessaloniki containing recommendations for a global Union strategy in the field of foreign policy and security. A preliminary discussion of the subject could be held in the General Affairs and External Relations Council in June. It is obvious that, although this will be a general strategy, it will also contribute to the development of EU-USA relations. It is also presumed that it will be based on the existing Union policy in relation, inter alia, to the role of the United Nations. The time is right, given that this will take place just before the EU-USA summit in Washington on 25 June.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as the development of the foreign and security policy is allowing the Union to deal more efficiently with recent events, including its cooperation with the United States in the Middle East, Afghanistan or the western Balkans, in the field of the European security and defence policy, improving European military capabilities continues to be a high priority for the Union, so that the Union can become a more efficient partner of the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council continues to take the view that a multilateral approach is still always the best way to resolve the various problems that we face today in various parts of the world. The Council has not expressed an opinion on the question of adding the principle of reinforced cooperation in the field of the ESDP to the new Treaty. When we completed the New Transatlantic Agenda, we stated that we were committed to the objective of constructing a new European architecture in the field of security in which ΝΑΤΟ, the Union, the OSCE and the Council of Europe would play complementary and mutually reinforcing roles.</p>
<p class="contents">This was our position in 1995 and it remains our position today. The New Transatlantic Agenda provides the most extensive framework for cooperation with the United States. The action plan may perhaps now be outdated, but that does not apply to the New Transatlantic Agenda. The dialogue we have with the United States is already intensive, with countless continual contacts at all levels. What we need is not more meetings but perhaps to focus our attention more. We hope that the development of an overall Union strategy will renew the dialogue with the United States and increase its usefulness to the situations developing around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Cooperation is still an absolute necessity in order to combat the scourge of terrorism. Following 11 September 2001, our cooperation has extended beyond all expectations on both sides. Over and above what is being said about differences, there is very often ignorance on both sides of the Atlantic about the essential and specific work being carried out jointly in order to combat terrorism. The United States need Europe, just as we need the United States if we want to be successful in combating the challenges of this century.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is fully aware of the fact that, if we are to succeed, we need to deal not only with the symptoms but also with the causes. And this presupposes mobilising resources in many and varied sectors, in the economic, social and development as well as the political sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the transatlantic legislative dialogue is an exceptionally important element in transatlantic relations. Whereas the Council's contacts are to a great extent with the government of the United States, Parliament can play a vital role by reinforcing its dialogue with the members of Congress, in the aim of promoting an understanding of the concerns and priorities of the peoples of the European Union. The Council is not authorised to dictate to civil society the role which it can play in this dialogue. However, it has encouraged the development of the four specialist dialogues and maintains the view that, together with the numerous networks of universities, institutes, laboratories, ideas and so on, they can make an important contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">No more cooperation frameworks are needed. What is needed in the dialogue with the United States is for each side to be carefully informed of the other side's opinions and mutual action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Madam President, there are a number of interesting questions framed by Mr Brok which hint at concerns we should try to address about the good health of our current dialogue with the United States. Those on both sides of the Atlantic who are already engaged in the intensive preparations for next month's EU-US summit to which the Presidency referred and in finalising an impressive list of deliverables, should, I believe, be able to reassure the honourable Member.</p>
<p class="contents">That we are emerging from a period of strain in the transatlantic relationship is not in dispute. In some respects it would have been a matter for greater concern if the trauma of a war had not prompted such a heartfelt debate. Nor do I doubt that some of the problems thrown into relief by the war in Iraq have deeper roots. I have spoken in this place and elsewhere of longer-term trends in some circles in the United States which are properly a cause of concern to Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all we must encourage political leaders and public opinion in the United States to resist those who argue in favour of overturning 50 years of American internationalism and multilateralism in pursuit of an illusory sense of security. Whatever their motivation, those in the United States who reject multilateralism must know that such an approach contains a depressing element of self-fulfilling prophecy. Multilateralism without the US may well fail. But those of us who advocate multilateralism also bear a responsibility: to ensure that it produces practical, effective and timely results.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an important debate. But it must not overshadow the realities of transatlantic ties which are, in many crucial respects, broadening and deepening. Having dialogue does not necessarily imply that we always agree, or that we agree on everything. But we agree to manage our differences and to continue the dialogue. We disagree on the Kyoto Protocol, but will still work together on carbon sequestration and soon on hydrogen research. We threaten the United States with FSC retaliatory measures and they take us to the WTO because they think that we are too slow in approving new genetically-modified products. But Europe and the US remain the largest trading partners in the world, and conflicts account for only a fraction of our total trade. Three quarters of all foreign direct investment in United States is European, half of America's foreign direct investment is in Europe. Europe invests more in Texas than America invests in Japan; American investments in the Netherlands are about twice the figure for American investments in Mexico.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course our dialogue with the United States reaches far beyond the Commission’s traditional domain of trade and economic relations. In the aftermath of September 11th 2001, we have made significant progress in police cooperation and in tackling sources of funding for terrorists. Soon we will finalise agreements on mutual legal assistance and on extradition. We are working closely with the US on a range of issues concerning transport security. And, building on the experience of EU-US cooperation in the Balkans, we are already working together on the reconstruction of Afghanistan. Now that the UN has established a political framework for Iraq in the post-Saddam period, we hope soon to be in a position to assess how we can contribute there.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the transatlantic economic partnership,<span class="bold"> </span>a framework for a close economic relationship was agreed at the Summit in London in 1998. We have an Action Plan incorporating a range of initiatives including technical barriers to trade, procurement, mutual recognition, intellectual property and competition. In multilateral fora we have co-operated closely in efforts to drive forward the Doha Development Agenda. Bilaterally, we have progressed on mutual recognition and on the new Positive Economic Agenda agreed last year. In support of the government dialogue both Europe and United States have recently reconfirmed their commitment to the Transatlantic Business Dialogue in a more focused format.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the point on different economic models, we do not see the differences between NAFTA and the FTAA, on the one hand, and the European Union, on the other, as obstacles to a closer transatlantic economic relationship. Rather we see them as different paths towards a common destination: greater global economic integration. The regional convergence of collective preferences can be addressed in the multilateral context in a fair and constructive way, but also in bilateral terms, notably by focusing on the identification of sectoral and mutually beneficial initiatives that have a direct positive impact on business and market conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the question of global challenges, for example, the environment, justice, migration, social and ethnic conflicts, clearly the report card on our co-operation is mixed. We have made a great deal of progress on justice; we have less of a meeting of minds on environmental targets.</p>
<p class="contents">In the realm of development assistance strategies, both Europe and the United States are committed to the new global partnership for development. We will work together in seeking to integrate developing countries into the world economy<span class="bold">. </span>In all these respects we are committed to the principle of complementarity<span class="italic"> </span>and ensuring the most efficient and effective use of donor funds in development programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">In the humanitarian field, we are also firmly committed to work towards greater effectiveness and complementarity of efforts, and our own agencies and American agencies work well together in order to try to accomplish this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the proposal for a report on future transatlantic relations, the House may recall that I addressed this issue perhaps a shade argumentatively in a speech to this assembly a year ago. As I said then, I do not believe that the problems we face derive from a lack of strategy. The goals and vision for our relationship, as expressed in the 1995 New Transatlantic Agenda, are still valid. Given the stormy waters we have traversed since then I understand the desire of some to review our course. But, it is precisely because we are still recovering from the rigours of this crossing that we should take a little time to steady ourselves and ensure that any new long-term strategy is not misdirected by the emotions and pressures of the short term. This is all the more true at a time when the European Union is engaged in a fundamental review of its own purpose and structures – including a new European Security Strategy – and the US is heading towards the early stages of a presidential election campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances there is every risk that any such review would be characterised, at least by those outside it, as further evidence of the alleged 'crisis' in European Union-United States relations. Instead we need to focus on the resolution of practical problems, whilst engaging in a more low-key dialogue with our American counterparts, preferably face-to-face rather than through the loudspeakers of our respective media. The role of the European Parliament will be essential in this regard. Of course we look to work with you to generate new ideas on the transatlantic relationship, and I hope Parliament itself will use its independence and wisdom to challenge us with some of the themes which should be included in a future strategy. We also look to the experience that you and your constituents bring to bear on the policies formulated in Brussels. Above all we need you to engage with your counterparts in Congress to ensure that the European case is given full weight in the intellectual and legislative debates in Washington.</p>
<p class="contents">There are just two points I would like to make in addition as a brief footnote. First of all the House has probably heard me say before that there is very little that we want to achieve in Europe which we are not more likely to achieve if we can work in cooperation with the United States. It is almost equally the case that many, if not most, of the things that the United States wants to achieve are more likely to be achievable if the United States can work with Europe. That was a point made both explicitly and implicitly in the recent American security strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">A partnership is different from rivalry. Equally, partners are entitled to have opinions of their own. We should not feel under any obligation to find out from Washington what our opinions as Europeans should be before we express them. So I very much hope that we will give one another, from time to time, the benefit of the doubt and will recognise that the world and we ourselves are better off if America and Europe are able to work in partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">One final point: I suppose it is possible to frame a view of relations for the future in terms of the solidarity that we enjoyed in the years after the Second World War, when Europe, principally, pressed for the security structures which led to the establishment of Nato and when America pressed for the economic and political integration which led to the establishment of the Common Market and eventually to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is folly not to recognise how much changed geostrategically with the end of the Cold War and with the collapse of the Berlin Wall. I hope that in developing a relationship for the future, we will base it on today's realities and future realities, not on the warm after-glow of a remarkably successful partnership in the second half of the last century. If we can do as well as that again we will be extremely fortunate. But if we are to do as well as that, we have to look at the problems of the future through the prism of today's challenges and not through the prism of yesterday's successes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Elles (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Madam President, this is an excellent occasion to have a discussion on the transatlantic partnership, now that the Iraq conflict is over and the dust is settling in the desert and before the Council and Commission head to Washington at the end of this month.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to my group that whereas in the 1980s the security partnership underpinned the transatlantic relationship and we had economic differences, now the economic market and integration on trade and investment are underpinning the transatlantic relationship, while the security side is looking somewhat fragile.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, for reasons which they both express clearly, the Council and Commission today see everything in the reasonably short term, rather than providing a longer-term vision of our relationship with the United States. An American diplomat expressed this nicely a few days ago: he said that we, in Europe, are looking at problems from a 2003 perspective: the problems of building the European Union, our foreign policy and the beginnings of an external strategy. The United States, on the other hand, is looking much more to the problems of 2020, with the weapons of mass destruction and a whole range of other things, on a global basis, which we tend not to do. The message which should be sent to the summit is therefore that politics, economics and security policy in the post-Cold War world are all beginning to be closely intertwined.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, as regards politics. Yes, we need to understand each other, as the Council President has said, but surely we need more collaboration, not just in particular instances, such as the war against terrorism: we need a long-term framework to get to grips with that problem and shift the emphasis from a Community of values to a Community of action, dealing with problems of AIDS in the Third World, nuclear proliferation and a range of other things which Europe and America face jointly as global challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in economics. We know, as the Commissioner has said, that global economic challenges bring us closer together, but surely it is by developing closer linkages, by developing a transatlantic market – much of that is already in place, but we need to add on financial services, the digital economy, competition policy and other things – that we can complete a transatlantic market over the next decade.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, in security policy, where we have the greatest difficulty, we have to ask the questions: will Europe have the military capability? Does it have the political will ever to emerge as a partner with the United States?</p>
<p class="contents">In concluding, it seems to me that we need a long-term European strategy to know what we want before we can shape a transatlantic strategy and think on similar terms with the Americans. Secondly, we need a transatlantic summit which takes a strategic view, rather than looking at particular instances and particular problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the big idea is this transatlantic market where we need to mobilise our business and political communities and listen to those we represent so that we can shape the world of tomorrow to our mutual benefit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Leadership by means of multinational cooperation has been replaced by a global unilateralist approach, the strategies of containment and dissuasion by the doctrine of pre-emptive attack and the restrictions imposed by participation in alliances and multilateral institutions by the creation of made-to-measure coalitions in which a form of subordination based on the notion that ‘you are either with me or against me’ tend to predominate. Many of us in Europe believe that this way of thinking, rather than producing a Pax Americana, may actually produce significant American chaos in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this context, if Europe wishes to meet its responsibilities it must turn itself into an organisation capable of playing a significant role on the international stage and, in order to achieve this, European policy must permanently pursue the objective of multilateralising the United States – an objective which is not entirely out of reach if we consider that opinion polls indicate that almost two-thirds of the American public prefer multilateral approaches to unilateral ones.</p>
<p class="contents">Within a renewed relationship we must accept clearly that there are significant discrepancies, that there are many differences of perception and approach but there are also many shared views and potential points of agreement. If we accept this contrasting situation we will be able to make progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I would finally like to say that I believe that positions expressed by the High Representative and Commissioner Patten, as well as the specific proposals presented by the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, are aimed in the right direction and we will support them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner Patten is right. The most pressing world problems cannot, and should not, be solved by the United States alone. Whether these problems concern weapons of mass destruction, human rights, poverty, religious conflicts or lack of democracy, it is vitally important for America and Europe to join forces. Europeans must join Bush in showing the West's neo-progressive face to the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union can be Washington's fully-fledged partner only if it acts like one. If the French-German axis turns away from Washington, while the British-Polish axis moves towards Bush, we will end up not making any headway at all. We must put the trauma of Iraq to one side and, as the European Union, draft a joint global strategy with the United States. Two strategies are too many, and there is no room for either inflated national egos or conservative ideological agendas. Let us now reunite Europe and America using a pragmatic approach, in other words the D'66 approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In other words, they expressed their desire for a relationship between the US and European people which contributes to peace in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">If it is shown that the US State Department was providing misinformation when it said that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq – and we are seeing that this was merely a manipulation – and if we remember that in the document from that Department of 20 September 2002, the UN, the European Union and international law were dispensed with and it is stated simply that the United States are going to dictate laws in the future, I believe we are facing a great threat to the world and also to Europe.</p>

We cannot build transatlantic relations just by repeating over and over again that that is what we want.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, transatlantic relations were determined by the stand-off between the totalitarian regimes of communist countries on the one hand and the West on the other. This was the point made by Mr Patten towards the end of his speech. This situation changed following the fall of Communism. If, therefore, we want to have transatlantic relations, we need to redefine the relationship. We need to ask ourselves whether the United States and Europe are bound to have the same interests nowadays. Prior to the fall of Communism, that had to be the case, but is this still true today? Having formulated the question the answer becomes obvious. The United States and Europe do not now share the same vision or the same interests. This is true both in terms of geo-strategy and in terms of economics. A new transatlantic relationship cannot therefore be built by repeatedly expressing our desire for it. We need to come up with a completely new definition of our relations with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take a very simple example. We now have the euro. If we are honest, the euro divides the European Union from the United States, as the euro is the dollar’s main rival. Therefore, our strategic and economic interests differ. If we want to reinvigorate our economies and re-launch Europe, we need to pose a question that is of fundamental importance for Europe. At a global level, we must ask whether we are bound forever to pay for energy and oil in dollars. Where is it decreed that we must pay in dollars for the oil and gas we buy from Russia, Saudi Arabia or Iran? We must have the will in terms of strategy and economic policy to make the euro a safe currency to ensure we have the funds to bring about economic recovery. The United States is doing just this today. A figure of USD 8 billion per day has been quoted. The US needs investment to pay off its debts. We therefore need to strengthen the role of the euro as a safe currency that rivals the dollar.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to discuss the subject of transatlantic relations, you must find the courage to put this problem to the United States. The real stakes are these. We will not succeed in building a new transatlantic relationship if we in the European Union do not have our own doctrine on all the strategic problems, on all the military problems, on our vision of the world and on what we want in the world. We need to ensure that we define our interests. Only then can we enter into discussions with the United States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Do we want to renew a transatlantic partnership or do we believe that it is in the best interests of the European Union to distance ourselves from the US Government at this time?</p>
<p class="contents">If a renewed transatlantic partnership is desirable it is certainly not going to be easy to achieve because of the ongoing differences between many EU governments and the present US administration. However, I believe that our common interests and concerns are best served by the European Union and the US Government working more closely together on a wide-ranging set of issues. We should not forget that over the last 50 years we have worked together to fashion an international legal order covering not just trade and security issues, but also issues relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms. It is equally important that the high emotions that exist at this time do not cause us to exaggerate our differences across a range of policy matters.</p>
<p class="contents">We should seek to address the relationship between the European Union and the USA by taking a careful and measured approach, rather than dealing with this very important relationship in a knee-jerk fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">The bottom line is simply this: I believe that the Union and the USA should work together to preserve our common interests, to minimise our collective differences, to maximise our own influence for good in the world. For example, our collective economies are only achieving moderate success at this particular time. One of the ways in which we can help to revive our economies is to ensure that the present deadlock in trade negotiations is broken. We must guarantee that the forthcoming World Trade Organisation talks, which will take place in September, are a real success. We must advance a positive agenda on trade matters and resolve disputes before they go to the WTO process.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also recall that we have worked very closely together in the battle against international terrorism. Issues that we have addressed together range from improving security in airlines to the issue of mutual extradition agreements. We are working closely together in the Balkans and Afghanistan. In Afghanistan the European Union has a bigger military presence than the United States. The EU is the biggest donor of humanitarian aid to the Afghan people.</p>
<p class="contents">The Middle East process has a better chance of success if the European Union and the United States work together with all the key contracting parties in the region so as to ensure that the present road map for peace guarantees both Israeli and Palestinian statehood and security in the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Regrettably, it is precisely these elements that have been absent from the transatlantic partnership over the past few months. The most painful manifestation of transatlantic, and at the same time European, discord was the public controversy over Iraq. We on this side of the Atlantic Ocean have all the more reason to first search our own hearts. In short, how should we take the transatlantic partnership further?</p>
<p class="contents">It is primarily the global safety situation that jumps out at you. Terrorism – of whatever ideological or religious hue – calls for a joint transatlantic approach. In concrete terms, destabilising forces in the Middle East may not play the European Union off against either one another or against the United States. The West's coordinated fight against terrorism makes association agreements and trade agreements with states from that region worthy of condemnation. Do the Council and the Commission share this vision? After all, Syria and Iran are on the agenda; is that not so, Commissioner Patten?</p>
<p class="contents">There is a great deal at stake: the European Union's political credibility – including in the eyes of my electorate – and the solidity and durability of the transatlantic partnership. Militarily speaking, the European Union is now clearly the weaker partner in the transatlantic alliance. What is more obvious than a more substantial input from the Member States within NATO? This would promote the transatlantic partnership. European military alternatives, on the other hand, would erode the crucial bond of safety with the United States. Moreover, I cannot see any reason why we should have faith in initiatives of that kind. Let us in Europe be realistic and, above all, be reliable friends and real allies to the Americans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the First World War that became the deciding factor in preventing the expansion of imperial Germany. In the Second World War the US contribution was decisive in delivering Germany and France from Hitler’s yoke and the rest of Europe from his aspirations to power. When the Cold War ended in the break-up of the Soviet Union and the liberation of countries that had been under the yoke of Central European communism and the Soviet Union it was decidedly the result of President Ronald Reagan’s arms race, which the Soviet economy and its social system could not bear.</p>
<p class="contents">When we say today that relations between the United States and Europe have reached a crisis it is more about a crisis in Europe’s internal relations and a crisis in relations between certain individual countries and the United States. The way certain countries go in for unilateralism in EU internal affairs shows we are still light years away from a common foreign and security policy in crisis situations.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the 25 European countries supported the approval of the UN Security Council regarding starting a war with Iraq. Most do not accept America’s insistence on being able to take up a position outside the international organisation in matters of war crimes. We disagree over the importance of the Kyoto Agreement and each day there are talks to resolve differences of opinion on economic matters. All this notwithstanding, the basic values we tend to share and considerations of security common to us both, where Europe is becoming more and more the recipient than the provider, are a firm basis for looking to the future and supporting the transatlantic partnership and genuinely constructing the kind of action programme that my colleague, James Elles, just mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Europe can no longer catch up with the United States in the area of defence technology; and perhaps we do not need to. We can and must, however, resolve our differences and aspire to a common foreign and defence policy. Only in this way will we be a worthy partner in matters that unite us and in those we disagree with the United States over, a partner that is sufficiently strong for our views to be heeded in the United States, whose largest trading partner we are, as we heard concerning US investment in Europe. That shows that for the United States the positive development of our relationship is important, but for us it is vital. We can accept the boycott on French wines in America if as a counterweight America places an order for a hundred Airbus planes, as was the case just a week or so ago. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, for that to happen, a better foundation is required at this side of the ocean. Above all, we need to try to establish what we ourselves want and not get bogged down so much by what we do not want the Americans to do. I think that this will be a very decisive factor indeed in future.</p>
<p class="contents">If we in the European Union want to leave our own mark on this discussion, we will once again need to define together what is essential to us. I hope that the strategy that Mr Solana will shortly be tabling will make a significant contribution to this. The European Union itself must be able, and have the courage, to take more responsibility. This can be done most effectively by continuing to build on our own defence identity in a dynamic manner, but also by carrying out security tasks independently, in – for example – Macedonia, and soon in Africa too.</p>
<p class="contents">We must learn to make more efficient use of our defence capabilities, but not avoid a possible discussion about higher defence outgoings. The EU must be committed to a wide range of security, conflict prevention being its key priority. Experience in this field and the instruments that the European Union has at its disposal must be better coordinated and used more effectively. Involvement in multilateral frameworks, such as the United Nations, forms part of this. Security is sustainable only if it is founded on international cooperation. This is the core message, I think, to the Americans, who go all out for their country's military power. NATO can play a bridging role, but only if the opinion which many Europeans have about security is done justice. We want political equality in transatlantic relations, but there is little point in asking for it if we remain divided ourselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As I do not have a great deal of time, I will only touch on some of these questions.</p>
<p class="contents">First, there is the question of Iraq. Can we really say that the issue of the war has been dealt with when the European Union has given its blessing to the United States having complete control of Iraq? Should we engage in a war against terrorism instigated by the bellicose stance of the United States that seeks to dominate, not to share power? This is just increasing the threat. Should we then allow ourselves to be engulfed in a genuine currency war, started this time by the United States? Should we give in to President Bush’s decrees yet again by setting aside what remains of the European social model? Should we set aside the provisions on retirement, for example, in the face of wholesale opposition as exemplified by the large demonstrations in France and Austria? Lastly, what use will the meeting of the WTO in Cancun be if the European Union does not stand up to the United States’ continuing failure to move on certain issues, especially that of allowing poor countries to access generic medicines?</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is at a crossroads. It may choose to hide behind the strategic doctrine entitled ‘for a new American century’. Alternatively it may choose to adopt a truly independent policy. If we choose the latter, how can we achieve such a policy without addressing the huge expectations of the southern hemisphere and without freeing ourselves from the ultraliberal policy that exacerbates inequalities and frustrates all attempts to promote development? We must listen to the people of Europe. They do not want Europe to be a poor relation of the United States. They do not want Europe to be overcautious. They are hoping and praying for an independent and responsible Europe. They long for a Europe that promotes the interests of all in working for a world that is safer because it is more humane. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to the famous CFSP, I hope and believe that the Convention will resolve the political gap, appointing a Minister for External Affairs and avoiding losses of international credibility such as that which we have suffered as a result of the Iraq crisis. With regard to the economic sector, however, I think the best solution is not so much to intervene via any WTO agreements as to draw up a single list which addresses the issues in terms of tax and trade concessions, for that will allow us to avoid further instances of bureaucratic chaos.</p>
<p class="contents">Otherwise, I cannot see us achieving anything. The so-called partnership agreements relating to what is our primary market in terms of both investment and trade will play a major role if we are able to reinvigorate them, simplifying the issue by compiling a list, an agreement that could be concluded by the Commission with NAFTA, first and foremost. On the eve of enlargement, I believe this is a significant way of boosting our economy and the political content of our foreign policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have an opportunity after the recent events to rebuild and improve the transatlantic relationship – that has to be the challenge we take on board. The summit at the end of this month will give us the opportunity – which we should grasp – to begin building that new future. We cannot allow the past to overshadow the future.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we have to realise that dialogue must involve both sides of the Atlantic. My experience in the last 12 months has been that the United States has not been engaged or focused and, to some extent, we must make it understand how Europe operates and works at this moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The legislative dialogue must be restarted. We almost had it, and the US pulled out at the last moment. However, I will not give up on that particular point. We must have an early-warning system in place to pinpoint areas of potential disagreement at the earliest possible moment. To achieve this we will require radical rethinking of how we have conducted our relations to date within the Commission and Parliament. I will use the meeting at the end of the month between Congress and the Members of this Parliament to further promote the dialogue and ensure that we can restart it. There is no point using excellent fine words that we put on paper if we do not have the follow-through on both sides of the Atlantic and if we do not deliver. That is the important point.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we all have to take responsibility for what has happened and to shoulder a little of the blame. This Parliament has a central role to play in this and must take on board its responsibilities, but the Council and the Commission must give us greater cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Désir (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, as has already been said, I believe it is desirable for Europe and the United States to work together in partnership. It stands to reason. All this rhetoric about partnership should not mean, however, that we evade the choices Europe has to make and the difficulty we are faced with at present. Contrary to what some honourable Members have said, we in Europe are not responsible for the erosion of the type of historic links we have with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">We are having to deal with a very particular type of administration. It was extremely unilateralist from the outset. Initially, however, it did not adopt a particularly interventionist line. One section of the administration used the trauma of 11 September to impose its own unilateralist and extremely interventionist agenda which predated those terrible events. Faced with this situation, Europe has a decision to make. On the one hand, it could be argued that nothing can be done to counter the will of the United States, given the power it has on the world stage. In that case, there would be nothing to do except to give in to the United States and to go along with them, even when it comes to lies and exposing ourselves to ridicule, just like those who tried to make us believe that intervening in Iraq was justified because weapons of mass destruction posed an imminent threat. If we were to go down that road, Mr Elles’ proposal would make sense. It amounts to a free trade zone or in other words a new version of the Transatlantic Market Place. We must, however, bear in mind that this would mean setting aside the Union’s common external trade policy. The creation of this huge market would amount to the United States annexing the European Economic Area. Decisions would be taken in Washington. The United States would not be willing to allow Europe to have its say in decision-making on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we could take the view that Europe has things to say on the world stage and a vision to promote of a world order based on the rule of law. This vision would entail fairer relations between the North and the South. In our view this is important if we are to create a world order that offers everyone greater security. If this is what we want to do, this is not the time to toe the line. It is the time to promote a common foreign and defence policy. There is a paradox here in that Mr Elles said we need to strengthen the common foreign and defence policy while at the same time suggesting we make certain concessions to the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, if we believe we should promote the statute of Rome and an International Criminal Court, if we believe that we should argue for the Kyoto agreements, the non-proliferation treaty and the end of atomic testing, we must assert our independence. Relations between the European Union and the United States must be rebuilt on the basis of this independence. Our American friends will have to accept this. The current US administration will not last forever and I believe that our friendship will win out in the end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, France and Germany are not the European Union. They certainly do not speak for Europe. It is not accurate or helpful, therefore, to describe their difficulties with the USA as a transatlantic rift between the EU and the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is not at all healthy for the European Union to construct itself as Europe's interlocutor with the USA on defence and security matters. There is already a forum through which European nations address transatlantic security matters – that is called Nato.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the idea that the European security and defence policy has anything whatsoever to do with reinforcing Nato is, at best, disingenuous and at worst a political deceit. ESDP is not about sharing the defence burden, it is not about strengthening the European pillar of Nato. It is about adding to European Union competences, taking forward the political ambition of European integration and empowerment. It adds no additional military capabilities. It merely establishes a different planning and decision-making regime that specifically excludes the Americans.</p>
<p class="contents">When the leaders of the European countries sit down with the Americans and other allies there is a remarkable unanimity. We have seen this in the last few days at Evian with the G8 and at the Nato ministerial meeting in Madrid. This is not unilateralism.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet when the same European leaders come together in an EU context some strange mental transformation takes place and they seem to speak an altogether different language. We should be reinforcing transatlantic solidarity, developing our joint capacities to tackle terrorism, to deal with the WMD threat and to deploy capable military forces wherever they might be needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the dangers that we all face I cannot understand why the European governments imagine that there is any advantage in discussing security and defence in a separate room to the Americans. Partnership of the European nations with the United States requires not just improved capabilities but also political will. This is sadly lacking at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The greatest service that could be done to Western security and transatlantic relations would be to draw back ESDP under the Nato umbrella and for us all to work together in solidarity for common ends. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
