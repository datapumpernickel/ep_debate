More specifically, the programme should help shift the expected increase in international road freight of 12 billion tonnes per km per year from congested roads to short-sea shipping, rail and inland waterway services.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme will be operational by 2003 and will last until 2010. For the five-year period from 2003-2007, we propose an overall budget of EUR 115 million. Marco Polo is an ambitious and pragmatic programme, geared to concretely improving services and logistics in the short-sea, rail and inland waterway freight markets. At the same time, it provides for appropriate monitoring and control to exclude unacceptable distortions of competition in the market. Marco Polo is thus more than a single continuation of the PACT Programme, which came to an end on 31 December 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">Marco Polo will be able to co-fund actions leading to modal shifts and better practices in all segments of the short-sea shipping, rail and inland waterway freight logistic markets. It will not be restricted to the combined transport sector as PACT was. Marco Polo will also support actions involving countries outside the European Union and candidate countries, in particular the applicant countries, whereas PACT excluded them. The programme also gives clear policy directions to industry on what changes the Community expects and needs in the freight market.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, it proposes funding for three different types of actions: modal shift actions, catalyst actions and common learning actions. A few words on each of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Modal shift actions: these involved start-up aid for new services in the non-road freight market.</p>
<p class="contents">Catalyst actions: this aid is also limited in time and should lead to viable non-road freight services. However, these actions are more ambitious than modal shift actions. They should change the way that non-road freight transport is conducted in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Common learning actions: these seek to improve cooperation and share know-how in an increasingly complex transport and logistics industry. In order to achieve a real European added value, the Commission proposes to support only projects of significant impact on the market, which implies sufficiently large contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">I have outlined to you the Commission's objective in setting up the programme and I now look forward with great interest to the debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have several important points to make on my report concerning the Marco Polo Programme. Firstly, this programme must strike a proper balance. It would be extremely counterproductive to bury business in yet more red tape, notwithstanding the need for efficient scrutiny of how money is spent and how effective the programme is proving to be. Secondly, in my view as rapporteur, it is essential that the programme remains market-driven. This provides an excellent opportunity to show that the EU is prepared to help, not hinder, business, as is so often the accusation.</p>
<p class="contents">I especially welcome the committee's decision to lower the thresholds involved. This is something I have been adamant in fighting for, not just on behalf of numerous small and medium-sized enterprises in my own region, but also for SMEs in general which, if it were not for these low thresholds, would miss out entirely on funding which is there to help them achieve the goals of the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to the new proposed new thresholds, companies could work together or alone in putting forward innovative projects that will benefit the industry as a whole. Keeping the original thresholds would mean that small businesses had once again been ignored by the European Union, which would seem to be merely interested – from the Commission's own comments – in showcase schemes. This, whilst looking good, does not benefit the people who pay for them – the taxpayers. In order to advance the immediate aims of the Marco Polo Programme – those of improving the environmental performance of freight transport and reducing road congestion, albeit in a relatively small way – this lowering of subsidy thresholds is crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">I also view as a welcome addition to this report, and one that well accompanies the reduction in these thresholds, the simplified definitions. This may not sound much to those of us who have been working on the report since March, but to the already overburdened managers of companies in the freight transport system all over Europe it would prove a great help in making applications for assistance for projects much easier. Indeed, these definitions could well prove to be the difference between companies not fully understanding the system – and hence not bothering to apply – and SMEs having much greater confidence in approaching the Commission with bids for their own innovative projects.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point reiterates one of the main aims of this proposal: that of reducing bottlenecks. I agree with the Commission that congestion threatens both the environment and the operational working of the whole freight transport sector. It is therefore imperative that we concentrate, in practical ways, on how to defuse these bottlenecks, especially around sea ports.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to some of my earlier points, I feel that the lowering of the thresholds and the simplified definitions also apply here. It would be wrong to infer that only large-scale projects can reduce bottlenecks. I believe that innovative projects, on a smaller scale, can have just as much practical use – indeed if not more so – than those costing many millions of euros. Thus, given the final outcome of the report in committee, I reiterate the necessity of our open approach – the carrot rather than the stick – designed to encourage the participation of the business community. Success will very much depend on enterprises coming forward with their ideas, not those thrust upon them by regulation. I would commend the report to the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Bradbourn has made very sensible suggestions and has a feel for the needs of the travelling public, in particular those in cars who are delayed by heavy freight vehicles. I applaud the entire Marco Polo Programme, which is badly needed to stop congestion. I am a civil engineer by background. I served on the Transport Committee in the House of Commons in London for eight years and know only too well by travelling up and down to my north-west region from London how very difficult it is to do something about this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I applaud the fact that new initiatives will be encouraged by this programme, ensuring that traffic is phased into junctions by using light-emitting diodes etc., things which are cheap but which are very effective and absolutely vital.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure that this scheme is properly monitored. That is the idea behind the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. We emphasise that, half way through the period up to 2010, there should be a thorough audit and investigation of what has been achieved. I agree entirely with Mr Bradbourn that we should not just go for large schemes, because out there the logistics industry – and I applaud its efforts up and down the country and across all countries in the European Union – has a lot of ideas that it wants to start up. That is where much improvement can take place.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that the Council is anxious to reduce the amount of money being made available for this project. However, I hope that even if that does take place, we will show by the mid-term review that we are getting excellent value for money and that the budget should be raised in future years.

The purpose of the Marco Polo programme is to reduce the social costs of traffic and, obviously, this basic idea and aim are very much worthy of support. But as the old saying goes, ‘All that glitters is not gold’. Unfortunately, I see Marco Polo as being part of the Commission’s programme to forcibly shift traffic from the roads to the railways. For this reason I cannot agree with what it says in the White Paper, that shares between the various transport modes should be retained and frozen at their present level until 2010. This cannot be a natural development, because we are barking up the wrong tree.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that road transport is responsible for a lot of congestion and pollution, but that is due to the fact that there simply is no other means of transport that compares to it. Freight transport is forced onto the roads because it is the most effective option. It is the fastest, the most flexible, and, most important of all, the cheapest form of transport for the end user. The citizens of Europe pay for transport and if it does not run efficiently and cheaply in Europe, we all suffer the consequences. In fact, believe me, those who always suffer most are those who have no alternative – those whose means are the smallest of all.</p>
<p class="contents">We should establish good incentives for different modes of transport and consider their overall costs, their benefits and their disadvantages to society as a whole. If we start off that way, it is all the same whether the share of road traffic is 1% or 100%. We need sufficient investment in the whole transport infrastructure, but the EU cannot be primarily responsible for finance, as we do not happen to be a money-dispensing machine.</p>
<p class="contents">Although this idea of the Commission unfortunately has a somewhat faulty basis there is also much that is positive about Marco Polo. The interoperatability of different transport modes, where we get something that works very well from the whole, is important. We must constantly remember that we are using the taxpayer’s money, and we have to use it as efficiently as possible, and certainly not in any populist way. I would like to repeat that there should not be an aim here to reduce road transport but rather reduce its adverse effects, because if a patient is sick you will certainly not cure him by killing him off, but by giving him the proper medicine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a practical instrument that will help us to achieve the aim that we have in transport policy, which is, as you know, to stabilise the modal split at its 1998 levels, or restore it to those levels. Hopefully it will be operational as early as next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Other measures that we envisaged in the White Paper – for example, the first railway package, which we have already adopted, and the second, which we are now working on; cross-financing from road to rail; charges for heavy goods vehicles; internalising external costs – will all only have an effect in the long term or at the very earliest in the medium term if we really get them on track. The Commission's three proposed actions in the programme have clearly been inspired by its experience with PACT. After all, this was a very successful programme, which achieved a great deal over many years, even if the focus is now rather different.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we now have more money than under PACT, the challenge is also greater, and that is why we need to ensure that the programme's scope is very precisely delimited. In the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, in a coalition of common sense in transport policy, we managed by and large to identify the main focus of the instrument. In the plenary, however, we are having to work together to fend off two attempts to render this programme of assistance powerless by extending it.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is a proposal to extend the scope to include intermodal transport. My group opposes the rapporteur's Amendments Nos 8, 10 and 12, because they again seek to contribute, indirectly, to subsidising road freight transport. I do not have anything against intermodality, but that is not the aim this time round; this time it is first and foremost about modal shift.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must reject an extension of the scope to transport prevention actions. My group opposes the amendments re-tabled by the Greens, seeking in addition to carry out actions on transport prevention on this tight budget. I would be happy at any time to support a new programme on transport prevention, but its inclusion here would overstretch the programme and after all we want to implement it strategically. Here, less is more!</p>
<p class="contents">Together we agreed in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism that we do not want any distortions of competition between the environmentally acceptable modes of transport. We have lowered the minimum subsidy thresholds for the actions, as the rapporteur has explained; we have judged cooperation between operators involved in cross-border transport projects – for example in corridor conferences – to be worthy of support, and we want a budget increase to be reconsidered as part of the mid-term review.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Council and the Commission will respond to our ideas quickly so that the programme can start next year, because the increasing problems with road freight transport mean that delay is not an option. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The need to improve the freight transport system in terms of the environment is a vital one, with the amount of traffic continually growing. The enlargement of the EU will also bring with it new challenges as transportation routes get longer.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group supports the Marco Polo programme and is satisfied with the Committee’s proposal. The EU can bring added value to this area by supporting innovative, new technology projects. No mode of transport should be excluded from the programme. Transport chains that may also involve transportation by road must also be included. If a project, in which road haulage companies are included, is good, it must be possible to apply for aid for it. The aim must be to move from a more polluting mode of transport to more environmentally friendly transport solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, it is important that we can also lend our support to improving the existing situation. Improvements can often be made by means of a better cost-benefit ratio rather than by starting on an entirely new project. In concentrating only on new projects there is a clear danger of distortions of competition in relation to the old ones.</p>
<p class="contents">It is right that the regulation should include a separate mention of sea transport and keep the reference to ‘motorways of the seas’. ‘Motorways of the seas’ is also given a separate mention in the White Paper on Transport; it is therefore only natural to include it in this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur said, threshold values for all types of action in the Commission proposal are too high. The threshold values for modal shift projects, catalyst actions and common learning actions must, as the Committee is proposing, be halved. Parliament’s amendments will not radically alter the essentials, but will make certain points in the Commission proposal clearer. We support Amendment No 29 tabled by the Group of the Greens and other amendments which aim to prevent and reduce unnecessary traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme’s budget is fairly modest and the objectives are very ambitious. We think, however, that it is important to set targets that are as ambitious as possible. In the longer term we hope that Marco Polo will prove worthwhile and attract additional funding. We must in addition investigate the possibility of additional finance for important infrastructure projects that supplement the Europe-wide traffic networks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is calculated that goods transport by road in the Union will increase by 50% by 2010 at a rate – as the Commissioner has said quite rightly – of 12 000 million tonnes per kilometre per year, and it is clear that neither the Trans-European Networks nor our environment can endure the brutal impact of this increase. We therefore need to adopt measures which, far from affecting our economic growth and progress, guarantee its sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">The Marco Polo programme is an absolutely essential instrument, but we must ensure that it moves in the right direction. Given the limits on the resources available for this financial instrument, its aid must be focussed strictly towards the transfer of the greatest possible amount of the goods currently transported by road to other forms of transport which are more respectful of the environment and which produce fewer external costs, such as short sea shipping, railways and inland waterways. We have no choice but to sacrifice the intermodality between these latter two alternatives if we do not achieve our priority: to reduce the congestion of the roads.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, as well as a common political will on cross-border projects, we must promote the prevention and reduction of transport needs. We must revise the systems of packaging, industrial logistics, the organisation of production chains, etc., with a view to preventing raw materials, intermediate goods and end products from having to be moved further than is essential. To this end, in business economies we must take account not only of the expenditure generated by transport services but also their external costs properly assessed. Only in that way can we achieve a general awareness which leads to an organisational transformation and a reduction in transport needs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is certainly no cause for celebration in the area of transport. Road transport takes centre stage in the plans of the new Dutch Government. Railways have a rough deal in the investment plans, and inland shipping even more so.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, such an attitude is not conducive to a transport system that can stand the test of time. Considerable investments in infrastructure for the benefit of road transport will not only promote supply, but also demand. On balance, this means that the existing problems are not being addressed. This is why we welcome initiatives such as PACT and Marco Polo as incentives that encourage investments in true solutions and alternatives for (the problems of) road transport in the areas of research, development and operation.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that we enthuse about the Marco Polo programme does not mean that we would not like to make a few minor observations. Not only alternative modes of transport deserve incentives. Initiatives within road transport that lead to a reduction in road miles should also be supported by the Marco Polo programme. In addition, the programme must be tailored to the situation in the sector or sectors. Large projects are bound to have a greater impact, but given the size of most businesses, it is questionable whether such projects will get off the ground in large numbers. Subsidy thresholds must be lowered in order to reach the entire sector, whilst the current budget level must be maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">This lowering of subsidy thresholds is also important for extending sustainable transport services. Indeed, extending capacity has virtually the same effect on transport flows, while the costs are down compared to when a new service is launched.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish off with a remark about the effects of this programme on the various sectors. It strikes me as inevitable that a subsidy for a certain transport sector will affect relations with the other sectors. In my view, the conditions imposed on actual support by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism are fair and logical. Subsidies should not result in effects that go against the Community's interest, particularly against Community policy. In addition, it is undesirable for subsidies to lead to a cargo shift between rail, short sea shipping and inland shipping.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, we are largely satisfied with the proposal as it is now before us and will endorse it accordingly. I hope that our governments will follow suit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, there is also much – if not even more – to criticise. The objective is positive. In the future more freight is to be shifted from road to other more environmentally friendly modes of transport. Ideally, this should check the growth in road freight transport resulting from enlargement of the Union. For my country, Austria, this is an absolutely fundamental political issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The instruments provided to achieve this are also sensible: start-up support for new, non-road freight transport services, which should however be economically viable in the medium term; support for launching freight services or facilities of strategic European interest, and common learning actions to foster more cooperation in the freight logistics market. Working together makes us strong, instead of everyone being against everyone else and opposing anything new. The individual amendments proposed by the European Parliament in the Bradbourn report are also good. The more SME-friendly minimum subsidy threshold deserves a particular mention here.</p>
<p class="contents">That, however, is the absolute limit as far as the praise is concerned. All of the measures that are intended, in the truest sense of the word, to be put in train here are long overdue. For far too long we have talked about more environmentally friendly forms of transport without taking appropriate measures. It should come as no surprise, therefore, that our roads are full and congested while rail and inland waterways have not for some time been performing at the levels of which they could and should be capable.</p>
<p class="contents">A critical question mark should also be placed over the funds allocated. EUR 115 million may be a lot of money, but it is spread over five years and the Marco Polo programme is a different situation yet again for all of the measures that were mentioned just now. Last but not least, I would lament a further serious shortcoming at European Community level. The way that Europe drafts its legal texts, the public will never understand us. With this in mind, I quote from the fifth recital, as also amended by the European Parliament: 'The Marco Polo programme features three types of action: (1) modal shift actions, which should focus on shifting as much cargo as possible under current market conditions from road to the more environmentally acceptable short sea shipping, rail and inland waterways; such actions must not lead to a shift of freight flows from short sea transport, rail or inland waterways to another of these modes, unless the share of freight transport by road in the transport chain is thereby substantially reduced.'</p>

Its predecessor, PACT, was very popular in the United Kingdom with both the public and the private sectors. I am sure Marco Polo will be even more popular in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to thank the rapporteur for ensuring that Marco Polo will be even more business-friendly than PACT was. I agree with the Commissioner that is important that Marco Polo does not lose sight of its main objective, which is to encourage modal shift. Why must we do that? Firstly, because we must tackle pollution. Transport is the fastest-growing source of global warming gases in Europe. Secondly, we must tackle congestion. We must, for example, help switch high-volume, long-distance freight away from the road onto the railways where it belongs.</p>
<p class="contents">Action is also clearly needed at EU level, not just at a national level. After all, only by encouraging the 15 railway companies to work together can some of the artificial national barriers to free movement be removed.</p>
<p class="contents">Action is also needed to encourage greater use of our ports, seas and inland waterways. 40 per cent of freight already goes by sea. That is an area where we can – and because of Marco Polo will – see more growth. Marco Polo will make a difference there.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and most importantly, let us not get carried away with our own rhetoric. Marco Polo is a positive move but, on its own, it is clearly nowhere near enough. The PSE Group urges the Commissioner to encourage more actions like this and encourage the Member States themselves to take on board their own responsibilities to encourage modal shift in a much more dramatic and radical way than we have seen in the past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He can certainly count on my vote in tomorrow's plenary. I particularly support his view that modal shift should not be the programme's only goal. The programme should also look to reduce congestion, lower thresholds and increase accessibility. The goal of the Marco Polo programme should, in fact, be extended, so that the programme can also contribute to the search for and development of more sustainable transport systems. I therefore value this line of approach. Sustainable transport systems cannot be achieved by modal shift actions alone. We must extend these actions to other forms of transport, including not only inland shipping but also short sea shipping, and of course rail transport. Roads remain of crucial importance, with a reduction of traffic congestion by more efficient use of them being the starting point. This is extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me straight to the next point, which is savings in transport. I am pleased with the amendments that the Greens have tabled before the plenary and I will endorse them. A great deal is to be gained from transport saving techniques. These are worth investigating within the framework of the Marco Polo programme. In addition, the important point is made that we must stay one step ahead of developments in transport.</p>
<p class="contents">My objection is that only rather limited resources have been made available over a five-year period. The amount of EUR 150 million has already been mentioned, and this is precious little to follow up PACT, a programme that already proved successful. I had expected the budget to be higher, and that may, in fact, turn out to be necessary. Also, the Member States themselves need to make efforts in this area and must commit themselves to solving problems, so that new opportunities can present themselves for the economy.</p>

Lorries are at their most environmentally friendly when they are off the road. We must therefore focus more on transport prevention. The Marco Polo programme only deals with <span class="italic">other</span> transport, not <span class="italic">less</span> transport. A programme such as Marco Polo must be more ambitious than the current draft. This ambition must also translate into projects geared towards preventing transport. The European Union's aim is to grow annually in economic terms. However, this economic growth goes hand in hand with a growing demand in transport, and what is worse is that this demand for transport now even exceeds economic growth. The correlation between economic growth and transport growth is tragic on different levels The European economy will in this way become increasingly less transport efficient. We drive more miles to achieve the same economic results, with more traffic jams and accidents to boot.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the sudden increase in mileage requires an enormous amount of fossil fuels and causes ecological and social damage. I take issue with the rapporteur's remarks about the doubtfulness surrounding the calculation of external costs and the increasing eco-efficiency of road transport. It is true that the performance of individual lorries is improving, but they are doing more miles. This increase in miles negates the profit gained from using an economical and clean engine. Journeys must be avoided and economic growth must be disconnected from transport growth.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore insist that projects aimed at transport prevention also be given scope within a programme such as Marco Polo and should not be discounted from the outset. Marco Polo is a very important project to us. We would like to see Marco Polo become more ambitious and it should, therefore, also offer opportunities to projects in which transport of this kind is avoided, for that is true innovation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is one supposed to make of the phrasing used to proclaim that one of the aims of the Marco Polo programme is to maintain the module repetition of freight transport at its 1998 levels by promoting a modal shift from road to other transport modes?</p>
<p class="contents">Another gem was the heading 'optimism in infrastructure capacity and logistical concepts'. This sort of mindless gobbledegook means as much to the ordinary citizen of Europe as a text in ancient Sanskrit. The Commission needs to learn that transparency is not about putting things on the website. It is about writing in clear, jargon-free language that ordinary people can understand.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the substantive issue of reducing road congestion and improving the environmental performance of the transport system, I note that this ambitious aim is to be funded to the tune of EUR 115 million over 5 years. That is just EUR 23 million a year to be spent Europe-wide between 15 Member States – or is it to be 25 Member States? Frankly, even if this aim could be achieved by the Commission's financial instrument – and I share Mr Bradbourn's scepticism on this – the amount of money allocated would hardly begin to dent the problem. As always, the Community's ambitions are bigger than our pockets. Therein lies the problem. The money being spent belongs to the taxpayers of Europe, it is drawn from national governments, each of which has its own unique problems. Thus, as always, the Commission is looking for a European problem that does not exist on a European level and then failing to address it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bradbourn's traffic-light solution, however, hardly seems appropriate. The problem in eastern England, the region I represent, is that we have neither decent roads nor decent railways. Yet improving infrastructure would cost more in my part of England than the whole of the budget allocated to this scheme. Given such a pathetic response from the Commission and the clear evidence that this House does not have any better solutions, it would be better to leave transport improvements to national governments. Our government in particular seems well capable of making its own mess of our transport policy without any help from the Commission and its jargon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I particularly welcome the lower threshold for subsidies and the simplified definitions. These measures will be of significant help to SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding SMEs, I hope that the Commission's aim of funding large projects, while understandable, does not mean the exclusion of smaller projects which are more likely to be placed in smaller, peripheral Member States which are nonetheless in great need of help and support in this area. I think of my own country in this context, with its poor road, rail and inland waterway infrastructure. Ireland suffers doubly from safety problems, road congestion and environmental damage.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome this programme, but it should not exclude smaller innovative projects which are deserving of support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to ensure as far as we can that freight is removed from our roads and is placed onto alternative means of transport. Ireland has benefited greatly from EU funding to develop its rail and road infrastructure. It is currently in receipt of monies to develop a new tramway system in Dublin and a tunnel to take freight from the north side of the city – the M50 in the airport area – to the docks, thus keeping unnecessary freight from the city's streets.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to raise a serious problem that has arisen in relation to the completion of the M50 in the Carrickmines area of Dublin. Around EUR 74 million has been allocated to this project. It has been found that an environmental impact assessment study which has been necessary to qualify for EU funds is seriously flawed. It did not identify an internationally important archaeological site, Carrickmines Castle, which contains, amongst other things, the remains of a 13th century Norman castle.</p>
<p class="contents">The motorway, as currently planned, will <span class="italic">bury</span> this site before an archaeological dig has been carried out. It is not appropriate that European taxpayers' money should be used in this way to destroy our heritage. It is not just Irish heritage, it is European heritage. I am calling on the Commission to intervene urgently to have the construction of this road stopped until a full review is carried out as to why the environmental impact study did not identify this major archaeological site when it was identified by a state-sponsored organisation, An Foras Forbartha, in 1983. This is a major issue that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency by the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At present, the White Paper is before us in Parliament and if there is something we are all agreed on, it is that something should be done to prevent a total standstill. Nit-pickers criticise us for interfering with the free market forces in an unacceptable manner, but this is somewhat laughable if one considers the amounts involved. As if this small amount would make any difference to market forces! Let us not get carried away here.</p>
<p class="contents">We are already very happy if, with Marco Polo, we can persuade the sectors involved to be more resourceful in thinking of ways of transporting goods from A to B. Road transport should therefore not fear an exodus. In fact, within a few years, the sector will want more goods to be transferred to other modalities in order to maintain mobility and cut down on traffic delays.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the amendments, we also tried to cater for small investors in the programme, while keeping the programme intact. Parliament wants to give the sectors involved a clear signal. We are quite happy to help clear obstacles to reach the modal shift. We do not want to impose any rules, but we do expect the sectors to use their common sense, for doing nothing leads to inertia and an enormous drop in dynamism and competitiveness. The sectors I have talked to have, in fact, interpreted the programme in this way and have appreciated the gesture.</p>
<p class="contents">Rail transport must, in my view, make a greater effort, cut down on red tape and work in a more customer-friendly manner. Failing this, I fear that citizens and governments will not be prepared to invest in new or modern rails. Can you detect any improvements yet, Commissioner? For I cannot. I fail to understand why the Council wishes to cut the programme's funding. Europe will make an utter fool of itself. More funding would be a more reasonable suggestion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am delighted that both the Commission and the Parliament share largely the same vision on how to actively promote sustainable transport.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I am happy to see that the Parliament supports the Commission with regard to the overall budgetary envelope of the programme. You surely know that this is a matter of discussion in the Council. The Council may propose a lowering of the amount. This would risk rejecting a disproportionate number of good proposals and endangering the very goal of Marco Polo.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming to the proposed amendments, you will not be surprised to hear that the Commission can accept a large number of them, possibly with redrafting or even unchanged in so far as they improve or clarify the Commission's texts.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are some amendments which, in our view, would not be conducive to the overall goals and management of the programme. The Commission rejects these amendments or parts of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me briefly explain the position. Amendments 14, 15, 21 and 24 aiming at lowering the contract thresholds will not help us to generate projects which by their size are of real European added value. We need fewer but larger projects with real impact. This will also help the Commission to manage the Marco Polo programme effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the concerns of some Members of the Parliament regarding the role and participation of small and medium-sized enterprise, but in fact SMEs do have the opportunity to join trans-national consortia in which any kind of companies can participate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also has a problem with bringing forward the date of its report on the implementation of the programme, as proposed by Amendments 3 and 27. While I understand the concerns of the Parliament, the date proposed will not give us enough time to gain experience with the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Using the term inter-modal action as proposed in Amendments 8, 9, 12 and 28 may carry the risk that we narrow the scope of Marco Polo and exclude important segments of the freight transport sector such as bulk and conventional traffic, which are not inter-modal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must also reject Amendment 10 and part of Amendment 17 aiming at including road transport actions in the programme. This is against the modal shift nature of the programme and may render it unmanageable. As for the second part of Amendment 28, modal shift between non-road modes is not within the scope of the programme because it would lead to unacceptable distortions of competition and does not focus on the main overall programme objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the concentration on maritime transport as such, as proposed in Amendment 16, would narrow down the 'regional motorways of the seas' wording, since the latter includes inland waterways. We cannot accept the reduction of the central steering role of the Commission in complex logistical projects as proposed by Amendment 18.</p>
<p class="contents">The detailed financial rules requested by Amendments 25, 26 and 31 seem superfluous as general financial instruments provide for enough control and monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission cannot support part of Amendments 2 and 28, referring to the formation of a common political will in cross-border transport projects as political decision-makers are not targeted by the programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
