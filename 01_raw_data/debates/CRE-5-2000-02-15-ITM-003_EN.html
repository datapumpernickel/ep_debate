<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a five-year programme is an extremely important undertaking, and this is why I preferred that you be given the unabridged text of the speech, which is available in four languages. </p>
<p class="contents">To respect my speaking time, I will confine myself to referring only to the broad outlines of my programme: a programme for the dawning of a new legislature and a new century, when it is right and proper to see Europe in a broader perspective, a Europe which is currently in a paradoxical situation. Let us remember that for half a century, Europe has provided us with peace, security and freedom and a united Europe has also contributed to giving us a period of unprecedented prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now seeing the beginning of a strong recovery, which it appears may even be sustainable for a good while yet if we are prudent with our policies. This recovery is the logical consequence of the efforts we have made, but it comes at a price: it follows the restructuring of public accounts in European countries, which have kept inflation under control with a policy wisely intended to control costs and increase productivity in a Europe that has begun a vigorous restructuring of its own industries, banks and public services, even though this process is not yet complete and still has a long way to go. </p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, despite these aspects, European citizens are disappointed and concerned: by unemployment which is not falling quickly enough; by a Europe trailing behind in technology, and seemingly falling even further behind, and in particular a scientific sector which is starting to lag a long way behind too; by the European institutions which appear distant and do not seem to be in step with the times, starting with the Commission itself. The crisis in the Commission was, in fact, a crucial point in the relationship between Europe and its citizens, and the low turnout at the European elections was a worrying indication of this. </p>
<p class="contents">Even stronger still, however, is the sense of insecurity, the feeling of being unprepared in a new world that is moving forwards, a world which is completely changing, where globalisation will even end up changing our points of reference. This is not the first time this has happened: Europe was once confronted with a similar transformation, an explosion of its markets, a change in its points of reference and a different view of the world. I am referring to the sixteenth century when the discovery of America turned everything upside down. Some countries – such as France and Spain – managed to meet the challenge, giving rise to great nation States; other countries – such as Italy – did not meet this challenge and lost all the headway that they had accumulated during the first part of that millennium: headway in science, technology, economic progress, defence structures and military organisation, philosophy and literature. </p>
<p class="contents">Today, Europe is facing a similar challenge, and we know that, just as history has been unforgiving in the past, it will not be forgiving in the present. </p>
<p class="contents">In this context of wholesale change, and in order to prevent our nation States vanishing again, in the wake of globalisation which is creating hitherto unprecedented scales and challenges, Europe needs to be economically strong, because globalisation demands unity, because every day we hear news of new agreements at world level and news of changes at European level too. But more vital still is a Europe that feels strong in the political arena. </p>
<p class="contents">In years past, the single market and the single currency have been the pivotal point of our actions, the mainstay of European life. Today, the new frontiers of European integration are political frontiers: common foreign and security policy, justice and internal security, and – to a lesser extent – the crucial question of the fundamental political values on which our coexistence is based.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has therefore adopted the strategic programme for 2000-2005, a programme that was immediately sent to the European Parliament and with which you are already familiar, so I will not go into detail about it now. Some of you may find it lacks detail, but no political structure sets out detailed five-year programmes. This is the European Union, not the Soviet Union. </p>
<p class="contents">Our programme highlights the major points of reference, the major areas for action: firstly, the development of new forms of governance for Europe; secondly, extension and enlargement of the area of peace, freedom, and security; thirdly, the launch of a new stage in the growth of the economy; fourthly, safeguarding and improving quality of life. These will be our major guidelines for action over the next five years. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the first area – new forms of governance for Europe – you already know that the Commission has undertaken to produce a White Paper and not a full legislative text since, in the light of major issues which are changing the structure of the way we interact, the Commission is first of all preparing for a debate; we will subsequently discuss the content with you; this will give rise to a policy document, and finally, a legislative document. This is an effective, transparent way to proceed and involve all the European institutions and the citizens of Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">This White Paper is a response to the challenges that enlargement is forcing on us, an enlargement that is forcing us to rethink the workings of all our institutions, rethink our very policies – all our policies – and above all rethink what we must continue to do at Union level when the Member States number 25 or 30, and what will be the best thing to do at individual State level, at regional level and at local government level. But it is not only enlargement that is urging us towards this rethink: as I said a few moments ago, it is also economic and political globalisation itself. </p>
<p class="contents">We must govern Europe in such a way as to make us more efficient, to bring us closer to the citizens and to encourage everyone to get involved, starting with the important issue of the involvement of women. One of the main differences in the comparison made recently between Europe and the United States was not so much job mobility or risk capital, as women’s involvement in economic life, an issue that has much more prominence in the United States than in Europe. This is a field where Europe has, nevertheless, always been in the vanguard. We therefore need to reflect on this at length and with an open mind, and all the institutions – Commission, Parliament, Council – will have to consider their own roles and their own policies. We shall therefore get straight back to work on this White Paper, although in order to finish it, we shall have to wait for the results of the Intergovernmental Conference, and it will therefore not be ready until spring 2001. It will not be a philosophical Paper, but a practical Paper, full of focused proposals. </p>
<p class="contents">We – the Commission – are the first to know that we must have a total rethink, and we shall therefore do two things: we are, and will continue to be, fully committed to internal reform, and we shall rethink our policies in detail. </p>
<p class="contents">I have asked all the Commissioners – and I shall ask them once again in a still more analytical way – to pinpoint all the activities that we can forgo. The Commission must define what its fundamental activities are, what it must concentrate on and shed its non-essential activities, thereby freeing up new resources and ensuring a more correct and co-operative relationship with individual countries, regions and local communities. </p>
<p class="contents">So we shall be freeing up new resources, but – I fear, and I want to state this before Parliament – the time will come when these new resources that we are already freeing up will, in turn, be insufficient in terms of allowing us to address our new tasks: I am thinking of enlargement, the new sector of justice and home affairs, health issues and environmental matters. When that time comes, when we have used up all our resources, I shall not hesitate to come here before you to request further resources, but what I am saying now is that if we are not given these necessary resources, we shall have to refuse to take on any new duties because the available resources will not be commensurate with the new tasks that we will be taking on. </p>
<p class="contents">As for internal reform, you well know how committed my Commission has been to this since day one. I know full well that we will not be able to achieve any political objective if the Commission does not undertake vigorous and comprehensive internal reform, if it does not become more efficient, if it does not increase efficiency in all sectors, starting with the sector in which the worst backlogs have built up in the past – external aid. Providing aid rapidly, when it is needed, saves human lives; in many cases providing it late is worse than not providing it at all. </p>
<p class="contents">When I speak about external aid, my thoughts immediately turn to the Balkans. There is cause for hope thanks to the commitment of our workers on the ground, an extraordinary commitment given our organisational problems. My thoughts also turn to Bernard Kouchner’s efforts, of the stability pact that we all vigorously support with total dedication, but I also think of new events, such as Croatia, where the situation has changed in a few weeks: the European institutions immediately opened the way to dialogue with this country and received the news knowing full well that the only way to resolve not only Bosnia’s problems, but more particularly Serbia’s problems is to throw a curtain of democracy around Serbia. This is the new element that we must help to bring to the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">We must increase our efficiency in this area. We must reopen the Danube to boats. It is contradictory to offer aid to Romania and Bulgaria yet leave these countries unable to harness their greatest resource. We must decontaminate the river and, in view of this, over the next few days the Commissioner responsible for the environment will be putting forward specific plans to monitor this serious problem.</p>
<p class="contents">We have done a lot in the Balkans: the new European Reconstruction Agency for Kosovo, the Balkans Task Force<span class="bold"> </span>and new regulations to speed up procedures. Nevertheless, we definitely have to do more. We must liberalise trade within the region and between the region and the European Union; we must contribute to building infrastructural links that will end its centuries-old isolation; we must intensify efforts to build a democratic, pluralist society in these countries with institutions, public structures, police forces and a structured civil society, but, above all, we must press these countries to work together in the context of a united region, as regards both politics and the economy. If we do not do this, we shall have failed in our duty. Remember that the Marshall Plan was not effective simply because of the scale of its resources: it was even more effective because it made us Europeans work together towards a new horizon; it gave us a fresh outlook in terms of our politics and our economy. This is what we need to do for the Balkans. Europe must prove – in the Balkans and the rest of the world – its ability to extend the area of security, peace and freedom and its ability to take a leading role on the international stage. </p>
<p class="contents">We are clearly, once again, returning to enlargement, which must be put into practice in tandem with the extension of the area of security, peace and freedom. We have made many promises in this regard, but I believe we shall succeed in keeping our promises even though we have a very delicate path to tread. Indeed, enlargement, which will be with us for our five years in office and beyond – I am referring to the aspirations of applicant countries – must hinge on concrete, objective criteria, and also on reassuring public opinion in the countries involved and, to an even greater degree, public opinion in our own Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">There will be friendship, calm, openness but also a certain strictness in the enlargement process. I repeat: we must reassure public opinion in those countries that wish to join but we need to provide public opinion in our own Member States with even greater reassurance. </p>
<p class="contents">Our responsibilities do not stop at enlargement, or at the Balkans. There are certain other key issues: relations with Ukraine, relations with Russia, relations with neighbouring countries and more importantly, the important question of relations with the southern Mediterranean which will be a crucial point for European history, and for security and peace in Europe for future generations. In this regard, we have a responsibility towards the whole of Africa. In recent times, Africa has raised hopes and has received offers of help, but nothing tangible has yet been achieved. In recent years in Africa, we have not seen a shift from totalitarian regimes to democracy, but quite the contrary – a shift from democracy to totalitarian regimes. Africa is, for us, a worrying topic for discussion. We therefore have another duty at international level, which has already been proposed by the Commissioner responsible for trade: the undertaking to relaunch the Millennium Round and to take on some fundamental problems affecting the poorest countries, not just in terms of writing off debts, but also via the unilateral opening-up to trade with the poorest countries in the world, with a great deal of willingness on our part, which we had already proposed prior to Seattle but which we could not put into practice. </p>
<p class="contents">We need to provide alternative answers, otherwise episodes such as those seen in Seattle will be repeated over and over and will come to hamper one of Europe’s positive roles in history. All over the world, Europe’s actions must be guided by a deep respect for the principles of freedom and respect for the rights of individuals and minorities. We should remember that we, the European Union, are a union of minorities: we are all a minority within Europe. There are concerns even within the Fifteen, concerns which may even surface again in the next decade. I am referring to the situation in Austria, where the Commission has remained true to its role, being duty-bound to work towards the cohesion of the Union, but also the unwavering guardian of the Treaties, ready to punish every minor breach of the principles of democracy, law and respect for minorities. Some people have criticised me over the congratulatory message I sent to Chancellor Schüssel. My message to you is: do not take the necessary and proper courtesies of form to mean that I have been less firm in the content. Reread the letter: The reference to the fundamental values of the Union is taken – and this is more than mere coincidence – from Article 6 of the Treaty, I repeat, Article 6 of the Treaty. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also ask you whether you believe that any other European head of government has ever been reminded of these principles by the Commission when they were elected. This is what we wish to do: maintain our role as a supranational structure, maintain the role conferred on us by the Treaties, but also be unwavering on principles and make judgements based on facts. </p>
<p class="contents">Last November, the Commission tabled a proposal for an anti-racism directive. I would ask the Council to adopt it swiftly and I would ask Parliament to help us with this action which will further strengthen the fundamental bases of our social cohesion. </p>
<p class="contents">I will quickly conclude by mentioning the last two points of our programme: the economy and quality of life. I have already talked about the economy: we well know which basic ingredients will set Europe on the path towards a lasting recovery which will in turn create more jobs. We must continue to keep inflation under control, proceed with liberalisation, ensure more competition, encourage the dissemination of information technology and all new technologies; push forward with science, and push back scientific boundaries, and develop an appetite for being at the cutting edge of science. The forthcoming Lisbon Summit on these issues – dissemination of technology, employment – will be a decisive summit. It has taken four years for us to be in a position to hold a summit of this kind. We are at last holding it and cannot let this opportunity slip through our fingers. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, our last commitment is to improve quality of life. We have opened this chapter with the White Paper on Food Safety: we now need to make significant headway in the environment sector. The Erika oil slick and the contamination of the Danube demonstrates the pressing need for European scale intervention to safeguard the environment. The time has come to discuss, and then establish, a body for emergency civil protection in Europe. All too often we find ourselves calling for this after a disaster has occurred. I think it would be appropriate to begin thinking about these things before disasters happen.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the challenges that we – the Commission but also all the other European institutions – are facing. How will we judge, ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, the five years of our mandate? How are we going to assess the results of these five years? I do not know, but one benchmark we could certainly use is the challenge we must take up together. Let us take a very simple parameter: turnout at the next European elections. If it is higher than at the previous elections, it will mean that we have successfully met our challenge. </p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are faced with all these major political challenges, but precisely because of the recovery that is now underway, we are also faced with major opportunities. This, ladies and gentlemen, could be the decade of Europe. Indeed, I would say that this must be the decade of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We also welcome the conclusions which we find in this document. And we welcome the broad outlines of the speech which President Prodi has just given. We read in the conclusions in the document that the five-year term of office of the Prodi Commission will be a time of major changes. Europe will press ahead with integration; at the same time the Union will start an enlargement process which will, in the end, reunite our continent.</p>
<p class="contents">A demanding, ambitious, perhaps even prophetic task and we wish you every success, Mr President of the Commission. However, we consider that the present is the basis of the future and we shall only be able to shape the future if we prove our worth in the present. I say that in all earnestness and I have chosen my words carefully. I refer to the current debate on the present conflicts in the European Union. We in the European Union are one Community. We belong together, even when there are problems. Now is not the time to isolate but to unite and to complete together the task of unifying Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the Commission, you have represented and defended the European Parliament time and again over recent weeks. You have seen yourself as the guardian of the Treaties, and that is indeed your role. For that and for the letter to the Federal Chancellor of the Republic of Austria which you mentioned, we expressly respect, acknowledge and support you.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the Commission, our objectives are one and the same: we want a strong Europe in the twenty-first century, a democratic Europe which is able to act. A Europe which defends its values of human dignity and democratic rule of law both internally and to the outside world and, at the same time, looks after its global interests with dignity, patience and convincing self-confidence. Europe’s message, the European Union’s message to the world should not be one of arrogance or even European nationalism, no; it must be one of cooperation, partnership and peaceful development.</p>
<p class="contents">Globalisation gives us the chance to shape the world, which is becoming smaller and smaller, as a world of peaceful competition and solidarity. Seen in this light, globalisation is more of an opportunity than a danger, more of a coming together than a segregation, more mutual enrichment than separation. But we also know that we can only shape the huge challenge of globalisation together as Europeans. Globalisation is not only an economic process, it is also a cultural process, which is why we say: we want partnership in the world, we do not want the clash of civilisations which many are predicting, we want partnership, a meeting, exchange and peace. But we also say: we want to defend this European Community of tolerance, which is why a common foreign, security and defence policy is so important.</p>
<p class="contents">Negotiations with six central European countries are starting today, bringing the European family a step closer together. We agree with what you said about the Barcelona process. All the countries in the Mediterranean area must acknowledge human dignity, democracy and the rule of law. For us, the Group of the European People’s Party and the European Democrats, it is not only the reform of the institutions of the European Union which will be important in the next five years; it is also important that we declare our faith in the single European currency and use the policy of stability as a basis for consolidating the European currency in coming years. We therefore take the uncompromising view that we must maintain a resolute and consistent stability pact.</p>
<p class="contents">We need structural reforms in the European economy. Most importantly, we need to restore a European economy in which performance pays and people can work as entrepreneurs. It would be Europe’s undoing if we were to end up with just a few multinationals and no future for small and medium-sized businesses in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has an important role to play here by getting a coordinated policy under way with the nation states to reduce taxes so that entrepreneurship pays. We too want to help put Europe on its feet.</p>
<p class="contents">You spoke in your paper of decentralisation and subsidiarity. We support that. The nations, regions, towns and communities of Europe will be preserved. However, there is a current trend – the “fauna, flora, habitat” directive was quoted as an example – which, in my country at least, creates the impression that associations are bypassing national and regional institutions and submitting programmes to Brussels and that Brussels is then making decisions affecting the property of countless agricultural holdings in the countries of the European Union. I merely mention it as an example of where we must take care and where I would recommend that we try to achieve more legal security in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the Commission, allow me to close with these words: as the Group of the European People’s Party and the European Democrats, we have every interest in a strong Commission. If you are persuasive in your actions, we all reap the benefits. In this respect we wish you every success. However, we are also aware of our role as the Commission’s watchdog. If we have the merest suspicion that you are failing to safeguard the law of the European Union, and at present we have no cause for complaint – on the contrary we acknowledge that this is not the case -, but if European law is infringed then we shall fight any such infringement uncompromisingly, precisely because peace in the European Union is founded on this law. We must preserve this law and peace in the European Union if we are to be able to go forth as peacemakers in the world.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to welcome the presentation of, and the first ever debate on, the Commission’s programme for government – the word President Prodi is so fond of; as I am –for the whole legislature.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, this is welcome because it explains, to our fellow citizens, what we are intending to do and what we are already doing. We must also express our regret at the current situation and try to improve on it for the future. We have taken almost eleven months – President Prodi was nominated at the Berlin Summit in March last year – to establish a legislative programme. This is not entirely President Prodi’s fault. We are recovering from a crisis. However, I believe that, in the future, it would be appropriate for the investiture of the next Commission to coincide with the presentation of a legislative programme. We are breaking new ground and doing so in complex circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">President Prodi began his speech by talking of a paradoxical situation, a paradox in the European Union and also throughout the world: we are at the dawn of a new secular millennium, dominated by the web of the Internet and the sorcery of biotechnological advance, and we are living through a genuine change of epoch. However, to focus on the European Union as it is today, and on the subject of government and governance – a word which, at least in Spanish, brings to mind the previous name of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, although it may be an appropriate word anyway <span class="bold">–</span>, the most important thing is that the European Union be provided with a good government, and, since President Prodi always defends his home town, Bologna, I would advise him to go to Siena for a while and see something which we all understand: the frescos of Ambrogio Lorenzetti, which speak of <span class="italic">bon governo</span> [good government] and <span class="italic">mal governo </span>[bad government]. What we need here is good government, Madam President.</p>
<p class="contents">Since we are recovering from a very complex crisis, we must try to enhance our institutions and give them substance. I would like to remind the House of something which we often forget, and that is that the investiture of the Prodi Commission, last September, received wide support. In our opinion, this demonstrates that the majority of us are in favour of progress and in favour of Europe. I would like to point out that, within this broad consensus, there were some Groups which said that the majority of Parliament should form an opposition to the majority of the Council. It is precisely this which, in a sense, is hindering the important process of developing codecision within the legislative programme. I am pointing this out because I believe that our support for the Commission also has to lead to continuity in the work carried out throughout the legislature.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we are witnessing the birth of a political Europe, which entails a collection of shared values which we all agree upon, and a European Union at the service of the citizens. With regard to the events of recent days, I would like to say – and I am saying this on the day, and the week, that the Intergovernmental Conference is starting – we have to place far more value and fundamental emphasis upon the charter on fundamental rights which, given what we have said about the Austrian crisis, I believe should be fully included in the Treaties. I have absolutely no doubt about this and I believe it is an essential point.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, Madam President, I would like to say that we should remain aware and watch our language. Last week, the new Minister for Finance of the Austrian coalition described the Austrian Parliament as a farce and a theatre. Those of us who have had to live under a dictatorship know of the existence of dictatorships with cardboard governments. There can be no democracy without a living parliament. I believe that this type of language is extremely dangerous and I would like to condemn it here and now.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the four great priorities which President Prodi systematically refers to and with regard to his analysis of the challenges facing us, I would say that we are very much in agreement. Nevertheless, I would point out to the Commission that, as far as the Socialist Group is concerned, there has been a change of priorities. We understand that the first priority is the economic and social agenda, which also includes what is known as ‘quality of life’ priorities, that is to say, the rights of citizens as consumers and as people, in relation to those questions which we always talk about, but never give sufficient priority to, that is, the European social model and its adaptation to the new circumstances, consumer rights, respect for the environment and sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">When speaking of the commitment to full employment, we have to bear in mind that, these days, full employment does not mean what it meant in the era of Beveridge at the end of the Second World War, that is to say, employment for the male head of the household. We must argue for equality of the sexes, the famous ‘gender mainstreaming’, which is one of the least developed questions in the Prodi Commission’s programme. This means prioritising sex equality, the adaptation of the social model and, above all, an unequivocal fight against populism whenever our economic and social cohesion is under threat. This must also be a main priority in the work of the Commission. It must be complemented with a forthright fight against racism and intolerance so that we may come to recognise, in practice, the evolution of a Union which has become a magnet for the rest of the world and an immigration zone, given its prosperity and seasonal demographics. I believe that this is the first objective for us to pursue.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect I would also add another element, which is economic government, given the single currency, and I believe this is inescapable. This is another question on which the Commission must make progress. With regard to the ambitious objectives and, above all, the Commission’s important step of adopting this broadening of the process of negotiation and integration, I would like – and my Group would like – more clarification in relation to the revision of Agenda 2000. Does the Commission think that there will be never be any revision? The issue of taxation also seems to us to be absolutely essential.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to governance in general, I believe it might be worth thinking in theoretical terms. I would like to remind you of one thing: it is dangerous to rethink the entire governance of the European Union from here. I would be clearly in favour of subsidiarity. If we are capable of defining what our area of governance is, I think that would be very positive. In all other areas, I believe that subsidiarity is also relevant to this discussion. Not only should the Commission discuss this, but also our states, our parliaments and our civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I would like to refer briefly to the last objective, which seems to us to be absolutely fundamental: the stabilisation of the continent and the strengthening of the Europe’s role in the world. It appears that there is agreement and support with regard to the prioritisation of South-East Europe, with regard to enlargement and – as I have said already – with regard to the process of integration and the strengthening of the Euro-Mediterranean programme and our ability to prevent conflicts, as well as an issue which we seldom talk about; the North-South challenge. We must not forget Africa, a continent which has been forsaken, not only by God, but also by Europe, nor our important contribution to cooperating with development.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, an issue for which we are increasingly responsible, as the world’s foremost economic and commercial power, that is, Europe’s voice in the world, which does not simply mean adopting an active approach to the Millennium Round. It means the reform of the United Nations and the international financial institutions, for which Europe has an enormous responsibility. Above all, Madam President – and here I will end – we must be able to express this in plain language, clearly, by changing to some extent the jargon which we use, because we cannot ask the Europeans, who are living through profound changes, to take part and show enthusiasm towards us if we continue to use a form of language which they find completely inaccessible. This is a fundamental way to increase and strengthen their confidence in us. I hope this will be demonstrated when we hold the next European elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cox (ELDR). </span></span>  – Mr President of the Commission, may I say to you on behalf of my group that we very much support the point of departure, the core of the analysis and the strategy that you bring to this House today: that is that the stakes now are irrefutably political. They are political because we are moving on. Even though we have not yet finished constructing all the economic building blocks, we are moving on from that kind of functionalist building of Europe to a much more challenging political perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenge of enlargement is political. The challenge of creating an area of justice and home affairs, of dealing with asylum and immigration and crime, is very political. The challenge of a common foreign security and defence policy is very political. Because it is political it is more complex. Because it is political it is more sovereignty-sensitive. Because it is more sovereignty-sensitive it is more voter-and citizen-sensitive. We need, therefore, to find a way forward towards these political ends and objectives, to address, not merely the scepticism but the greatest enemy, the apathy which you identify.</p>
<p class="contents">The means of achieving this are difficult but they are real. I applaud your view that we need more synergy between our institutions, not just between Commission and Parliament, but also between these and the Council to underscore the extent of the political challenge. We need more dialogue, not just with each other but also with civil society. We need more explanation of what Europe is about. We need to be able to confront fears and anxieties, because in many instances the greatest fear is fear itself. Perhaps with more dialogue and explanation we can overcome some of that.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is especially attracted to the creative possibilities you signal in regard to the prospect of a White Paper next spring addressing the issue of governance. As we look at the Europe of networking which you describe, it is very important that Europe concentrates on its core business, that we have the courage to suggest areas where Europe may perhaps stand back. That could convince people that Europe, in its governance, is not something run exclusively from Brussels, which concentrates and soaks up more powers, more decisions, more authority. That is the political core of the challenge and I think you have identified it well before this House today.</p>
<p class="contents">For my group, enlargement is the first priority against which all the other possibilities for reform must be measured, be they governance, be they the intergovernmental conference, be they reform of the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We see enlargement as a process of partnership, not a process of "them and us". We see enlargement as a positive sum gain for member and candidate states. I suggest to the Commission, as a repository of an enormous amount of detailed information on enlargement, to present a document, that explains the value of enlargement, not just in budgetary and financial terms but in a broader sense; a document, like the Cecchini report before the Single Act, that explains to people in a way which engages them in the debate that this is the grand, historic challenge facing Europe today. We need to be able to prepare that ground carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">On south-eastern Europe, I agree with your view that we measure political institutions through their achievements. In the lifetime of this Commission and this Parliament we must succeed in the task of winning the difficult and uneasy peace in south-eastern Europe. We applaud the stabilisation and association agreements, but we would like to see more. We will publish this material and bring it forward in the debate on the Swoboda report later this week.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategic paper emphasises the global role of the European Union. Our central aim must be to give the Union a weight in global affairs commensurate with its weight in terms of aid, trade and finance. At the beginning of this decade we must foresee how our institutions will develop internationally by its end, and notably where we fit into international monetary bodies, where we fit into UN agencies and so on. We need to open that debate.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, this morning, the day after St Valentine's Day, the newspapers are saying that your honeymoon period is over. I do not know whether you are a romantic or not, Mr Prodi. Perhaps this is a very unromantic thing to say on such a morning. However, we in the Liberal Group welcome this because it means we are now settling down to business. That is the way it should be. Regarding the many adjectival descriptions of Europe you addressed in your speech – an energetic Europe, an enterprising Europe, a Europe that has a human face and is inclusive – let me, in a word dear to the heart of my Liberal colleagues, give in one adjective, one description of the kind of Europe we want to see in your plan for governance: an enabling Europe.</p>

You gave consideration to important questions of principle in your programme. I believe that the public will start to show more interest in politics if we can tackle the major issues alongside the day-to-day ones. At the same time, however, it has to be said that, unfortunately, your programme reminds me in many ways of a party manifesto. There are a lot of good intentions in it, but it very much lacks concrete proposals concerning how this can all be achieved. As in any other party manifesto, it is full of contradictions. I would like to take this opportunity to help you recognise them.</p>
<p class="contents">First let me speak about the economy and social development. We have to be able to think hard about how we can coordinate the aim of competitiveness with the aim of full employment; that is what was mentioned in your programme. Should we at long last be drafting convergence criteria, in which – as you in fact hint at in this programme – the aim would be that unemployment in no Member State should be higher than, say, the three most successful countries in this matter? Ecological tax reform is what my group would like to stress the importance of, because we can only create employment and sustainable development by changing our taxation structure. But, unfortunately, as we all know, this is an area where the European Union is totally unable to act. Do please raise this issue at the intergovernmental conference. The EU can only achieve authority in the fact that it focuses on tasks that individual countries cannot attend to alone. In this respect, Parliament will definitely defend, along with yourselves, the importance of supranational decision-making.</p>
<p class="contents">One contradiction within your programme relates to globalisation. I think it is very creditable that you should mention the concept of ‘global administration’, as others too have said here. However, please learn from the events of Seattle: we have to be able to combine the freedom in world trade, on the one hand, with all those values of human importance that we wish to defend, on the other. You must embark on a dialogue with the international community. Do please try to make the international organisations democratic. The European Union could be critically important in a process in which the United Nations and the WTO really do become subject to democratic monitoring. We can submit motions for this together with you.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I consider it a very positive sign that you speak so often about the civil society, although, unfortunately, this is another contradiction. You ought to also be able to draw conclusions at the IGC. We have to table motions proposing that our citizens might really have a direct impact on decision-making. What you just said is absolutely true: people want more engaged democracy. In my opinion, this is the only way if we want to gain the approval of the people with regard to Europe and their interest in Europe too.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The main merit of the text of this communication is therefore the fact that it exists. We are also pleased to see certain statements and intentions which it contains and which Mr Prodi has just underlined and, in some cases, usefully clarified. </p>
<p class="contents">The current globalisation process is – and I quote – ‘exclusive rather than inclusive and has widened the inequalities’. The European Union’s objective must therefore be to help define new ground rules within the Union and in international relations. Clearly, many citizens are ‘disenchanted and anxious’ about the lack of real and lasting solutions to basic problems, such as unemployment and social exclusion, which affect our very existence. This must be one of our absolute priorities. We do need to rethink many aspects of current Community policy if the important and difficult project of enlargement is to be a success. We also need ‘distinctive strategic partnerships’ with our neighbours to the south and east in order to achieve stability and peace. There are plenty of areas for serious discussion. We will carefully study the planned White Papers and will participate constructively in the work begun or promised.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this spirit that I have three criticisms to make. These must be taken into account if we are truly to shape the new Europe, as proclaimed ambitiously by the title of the Commission document and Mr Prodi’s speech and do so in reality not rhetoric.</p>
<p class="contents">The first and most serious criticism concerns the Commission’s propensity for rather grandiloquent self-satisfaction with regard to the European Union and for a cursory and even condescending view of our partners. The perfect illustration of this crippling flaw lies in the opening sentence of the Commission communication. This talks of the European Union as ‘living proof that peace, stability, freedom and prosperity can be brought to a continent’ and as a model showing the world the way forward. It concludes that ‘our neighbours have the chance to join this prosperity, and we have a golden opportunity to enable them to do so’. A more balanced and more rigorous diagnosis would be welcome in my view. Similarly, the idea that the euro has fostered a consensus on wage moderation is not really borne out by the repeated nervous orders issued by the European Central Bank to the trade unions which are deemed to be too demanding.</p>
<p class="contents">My second criticism follows on from the first. This extreme difficulty in seeing the contradictions of the current situation and, where necessary, confronting these is seriously limiting the will, duly confirmed by Mr Prodi, to grant public demands. For example, at least in the countries which I know well, I doubt that the intention, repeated three or four times in the Commission document, to reform ‘Europe’s social protection, health care and pension systems …in a climate of more cautious public spending’ will meet the needs of those whose confidence we apparently want to win back.</p>
<p class="contents">My third criticism stems from the first two. The weakness of the analysis and the obstacles to the necessary changes have resulted in a project whose scope is severely limited by an overabundance of generalisations, a rather indecisive approach and therefore a lack of impetus. But all is not lost. This is a starting point and we have five years to succeed, provided that the political will exists and is expressed with sufficient force and clarity. My group is fully intent on helping with this work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was the opening statement of Commission President, Prodi, when he presented the strategic objectives of the European Commission for the next five years.</p>
<p class="contents">We await the White Paper on the governance of the European Union dealing with the issue of balance between Member States’ governments and the European Union institutions which is to be published this summer. On this specific point I think it is important that we address the reform of the internal decision-making procedures of the Commission. The Commission, in its proposals to the forthcoming intergovernmental conference, has indicated that its preference lies in seeing smaller Member States lose their automatic right to nominate a member of the European Commission. This is a scenario whereby the European Union has a membership of over 25 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to see a two-tier European Union built. I believe this would fly in the face of the spirit and objective of the Treaty of Rome and all subsequent treaties. There must be equality in terms of national representation within the Commission and within all the other European institutions. I would like to remind those who seek to eliminate the right of small Member States to nominate a European Commissioner that the United States of America gives smaller states the same recognition as larger states in the United States Senate. More or less each of the 50 states in the US has two elected positions in the United States Senate, regardless of its population.</p>
<p class="contents">Any future reforms of the European Union treaties will require a referendum to be held in my country. It would be very difficult for those who propose a ‘yes’ vote in any such future treaty to win the support of the Irish people if we lose our right to have our nominee to the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Undoubtedly, reform of the European Council is also going to be included in this White Paper on the governance of the European Union which will be published this summer. Once again there are special areas of policy-making which should be left to the domain of the national Member States. I do not believe that there is broad support in Europe for the introduction of qualified majority voting on taxation, justice and home affairs, and foreign affairs at European Union level.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, under Article 99 of the Treaty of Rome, decisions taken at EU level concerning tax changes must be by unanimity. I believe that this proposal should remain, as a common European taxation code would diminish rather than enhance the workings of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the enlargement of the European Union. I support institutional changes so as to ensure that enlargement of the Union takes place in a streamlined and structured manner. However, we must remember that the public opinion of 370 million people in the European Union is a vital factor in changing the EU treaties. Changes should not be brought about too quickly and cannot be too sweeping, otherwise public opinion will make ratification of any future European Union treaty very difficult indeed.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dell’Alba (TDI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, I am speaking on behalf of the Italian Radical Members. President of the Commission, a short while ago you said that no political structure sets out five-year plans. This is true, if we think of Russia’s plans in the thirties, but at the start of your mandate, a few months ago, you yourself announced at the Conference of Presidents that you would, however, be presenting a legislative programme, or rather, the major policy lines of the European government of which you are head and in the running of which we are engaged today. So, whether this is to be a government programme or a potential programme, the breakdown of the document you distributed to us and of the accompanying speech is not much more than a list of good intentions, or rather a list of issues on the table. It does not, however, give us the impression that the Commission is taking a clear position on any of these points, but that it is just doing the European Commission’s duty. In this House, in the past, large-scale debates have taken place on major strategic options which the Commission, under its power of initiative, launched, not as experiments, but as proposals which then made varying degrees of progress, but in any case did contribute to the integration and development of the European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">In this case, Mr Prodi, we certainly have a kind of “Ten Commandments”: a whole raft of issues are listed, but if I may say so, we are left with the impression that the Commission is afraid to make any decision regarding what needs to be done about any of these points. There was only one point that you really stressed – too much in my opinion – and that was that it looks almost as if the highest priority task that you are setting yourself is to cease “unnecessary” activities. We should be careful, though, Mr Prodi, because we had a crisis of confidence in the previous Commission and backed this Commission – at least a parliamentary majority backed this Commission – precisely because, first and foremost, the reform of the Commission would bring consolidation, a new identity and a new awareness of being guided by a firm hand.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us consider the scenario whereby the Commission, not believing itself to be equal to the task, wishes, or proposes to shed, for example, its powers to implement common policies, which it is nevertheless accorded by the Treaty. What do we expect from a government in any case? What do we ask of this structure – the European Community – which is, so to speak, ambiguous and unique? It is right for joint resources to be controlled supranationally and not to be delegated to the Member States or the TAOs, as has been the case in the past. </p>
<p class="contents">It seems that you are proposing the same old menu, but with more unsatisfactory implications, restricting the Commission, so you say, to the task of drawing up a few White Papers, as you proposed. My fear – even if you shake your head, Mr Prodi – is that this will translate into what some countries have thought for years, that the Commission should be a simple secretariat for the Council of Ministers. </p>
<p class="contents">If this is the role that the Commission intends to play over the next five years, we federalists are convinced, we are certain that this is not the right path to take and we shall send for you and judge what the Commission intends to do in this regard. The reform is important but, if it aggravates the situation, reduces or weakens the supranational powers of the Commission, then the structure of European integration, as planned by the founding fathers for the European Commission, will be at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the other points, Mr Prodi, I will take economic and social policy as an example: the European social model is certainly experiencing a major crisis and it is certainly not coincidental that unemployment tops the list of problems that none of our policies has managed to resolve, but it is not certain that it can be resolved by going through a list of problems that we have discussed in the past, without having a clear idea or proposal<span class="bold"> </span>which takes note of the fact that<span class="bold"> </span>Europe contains economies that are growing at some of the most sustainable rates and that it is not by chance that these are the economies which have made labour market flexibility and enterprise their prime objective. If we continue to get bogged down with proposals that have given extremely poor results so far, I do not know what we or the Commission will be able to do.</p>
<p class="contents">The same goes for enlargement as an end in itself, without it being linked to a reform to make the European Union and its structures much more efficient, and to proposals that the Commission could have made at the IGC. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, there is one positive thing that I would like to say to you, perhaps contrary to the opinion of some Members, regarding the telegram that you sent to the Austrian Government. We approve of your position on this: you did well not to isolate that country any further. In any case, we shall see what specific steps transpire when the time comes for practical action. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, I repeat that this is, in our opinion, a slightly short-sighted view. Above all, it lacks drive in the sectors I have mentioned, for example, as regards the Balkans. Can we really continue to leave the Balkans out of the enlargement process, disregarding the fact that Croatia, Macedonia and other countries also have the right to a place in this House that is open to all?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I remember your predecessor’s speech five years ago. Like yourself, he promised “less and better”, but Mr Santer finished up by having delivered “much more and much worse”, and I do not believe that you, either, can deliver the goods you promise. You talk about decentralisation but practise centralisation. The legislative programme is, in fact, a litany of subjects over which the people are to be deprived of influence and in connection with which, Mr Prodi, you are to take influence away from the people, even on social questions. You talk about greater transparency, but produce proposals which would lead to documents which, at present, are available for public inspection being locked away. Your Commission consists of the only 20 people in the EU who can propose that the quantity of legislation should be reduced. Local politicians cannot do that, once legislation has been passed in Brussels. The legislative programme from the Commission ought at least, therefore, to be accompanied by as long a list of tasks which are to be referred back to the Member States and to the processes of popular democracy. Otherwise, the number of laws produced in Brussels will just keep on growing. We have passed 10 000 laws and as many amendments, and the applicant States have had 26 000 documents sent to them which, as debated by the Polish parliament, fill 140 000 sides of paper. Even by this stage, that is already too many by far. Brussels should make decisions on fewer matters and hand over more decisions to the people, the regions and the Member States. The only decisions which should remain with Brussels are those concerning cross-border issues which the national parliaments can no longer legislate on effectively. What is more, the work carried out in Brussels should be of a much higher quality and be completely transparent, so that people might at least have some small sense of owning the process, now that Mr Prodi and his predecessor have taken their autonomy away from them. I should also just like to draw Mr Dell’Alba’s attention to what the founding fathers of the European Union dreamed of. Take a look at Jean Monet’s memoirs. What he envisaged was what he called a small, practical secretariat. That is not what Mr Prodi is President of today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Elles (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Madam President, this morning the Commission President, Mr Prodi, has set out ambitious goals for the European Union for the next five years, laudable aims indeed, to make a strong and effective European presence felt in the world: succeeding with enlargement, meeting the challenge of selling e-Europe, introducing better principles of governance. We accept that Europeans, particularly the younger generation, need to be given a broad perspective of where Europe will be in the years ahead. But how are we to succeed when the resources available are limited and the credibility of our institutions is not very high? We need to match this vision with reality. Here there are three elements I would like to contribute.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we need a successful European economy. We must ensure that unemployment rates continue to go down across Europe, confirm the trend in privatisation and deregulation, encourage the insertion of information technology and knowledge of the Internet, show that e-Europe is a good initiative. But we must avoid lurching back into the old-style regulation, stifling individual initiative and enterprise. We must not fear globalisation, but we must also make sure that we understand its political impact in the network society. Without a successful European economy we cannot meet the challenges ahead, particularly of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need to ensure that we legislate only when necessary – subsidiarity. Doing less but better – a central plank of the last Commission – needs to be the aim of this Commission too. We will be looking at this closely when we come to the annual programmes of proposed legislation. Mr Bonde was right to say that there is this image of doing less better and then suddenly we see an annual programme for the year 2000 of 500 proposals and recommendations, which seems to go in a different direction. We must establish priorities and make sure there is value for money in each of these programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we need to ensure that there is proper, genuine reform of the European Commission. Yes, the Commission – guardian of the Treaties – is meant to be an independent body, but it also has to be accountable to European citizens through our Parliament. The information problem, which Mr Bonde just referred to, is treated like a straw in the wind, with the Commission seeming to restrict information to us, as citizens and as parliamentarians, although we have the right to it under the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is not in fact today a European government. The Commission does not reflect the majority in this particular Parliament. We in Parliament have a major role to play in the shaping of governance in Europe. This governance therefore needs to be a sensitive governance so that we can actually work together and understand that each of the institutions in the European Union, has its relevant role to play. Therefore we need to have credibility, coherence and confidence that in working together we can restore the image of the European Union to our citizens.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Swoboda (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, numerous steps have been taken in the past to strengthen the European Union, from the euro to resolutions on a common security policy; even to the response by the 14, the Commission and Parliament to the new coalition in Austria. I fully endorse the philosophy and the principles behind these decisions. Nonetheless, I agree with you, Mr President of the Commission, that many more steps to strengthen the European Union will be needed in the future because the European Union is not strong enough either to master the huge, inevitable task of enlargement or to control current and potential movements which, to put it mildly, have an ambivalent attitude towards European values of democracy and tolerance and the desire to integrate all the people on our continent. That does not apply to Austria alone.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union professes its faith in its fundamental values in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the institutions of the EU confirmed this faith once again when the new coalition was formed in Austria. However, the full potential of these values will only be realised if they are set out in comprehensive detail in and form part of the Treaty and, in the final analysis, represent legal claims on the part of individual citizens. When it comes down to it, Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty are not enough. In this sense, the Commission must insist, and I should like to endorse and confirm this here, that the new Charter of Fundamental Rights become part of the Treaty and create binding, enforceable rights. In this sense, the Commission must insist on building up the common area of freedom, security and justice and in this sense I disagree with the last two speakers.</p>
<p class="contents">Only reasonable, feasible and humane principles of immigration and asylum law can counter the irrational, misleading and demagogic allegations of the extreme right. But, and I would like to stress this, this policy must also be accompanied by a coherent and convincing policy to promote employment and prevent social exclusion because unemployment, marginalisation and growing inequality are the best breeding grounds for anti-European, nationalistic actions and reactions.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, Mr President of the Commission, I too should like to address the issue of globalisation which you speculated on and how it is perceived by large segments of the population. The feeling of being at the mercy of others, of lacking in influence and of having no protection from the state leads in the best case scenario to a lack of interest in politics and a refusal to vote, as in the European elections and, in the worst case scenario, to extremist voting patterns. The Union, like everyone else, has not yet understood how to present the EU to the citizens of the EU as a means of protection against the negative effects of globalisation. We are in the process of building a house but too few of our citizens really feel at home in our house. What we need are not just reforms of the World Trade Organisation and the economic architecture – and, significantly, the President of the Commission forgot to mention the reform of the financial institutions and international financial architecture; we also need confidence-building measures for our citizens, who rightly expect help and support from and in the EU with the inevitable and painful process of adapting to new global circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, what the Commission says about boosting Europe’s voice is important. You yourself, Mr President, spoke of a model of which, unfortunately, there is little mention in the document. You said that we must offer our citizens a model of economic, social, cultural and ecological development, both internally and towards the outside world, which differs from other models, including the US model. In this sense, the USA is not only our partner; it is also our competitor; not our opponent, our competitor and we must fight to see which of us offers our citizens the best model. I hope that what we have said so clearly and vehemently here today will also be reinforced in the Commission documents.</p>

You have made a bold start by rightly emphasising the need to focus on so-called "core tasks". That, as you have said yourself today, means that you must also identify tasks, policies and programmes which are peripheral or irrelevant to the Commission's main vocation.</p>
<p class="contents">Many existing European Union policies and programmes may simply have passed their sell-by date, or have been proved unwieldy or ineffective when administered at European level. The challenge now is to have the courage to devolve as many non-core tasks as possible back to lower levels of national, regional and local government. If we are to succeed in persuading a sceptical European public of the merits of further European integration, we must be able to demonstrate that we are as active in the devolution of unwarranted EU powers as we are in the evolution of new EU powers.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not allow the critics of European integration to claim, as they presently do with some justification as we have just heard from Mr Bonde, that the increase in EU responsibilities is a one-way street only. It must be shown to be a two-way process in which existing EU policies and programmes, which are not clearly justified on the grounds of subsidiarity and proportionality, are devolved and repealed. If you are able to match these aspirations with actions in the years ahead, you will be making an unprecedented contribution to the future of the European Union as a whole and, as we have heard today, you will enjoy widespread support in this European Parliament.</p>

<p class="contents">I myself want to refer to a subject which has not been mentioned but which is on the agenda, namely the Commission’s work programme for 2000. I am aware of the limitations of the exercise given that we have to work within the current Treaty and are therefore restricted by its operational rules. I am thinking in this respect of the important issue of taxation which I am not, however, going to talk about. Rather, I want to start by welcoming certain proposals which you have made in this programme for 2000. These include all the proposals on food safety which are ambitious and important and those on maritime safety which are particularly important given the two oil slicks which have affected the coast of Brittany and Turkey. The Commission should react quickly in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">However, on other issues the proposals could be more ambitious and faster acting. I have some positive suggestions to make, particularly on the social area, the environment and the follow-up to Seattle. Firstly, you have said that the citizens of Europe must be reconciled with the institutions. This is self-evident and it is therefore essential to find out their main concerns. For example, in the social area, it is not enough to announce a communication on a programme of social action. We must move faster. You must submit a new social action programme to us by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of company closures and mass redundancies is one which has been and still is very firmly in the news. We are working on the basis of a directive whose limitations have been clearly demonstrated. I therefore propose that this should be reviewed in order to produce a directive which is more effective in protecting employment and also in imposing penalties on those who do not comply.</p>
<p class="contents">On the environment, you have announced a proposal for a decision on a sixth action programme on the environment. This is all very well but it seems that the text to be proposed will not contain any specific objectives or a timetable for implementation. Perhaps you can correct me on this. I personally feel that it is essential to have precise objectives and a proper timetable for implementation. In terms of civil liability for the environment, it is right that we finally have a White Paper. However, Parliament did ask for a legislative initiative six years ago. The White Paper clearly foreshadows this legislation but for when? You must realise that this process needs to be accelerated.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, after Kyoto, we should be able to rapidly produce precise proposals. Finally, on the subject of the WTO, the idea of relaunching a new global round is not necessarily bad. However, in the first place, the Commission should make proposals on changing the operational rules of the WTO. The Commission has a role both within the EU and throughout the world. The European Union must therefore instigate a re-evaluation of the WTO’s operation which must lead to precise proposals being made on its rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We therefore need resources available to spend before proceeding to enlargement, so that we can at last establish a European monitoring body responsible for monitoring quality of life and living conditions, with the aim of creating a new world where such tragedies will no longer occur.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say a few words on Africa, Madam President. The third and fourth worlds have been abandoned: just one dollar, one and a half euro would be enough to save a great many children. Europe, which is so democratic, so progressive, does not speak out or take these tragic problems on board, while half of Africa is dying of Aids and other diseases. </p>
<p class="contents">One final remark regarding the Internet and globalisation. Globalisation of the economy must not be reduced to product and quality certification, just as the globalisation of politics must not come to mean levelling of values or dampening of hopes and enthusiasm. The peoples which do not participate and gradually grow more distant will leave the way open for an oligarchy that will take power and leave control in the hands of a few. </p>
<p class="contents">As for the Internet, Europe has finally found the courage to say that we need rules. On a personal note, please allow me at this time to congratulate the pirates who, by acting the way they are, are forcing the world to reflect on the only system which is currently unregulated. We live in a world of rules and regulations: let us regulate the Internet too and give our fellow citizens rules and hope for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ensuing document is both ambitious and bombastic. Is it not rather melodramatic to say that “the world looks up to Europe”? Moreover, Europe as a continent is a great deal more than just the fifteen EU Member States. It is not rather ambitious to ensure peace, democracy and human rights in the <span class="italic">whole</span> of Europe, no less? I am particularly intrigued by how the Commission considers bringing this about. </p>
<p class="contents">Does “the European integration model as a rich source for global administration” imply the export of a large-scale perspective and concentration of power? According to the Commission, external policy can succeed, provided everyone knows exactly who is in charge! So who is this then? The Commission as a whole, its President perhaps, the Council? </p>
<p class="contents">You stated that the new European government requires strong institutions, while the Commission wants to focus at the same time on its core tasks. We could not agree more with the latter. It is high time that institutions restricted their scope to actual cross-border issues and stopped decking out the European cart with powers which they are taking away from national authorities. </p>
<p class="contents">The document mentions common values on different occasions. Unfortunately, I find the reference to the relevant standards to be lacking. This raises the question as to what these standards and values are based on. I am convinced that the Bible, God’s word, is the only pure source of proper standards and real values. In the tradition of our continent, this realisation is an important one which merits recognition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I very much agree with the gist of the document. I also share the view of Mr Prodi and the Commission that in a number of areas, there is a need for more Europe and more integration, and rightly so. Areas such as security, the World Trade Conference, food safety, but also the new economy, require more action, therefore, from the European Commission. </p>
<p class="contents">It will be a challenge to find a way of bringing the Member States, the Council, the European Parliament, the national parliaments, the Commission and all kinds of other agents into line. The European Commission will need to play an important director’s role in this, provided that clear and attainable objectives are in place. Clear priorities, focus, and, above all, communication with society to inform them of what we are up to, are the key goals. That requires from the Commission, with a view to subsidiarity, concrete plans which we would like to see implemented in the forthcoming programmes. </p>
<p class="contents">There is, in itself, nothing wrong with emphasising the core functions, and I applaud the fact that the Commission would like to assume a better, more prominent role in order to develop policy ideas and political initiatives. But what also matters is the actual implementation of the Commission’s ideas. </p>
<p class="contents">Take the Telecom sector, for example. Although we have drafted a large number of directives, at the end of the day, we still have 15 different markets and the 15 Member States still implement the directives differently. </p>
<p class="contents">And where implementation is concerned, the Commission needs to ensure that our political wishes are also implemented in practice. </p>
<p class="contents">Looking at foreign policy, Madam President, I very much like the ambition that the European Union should have as much political as economic say at world level. But then I wonder: if there is talk of a real common policy, of a system of crisis prevention and crisis control at Community level, where are the actual proposals then? Indeed, at the end of the day, we need these in order to verify whether we can realise our objectives in this area. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi was right in devoting a lot of attention to Africa in his speech, but I have to say that I am nonetheless disappointed when I study the work programme for 2000. I cannot find any reference to Africa in the introduction, nor in the programme itself, and I do hope, therefore, that Mr Prodi will produce a proper file by way of preparation of the Summit in Africa. </p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, words are essential, but we can only judge the Commission on its merits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Have you already included your second term of office?</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">But seriously. As it enlarges, the Union needs to be strengthened through streamlining and demarcation. First, streamlining. What you say in your programme about concentrating on the core functions of the Commission is only the beginning. The activities of the entire Union must be reduced to core areas of policy. In other words, a social, ecologically-orientated market, a secure currency, guaranteed civil rights internally and representation of common interests externally. It is not just that we need to speak out in the world with one voice; it is what we want to say with this voice that it is important.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the new “in” word is flexibility. However, increasing flexibility can or quickly threatens to turn into intergovernmentalisation. We must hold fast to joint decision-making institutions which embrace the Member States. That also applies to the inclusion of the civil society, which is a welcome step. Our citizens do not need any new institutions and certainly no new mixing of powers.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Transparency does not mean more access to more paper; to our citizens, transparency means greater clarity at long last as to who takes decisions in Brussels and Strasbourg, when and with what right. That is transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the European Union cannot and should not enlarge endlessly. Its borders are set not by how may countries want to join, but by how many countries it can accommodate.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If the price of enlargement is the watering-down or even the break-up of the present Union, then it must not be paid. It is too high a price, not only for the Member States already in the Union but also for the states which want to join the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no future for a Union which is merely a geo-strategic concept or for a Union which is merely a free trade zone. But the Union will only continue to be more than a market and to be accredited by the people of Europe if it sees itself as a community of destinies. That goes far beyond your new economic and social agenda or a new, better quality of life. Not only the Commission, not only the European Parliament but also the people and the states in our European Union will have to find new answers to the question of how and why we want to live and work together. In doing so, we need, no less, to reinvent the European Union, but without destroying the present Union.</p>

The Commission must carry on negotiations that are a decisive attempt to have each applicant country join the Union as soon as possible. On the other hand, we have to see to it that none of the achievements or aims of integration that have been stated thus far are watered down. To avoid this the European Liberal Democrats have expressed the hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will consider the various models of differentiated integration and create a concentric Union, in which there is a federal core and a less integrated outer ring.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the subject of the internal differentiation of the Union will be raised at the IGC. The subject needs to be discussed without prejudice. A technical improvement in the flexibility system will not be enough: we also have to raise the issue of developing our institutions for the countries in the vanguard as proposed by Jacques Delors, for example. In this way, a decision-making system can be created that is more effective, clearer, more open and more democratic. I hope that the Commission will make its own proposal concerning how the expanding Union might implement its institutional and other differentiation.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It raises expectations, but it can also lead to disappointment. This is connected to what Mr Van Velzen was just saying, about the difference between words and deeds. </p>
<p class="contents">The enlargement of the Union is inspired by our wish for peace, security and stability. You are looking to reassure the acceding countries, as well as European opinion. But these days, we are witnessing the exact reverse before our very eyes. We have noted increasing levels of apprehension and disquiet, even within regions where unemployment is quite low and prosperity very high. </p>
<p class="contents">We need to make our citizens feel at home, according to Mr Swoboda, and I agree. This is a place where we share the same values and where each and one of us also have our own task and responsibility. This is probably linked to the standards mentioned by Mr Van Dam, namely subsidiarity. It is necessary to have a clear division of responsibility among all levels of authority and to be partners, rather than competitors when it comes to policy. It is also necessary to exercise authority as closely as possible to the citizens, where it can be exercised with due transparency and can be monitored by the citizens themselves. </p>
<p class="contents">That will require a new political culture, not only in words, but also in practice, which will take into consideration the reality of Member States and regions. Regions which, culturally and economically, sometimes match the interest of some Member States. The new Europe should not only expand horizontally, but also vertically, by living by our values in practice and by developing a democratic structure of a real community.

These are contained in an extremely general document in which all the problems have been glossed over to prevent any conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">So, in the first part on the new forms of European governance, the words ‘federalism’ and ‘superstate’ are not mentioned at all. Yet these are the main themes in any discussion of strong European institutions in which only day-to-day tasks of execution are decentralised and a collective vision is promoted within an indistinct whole. In this scenario the governments and national parliaments are merged with the regional and even local authorities and with the civil society, all of which are described, with no form of hierarchy, as ‘integral elements of European governance’.</p>
<p class="contents">These ambiguities mask many misunderstandings, primarily about our values. It is not enough to claim to adhere to democracy in order to be a democrat. It must clearly be accepted that the people should be free to make their decisions at the level which best combines the objective conditions of an immediate, fair and transparent democratic debate, namely at national level in the main.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet the whole of the Commission communication is based on the opposite theory. In this theory, on the pretext of ensuring the best protection for peoples, their margin of independent choice should be increasingly limited by new regulations, new policies or new, restrictive legal structures such as the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights. This Charter is really misnamed because it will actually reduce these rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Union for a Europe of Nations Group our principles are rather different. Clearly we want to defend the countries of Europe but we also want to respect the autonomy of nations. This is not impossible. We must move away from the outmoded federalist schemes promoted by those whose every idea on European matters comes from the Memoires of Jean Monnet. Instead, we must open the European institutions to the modern world by creating a flexible dynamic which respects nations.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the keynote idea on the new governance which we would have liked to have seen in your communication, Mr Prodi, but which is unfortunately not there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The confidence of millions of Europeans cannot be won without being worthy of this. And how could you be worthy of this after the mad cow scandal and the resignation of the Santer Commission for corruption? You are responsible for millions of unemployed and for millions living in poverty, insecurity and increasing misery because of your ultra-trade-oriented and ultra-liberal policies and because of the forced march towards the single currency. You wanted and have obtained the abolition of internal borders. Consequently, you have opened Europe up to an explosion in crime and insecurity and to a flood of uncontrolled immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">You are now proposing to give all decision-making power to a handful of officials. The Member States, local authorities and NGOs will simply become enforcers of decisions handed down from above, all on an equal footing in their submission to Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">Not once does your twelve-page document mention the national parliaments even though they comprise the elected representatives of the people. Clearly, they have no role to play in your strategy. You dare not even call a spade a spade, but instead hide behind pseudo-trendy language by using the term ‘governance’ for what is nothing more than federal, autocratic, centralised government.</p>
<p class="contents">Having tried for many years to persuade us by talking of shared sovereignty, you are now revealing your ultimate goal. You intend to trade in all European sovereignty, whether national or collective, for a world government in which you do not even expect to obtain a dominant position.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, you are daring to condemn and penalise the free and democratic vote of millions of Austrians, or are allowing this to happen, just because the result does not suit you. Yet at the same time you are supporting Communist China and trading with countries which have openly violated human rights for decades.</p>
<p class="contents">Members of this House are today speaking out against a telegram from Mr Prodi to Chancellor Schüssel which, quite obviously, is not a demonstration of sympathy but rather a political manoeuvre. Your sabre-rattling fools no one because, as you know perfectly well, whether you like it or not, you need Austria in order to reform the Treaties and harmonise savings tax. You will cynically and hypocritically use Austria as a convenient threat to further strip the Member States of any real powers in the construction of the European Union. Your Commissioners are clearly not solely responsible for this. The governments which, through spinelessness or ideology, support you are also responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">Brussels is not all of us, as you claim. It is all of you. Tell the truth for once. You could not care less what the people of Europe want. They are free to choose only between your brave new world and denouncement. It is over ten years since the collapse of the Soviet Union and yet your projects contain a strong hint of the gulags and mollifying moralism.</p>
<p class="contents">We were among the small number who denounced the communist dictatorship. We are and will remain among those fighting against Europeanist dictatorship. We call on all the people of Europe to resist your monstrous projects. The salvation of European democracies is with nation states. Europe’s salvation lies in the cooperation of the nations of Europe.</p>

It is a programme based on real-life situations and issues, and it is therefore right to put concrete measures aside for the moment and focus on the major issues. </p>
<p class="contents">In my view, Mr Prodi, judging from the text and the document that you had sent to us, one subject that is very important to both of us has been given secondary importance, and that is solidarity, not so much at international level as at internal level. </p>
<p class="contents">The Archbishop of Milan, Monsignor Carlo Maria Martini, is calling upon all politicians, in particular those like you and me, President Prodi, for whom the cultural and historic principle behind their presence in politics is the principle of the active involvement of Catholics in politics, to reconsider a development process, which, in addition to economic profit, takes the marginalised and those left behind by society very much into account. It is of the utmost importance to address the issue of those who cannot keep up, one which reminds us of how difficult and complicated it is to establish progress indicators and how inadequate it is to use the parameter of per capita income alone. </p>
<p class="contents">It also reminds us of the need for a new growth model, one that is firmly rooted in the culture of the Catholics who are involved in social problems,<span class="bold"> </span>who see, in the civil community and the social<span class="bold"> </span>interaction<span class="bold"> </span>that that must be encouraged and facilitated among the public, the most natural instruments for building solidarity. </p>
<p class="contents">The fundamental element for the development of each person – his freedom, which comes before economic gain – is thus enhanced. This social freedom, which becomes manifest in initiatives favouring the poor, gives excellent results in terms of social justice and stability. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, public institutions must not accept only the economic criterion. They must focus on service to people and commitment to achieving freedom for each individual, without forgetting, naturally, that all this cannot and must not conflict with the need to create business, to invest and risk, and in an ordered and focused system, entrepreneurs are able to make a substantial contribution to social growth solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">In the age of globalisation, which we do want to facilitate with a framework of specific rules that will provide guarantees to the economic operators and consumers, the European Commission cannot forget solidarity, and must call for its implementation through the use of all of man’s spiritual resources in his relations with his fellow man.</p>
<p class="contents">Our heritage has taught us that politics must have a heart. We hope that the White Paper and the actions of you and your Commission will put this into practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our ambitions and our work will be followed not only by people in our own countries, but also by many people outside Europe and the European Union. What sort of impression will an interested public, as well as the rest of the world, have of this five-year programme? My reply would be: a new start, a clear agenda for reform which confirms that the Union in the 2000s will not stop at being an economic community but will become a community that can be trusted and that we take seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is correct in stating that the Union intends to develop and safeguard the welfare state in an age of globalisation. It foresees a just and more effective Europe that also recognises its responsibilities beyond its own borders out of solidarity and enlightened self-interest. Consequently, we see poverty and exclusion as the greatest enemies of peace and freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">I concur with what other members of my political group have said and I commend the tone of your document. However, there are two omissions which need to be addressed in our future work. The first concerns women, gender and women's rights. You talked about how women can help in increasing production and growth. That is important, but equality is not only necessary for productivity, but also to make our societies more democratic. It is therefore noticeable that 'equality', 'gender' and 'women' are barely mentioned in 'Shaping the New Europe'. You mentioned 'women' in your speech, but they are not referred to in the context of the strategic goals. Is that because mainstreaming is already so widespread in the Commission that there is no need to mention women? What other explanation could there be for omitting women? The EU must not take on a masculine persona.</p>
<p class="contents">My other question concerns Africa, which is the only continent not mentioned in 'Shaping the New Europe'. Africa has the largest number of refugees in the world, the most overall poverty and a debilitating AIDS epidemic. I know that Commissioner Nielson and some of the other Commissioners are doing a fine job, but the rest of the Commission also needs to focus more clearly on that continent, partly by including it among its strategic goals.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I welcome the Commission's statement and the fact that this says for the first time that the EU is prepared unilaterally to introduce measures to make it easier for developing countries to gain access to our markets. I would merely ask when this is likely to take effect.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, out of all the points, two specifically require our attention, and they are closely linked: peace and stability within Europe and outside Europe. It is a question of objectives that must be pursued as a priority. For some time, we have all agreed on this notion, but we must also clearly affirm that these objectives will not be achieved without enlargement, even if this comes at a price. </p>
<p class="contents">Today, we have been called on to choose, for the forthcoming decades, between a Europe that might be less prosperous but a beacon of peace and civilisation for the whole planet and a Europe that might be more wealthy, but where there is uncertainty over what the future might bring.</p>
<p class="contents">These goals will be more easily obtainable only if the Intergovernmental Conference, which will draw to a close within the year, results in constitutional reform, providing the Commission with real and adequate powers so that it will no longer merely implement Council decisions or Parliament’s codecisions but will have to perform the role of a real European government. </p>
<p class="contents">The first supporter of this reform should be Parliament itself, if it really wants to increase its role of interpreting the will of the Europeans and acquire the centrality which is part of a genuinely democratic and firmly integrated Union. </p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it will only be possible to give the Commission responsibility for the tasks it takes on according to<span class="bold"> </span>the actual powers it will be accorded. </p>
<p class="contents">Without these prospects that we have outlined, Europe would, once again, have no future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I note that you consider the fall of the Berlin wall to be the crucial factor of the end of the century. This event must underpin enlargement. Rather than using the word ‘enlargement’, I want to talk of reunification which has much greater political significance.</p>
<p class="contents">Your idea is to concentrate your activities on the core tasks. This is one of the goals of your reform. In essence this means applying the principle of subsidiarity. Precise application of this principle can only reinforce the actions taken and give our citizens a clear view of each level of competence. However, saying is one thing and doing is another! You must therefore fight against the tendency of all institutions to try and increase their powers. I will therefore judge you on your deeds. In the meantime, I approve and encourage this clearly expressed desire in your communication.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I must make two essential points. These concern the simplification and application of Community law. In 1998, 123 referrals were made to the Court of Justice for non-application or non-transposition and 25% of environmental directives were not applied or transposed. Recent events have shown us that these regulations are essential. Community law must not go unapplied because it is too complex or too pedantic. The Union must not make this mistake and I therefore regret the fact that your communication does not go into more detail on this.</p>
<p class="contents">You are being realistic when you say that the welfare state can no longer provide adequate responses to the problems facing us, including unemployment. Nevertheless, I regret that a clear alternative has not been proposed. The emphasis should have been placed on the rejection of any policy of handouts and instead on the development of initiative and responsibility. You have not highlighted the ageing of our population which will fundamentally alter the structure of our society, not only economically but also in terms of public health. This is a silent revolution and in this respect I expected more from your communication. Finally, you do highlight European research as being at the heart of our future. Yet you do not indicate the resources you intend to implement to achieve this. Also, ethical principles are at the heart of this research but your communication says nothing about these. If you want to better inform the people, you should start by strengthening liaison with this House, as we are the representatives of the citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Trentin (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, we can only endorse the general guidelines of the five-year programme and of the programme for 2000, set out with so much enthusiasm by President Prodi this morning. </p>
<p class="contents">In the two documents, strong emphasis is placed on the need to define new forms of European governance and, to this end, to introduce a new agenda for the Commission, establishing more stringent priorities in the pursuit of the goal of full employment, through more efficient coordination of the economic and social policies of the States, and, primarily – allow me to stress this – of the nations that have joined the monetary union and which must be enabled to become the first example of closer cooperation. </p>
<p class="contents">To this end, I shall confine myself to stressing, out of all the choices available, the importance of three priority decisions which should, in the drawing-up of action programmes for the government of the Union, be the basis for both the Commission’s agenda and the actions of the European Union in the coming months.<span class="bold"> </span></p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the promotion of and participation in the drafting of joint plans for the creation of an integrated services network in the transport and energy sectors, with the backing of the European Investment Bank. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the approval of investments – where the parameters are binding when drawing up action programmes on employment – to be made in individual countries via Community projects in the priority sectors of research, innovation and training. I feel that these parameters – particularly those of a qualitative nature, resulting from investments in continuous training, refresher courses<span class="bold">,</span> adaptability and retraining of older workers – are considerably more significant and binding owing to their lasting effects over the medium term than the simple drawing up of annual quantitative objectives, that are always debatable, regarding new employment or employment cuts. </p>
<p class="contents">If, among other things, as the programme of the Portuguese Presidency stresses as well, the Commission could promote a new phase of social dialogue, focusing on an agreed strategy of socialisation and diffusion of knowledge, in other words, a strategy for employability and the definition of its rules, this would allow us to take a step towards having employees participate in the informed and consensual management of the restructuring and reemployment processes. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I do not think that the decrease in the number of the working population, owing to the ageing of the population, is unavoidable and inevitable for the European Union. This is not just because of the existence of margins which would permit an increase in the number of working women and immigration, but because we need to be determined in reversing the widespread trend of early retirements from the job market, and direct the coordinated reform of social welfare systems, certainly not towards large reductions in future pension payments but towards the active use of people’s increased life expectancy and towards a longer working life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome you and your ambition. Ambition will be needed, given the mammoth task which awaits us. In order to make these reforms, however, and in order to make progress with the 2001 legislative programme, we must be very sure, not only of the strengths of the reformer himself, but also of the opinions of others.</p>
<p class="contents">You say that you will not hesitate to come to this House to request more resources for the Commission, but the Commission must be aware that we are walking on thin financial ice. We have 1.27% of the Community’s GDP. Not a euro more or a euro less. It will not be us who refuse these new resources. You should ask the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">These financial perspectives are adjusted to within a millimetre. In order to finance the stability plan for the Balkans, we will have to negotiate a significant revision of Category 4, and you must remember the enormous difficulties we have had in approving the 2000 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind you that this Group, the PPE-DE, does not like to finance new political initiatives at the expense of existing ones. The political priorities must be set by this House and the MEPs. Do not believe for one moment that your proposed reform of the budget will disguise the limitations of the Community financial system. It is all very well for us, by mutual consensus, to make an effort in terms of budgetary rationalisation, but you must be very aware that the lack of resources, the absence of financial autonomy and the poor execution of the budget, continue to be urgent issues which must be resolved. We therefore wonder whether the Commission has the political will to resolve them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On one hand, there are the words and, on the other, their real political meaning.</p>
<p class="contents">We Socialists applaud the Commission for wanting to fight against social exclusion and poverty. Yet how can the gulf between political rhetoric and reality be filled? What is meant by the Commission’s declared objective of ‘economic reform’ in the labour market? Does this mean more flexibility, insecurity and fixed-term contracts? Everyone knows that quality of life and full and better employment depend on sustainable economic growth. The Union is currently restricted to a policy of stability which is certainly necessary but insufficient. We Socialists desperately want a European pact for growth and employment. The ingredients of this policy are well known. They are the stimulation of public and private investment, increased investment in research, education and training and the promotion of the spirit of enterprise. In this respect, the e-Europe initiative is to be welcomed. In the world of new technologies, the main danger remains that access to information will be easier the richer you are.</p>
<p class="contents">The gulfs which are opening up everywhere are the main problem for our era. On one hand we have the exuberance of the financial markets and the explosion of wealth and, on the other, more widespread exclusion. We are asking workers to be flexible, innovative and ever more productive, yet the fruits of this productivity increasingly benefit the shareholders alone. The European Central Bank is keeping very quiet about the staggering rates of return on financial assets, yet it never misses an opportunity to remind us that any wage increase should remain below the rate of increase in productivity. How do we explain to workers who fall victim to the rationalisations of the worldwide Monopoly game that they must be prepared to change career several times in their working lives when the captains of industry, having lost the gamble of a take-over, leave with compensation of EUR 30 million?</p>
<p class="contents">For years we have been told over and over that the economy must be liberalised. The sectors which have been liberalised are experiencing an avalanche of mergers and acquisitions, leading inevitably to monopoly situations. All these stock market battles are based solely on forecast increases in profit of 15%, 20% or 25% which are unrealistic in the long term. The unfettered rise in prices of financial assets and property means that the risks are on the increase. The main danger awaiting us in the medium term is not inflation but deflation caused by the collapse of the speculative bubbles on the international financial markets.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the next five years will be crucial. We need new rules to regulate globalisation and we need investment in the real economy and in people. We need the Member States and the Commission to ensure the social dimension of the market economy in a visible manner.</p>

There is no point in drawing up a new economic and social agenda if you have not even finished the old one. I am thinking of transport policy and regional policy. You have excellent Commissioners for both issues in Mrs Palacio and Mr Barnier, yet still you attach too little importance to these areas. And do you know why? Just look at transport policy; clearly it is crucial for this policy to be drawn up as a economically and ecologically sensible policy before the accession of other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would be grateful if the President of the Commission would listen to what I have to say, although of course he has no obligation to do so. Let me give you three examples. First: we need reasonable deregulation of the railway sector because we want to shift freight from the roads to the railways. That makes sense from an economic and an ecological point of view. Without deregulation we will not make any headway with a reasonable transport policy. The same applies to European air traffic control. Our citizens cannot understand that we are deregulating air traffic, but leaving 15 different sectors in the skies which are under national control, which have an adverse economic impact on the airlines and which pollute the environment. You still have not finished that agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, far too little is said in your paper about regional policy. Economic and social cohesion in the EU is a fundamental task of this Community. If we fail to complete it, citizens in less favoured regions will dread enlargement. We must show them that we intend to use the next five years to help them join the rich regions by promoting the less favoured regions using reasonable means. Then they too will be prepared to really support enlargement and help to achieve it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the Commission, if we do not manage to create true solidarity between the rich and the poor regions, then this Union will be all the poorer and it will not meet with the approval of the people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From that standpoint, it is useful that the Commission’s work programme comes back to the issues of Agenda 2000, the common agricultural policy, which includes fishing, and secondly, the activities of the structural funds. I hope this reference means that the reorganisation of the Commission currently in progress will not damage the mechanism for monitoring and implementing Agenda 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">The Agenda 2000 issues are, of course, ones that relate to your third and fourth strategic objectives, the economic and social Agenda and a better quality of life. What your texts do not make apparent is the extent to which these major, high-minded objectives are compatible with the resources that the Commission intends to deploy. I do not necessarily mean financial resources. The implementation of Agenda 2000 in the agricultural sector does not ultimately require more money. There must also be savings. But what we need is the analytical resources: these issues require the investment of more intellectual capital. This is because it is essential to achieve two things: the European model of multifunctionality in agriculture must be secured, and this must be done in a way which facilitates the liberalisation of world trade in agricultural products, mainly to the benefit of developing countries. It is not easy to combine those aims. There is no obvious way. There may well be contradictions between the two objectives and there is nothing to show that the Commission has pointed out those contradictions and how it proposes to deal with them.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the other aspect of Agenda, the aspect of cohesion and regional development, there we do indeed have great achievements to point to, but there are still less developed regions, particularly island regions, to which more attention should be paid.</p>
<p class="contents">As for fishing, there is nothing in your programme to tell us that the predatory exploitation of fishing grounds, which has gone as far as to wipe out entire species of fish, will certainly prove fruitful in the future. Perhaps these issues should be approached with greater attention and a greater <span class="italic">esprit de finesse</span>.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How strongly is the single market established at the moment? I want to remind Mr Prodi, and his colleagues who are still here, of the findings of the Commission’s own survey among 3000 European businesses. Nearly 40% of businesses in this survey are still reporting additional costs to render products or services compatible with national specifications. This is the Commission’s own survey. These are the classic symptoms of continued obstruction by national governments – bureaucratic red-tape blocking market entry.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s programme shows a disturbing complacency about the completion of the internal market. We have to keep the pressure up in all areas by removing further barriers, intensifying pressure on Member States who fail to implement single market measures and, of course, extending into crucial new areas like financial services. Only on the strong foundation of the single market will the agenda of enlargement be successfully achieved. An enlarged Europe must build on the existing strengths of the Union. The single market extending across that enlarged Union is going to be a colossal achievement.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude by saying, on behalf of all my Conservative colleagues – and we are the second largest national delegation in this Parliament – that we pledge our full support to the Commission and to Mr Prodi in achieving this historic task.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The serious business is therefore now going to start as we are to vote on your programme.</p>
<p class="contents">From your speech I will concentrate on what you have called the new governance, which you will use as a tool for reconciliation with our fellow citizens. Yet this new governance simply means how the institutions and our public authorities operate, if we agree that the European Union must be a public authority.</p>
<p class="contents">The interlinking of the EU institutions, the responsibilities of the Member States and the local and regional authorities is all very well. Yet is this really how we will reconcile the people and European construction? Is this really how we will answer the fundamental questions which are not so much about ‘who does what’ but more ‘what are we doing together’? It is these questions which cause concern among our fellow citizens. In your speech you mentioned the challenges of globalisation and enlargement which await us. I would add to these the future of our social model. </p>
<p class="contents">This is why I and my group are so firmly insisting on the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The reason our timetable includes the drafting of this Charter is because we are at a key point in our history. Our Union needs to redefine the values on which it is based, both within its current borders and also with a view to the imminent enlargements which we earnestly desire, but not under just any conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Our people expect more Europe, but not just any Europe. They are expecting us not to fall in with globalisation but rather, on the basis of our social model, to be able to organise globalisation. In this respect I must say that, in terms of your commitment to a political union, to which we are favourable, this cannot be achieved unless it is based on our social model, on our originality and our capacity to better regulate the business of this world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission is planning in particular to develop a genuine European policy on asylum and immigration. It wishes to boost judicial assistance and cooperation and to develop an effective approach to the fight against all forms of crime”. That is the entire programme for the next five years on the question of internal security, freedom, citizens’ rights and judicial cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">A paper this short is a farce. A farce because we know and appreciate the work of Commissioner Vitorino and what we have here on paper is a blatant contradiction to how things actually stand. A paper such as this is no basis for a scoreboard. It has been extolled and celebrated as a huge achievement and I am all for it; we need a basis for a scoreboard. We here in Parliament want to hold a serious discussion about the future development in this policy area on the basis of a programme.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are looking for are minimum standards in asylum procedures so that refugees can be given help quickly, and those who are not fleeing know where they stand.</p>
<p class="contents">We want instruments to prevent abuse. We want to develop a Community immigration policy which takes account of the Member States’ capacity to absorb immigrants and we need to extend the operational powers of EUROPOL, for example, so that specific steps can be taken to combat organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">We debate these issues intensively and seriously and we should be entitled to expect likewise from the Commission, even where it is merely submitting a paper. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not the case in other areas, as has already been pointed out. We share these views because we are in favour of world trade, but we want this trade to be conducted according to common standards, common rules which would regulate world trade with one aim in mind. This aim is that trade should benefit development, and particularly harmonious development in which the values of citizenship do not only apply to the world’s most dynamic and competitive regions. </p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, what does this statement tell us about principles? This regulation and these standards have brought an increased volume of trade for the World Trade Organisation, in other words, increased wealth, but when we look at how this wealth is distributed, we see, unfortunately, that the gulf between the world’s richest countries and blocks and the poorest and least developed countries continues to increase.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore quite legitimate and even imperative that we ask ourselves, what purpose do the current common standards and rules serve? What good are the current way in which we negotiate and the way in which the World Trade Organisation works, if they cause trade to increase on the one hand, but on the other, they create problems and above all cause this gulf between rich and poor countries to grow?</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we said that we were in favour of the strategy that the Commission outlined here for the Seattle negotiations and for later ones. We are certainly in favour of this strategic vision but we need to be brave and ambitious. We need to be demanding and ensure that social rights, environmental rights and consumer protection are incorporated into the forthcoming negotiations. Most importantly though, we must have a brave and ambitious long-term vision for reform, not just of the WTO but also of the ILO, the United Nations and above all, of the financial institutions, specifically the IMF and the World Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be brave and not only see some aspects of globalisation. We must be brave enough to have more of an overview of this process, so that wealth does not only benefit the most highly-developed blocks and countries, but that there is also harmonious change and development in every region in the world.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Having said this, Madam President, I am prepared, once again, to be a voice crying in the wilderness as a result of the absence of a fishing policy. It is really surprising that the Commission does not treat the revision of one of its common policies as a strategic objective for the coming years, in view of the reform which must take place in 2002. There is no doubt whatsoever that this revision process will be the most important thing to affect the fishing industry for many years. However, it seems that the Commission does not share this view, although it is the Commission which is obliged to present the Council and Parliament with a report on the functioning of the common fisheries policy over the last decade before the end of 2001, and it is on this basis that the Council will have to make the appropriate decisions with regard to its modification.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the revision process has already begun for many bodies and institutions, such as the European Parliament, which in 1998 already issued and adopted a report pointing out all the current problems and deficiencies of the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We have often asked for a basic timetable for this revision and we have received no reply. Less than two years is not much time if we bear in mind also that the fishing policy is anomalous with regard to the internal market regulations and that such anomalies should be resolved within the framework of this reform process.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I would ask that this issue, which is of vital importance to a very significant industry within the European Union, be taken into account in this strategy and these strategic objectives for the next five years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I particularly welcome his recognition of this virtuous circle of having sustained growth: the information society in an expanding European market with the addition of a fully functioning single currency which will give us the opportunity to genuinely promote prosperity, innovation enterprise, the entrepreneurial spirit and yes – most importantly of all – extra-high value sustainable jobs for our European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one observation, not a criticism, to make regarding Commissioner Prodi's statement this morning and that is that it was a little weak on the actual content of economic policy. We must not take anything for granted in terms of how we get the European economy restructured. After all, what is social justice if it is without full employment? Full employment is the best way to generate social justice for our citizens. This is a key priority for us to focus on.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to welcome one or two initiatives that have already come from the Commission which will help us: in particular Commissioner Liikanen's commitment to having an innovative knowledge-driven economy. Yes, e-Europe will be the future for us because it will help us create new prosperity and new jobs. I welcome the Commission initiatives now and in the past to support our small and medium-sized enterprises and I would like to congratulate our Portuguese Presidency for its initiative on having a charter for micro-businesses. That is important and something that can be developed through the Lisbon Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome Commissioner Busquin's idea to have a common research area for the whole of the European Union. Again, this is a way that we can help create better opportunities for jobs and for prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">You said in your summary, Commissioner Prodi, that liberalisation, competitiveness, keeping inflation low, innovation, science and technology are central for the future success of the European economy and creating jobs. I very much agree with you on that, but we can take nothing for granted. There is still more we have to do, and the Lisbon Summit will become part of that. So with those remarks I would like to congratulate you on the programme and wish it every success.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To me, this Commission strategy paper for the next five years reads like a scientific paper on the European Union or a declaration of principle. Unfortunately, it does not give the impression of being a real political strategy on the part of the Commission. As the spokesperson for cultural and training policy for my group, I would have expected more in the way of agenda from an Italian President of the Commission. The Commission gives no soul to Europe. Culture and training simply do not exist in this paper, despite the fact that we need to create a real area of training and culture in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Just a few main points. I am talking about the integration of the policies of the culture industry in this area of training and culture; they create jobs. I am talking about the introduction of cultural mainstreaming in all policy areas, about consolidating and improving the European dimension of training and education syllabuses and about networking training and education policies in Europe especially lifelong learning.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the Commission, it is the new millennium and you made no mention whatsoever of the audio-visual area of Europe. Nor was any mention made of information policy and communications catering to the needs of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that something is missing from this programme. Truly European citizenship depends on our creating a real, visible area of training and culture. Declarations of principle are not enough. We need an agenda which can be translated into political action by the Commission on an ongoing basis in the way in which I have just described. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have the fine, charming idea that the outcome and the benchmark for your policy and for your five-year programme will be the result of the elections, or rather the turnout at the next European elections. When I think that I have to explain your work programme week in, week out to my constituents, not in the rarefied atmosphere of this House, but on the street, then I ask myself, what can I say?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi, what can I say; what is there that is new? There is nothing new in your work programme. You have taken 12 pages for five years and 18 pages for one year’s work programme. Does that give me hope for the year 2000? No, it does not! In your work programme for 2000 you state something quite clever. You say that environmental considerations must be integrated into all other policy areas. Have you done so, Mr Prodi; have you even read your work programme for the year? No, you have not done so. You have not integrated environmental policy into enlargement, despite the fact that it will be one of the fundamental problems of enlargement. Nor have you integrated it into economic policy, competition or the internal market. You have not integrated it anywhere. You have tacked a few components together but you have no overall structure.</p>
<p class="contents">You said earlier in your speech that a disaster such as that of the Danube is an example of the need for an emergency structure; no, Mr Prodi, we need, at long last, to start transposing legislation and ensuring that legislation is monitored. You say in your five-year programme that the people of the European Union rightly expect food standards to be higher and better foodstuffs legislation. Mr Prodi, you do not know what you are talking about. The foodstuffs legislation in the European Union is the most ambitious in the world. Where it falls short, what is missing, is transposition in the Member States and monitoring. It is time you took your job seriously, it is time for you, as President of the Commission, to box the Member States on the ears and force them to do their work and fulfil their duties. It is no good spending time on hobbies when there is a day’s work to be done. That is what we expect of you in the next five years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I feel duty bound to publicly denounce the fact that fishing is absent from the programme which you have presented to us. The next five years of the Prodi Commission – as you solemnly announce in the first of your conclusions – will mean great change. I hope that this change will not mean an even greater marginalisation of fishing, since the silence of your programme, with regard to fishing, is deafening. Not a single line, nor a single word, refers to fishing or the CFP. I am not asking for details or specific points, but I believe that a mention was required.</p>
<p class="contents">How could you completely ignore a common – I repeat; common – policy with such an economic, social and regional impact, and which therefore affects the economic and social cohesion of Europe? This is all the more serious, if that is possible – as others have said – bearing in mind that your Commission, Mr Prodi, has to carry out nothing less than a revision or reform of the current common fisheries policy, which you are legally required to do in 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission intend to do nothing – at least it has announced nothing – about this reform in 2000 either? What message can we send to the fishermen of Europe, and their families, and the fishing industries, both the extractive and processing and marketing industries, and the related and secondary industries which depend on fishing in so many European ports, in so many European regions, in most cases peripheral regions, who rightly demand that this problem be dealt with as a priority?</p>
<p class="contents">You have made an explicit reference to the CAP for the coming years, but you have not done so for the CFP, with regard to the double adaptation of the internal market which is necessary to prevent exceptions – as has already been said – and in a global context, in the context of globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">This House has expressed its opinion on the first issue and it will also do so on the second. I would therefore ask you, Mr Prodi, to make an explicit reference to this problem in your reply today. Our parliamentary Group will table an amendment in this respect and we expect a positive message from you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On behalf of the Socialist Group, I would like to focus on the point of internal reform. We wholeheartedly support the programme as it is now laid down in a consultative document and which is also included in the programme of Vice-President, Mr Kinnock, on behalf of the Commission. We consider it to be of utmost importance that, in terms of financial control, personnel management and bureaucratic short-cuts, we can expect swift lines of policy and a more effective bureaucracy, for the benefit of the citizen. </p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we are aware that this is a massive programme and that, during the overhaul in the next couple of years, it will be necessary to keep the actual results coming in, as before. Much like in the Netherlands, where, at a given point, women woke up to the fact that, by referring to European legislation, they could improve their status in terms of social security, this is now also the case for scores of other citizens. They want to see results. Democracy, transparency and clarity always lead to results, citizens value results and this is what the Commission is judged on. This is exactly the point which Mr Swoboda and also other Members made: fear of modernisation, globalisation, and the individual losing his own sense of safety and security. </p>
<p class="contents">This can be prevented if a European social model is drawn up and if results are achieved in all these concrete areas. </p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore strongly advocate internal reform which delivers fast and concrete results at a social level. This gives the citizen a sense of recognition, here in Europe and elsewhere.

I am delighted that it is being discussed in Parliament, but I also note the compromises and the omissions in it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission makes only a passing reference to economic and social cohesion, to solidarity between Member States and to the European Union’s regional policy. And this is true even when it addresses the issue of enlargement. Are reducing the disparities between levels of development and the consequent promotion of real convergence objectives that we have already achieved? Certainly not! At the same time, it was rightly pointed out that Europe must evaluate its role as a joint partner with developing countries, and strengthen its activities designed for fighting poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">This document leaves out issues which clearly should have been included. I think the fact that the Commission does not address the issue of cohesion is extremely serious. It plays down one of the Treaties’ principles – that of economic and social cohesion – which must inform all of the European institutions’ policies and measures. It seems to ignore the fact that various European regions are still considerably less advanced than others. It also forgets that enlargement means that we must get regional policy right. Unless we achieve real convergence, the cohesion of the European Union itself will be at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">We should take into consideration the sixth periodic report on the situation of the regions in the European Union, for which the Commission is responsible. This report confirms that whereas an average level of development is given a rating of 100, the ten so-called “strongest” regions reached an average of 158, and the ten so-called “weakest” regions reached a figure of around 50. You may draw your own conclusions. 50 is exactly the level of development of my own region, the Azores, one of the regions defined in the Treaties as ultra-peripheral. I am waiting for the Commission’s report on the ultra-peripheral regions, which the Council decided should be drawn up by December 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall finish by restating my conviction that without economic and social cohesion, there will be no cohesion at all, only disunity.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As intended by the Treaties and the will of the people, the Commission is the driving force of European construction which is like a rock of Sisyphus which we have to push back up to the summit again together after each round of enlargement. We therefore need a strong Commission but one which relies on the support of a parliament. This House is therefore your ally but not one which is too accommodating. You must therefore listen to our opinions, one or two of which I wish to express in my brief speech.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, Mr President, although your two predecessors concentrated on developing an internal market and establishing the single currency, it has been left to you to develop this whole value of citizenship which is at the heart of European construction. You must not allow yourself to be distracted by the sole issue of enlargement, however important this may be. You must go further, towards reconciling the people with Europe, in particular those people who are falling victim to economic, social and, probably, in the future, technological divisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The promotion of scientific development and new technologies and access for all to these technologies will not be provided by the market or competition. The latter will also not ensure the social proximity and effectiveness of the main community services of health, education, transport, communications, water and whatever else. Your action programme and your objectives are reserved, even silent, specifically on the stimulation of public investment which is needed. This is also the case with the consolidation and financing of the main public and general interest services. This is an absolute priority if you are to reconcile Europe with the people and ensure that the people choose Europe rather than Jörg Haider. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The recent dioxin scare in Belgium, prior to that the BSE crisis in Britain, and the continuing controversy over the safety of genetically-modified foods, have all contributed to undermining consumer confidence in the safety of the food they eat. If the Commission can indeed restore confidence in the food production chain it will simultaneously restore confidence in the European Union institutions themselves and demonstrate their ability to protect the rights of EU citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the fact that the issue of food safety, public health and consumer confidence features prominently in the Commission's work programme for 2000. However, I was disappointed with the nature of the proposal for the establishment of a European food authority in the recent White Paper. In its present form, what is being proposed is more like an advisory agency to the Commission rather than an independent body that would have decision– and law-making powers more similar to those of the US Food and Drug Administration, which has already established credibility in this particular field.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, future legislation must address the <span class="italic">modus operandi</span> of the relationship between the European food authority and the authorities of national Member States, for example the food safety authority in Ireland. This body, for example, alongside the recently established cross-border body in Ireland for food safety, is already doing good work. It would be a tragedy if their efforts were to be undermined by deficiencies in EU legislation. My fear is that such deficiencies in EU legislation could lead to turf wars between national and EU bodies, who should be working together rather than against one another. That is something we must guard against.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We will be looking for the detail year by year, for example in the social action programme to be unveiled this year. We will also be looking at this from the perspective of social and employment policy, and will be applying a number of tests. We will be looking at the extent to which we can create an equilateral policy triangle combining economic policy, employment policy and social policy. At the moment, social policy is trailing well behind economic and employment policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the employment strategy we will look for a deepening and broadening of the strategy following the review under the Portuguese presidency and within the framework being proposed by the Portuguese Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the social dimension we will be looking for a deepening of the internal market with a social aspect. The spate of mergers, takeovers and transfers that we are experiencing with the deepening of the market means that we must act to update the matrix of information and consultation directives that we have adopted in the past; but we must also complement them with the new general framework of information and consultation and an updating of the works council directive.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need a code of corporate conduct to make sure that companies in fact work in partnership with their workers in the management of change. That is the successful way to manage change, and I hope the Commission will act to make sure that is put into place.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with the emergence, the resurgence, of the xenophobic Right within the European Union I hope that our institutions together will do their utmost to give reality to Article 6 by using Article 13 to combat discrimination, and Article 137 to combat exclusion. We need to move that agenda forward with great urgency now. The aspirations are fine, President Prodi, we want those aspirations to be matched by action.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Prodi, you set great store in your reform efforts on introducing a forward-looking employment policy throughout Europe. However, for the economic sector which I represent, i.e. fisheries, this means change. We need to break away from planned economy subsidies in favour of a liberal policy which fosters personal responsibility. We must reduce protective tariffs in order to safeguard effective capacity utilisation in undertakings in the processing industry.</p>
<p class="contents">What it comes down to is the competitiveness of the European economy on the world market and the existence of thousands of jobs in the processing industry and offshore fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am sure that I do not need to remind you of the importance of a branch of the economy which is both an economic and a social factor, which affects not only Germany but all the coastal regions of Europe. Plus, this branch of the economy is one of the few sectors in which Europe has fully integrated powers to decide and act, which is why we expect to be given a right of codecision here too. This has since been unanimously approved.</p>
<p class="contents">The fisheries policy is due for review in a few months’ time, i.e. at the beginning of the year 2000. So it is somewhat upsetting that there is not so much as a mention of this branch of the economy is this paper. I hope that this is a misunderstanding. Please, Mr Prodi, stand by your word and implement your promises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we have acknowledged that this is an innovative and very welcome initiative by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">One area that I want to focus on, in addition to those already identified, is that of cultural diversity in Europe. The introduction to this statement acknowledges under the quality of life section that it is important. But there is nothing in the statement which indicates that the Commission intends to take any steps to deal with the issue of cultural diversity. If we are to ensure that we defeat the fear-mongers amongst us – those seeking power on the backs of anxious citizens – then we must seriously address the question of how we can live together and how we can dismantle the negative stereotypes that we have of each other, both within the present European Union and among those who seek to join us and, indeed, among those in other parts of Europe and the world who want to come and live and work in Europe. Unless we address these issues, unless we dismantle these negative stereotypes, unless we take what is best from our various cultures and languages and protect and expand it and ensure that we are serious about having a diverse Europe, we will fail. Those who are currently coming to the fore in Europe based on fear will win the day.</p>
<p class="contents">I am seriously concerned that unless the Commission recognises that this is an important aspect of how we will create a cohesive Europe, we will make progress on the economic front, on the employment front and even on the issue of foreign and security policy, but our citizens will still remain fearful because they will fear the unknown and they will fear those they do not understand.

It has been a calm debate with broad agreement over the basic points, but also where there has been a marked reassertion of Parliament’s rights and of the need for cooperation and dialogue between Parliament, the Commission and the Council. It has been a constructive debate for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The document that I have presented has been described as a political manifesto with some internal contradictions. Mrs Hautala, I think you were almost right in saying this, because it is indeed a political manifesto. But it is not some abstract political manifesto, but a manifestation of political will which we need at this delicate stage for Europe. It is pointless to say that Europe is in crisis if we are then unable to issue a political manifesto, to discuss it, to dwell on it and to draw conclusions on it together.</p>
<p class="contents">So the contradictions between objectives and instruments which Mrs Hautala rightly pointed out, reflect contradictions in the current state of affairs in Europe. These are the contradictions that it is our duty to rectify and overcome. This is the importance of the political task we must tackle today. I have brought them out into the open without hiding anything. I am pleased that they have been given such prominence and also, sometimes, been asserted so forcefully,<span class="bold"> </span>been given such importance, and this is why we want to change the instruments that we use to guide our action, Parliament’s action, my action, the action of all the European institutions; this is why we wanted an effective Intergovernmental Conference; this is why Helsinki signified a time of delicate change. </p>
<p class="contents">It has been written that we had given up the drive towards a stronger Europe, but then in Helsinki we rekindled the flames that we had managed to keep going until then. Cast your minds back – I recall this because it took place in this very Chamber – to the speech given by the President of the French Republic on the issues of reinforced cooperation which reopened a dialogue that appeared closed prior to this. I hope our tenacity in maintaining our positions in Helsinki will be rewarded at the Intergovernmental Conference, which will culminate with the Nice Summit. </p>
<p class="contents">We have been reminded by everyone – not just by Mr Poettering and Mr Fiori, but many speakers – of globalisation and the difficulties this is causing us in our lives and policies. The Commission wants globalisation. It sees it as positive because it is providing a minimum amount of dignity for billions of people marginalised by the global market, and because it is thanks to globalisation that a new day is dawning in China and India for, I repeat, billions of people.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that globalisation will continue to have this positive aspect in the future, but – and this is going to be one of our major commitments in the future – it leads to problems in poor countries and in our countries, problems that we must address. And it also leads to problems in the weakest sectors of our countries. This means examining our conscience over the practical action we must take from day to day, because it is clear that globalisation is causing our society to diverge, increasing poverty, giving more grounds for anger,<span class="bold"> </span>causing wide differences in salaries, even in sectors which seem similar, and we need to focus our attention on this. </p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, when our young graduates notice differences in salaries, small or large depending on the type of employment they are in, and when the financial sector pays wages that are X number of times higher than someone working in research, for example, all of this creates problems relating to the organisation of our future society. We need to deliberate carefully over this, and – I am responding to Mr Trentin – frankly we still have not, or at least I still have not prepared a complete response in this regard. I started to respond in Lisbon, by attempting to reduce the marginalisation of an entire age group, that is, to provide all the young people of Europe with new instruments for communication, broadly reunite all the European schools and create new opportunities to prevent geographical and social marginalisation in Europe. This still does not go far enough towards controlling globalisation, or at least understanding the consequences of globalisation, but it is a substantial and necessary response. </p>
<p class="contents">In recent weeks, Commissioner Lamy also vigorously proposed a response at global level on behalf of the Commission: to rebuild confidence in the development of the Third World that was put in such serious jeopardy at Seattle and to repropose a role for the WTO with a wide agenda able to address the challenge of globalisation. In Geneva, the Commission proposed an extraordinarily bold short-term packet which complies with many of your requests. It proposed unilaterally reducing customs duties to zero for the 38-40 poorest countries – unilaterally, completely and across the board; it proposed reforming the WTO’s procedures and greater transparency; it proposed giving a response to the developing countries over issues relating to the promotion<span class="bold"> </span>of this measure. If these measures gain support<span class="bold"> </span>over the next few days, the Commission – as it has already announced – will vigorously proceed with the relaunching of the Round for summer, and therefore its resumption. </p>
<p class="contents">We are trying to repair the damage done in Seattle. This is the Commission’s major task, and together, we plan to reform the WTO and establish a place for the Commission within it, and the Commission will at last study the matter in great depth because it has not been done in recent years. This is an initial practical response in a five-year programme, which is not there to provide responses on individual issues but to provide these major policy lines, extracts<span class="bold"> </span>from our future action, extracts where Parliament’s supervision is essential, as is collaboration between Parliament and the Commission. The synergies between the Commission, Parliament and the Council are essential, Mr Cox. </p>
<p class="contents">Clearly this will compel us, as we have seen and as was the subject of a large part of my intervention, to rethink the concept of subsidiarity. I am grateful to Mr Poettering, Mr Cox and the others who mentioned this. This is the cornerstone of the programme. Too often, subsidiarity has been lauded in theory but has not been understood<span class="bold"> </span>in practice. We must give subsidiarity a material body and a political soul: this is the aim of the White Paper, which must put value back into Europe and recommend what practical action to undertake. I do not want to<span class="bold"> </span>devalue Europe, Mr Dell’Alba. I do not want to do shed the power to implement common policies; on the contrary, I want to consolidate, accelerate and improve the decisions and implementation of common policies, but at the same time I want to prevent our mechanisms becoming flooded with a large number of disjointed policies which, in reality, have little that is ‘common’ about them.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Let us remember how often we have been made into a laughing-stock because we deal with things that are absolutely ridiculous, which defy common sense and conflict with the interests of our population. Regarding this matter and this transformation, the Commission can and must be a real leader, relieved of useless burdens, given more credibility because it takes tangible form in its “core<span class="bold"> </span>business” and<span class="bold"> </span>because it does not make requests but instead rejects unnecessary tasks and powers. The Commission must become a driving force. As Mr Cox said, we should be an "enabling Europe" not an "including Europe", but very often we have been an “enabling Europe” on the one hand and an “including Europe” on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">My second guarantee is that these are not empty proposals. We have started work on them, not just as regards the internal reform of the Commission, together with Commissioner Kinnock, but also in some initial reforms of the structure of individual policies. I shall give you an example: if there is one policy that is important to the Commission, it is competition policy. Well, we have presented – and in January this House supported these hypotheses with an overwhelming majority – a programme for reform which will allow the Commission to concentrate on the fight against the most serious and important breaches of competition policy at European level, and we have begun a process of major cooperation with the national authorities on this. </p>
<p class="contents">We have done the same thing in the White Paper regarding the food sector. I have heard this being criticised – and I understand the criticism – that it is "has less powers than American Food and Drug Administration”. Well of course it does! I wanted to use the national authorities which are already active in this area. If I had used an organisational model such as the American one, you would now be rebelling and saying, “you have set up yet another centralised structure in Brussels!” This is Europe: this delicate balance between existing national structures which must be enhanced and put in a network with the European authority, and not humiliated by its presence. Just as enlargement is a difficult challenge, this is too because it has never before been attempted. </p>
<p class="contents">I welcome this broad unity over enlargement. There has hardly been any difference of opinion during this morning’s debate, and I welcome that because enlargement is a decision that is going to entail sacrifice for us and great changes within ourselves. At the time of the actual decision, here, we shall all have to be united in order to demonstrate that enlargement is in the interests of peace, prosperity and is taking place by way of a guarantee, as I said before, for our people, in addition to a guarantee for the countries which are attempting to enlarge. </p>
<p class="contents">I have no intention to proceed to an enlargement process that is not serious, strong and, above all – Mrs Muscardini was very attentive and made a justified remark about this – enlargement must not produce two types of members: the importance of enlargement stems precisely from the fact that, once a country joins this Union, it is the same as all the others. I said that we are a unity of minorities, a union of minorities: this is the extraordinary thing about the European Union. But enlargement is also about being strict. I was reminded about the nuclear power stations and the Danube. I have just been to Lithuania, Slovakia and Romania, three countries where we have had to request nuclear power stations to be closed. We did this, mindful of the serious problems for the local economies, but we explained that these are Europe’s rules and that this is a safety measure which everyone has to and will have to adopt. These countries understood that we have helped their transformation. They have undertaken to close the nuclear power plants, which is an enormous sacrifice for them. But this is Europe. Why the sacrifice? So that the goal, which is in the common interest, can be achieved. </p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to reach an agreement over Africa. I have heard a lot of impassioned interventions about Africa, which I also mentioned in my speech because Africa is one of the crosses we have to bear: Africa is neglected by everyone. I would remind you of the long journey the American President made in recent years which brought hope for a time, but then nothing came of it. Africa is principally one of our problems. Naturally, it is included in the hierarchy of the analyses of foreign policy we mentioned earlier; enlargement, the Mediterranean, Ukraine, Russia and the question of Africa, which is under discussion. Preparations for the Summit are progressing, but there are enormous difficulties: there are terrible divisions in Africa, and I am trying to reduce them too: I am trying to heal the rifts because if they remain, it would become impossible to launch a major policy to help such a desperate Africa. The Task Force in the development DG<span class="bold"> </span>is cooperating closely with the external relations DG<span class="bold"> </span>in order to include new sectors in their work on Africa too. We are starting to cooperate in the communication, education and science sectors. If we do not act in these sectors of civilisation, it will be impossible for Africa to act. Nevertheless, I am aware that we are still at the beginning and I would therefore ask for a great deal of openness and help from everyone. </p>
<p class="contents">I have also been rebuked for not having mentioned certain important sectors such as fisheries. It is true, I did not mention fisheries, and I did not even mention agriculture, schools or the whole of the major social policy on the elderly. I did not mention it because I believe that the five-year programme must set out the major policy lines regarding general development, but I am convinced of its enormous importance for cohesion and European solidarity. I assure you that there will be a commitment in this area because it is clear that it is a piece of the important mosaic that we have outlined in today’s debate. </p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely with these essential functions, with which we must ensure respect for our irreplaceable,<span class="bold"> </span>political and moral role at Europe’s helm, that the Commission must strive to show the advantages and costs of our policies and to be very clear for a population that asks us for clarity, that asks us to be absolutely transparent. In this regard, I am reassured and encouraged by this debate. It reassures me because I have perceived a broad consensus on the basic lines of our programme and because I have the impression that its true substance has been understood. It has been a calm debate, as I said at the start, but not modest: on the contrary, it has been a debate with only a high political profile. So while the term “manifesto” might sound negative, it does, nevertheless, have an important value of its own and a sound political content. We have talked to each other with a language that Mr Barón Crespo described as plain and accessible. It emerged clearly, but forcefully that the challenges before us are the great political challenges that we must tackle together. </p>
<p class="contents">This makes close collaboration between Parliament and the Commission even more important. I am encouraged by this. There are those who have not been persuaded by the debate, such as Mr Wurtz, who said in his statement that he welcomed the constructive spirit and added: “we have five years to succeed”. We are ready to collaborate. This is what I want, Mr Cox, and not because I have ever noticed I am living in a honeymoon period. You said that the honeymoon is over. I remember the honeymoon as being somewhat different, from the months we spent together, but I am pleased you used this term. In any case, this debate has further convinced me that the major challenges that lie ahead are political challenges. They require great energy, energy that will need to be intensified as the synergy between the institutions grows. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by picking up on something Mr Barón Crespo mentioned. He mentioned something that is very important to me: Ambrogio Lorenzetti’s fresco on Good Government, in Siena. If you recall, it is a fresco where everything works. There are people working, merchants, and hierarchies which can easily be seen in that Sienese society. It was a real five-year programme of the Community of Siena; it was their document whereby they tried to describe the society of the time. We can but admire this, because after all, it could serve as a point of reference. And Mr Barón Crespo, we cannot forget that the five-year programme was unable to exert any practical influence in the world; it disappeared from political manifestos when Siena's role in the world weakened. I think that we must avoid this danger. </p>
