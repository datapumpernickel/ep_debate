<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, the plan of implementation agreed in Johannesburg during the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 put a strong emphasis on renewable energy. It stresses the need to substantially increase the share of renewable energy in the total world energy supply. In answer to this challenge, the European Community and the Member States launched, during the World Summit in Johannesburg, the so-called 'Johannesburg Renewable Energy Coalition', inviting all countries of the world to joint it. A key milestone in this process is the conference that will take place in Bonn this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been involved in its preparation since the very early stages. The first preparatory international high-level conference was organised by the Commission. It offered the first major stepping-stone towards the Bonn conference, including a clear road map. The Commission is also hosting the secretariat of this coalition.</p>
<p class="contents">The coalition has now grown from 66 to 87 members and continues to grow: Ghana joined only this week. The Commission intends to present three initiatives at the Bonn conference: first, a communication assessing the state of development of renewable energy in the European Union. The communication takes as its starting point the need to address the Union's growing dependence on energy imports – mainly oil and fossil fuels from a few areas of the world – and the need to tackle climate change. The promotion of renewable energy has an important part to play in both those areas. The communication will evaluate progress made by Member States under the directive on electricity from renewable energy sources. It will report that all Member States have adopted national targets for the share of electricity production from renewable energy sources. If Member States achieve their national targets, the share of electricity from renewable energy sources in the EU of 15 should come close to the 22% target of the directive, compared to 14% in 2001. However, national policies and measures currently in place will probably achieve only half of the progress necessary, bringing the renewable energy share in electricity production only up to between 18% and 19% in 2010. That is a source of concern.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards overall energy consumption, the Union has, since 1997, been working towards the target of a 12% share of renewable energy. A couple of years ago the share was only 6%. Since that date, in 2001 the Community adopted new legislation in the field of renewable energy and energy efficiency, a directive on electricity from renewable energy sources –covering biofuels, energy performance of buildings, co-generation, etc. The European Parliament and the Council are examining further proposals on eco-design requirements, energy efficiency and energy services. However, even if this framework legislation is fully transposed and implemented, the share of renewable energy should still only reach 10% in 2010. There will be a need for further action. A priority will be the heating sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Through the secretariat of the Johannesburg Renewable Energy Coalition we have launched two key initiatives to support, in particular, the developing country members of the coalition. We are developing a global on-line renewable energy policy and measures data base, including reported targets jointly with the renewable energy team of the International Energy Agency. To respond to the continuing call for innovative public/private partnerships we are also exploring the feasibility of creating a patient capital fund to encourage participation from international and local financial intermediaries, as well as the international financial institutions. The aim is to offer affordable risk capital. Both projects will be presented by the Commission at the Bonn conference.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to clarify some issues about the patient capital initiative, which originates from the commitments made by the European Union to identify and bridge financing gaps and obstacles with respect to renewable energy. First of all, it is still only an idea that we are studying. A feasibility study has been launched. If it is established, that fund would be a type of equity finance that blends public and private sector investment requirements. It would provide equity funding in the expectation of a return but on a less demanding basis than pure market private equity capital. We are presenting this initiative in a wide range of events and fora and have received positive feedback so far.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Bonn conference, the European Preparatory Conference on Renewable Energy was held in January this year. That conference considered that the use of overall targets for renewable energy should be extended beyond 2010. A number of technical studies suggest that a target of at least 20% of gross domestic consumption from renewable energy in 2020 is economically feasible and achievable for the EU of 25, provided that the right policy environment is created. However, it is the view of the Commission that the adoption of an EU target of 2020 is premature at this point in time, as further consultations are necessary. Nevertheless my personal opinion is that we should give a clear signal in Bonn that we are ready to set 2020 targets, but that more work is needed on what those targets should be. Such a signal is critical if the EU wants to maintain its leadership role within the coalition for renewable energy and in the field of global sustainable development in general.</p>
<p class="contents">The targets set for 2020 are also necessary to give certainty to the fledgling renewable energy industry within the EU and, in particular, to the financial sector. This will help achieve current and future targets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union has made considerable progress, but much remains to be done. Three years ago, this Parliament approved the Directive on the promotion of renewable electricity sources and, since then, there has been a spectacular increase in the use of such electricity sources. The European Union brings together the majority of the world’s installed capacity. In 2001, there was 17 000 megawatts of wind power installed. Today this figure has doubled. This is just one example of a long list of successes which allow us to export innovative technologies respectful of the environment to other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">From now on, we will need to achieve greater efficiency which contributes to better management of energy resources. In this regard, I believe that the directives on energy efficiency in buildings and cogeneration will play an important role, as well as the new intelligent energy plan for Europe. I would like the 20% referred to in the motion for a resolution to be achieved, but the method that can contribute most to achieving it is unquestionably improving energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">The consumption of fuel for transport generates emissions of polluting gases, the immediate effects of which are suffered in the large urban centres. Therefore, the directive for the promotion of biofuels, approved last year, is another of Commissioner de Palacio’s commitments to renewable energies with a view to reducing emissions into the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="contents">We are already seeing some cities incorporating transport systems using biodiesel, bioethanol and hydrogen. In some cases they are experimental projects, but in others this technology is a reality within our transport systems. These fuels can also be used in mixtures with other conventional fuels in normal cars and, as if this were not enough, hybrid vehicles which operate conventionally and electrically and are the most fuel-efficient are already being marketed.</p>
<p class="contents">The next step must be technology for the large-scale use of hydrogen. The Commission has already opened a wide debate on this energy vector which will allow us to use forms of transport without emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">The current legislature is coming to an end, but I am sure that hydrogen will be one of the great subjects of debate in the coming months and all these initiatives can contribute to achieving the most ambitious objectives for renewable energies and, ultimately, for the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when OPEC has just approved a reduction in oil production, I would like to end today by calling on the Member States to demonstrate sufficient will to promote these renewable technologies which do not pollute and which come from sources which nature provides us with in abundance, since this will benefit everybody. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rothe (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the International Conference for Renewable Energies is to be held in Bonn at the beginning of June. The German Federal Chancellor had announced this conference at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg. I regard this conference as a truly important result of this summit, as you yourself, Commissioner, have just said. I do think that it was particularly those who had been in Johannesburg who were extremely disappointed by what came out of it with regard to renewable energies. Even if, as you just said, we can now welcome the Johannesburg coalition’s first successes, it had not been possible to achieve the goals we had set ourselves there at the time, even though the European Union really did make very serious and very concerted efforts. As I see it, this makes it extraordinarily important that this conference in Bonn should be a success.</p>
<p class="contents">You referred, Commissioner, to the European preparatory conference in Berlin, which was held in January, attended by over 650 participants from 45 countries, and made its expectations very clear – not only as regards what it expected of the Bonn conference, but also of the European Union and its policies. I think the way in which the European Union has conceived its strategy for the development of renewable energies has been positively exemplary, envisaging the doubling of the share of energy production from renewable sources to 12% – in the case of the electricity sector to 22.1% – by 2010. You mentioned our market penetration campaign and our legislation to promote electricity and biofuels. It is important to note that we are currently engaged in using the eco-design directive and energy services to build up efficiency, but what is now vital is that we press on with this strategy and step it up. I do not actually need to remind you what this is about – the climate change problem, finite resources, the need to reduce our dependence on imports, the creation of jobs in this area. I think it is, in the first place, important that we should look beyond 2010 and – although this is where I disagree with you, Commissioner – to set ourselves a new objective. The fact is that the Berlin conference did not merely call for a study; it also made it quite plain in its concluding resolutions that 20% was a desirable target for 2020, and you can see that our compromise resolution expects no less than that, namely that the Commission and the Council should have that as their goal and that policies should be framed with it in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">What will in future be important in terms of a more intensive approach will be the devising of new measures to this end. Although you have expressed doubts about this, we can see that it is, under certain circumstances, possible to achieve the 22.1% we have set ourselves in the electricity sector; we learn this in particular from the countries with a system of central dispatch. It is impossible, or almost impossible, to achieve this in heating and refrigeration, so this is where it will be important to add to EU lawmaking if the overall target of doubling is to be achieved, but also to integrate renewable energies in many of the European Union’s other policy areas, such as structural policy, regional policy, perhaps in the Mediterranean and certainly in development cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that three billion people around the world are obliged to live without access to electricity, and it is quite crucial in terms of the poverty reduction that we should back something that offers real opportunities of doing this, that being decentralised systems using renewable energies. It is for that reason that our resolution makes it very clear that it is necessary to provide for the appropriate measures, and that means that institutions providing funding – such as, among others, the European Investment Bank – must give priority to renewable energies and to energy efficiency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will, however, make some observations by way of adding nuances.</p>
<p class="contents">The need to protect the climate and the environment means that renewable energies, which will reduce our dependence on oil and gas, are the form of energy for the twenty-first century; without them, though, even with the development strategy, billions of the world’s people will have no future. It is of course a good thing that they will also enable us to create jobs in Europe. I have heard this week that Mr Kerry, the Democrat candidate for the American presidency, has announced that the USA, too, intends to derive 20% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020, and this represents a gigantic boom for European industry, as we are the leaders in renewable energy technology, and this will benefit European industry too.</p>
<p class="contents">If the EU is to create security for investment in the energy sector and in others, then it needs long-term climate protection goals, with renewable sources producing at least 60% of energy by 2050 and at least 20% by 2020. Today, we have less of a problem with renewable energies themselves – in which we are ahead of the field – than with a strategy for efficiency, in which we lag behind China. Yesterday, in the Council, the possibility of coming to an early agreement on the Eco-Design Directive evaporated, as we are no longer able to make ‘win-win’ directives of that sort palatable to the Council, or perhaps also because there is too much lobbying on the part of industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution, which is supported by all the political groups, also makes it plain that the European Investment Bank must play a higher-profile role. As things stand today, not even 10% of its loans are made to support renewable energies; as they are the energies of the future, that is another area in which political pressure needs to be exerted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, under international law the Kyoto Protocol will be binding on its signatories for several years. During this time it cannot be altered, meaning the Kyoto process will remain much too static.</p>
<p class="contents">Climate change, however, is a real threat, and for that reason the action taken to resist it should be seen as tough and dynamic. One way is to analyse the EU’s former policies, which in most sectors have already successfully made economic growth independent of any increase in emissions. This has come about when the actions have decentralised, forming a variety of effective policies that create a dynamic, and even positive side effects for the environment and society. These should now be strengthened and applied to other sectors. Above all, this should now be applied globally. The Bonn conference will be the first step.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations environment programmes should be granted the authority they need and resistance to climate change should be split up into areas of action to promote energy efficiency, the use of renewable energy and clean technology. This would also create the dynamic needed for change to take place.</p>
<p class="contents">Such an approach would also give the United States of America and Russia a new opportunity to be involved and participate in action to reduce greenhouse gases. Within the framework of the UN clear global structures should be created for the carbon economy and a price for carbon dioxide established, while at the same time there is vigorous promotion of market-based incentives to cut emissions. Similarly, the incredible rate at which emissions are increasing in China and India must be cut within the framework of the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">Keeping to the Kyoto targets is vital, but it should be possible to quickly acknowledge the adverse effects of the Kyoto process and control them. Otherwise the agreement will go against the aims of sustainable development. The EU has shown great courage as a pioneer, but one also has to have courage to admit one’s mistakes, if any have been made. With Kyoto it would seem that the biggest mistake concerns carbon leakage, which threatens to come into existence, when production switches to countries unaffected by the Kyoto targets. ‘The polluter pays’ principle is thus changing to the ‘the polluter is paid’ practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, with renewable energy sources there is a danger of slogans going to our heads and of us not being very realistic. The investment in research into the promotion of renewables is already excessive, and Parliament is again prepared to increase its minimum share. Most renewables still come from large hydroelectric power stations, and people are not ready to add more.</p>
<p class="contents">You cannot push on a cord; you have to pull it, as the Finnish saying goes. Investment in research will not help any more, but global demand would. That is why we must do our best at Bonn to draw people’s attention to the issue of global demand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My second comment has to do with the Bonn conference; I would like to suggest that we in this House should also send a delegation to represent us at it, as a whole array of legislatures from around the world will be doing. It would be a disgrace for the European Parliament not to have a visible presence there in the shape of a group of MEPs with an official mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, let me say that, in the resolution – to which Mrs Rothe very rightly referred – the term ‘poverty reduction’ occurs twice. I see it as extremely important that we should make the connection between climate policy, energy policy and poverty reduction. For example, the instrument for doing this – or at least one of those that are suitable – is decentralised energy supply systems using renewable energies and another instrument that we are at present discussing in this House, that is, emissions trading, what is termed the Linking Directive. We can be grateful to the Commission for having, some time ago, brought out a very interesting brochure in which it set out the means that could be employed in this way to benefit the renewable energy sector in the Mediterranean region alone. The figures quoted in it are extraordinarily high. I think this is an instrument of which we could make much more use. After all, we have to finance renewable energies, and we all know that they do not come cheap.</p>
<p class="contents">My final observation must be that what rather worries me about renewable energies is that they are currently going through an upward phase. They are on everyone’s lips, renewable energies get good write-ups in the press, and rightly so too. Who knows, though, what will happen in a couple of years’ time, when the costs go up? Will they be just as acceptable, or will we perhaps come to the conclusion that you can have too much of a good thing, and decide cut back a bit? To do so would be extraordinarily dangerous, for it would inhibit continuity in a sector that forms part of our industrial policy. What this boils down to is that we need continuity, and the small- and medium-sized enterprises that have invested in renewable energy sources need security.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interruption)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Yes, costs are falling, but they are, nonetheless, relatively high. I am perfectly familiar with the debates in my own country about the costs of renewable energies. In Germany alone, it is estimated that they will cost us between EUR 4 billion and EUR 5 billion in a couple of years’ time. It may well indeed be that many will see this as a pain barrier through which they do not want to go. I just want to warn that continuity should be maintained rather than broken if those who invest in them today are to have security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I both experienced and shared the disappointment that the EU delegation, above all, felt about the fact that we did not get further with the establishing a global objective for renewable energy. We turned the meeting to as best account as we could achieve at the time. I myself have taken a very active interest in bringing together those who wish to work with clear goals and dates in the matter of how to achieve a greater proportion of renewable energy.</p>
<p class="contents">The impending meeting in Bonn will, of course, be of great significance. Above all, we will be able to share experience and knowledge there on how we can best support the development of renewable energy by political means. During today’s debate we have heard some of the best arguments for why this is necessary, including the argument regarding climate change. Mr Turmes listed all our convincing arguments in favour of the need to invest in renewable energy. We have discussed some of the most important tools. I am the first to admit that, by explaining in Bonn that we are prepared to think slightly more long term, that is to say up to 2020, and that we wish to set such a goal, we should be sending out an important signal. In the enlarged European Union, we will, however, need a little more time to discuss in more detail how this goal should be established and at what level it should be set.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to state that there is a misunderstanding among some of the Members regarding the current situation relating to the Kyoto Protocol. The situation is not as a number of people think, that is that we have a complete stalemate. All the countries that have now ratified the Kyoto Protocol are in fact doing very important and practical work to implement the Protocol. This is because most of these countries, particularly the poor ones, are already affected by climate change. They realise that the effects of climate change will only get worse if they do not deal with the problem now. Important work has therefore already been got under way. We are not alone in taking action. All over the world, people have begun to realise that the threat of climate change is so great that we need to take action right away.</p>
<p class="contents">The assertion that renewable energy could become more expensive is wrong. On the contrary, it will become cheaper. Think of the development regarding fossil fuels. We have seen just recently how expensive oil has become. It will become more profitable to invest in renewable energy. This is especially true if we also take the fossil fuel subsidies out of the equation.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also be completely clear about the fact that the market for renewable energy already represents great economic value. It is European companies that are today responsible for 90% of the world market in equipment. We are very competitive, a fact that has created thousands of jobs in Europe. This development will continue. Wind energy alone has increased from 5GW (gigawatts) in 1997 to 27GW in 2003. Huge development is taking place in this sector. It is not at all the case that this area is standing still, or that not enough is happening. An enormous amount is happening, and the potential is fantastic. We must make use of these facts as arguments during our meeting in Bonn. We must make sure that, in the future too, we are world leaders in the area of renewable energy. This is something from which we shall all gain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will be working here this evening on behalf of those whom I represent, and will be doing so until tomorrow lunchtime. That I affirm; I believe it to be our duty.

What goes on in the depths of this House, particularly in the evenings, is a scandal. A group of us had to wait, in gusts of wind, up to 40 minutes for a car from the so-called car service. I am not blaming the drivers, who do a quite outstanding job of work, but responsibility for this must surely rest with some official or other, some manager in the administration, who took 17 cars out of service for this week. For how much longer are we MEPs supposed to put up with this intolerable humiliation by officials of this House? I ask you to ensure that the service is organised on more MEP-friendly lines without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">If you want an example of a good car service, then let me, as a German Member, advise you to look to Berlin, where the car service really is worthy of the name and provides a service for the Members’ benefit.</p>
