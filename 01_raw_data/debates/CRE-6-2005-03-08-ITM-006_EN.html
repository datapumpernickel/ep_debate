<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">President. </span></span>  <span class="bold"></span> Today, ladies and gentlemen, we are celebrating International Women’s Day. We have been doing so for more than 90 years, but, despite this celebration, every day millions of women throughout the world still suffer discrimination on the grounds of gender and abuse of all kinds, both in times of peace and in times of war. They are still the victims of physical, psychological, sexual and economic violence, violence which sometimes comes from within their closest family environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Just a few days ago we saw horrific images of Turkish riot police putting down a demonstration of women ahead of today’s Women’s Day. I had the opportunity to condemn these actions yesterday in plenary. I have asked the Turkish Government to punish the perpetrators of these indescribable actions and I would like to point out that they do not, of course, send the best possible message in terms of Turkey’s possible accession.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, at the moment and until 11 March, the United Nations are hosting a World Conference on gender equality to review the progress made since the Beijing Conference of 1995, ten years ago now. As you know, a Delegation from our Parliament is participating very actively in this Conference, as was also the case in 1995.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no question that progress has been made since then. Kofi Annan acknowledged this in his speech at the opening of the Beijing + 10 Conference, but there are still enormous problems, immense challenges, which must not be considered without proposing solutions, just as we must not treat today as simply a symbolic day which merely serves to satisfy our guilty conscience.</p>
<p class="contents">This afternoon we will hold a debate on ‘Cultural and domestic violence’ involving specialised media and personalities. I would like to invite all of you to this seminar/debate, and when I say everybody, I mean everybody, men and women, because when we hold these events relating to the problems of women, we men are usually conspicuous by our absence. We must be aware that the problem of gender equality is not just a problem for women, it is a problem for both women and for society as a whole, and we men must be more involved in the task of resolving it.</p>
<p class="contents">Today in Europe, one in every five women claim to have been victims of abuse, one in every five. And unfortunately this proportion is increasing in many countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In the rich, democratic, developed and cohesive European Union, poverty is becoming increasingly feminised. There are worrying signs of a feminisation of poverty. Women today still receive, on average, 16% less pay than their male colleagues for the same work.</p>
<p class="contents">This point must also be dealt with within the Lisbon Strategy, which does not offer very positive figures in this regard either. For this reason, during this term in office, we have introduced into each parliamentary committee a Member responsible for monitoring gender issues, which cannot be dealt with in an isolated fashion, in a kind of conceptual ghetto, but which must affect all policies horizontally.</p>
<p class="contents">This term in office will also be marked by the ratification of the Constitution, which includes, very rightly, gender equality amongst the Union’s objectives and values. But we must go beyond texts and words and be aware that equality will not become a reality until the mindset of men changes radically, overcoming an anthropological heritage that is sometimes deeply ingrained in our customs and consciences, until employers start offering equal salaries, until specific advantages are offered with a view to helping women to carry out their professional activities and to prevent or compensate for the disadvantages they have to face in their professional careers as a result of fulfilling a role that only they can play, human reproduction. We will not resolve Europe’s demographic problems unless we resolve the problems of equality for women.</p>
<p class="contents">When the day comes when all the Member States apply the Declaration relating to Article III-116 of the Constitution and adopt the necessary measures to punish criminal acts, because we are talking about criminal violence against women, we will have taken a great step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like there to be complete gender parity in this Parliament. But I would like this to come about, not because a rule imposes it, but because the equal distribution of capacities between men and women is reflected in our social and political practices. Neither should we believe that the best yardstick for measuring equality between men and women is the percentage of women members of the parliaments of the different countries. Inequality manifests itself in the cruellest and hardest way in the lowest strata of society, where a combination of dreadful working conditions and family burdens makes life hardest for women.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like once again to invite you to take part in the events that are going to be held today in the European Parliament, which is participating in today’s celebration with the greatest of enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gröner (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, today being International Women’s Day, it is an important opportunity to draw attention to the fact that women around the world are insufficiently involved in decision-making. I am glad that the Commission, too, will now be joining in our debate, as the questions raised will focus on how the evaluation of the platform for action at Beijing ten years ago has developed as our most important foundation for measures in connection with women’s rights around the world. As I speak, the UN is in session in New York, assessing the outcomes of the Platform for Action, and in this the European Union has a very important part to play. As a rapporteur in Beijing, I did of course follow closely what the European Union was doing and the action it was taking; I did so again five years later at ‘Beijing + 5’ in New York, and now, with a delegation from the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I am doing the same with ‘Beijing + 10’.</p>
<p class="contents">We see it as an important step, and one on which I congratulate the Luxembourg Presidency, to use good and adroit negotiation as a means of defending women’s rights there. The United States of America has pushed hard for the platform for action to be renegotiated in order to spark renewed controversy and gain renewed influence, particularly in matters affecting twelve critical areas – prime among them being reproductive and sexual rights, which, in practical terms, means abortion. The negotiating skills of the Luxembourg Presidency, among others, made it possible to prevent this, but I find it regrettable that the Commission did not put on much of a show in New York, being represented only by one Commissioner, or, perhaps on one occasion, by Mr Barroso.</p>
<p class="contents">The questions that we are putting today to the Commission and the Council in those twelve different areas must serve to evaluate progress and, of course, also to highlight the deficiencies in these areas that have yet to be made good. Here in the EU, we have had one report from each Member State; the Luxembourg Presidency has held a conference to collate them and to undertake an assessment. Progress has certainly been made. Where political participation is concerned, we have been successful in raising consciousness. In some countries, there have been breakthroughs; in your country, Mr President, that being Spain, the government is establishing parity between men and women. In the last elections to the European Parliament, we did not experience the invasion we had dreaded and expected after the ten new Member States sent observers of whom only 14% were women. Here, then, things really have been moving. European countries have performed very well in the Inter-Parliamentary Union’s assessment of participation in governments, even though women’s participation stands at only 10% in France and Italy. For that reason, women, and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, are still calling for quotas, which are necessary if women are to have a share in political decision-making processes.</p>
<p class="contents">To that our European anti-discrimination policy has given a great deal of impetus, even though its implementation in the Member States still leaves much to be desired.</p>
<p class="contents">Our various actions against violence, such as the Daphne and STOP programmes, have highlighted the need for violence to be curtailed. We have afforded ample consideration to trafficking in women, thereby making it clear that we cannot accept a situation in which up to 500 000 women are smuggled into the European Union in order to be sexually exploited. We find it completely unacceptable that practically one woman in five in Europe should be at least once in her life, the victim of some form of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">What we want is a Gender Institute to underpin our work and supply us with statistical data to help combat various forms of discrimination in even more practical and tangible ways. Alongside the integration of women in the labour market, the encouragement of women in time-tested ways, and gender mainstreaming as a framework policy, we want an equal opportunities programme. Something that we certainly want, and on which neither the Commission nor the Council have budged, is a European Year for Combating Violence, which ought to be announced in 2006. Nothing has happened so far; we do not even have practical proposals as to what form the Gender Institute should now take, and so this is where the Commission and the Council still have a great deal of work to do on implementation. Goodwill is not enough on its own; what we need is action. Symbolism is fine on one day – International Women’s Day; we now have 365 of them, full of work to be done.</p>

<p class="contents">As you know, this issue is currently under consideration at the 49th Session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women. The Presidency has already delivered a message, a robust one I hope, giving an indication of the Union’s commitment to seeing the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action implemented properly and in full. However, since the session is still in progress, I am not yet able to report on its results.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the European Union considers equality between women and men to be a fundamental principle and the rights of women and girls to be an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights. The ‘Beijing + 10’ review comes at an important time, because it will not only enable the Union to strengthen its programme and its commitment to achieving the objectives of the Beijing Platform for Action, but will also provide an opportunity to identify the areas where progress has been made and those where concerted action needs to be further stepped up.</p>
<p class="contents">The report published recently as part of ‘Beijing + 10’ on the progress made within the European Union, which was drafted by the Luxembourg Presidency, sets out clearly the major results achieved by the European Union institutions, as well as the progress made in terms of institutional mechanisms in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, in its report, the Presidency also lists the challenges that remain to be addressed, and Mrs Gröner has just cited several relating to the 12 critical areas of concern identified at the Fourth World Conference on Women, which was held in Beijing in 1995. As Members have said, it is important to endeavour to ascertain why obstacles still stand in the way of achieving equality between women and men and to find out how they can be overcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me also to refer you to the Commission’s Annual Report on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men in the European Union, which was adopted on 14 February.</p>
<p class="contents">Before addressing more directly the issues raised by Members, I should like briefly to set out some of the positive initiatives taken at European Union level to promote gender equality. Our work to promote gender equality has been marked by three significant milestones in the last ten years: firstly, the adoption of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which created new competences relating to the principle of gender equality; secondly, the setting up of a European Employment Strategy, which has made equal opportunities an essential priority; and finally, the mainstreaming of gender-equality issues into different policy areas, in particular the process of social inclusion and the Structural Funds, by means of mechanisms such as annual work programmes or national action plans including targeted actions to promote gender equality.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s legislative framework on equal treatment has expanded unremittingly over the years. The latest development was the adoption, in December of last year, of a Council directive extending the principle of equal treatment beyond the field of employment and professional training for the first time and applying it to public goods and services.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, despite the progress made on establishing equality between women and men, there is a discrepancy between equality in law and equality in real life, and there are significant disparities between women and men in many sectors, as the Presidency’s report also shows.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us now take a look at the critical areas of concern identified in the Beijing Platform for Action to which you referred in your question. I should like to start with employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The good news is that women’s employment rates have increased at a greater rate than men’s over the last ten years, but the bad news is that the difference between the two is still very high, at 17.2 %, and that the wage gap between men and women remains practically the same. This is worrying not only for women but also for the European economy as a whole. If the European Union wishes to achieve the ambitious objectives of the Lisbon strategy, it will have to meet the objective of an employment rate of 60% by 2010. In accordance with the European Employment Strategy, the Member States have put mechanisms in place for meeting this objective as part of their national action plans.</p>
<p class="contents">The Barcelona European Council set a target for the provision of childcare services, the purpose of which was to make it easier for women to enter or return to the paid labour market. It is also part of the strategy to reconcile work and family life. Considerable progress has already been made in this respect in many Member States, even though the traditional division of childcare and paid work between women and men persists, and this in spite of the efforts made by certain Member States to implement policies seeking to encourage fathers to take parental leave.</p>
<p class="contents">This year’s draft Joint Employment Report, which will be sent to the Spring European Council, also clearly shows that more concerted action is needed to increase women’s participation in the labour market, and in particular to address the pay gaps between women and men.</p>
<p class="contents">With a view to responding to these concerns, the ministers responsible for gender equality policy in the 25 Member States undertook, in a declaration adopted on 4 February 2005, to develop strategies to increase the number of women in employment and in quality jobs, to guarantee and protect the rights of women workers and to remove structural, legal and psychological barriers to gender equality at work. The aim is also to promote policies enabling women and men to strike a balance between their professional and private lives, including their family responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The joint indicators identified by the European Union for the area, ‘Women and the economy’, that is the sixth critical area of concern in the Beijing Platform for Action, will make it possible to monitor progress. The structural indicators developed as part of the European Employment Strategy will also be extremely useful in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">Violence against women: despite the considerable progress made in this area since the initial Daphne programme was launched in 1997, unfortunately further measures urgently need to be taken to prevent violence towards women and children and to combat this phenomenon. We hope that the present Daphne programme, which will be in force until the end of 2008, will remain an essential programming instrument to combat violence. The projects carried out under this programme over the years have made it possible to create many effective networks and to develop good methodologies.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of presidencies have tackled this problem, the most recent initiative being the adoption of indicators drafted by the Dutch Presidency on sexual harassment in the workplace. In the aforementioned declaration, the ministers of the European Union responsible for gender equality policy agreed to develop preventative methods to combat gender-based violence and trafficking in human beings and to monitor their implementation. They also decided to intensify actions to prevent and combat all forms of trafficking in women and girls through a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary and coordinated anti-trafficking strategy. This strategy will include measures to address all of the factors that encourage trafficking, by strengthening existing legislation with a view to providing better protection of the rights of women and girls and to prosecuting and punishing the perpetrators through both criminal and civil measures.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards your request to make 2006 the European Year against Violence towards Women, I cannot deny that such an initiative could help to raise public awareness of this issue, but, according to my information, the Commission intends to declare 2006 the ‘European Year of Mobility for Workers’. It has also announced that, as part of its drive to promote diversity and non-discrimination, 2007 will be the ‘European Year of Equal Opportunities’ and it would seem that 2010 is to be declared the ‘European Year of the Fight against Exclusion and Poverty’.</p>
<p class="contents">You will perhaps be interested to know that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has recommended to the Committee of Ministers that 2006 be declared the ‘European Year against Domestic Violence’ as part of a pan-European campaign run in cooperation with the European Commission and the European Parliament, as well as with national associations and NGOs.</p>
<p class="contents">Women and poverty: in the ministerial declaration of 4 February, the Member States also agreed to strengthen efforts to combat social exclusion and to remove obstacles to women’s participation in the labour market, on the basis that a good job is one of the best ways of escaping poverty. Although there are not yet any gender-specific indicators at European Union level for the feminisation of poverty, certain structural indicators, broken down by gender and produced as part of the processes of inclusion and social cohesion, are presented each year to the Spring European Council. It is nevertheless true that a great deal remains to be done and that most of the Member States’ national action plans hardly mention questions of gender equality outside the world of work. The issue of gender-specific indicators could be addressed in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Women and the environment: as regards the measures currently being taken by the European Union to take account of gender in its development cooperation policy, I should like to remind you that last April the European Parliament and the Council adopted a regulation on promoting gender equality in the Community’s policies, strategies and interventions in development cooperation. A financial framework of EUR 9 million has been agreed for the period 2004 to 2006 for the purpose of implementing this regulation. This follows the 1998 regulation, which recognised that actions in support of development have rarely taken proper account of the differences between the situations, roles, opportunities and priorities of men and women, and that correcting the inequalities between men and women and strengthening the role of women are vital to achieving social justice and ensuring that our development work is effective.</p>
<p class="contents">May I also stress that the regulation was adopted in the context of the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations, the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women, as well as the Beijing Platform for Action and the outcome document of the special session of the General Assembly entitled, ‘Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century’.</p>
<p class="contents">During the 49th Session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, the Presidency stated, on behalf of the European Union, that it recognised that gender equality and women’s empowerment were essential for sustainable development and poverty eradication.</p>
<p class="contents">Girls: I have already addressed the issue of trafficking, but I should like to add that, in a recent declaration, the European Union ministers responsible for gender equality policy agreed to mainstream a gender perspective into national immigration and asylum policies, regulations and practices, as appropriate in order to promote and protect the rights of all women and girls, including by considering steps to recognise gender-related persecution and violence when assessing grounds for granting refugee status and asylum.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to stress that in April 2004 the Council adopted a directive seeking to have residence permits issued to third-country nationals who are victims of trafficking in human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">Women’s rights are human rights: before the Commission on the Status of Women, the Presidency reaffirmed, on behalf of the Member States, its view that full respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms is essential to empowering women and girls and to establishing a genuine democracy. This point of view should continue to prevail when the Council negotiates the forthcoming Commission proposal to establish an Agency on Fundamental Rights. I should also add that the European Union’s statement in New York also mentioned the need to eradicate harmful customary or traditional practices, including female genital mutilation, early and forced marriage and crimes committed in the name of honour, which are obstacles to the full enjoyment by women and girls of their human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Women and armed conflicts: the Council has taken note of the European Parliament’s resolution recommending that women should constitute at least 40% of the staff of reconciliation, peace-keeping and conflict-prevention operations. Discussions have indeed been held in the European Union on the importance of having women in peace-keeping forces, and on the need to provide all of those involved with training on the particular problems faced by civilian women in conflict zones. Nevertheless, in the absence of approved indicators and relevant statistical data on women and armed conflicts, I am unfortunately not able to say whether the 40% quota has been respected or not.</p>
<p class="contents">In their declaration of 4 February, the European Union ministers agreed to implement and encourage initiatives, policies and programmes following the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 concerning women, peace and security, which does not set quotas as such, but does recommend greater female participation. They also decided to act in accordance with the Council of Europe Declaration, Programme of Action and Resolution on democratisation, conflict prevention and peace-building.</p>
<p class="contents">During the first week of the work of the Commission on the Status of Women, the European Union outlined its commitment to promoting the role of women in conflict prevention and resolution, peace-building and democratic processes after conflicts, as well as after natural disasters and during reconstruction. The European Union also stressed that it is important to ensure that the needs of women in post-disaster relief and reconstruction situations are properly understood and are addressed in programmes, and that it is also important to ensure that women have equal access to information on disaster reduction by means of formal and non-formal education, including through gender-sensitive early-warning systems.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to conclude by thanking you for allowing me, on this International Women’s Day, to give voice to the European Union’s determination to achieve gender equality and its commitment to meeting the objectives set out in the Beijing Platform for Action and the follow-up documents from the 55th Session of the General Assembly in 2000, which have lost none of their relevance today. I am convinced that the European Parliament and the Commission will continue to work towards these same objectives and that by also involving civil society and the NGOs as far as possible, we will be able to take other measures to promote equality.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I could not finish without telling you how pleased I am to see that today the Commission is going to table its proposal on the European Institute for Gender Equality, as it was invited to do by the European Council in June 2004. Such an institute will provide the means and the robust structure necessary to find a response at European level to issues such as the pay gap between men and women, increased access for women to the labour market, their participation in decision-making and the balance between work and family life.</p>

I am pleased to have this opportunity of discussing with you, on a day we commemorate as International Women’s Day, the implementation of the Beijing Platform and the results that have been achieved. The celebration of this tenth anniversary is also a significant opportunity for the European Union to continue the remaining tasks. First, I would like to thank Mrs Gröner and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities for this extensive and complex question. Thanks to the support of your committee, we have made, and continue to make, considerable progress in reconfirming the obligations of the Beijing Platform. I am pleased that the United Nations has reached an agreement on a political declaration in this context; it is no coincidence that the European Union has made a significant contribution to this decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Luxembourg Presidency, because this issue has not been easy; it has taken a lot of effort and has required the force of a united Europe. The European Commission played an active role in the coordination of positions for the preparation and continuation of the Beijing Platform for Action within the United Nations. The conference held by the Luxembourg Presidency on 2 and 3 February on the theme of ‘Beijing + 10’ presented a report on the implementation of twelve areas of the Beijing Platform for Action in the European Union, and also highlighted the shortcomings and tasks which need to be resolved. The report is based on indicators on which the Member States agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">Your first question concerns two central problems. One is the participation of women in the labour market, and I would like to stress that efforts to eliminate the inequality between men and women are and will remain a fundamental prerequisite in achieving the Lisbon objectives. It is true that the disparities in the salaries and wages of women and men are very great and remain too great. The Commission will strive to ensure that European legal regulations in the field of the equality of remuneration are applied. Within the framework of the European Employment Strategy, it will make recommendations to Member States where the differences are relatively large. It is also necessary to underline the fact that the role of the social partners in this field is important and, in some respects, crucial. One of the European Union’s tasks that still needs to be resolved is the difficult reconciliation of family and working life. Therefore, in its new social agenda, the Commission proposed a communication on future developments in policies concerning the equality of women and men. Reconciliation remains the central issue here.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention the fact that, in this respect, the review of the Working Time Directive will be highly significant. In the programme for the equality of women and men, projects and conferences have been funded within the framework of the Presidency, and we are now analysing the results. It is important to continue presenting initiatives intended to increase awareness in this field. We must also have the necessary data at our fingertips. Therefore the Commission has set up a database on women and men involved in the socio-economic and political decision-making process, which is available on the website of the Directorate-General for Employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Ten years after Beijing, women remain, unfortunately, the victims of the dramatic phenomenon of trafficking in women. The Commission is currently preparing a communication on trafficking in human beings, in order to present possibilities for an improvement in EU policy against this crime. The Commission plans to publish this communication by the end of the first half of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">I am well acquainted with your proposal of a European Year Against Violence Against Women. The Commission considers the fight against violence against women to be a matter of paramount importance, and has studied the request from the European Parliament that 2006 be declared the European Year against this form of violence. However, the Commission notes that 2004 was the subject of a global campaign by Amnesty International on the same theme, and therefore, while there is no doubt about the significance of the initiative brought up by Parliament, the Commission is reserved as regards the opportunity of proposing this event at a European level as early as 2006 when it took place on a global level in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important for gender issues to be incorporated into policies related to health. This is happening at European level via the public health programme, out of which projects for the development of strategies and for the appointment of best practice have been financed (for example, in the field of birth control among adolescent girls, family planning, and the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases). Special attention is paid to HIV prevention in relation to mothers and children. Efforts in the field of education should continue to prevent a situation where segregation begins at school and is carried through into the world of work. On several occasions, the European Council and the Commission have highlighted the lesser participation of girls in subjects connected with the natural sciences and in technical subjects. Therefore it is important for the Council for Education to set itself the target of increasing the number of graduates of mathematical, scientific, and technical subjects by 15% by 2010 and of reducing the imbalance between men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">The mainstay of the European Union’s policy for audiovisual media is Directive 97/36/EC, Television without Frontiers. Within the framework of the review of this Directive in 2005, the Commission will present a proposal that takes account of the rules related to human dignity, especially rules against discrimination. Another important instrument in the field of the media is the recent proposal of a recommendation concerning the protection of minors and human dignity and the right to reply, with regard to competitiveness in the audiovisual sphere and the European industry of information services. It is important for media operators to assume greater responsibility for excluding discrimination from the content of the work they produce. In our conditions of developmental assistance, we propose a strategy for the equality of women and men as a goal in itself, and we acknowledge the leading role of equality in developmental policies as we seek to reduce poverty and improve government, and in human rights. Modern society, which is based on creativity, on the ability to tap the human potential of all its members, is not capable of holding its ground if it does not make full use of the potential offered by women. I think that this is one of the fundamental reasons for poverty in some parts of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">In the summary report on progress made by the Union and its Member States in achieving the millennium development targets, the cooperation between the platform and the millennium targets is taken into consideration. I would like to stress that women’s rights are fundamental human rights; the issue of the equality of men and women in the European Union goes beyond the framework of respecting a fundamental right. It is a special Community policy, a priority, a well-established policy established in treaties and agreements which can draw on a solid base of legal regulations. As you know, the Commission is preparing a proposal for an expansion in the responsibilities of the monitoring centre in Vienna to include the protection of fundamental rights, and although it is too early to express an opinion on the activities of the future agency, this agency will clearly handle the protection of the fundamental rights of both men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, in the previous speech it was mentioned that today the Commission will discuss the proposal to set up an institute for equal opportunities between men and women, a gender institute, and I am pleased that we have made progress in this issue. I think it will be a step that will reinforce the policies of equal opportunities, that will result in something I hold in high importance – a solid base, and I believe it will give us more room to take action armed with knowledge and free of prejudices. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you. </p>

Beijing + 10 is a new departure today and I am especially grateful to those of you who helped to table this oral question.</p>
<p class="contents">Today my thoughts are with all those women who have devoted their lives to defending the dignity of women by winning fundamental social, economic and political rights. Their commitment was sometimes seen as an act of transgression, a sign of a lack of femininity or even a display of exhibitionism. True equality of human rights, equal pay for equal work, protection for working mothers, fair career advancement and the equality of spouses in family life are matters of urgency. The social presence of women calls into question a society based on efficiency and productivity alone.</p>
<p class="contents">Abuses against women must be strongly condemned as a matter of urgency, women and girls defended against all forms of violence that turn them into objects or commodities. In such conditions, before being the responsibility of women, the choice of abortion is the responsibility of the man, with the complicity of the environment in which they live. Being a woman and being a mother should not entail any discrimination or penalisation because the survival of humanity depends on it.</p>
<p class="contents">A woman who is able to express her creative genius becomes truly revolutionary because she knows how to resolve conflicts, to make and restore peace. Peace is not only the absence of war; it is a state of justice, a matter of urgency that affects us all, men and women, today. Let us women therefore wish ourselves a happy anniversary! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The United Nations Secretary-General gave warning that 201 million women are still without access to contraception and pointed out that one third of deaths during pregnancy and childbirth are caused by a lack of reproductive and sexual health services. Furthermore, new types of discrimination have come to light. When a woman has to choose between breast-feeding her child and keeping her job in management; when a woman has to choose between looking after her sick children and the risk of being sacked; when a woman finds that the people at work are more understanding if she asks to leave early in order to take the car in for a service than in order to pick up her child at the kindergarten; all of this tells you everything about the mentality of those who hold economic power and about the undervaluation of jobs traditionally allocated to women.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the good intentions expressed here, by both the Council and the Commission, but I should like to see those words translated into action and should like to hear what practical measures the Commission and the Council are going to take to remedy this state of affairs, and I am not talking here about the situation of women in poor countries, of Muslim women, of women in a poor country in Africa or Asia at the mercy of a corrupt despot or of fanatical terrorists, where people do not live but die slowly, as we have seen – and already mentioned in this debate – with the situation of women in Turkey, with whom I should like to express my solidarity. These are the issues at stake.</p>

It has reaffirmed the Beijing Platform for Action and women’s reproductive rights. That is something I warmly welcome. Nevertheless, it is not the only important issue today.</p>
<p class="contents">A large number of women suffer violence at the hands of the men with whom they have or have had a relationship. It is said that considerable progress has been made, but in fact there has been no progress, because we have not yet realised the full extent of the problem. In terms of figures, we are talking about at least one-fifth of all women in the EU, with some studies currently putting the true figure as high as one-third. This is an epidemic in our society.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur on this matter, I am finalising a report in which I urge all Member States to carry out accurate studies on prevalence. We need correct figures on a Europe-wide scale. I will also propose a ‘name and fame’ list of the countries, regions and cities dealing with this issue in the right way. It is clear, for example, that Spain is one country doing much to change this sad state of affairs, and I take this opportunity to say <span class="italic">¡Viva España!</span></p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to highlight the most extreme form of violence against women. On our continent, women and girls are being sold like cattle. We all know about this. It is the most devastating of human rights crises, currently affecting hundreds of thousands of women in Europe alone, and it is happening right now as we commemorate International Women’s Day. It is modern slavery. Where there is demand, there will be supply. Consequently, from now on I will end all my speeches in this House with a phrase borrowed from a famous Roman politician: <span class="italic">Ceterum censeo prostitutionem esse delendam </span>–<span class="italic"> </span>‘I therefore maintain that prostitution must be abolished’.</p>

I hope that will continue to be the case, and that the equal opportunities policy for women will not come to a standstill. Today, Commissioner Špidla, I have been very disappointed by what you have said; you had a lot to say about what had happened in the past, but I heard little about what you want to do in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We have waited a long time for this Gender Institute, yet you had not one word to say about the topic of gender budgeting. I heard nothing from you about how we are meant to do away with the wage gap, which really is a cause for concern to us, not to mention the day for the elimination of violence against women. The President-in-Office of the Council said it would be next year; you said that Amnesty International had already held one. If so, so what? We heard nothing about it. I hope that a policy of equal opportunities will not be something just for today, but for 365 days in the year. I would have liked to hear more about the prospects for one; what is the Commission thinking of doing now? What I heard was actually no more than empty phrases.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Carlshamre said a minute or two ago, the EU, too, is the scene of genital mutilations, honour killings and forced marriages. I call on its Member States and on the Commission to do real work to coordinate action against these things, for what I believe we have to do today is to send out a message. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Each year, we have pinned great hope on all the words being translated into practical action. Certainly, progress has been made, but the basic patriarchal power system still exists.</p>
<p class="contents">It would certainly have made it easier to follow up the Fourth World Conference on Women if the President of the Commission had appointed a Commissioner for Gender Equality. The significance and scope of equality issues in all political areas required a Commissioner for Equality concentrating exclusively on equality issues. In spite of the fact that, unfortunately, there is at present no Commissioner responsible for equality issues, I would call upon the Commission in future to prioritise the work in pursuit of gender equality to the same degree as the work involving the internal market, goods, services, industry etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Part of the evidence of women’s subordination is male violence against women. The World Bank has estimated that violence against women is as frequent a cause of death as cancer. It is the cause of more ill health than malaria and road accidents combined. Most of us condemn such violence, but we must also get to grips with those values that facilitate the violence. We must tackle the culture that says that women must be accessible to men and that men are entitled to control women’s lives and bodies; the culture that identifies women’s bodies as goods that can be bought and sold. These assumptions underlie the everyday experience of many women and girls in Europe today. The names for that experience are trafficking<span class="italic"> </span>and prostitution, but it can also be called sexual slavery. That it is able to continue to exist is due to an unholy alliance between financial profit and a sexist and racist world view. On behalf of women in the Member States, I also regret the neo-liberal economic policy, with its deregulation and privatisation, which makes women’s situation still more difficult where both job opportunities and access to childcare and care of the elderly are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">It is high time that the Platform for Action from Beijing were converted into practical policy. On the day that we have achieved these objectives, we shall hopefully be living in a society that does not need special women’s days. Then, every day will belong to women, men and children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a woman and a doctor, however, I should like to protest most strongly in this House against the tendency to treat women as objects, to subject women to aggressive masculinisation and to use the phrase ‘reproductive health’ to refer to motherhood. This is clearly a phrase that should be used in relation to animals, not people.</p>
<p class="contents">A woman’s dignity and mystery are revealed through her role as a mother, which need not be understood in a strictly physical sense. Emotionally healthy women who have not been corrupted are full of warmth. They are by nature emotionally sensitive, they care about other people and they are prepared to make sacrifices. Their vocation includes the home, the family, marriage, children and work, but it does not include a power struggle with men. I would especially call on feminist organisations to respect women’s dignity and femininity, which is an expression of their spiritual wealth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Physical violence in the family is the consequence of the inadequate work of institutions that fail to enforce the legal rights of women. Let us see, then, how we enforce political rights and social rights. Many governments, even the governments of the Member States of the European Union, and, unfortunately, I must say, even my government, have no women on them at all.

The UN’s 4th World Conference on Women in 1995 in Beijing first highlighted the issue of discrimination by race and sex. Contrary to the challenge issued in Beijing, discrimination has not been examined more deeply or in more detail either at an international or a domestic level. Because of this very little is also said about ethnic discrimination not affecting women and men equally. The Roma woman suffers greater prejudice when she is discriminated against not just on ethnic grounds but on sex grounds also. The Roma woman faces numerous social barriers within the European context. At the same time, within narrower communities the barriers of sexual discrimination hold her back. The Roma woman, as a member of the Roma community, is in most cases pushed to the margins of society where she must face material insecurity, social exclusion, negative discrimination, the anti-Gypsy atmosphere around her and her family, and in some cases even physical danger on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Discrimination on an ethnic basis in health is banned by several European laws. Yet despite this, Roma women endure numerous incidents which contradict these principles. Separate Gypsy rooms, forced sterilisation, verbal abuse and lower standards of service are all current problems. Roma women live on the crossroads of sexual and ethnic prejudice, but it is not possible to reduce their problems to merely cultural or ethnic dimensions. They struggle with the same problems as non-Roma women who are often equally excluded and impoverished, and have worse employment opportunities than men, lower rates of pay, and consistently experience shortcomings in child-care services such as nursery care, kindergarten or schooling.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, one of the most important elements in our struggle for equality of opportunities for women is that we recognise, accept, increase awareness and cure the multiple discriminations burdening women who live in minorities, including Roma women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Beijing, it was said that women’s rights are human rights. There can certainly be no turning back from that position, despite the fact that the world’s more conservative countries have been attempting to do so for some years now. This was the case, in particular, with the United States last week during the proceedings of the UN Commission on women’s rights. The attempt was foiled, largely thanks to the European delegation, and in particular to the intelligent and vital work of the Luxembourg Minister, Mrs Jacob, who led our delegation and to whom I should like to express heartfelt thanks.</p>
<p class="contents">There can certainly be no turning back from Beijing, but a mere statement of intent is not enough; we need to speed up the process of implementing the platform. One of the topics covered is that of political power, still predominantly in male hands. Women still represent only 15 percent of the world’s parliamentarians, and only 15 countries out of approximately 200 have achieved a level defined as the ‘critical mass of 30%’. When the presence of women in the institutions reaches critical mass, there is more likelihood that women’s points of view and experiences will be taken into consideration, that priority will be given to the issues important to women and that action will become possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the 15 countries to which I referred earlier, eight are in Europe – in other words, less than one third of the 25 States making up the European Union. We need determination, commitment and action if these eight countries are to increase to 25 – and this is what we are requesting from the Commission and Council. Above all, we need people to be convinced that an increase in the parliamentary representation of women is beneficial to both men and women. Spain, with its government consisting of equal numbers of women and men, is the example to be followed. Spain, with its socialist Prime Minister Zapatero, has proved that democracy with equality can be achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The chain of events that lead to poverty is always the same: unemployment, sickness, humiliation and then social exclusion. It is a vicious circle where women are more vulnerable than men. Indeed, they are constantly in a situation of inequality relative to men, in all areas of society.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of women living below the poverty line has risen by 50% since the 1970s, while that of men has grown by 30%. What is behind what sociologists call the feminisation of poverty? No one can deny that poverty is fertile ground for prostitution. Moreover, the AIDS virus spreads more quickly in environments where women are kept in a state of sexual slavery.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe cannot be indifferent to all that. It must continue to play a shrewd and uncompromising role in ensuring that all the underlying causes of poverty are dealt with and that the most degrading of its consequences, the trafficking of women for profit in a parallel market which reduces them to nothing more than a commodity, is eliminated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Improving the status of women is one of the most effective ways of developing society as a whole and making it more stable. Moreover, the position of women in the developing countries is connected with our security. The Central Intelligence Agency in the United States made a study of countries torn apart by genocide and violence, and discovered that a high child mortality rate is the clearest indicator that a society is caught up in a spiral of internal violence. A high child mortality rate is of course the connection with the status of women.</p>
<p class="contents">It has also been found that terrorist groups, which we now fear so much, recruit members from areas where there are a lot of unemployed young men with no good prospects for the future. These young, unemployed groups form in countries with high birth rates. The birth rate, on the other hand, goes down when the social position of women improves, when they receive an education and information on birth control, and when they have their own means of earning a livelihood. With regard to development cooperation policy it therefore has to be understood that improving the status of women is one of the most effective ways of promoting development in general; not only that, but it can help to promote stability and prevent new hotbeds of conflict from springing up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Against this backdrop, the fact that we celebrate International Women’s Day, 8 March, a day on which we fight for women’s human rights, an integral, inalienable and indivisible part of universal human rights, continues to irk many politicians and governments. Such was the case in Turkey, when police acted with violence against a women’s demonstration – all the more appalling given that this is a country seeking membership of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unacceptable that unemployment continues to rise in Member States as a result of increasingly neoliberal policies, that insecure work is spreading in the name of flexible work and competitiveness, that there continues to be salary discrimination, that the trafficking of human beings and prostitution persist and that violence is a day-to-day reality for millions of women in the EU and appropriate measures are not being taken to remedy this state of affairs. It is also unacceptable that health and sexual and reproductive rights, guaranteed by the Beijing Platform for Action, continue to be undermined in countries such as Portugal, where women accused of backstreet abortions have been subjected to humiliation in court cases and threatened with up to three years’ imprisonment, due to the continued existence of an unjust and iniquitous law that is tantamount to an attack on the dignity of women.

From a historical perspective it is not long either since universities first opened to women. On the other hand, if anyone looks impartially at the proposed introduction to the text of the resolution, they can verify that while mountains of paper have been consumed, and earnest bodies have filled weeks and months formulating dozens of documents, in practice little progress has been made.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s proposed text could be a cry of despair, for times have speeded up tremendously and unfortunately there is a cynical attitude around that we do not need to change the world because it is good for at least half of society the way it is. The principle of equal work for equal pay, which in 1975 became a part of European law, is a good example of how a statute can be in force for 30 years, but life still goes its own way, and today again we can establish that the differences between women’s and men’s pay have not diminished. Indeed, in several countries this difference rather shows a tendency to increase, what the legal experts call a difference between the <span class="italic">de jure </span>and<span class="italic"> de facto </span>states of affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is also a much more disturbing form of tolerating this situation, violence committed against women. It is true that in Europe <span class="italic">honour killings</span> rarely happen, but they do happen. In the countries of Central-Eastern Europe a woman dies every week as a victim of violence within the family. We cannot always be effective against such practices and customs, which have no place among human dignity or laws. Recent events in Istanbul show that institutionalised violence against women is part of life today, right on the doorstep of the European Union. From the resolution what emerges is that we should solve what can be solved and talk about what cannot yet be solved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU delegation — both governments and civil society — gave strong messages of commitment to further progress. Thanks to the great cooperation with Mrs Jacobs, the Minister, there has been some progress over this period. However, poverty still has a female face and violence against women is pervasive: one in four women in the world is subject to violence, a significant number of them in their own homes.</p>
<p class="contents">I also take this opportunity to condemn yesterday's horrific events in Turkey. I condemn the violence used by the police against women involved in peaceful demonstration.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also disappointed with the negotiations last week in New York. As a result of intense international pressure, the US Administration reluctantly accepted the internationally backed declaration because it contained the word 'abortion'. We in Europe have an honest and meaningful debate about those issues. European socialist women are ready to fight with all their energy against this conservative backlash in the US. This is the right time for action. Let us use the New York meeting to inject new energy and commitment at EU and national level: legislation, evaluation and accountability.</p>
<p class="contents">In its declaration, the Luxembourg Government advocated the reinforcement of its institutional mechanisms and the integration of gender into all its actions and policies. Today, European socialist women have launched a pledge card with five priorities, the most important of which is more and better jobs for women. We cannot hope to achieve our economic and social objectives set in Lisbon without more women in work. This is not about women fighting for women, but about a common battle, fighting for a better EU for women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the European Union has barely made any progress in matters of equal pay. I cannot think of any single case in recent years in which there has been any genuine success in promoting gender equality in matters of equal pay.</p>
<p class="contents">The representative of the Council spoke just now and said that the ministers responsible for equality in the EU countries are committed to the development of strategies to promote women’s employment and skills. It is as if we women had no skills. Perhaps we do not have the skill to catch up in the equal pay stakes, and that is where our skills should be developed.</p>
<p class="contents">President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, now is the time to take action to prevent us from losing our credibility completely and to enable us to fulfil the promises that have been given to women, children and men. In ten years the EU could set itself the objective of achieving equal pay for women and men once and for all.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that equality is not something to reflect on just one day a year. International Women’s Day should not be a day on which women are humiliated by being eulogised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Women continue to be disadvantaged and discriminated against in every area of life. We are still far from achieving equality of opportunity in such areas as education and careers. Women are often denied higher education. The lack of childcare opportunities often makes it impossible for women to reconcile work and family life. Even though the work they involve is demanding, typical women’s jobs are badly paid. Women are continually on the receiving end of violence and victims of sexual assaults, often committed by those close to them.</p>
<p class="contents">There has recently been a renewed rise in the number of reports of honour killings and stonings. A State of the World Population Report study published by the UN indicates that around 5 000 girls and women, in at least fourteen countries – Pakistan and Turkey among them – are murdered in the name of honour, although the number of such killings that go unreported is much higher. In areas hit by crisis and war, in refugee camps and everywhere where public order has broken down, conditions are often catastrophic. Around the world, 150 million women and girls suffer genital mutilation; it is estimated that at least 24 000 of them live in Germany alone. In South Africa, a woman is shot dead by her partner or ex-partner every six hours. I protest against the violence meted out by the police to the women who demonstrated in Istanbul at the weekend. We all have to do much more for women’s rights. I call on the governments to implement women’s rights and make them a reality once and for all. There is an urgent need for women’s quality of life to be improved. Women must be accorded the same rights as men. There must be no violence against them!</p>

The European Parliament is rich in debates and resolutions referring to the participation of women in economic and public life and to particular problems and discrimination which they face in their lives. However, it is particularly important that we are debating them again today, 8 March, on International Women's Day because, in this way, we all – men and women – have a greater realisation that these problems are centuries old and cut across the ages and remain unresolved and topical. They also have a global character, in that they relate to every society in every country.</p>
<p class="contents">This year, 8 March also coincides with the tenth anniversary of the Beijing conference and the adoption of the platform on a strategy to combat these problems. It is a good opportunity, therefore, to review and evaluate the work which has been done and its results.</p>
<p class="contents">As European men and women, we have a heightened awareness of this global endeavour, because our historical experience convinces us that combating women's problems and achieving real equality are necessary prerequisites to growth, the quality of democracy and peace.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would like to emphasise today is that we need to remain faithful to the global nature of this platform, by which I mean to the monitoring of the twelve crucial sectors which interact: efforts on employment, education, health, combating violence and participation in political life are directly connected. At the same time, however, we also need to monitor developments taking place around us and to adjust our policies to the new reality circumstances – social, demographic and technological – because only thus shall we be able to express women's real aspirations and make our policies effective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But it is also the case, unfortunately, that the reality in many fields is still a long way from matching what is laid down in our laws and what we have stated in our declarations.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, ladies and gentlemen, as we have seen in recent days in New York, if we had not been careful, the progress we have worked so hard to make could have been reversed through the negative influence of ultra-conservative forces and religious fundamentalism, particularly with regard to human rights and the sexual and reproductive rights of women.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, the final declaration of Beijing + 10 reaffirms the Beijing Platform for Action in full. This achievement has undoubtedly also been a success for those people who have negotiated on behalf of the European Union, and I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the good work of the Luxembourg Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Simply ensuring that we do not move backwards is no great achievement, however. It is urgent that we make much faster progress in the direction we have set. We have the tools; all we need is political will and the European Union must lead this progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, Minister, our framework strategy on equality between men and women and the associated programme ends this year. I would like to insist that, without a new framework strategy, it will be much more difficult for us to move forward. We must also urge our Member States to adopt new measures in the fields that fall within their competence. In this regard, I would like to mention today in particular the 53 measures approved last Friday by my country’s – Spain’s - Socialist government, aimed at promoting equality between men and women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rise in the incidence of crimes against women, particularly the trafficking of them and forced prostitution, has risen so much in recent years. Let me say, while I am on this subject, how profoundly shocked I am by recent events in Turkey, with women being brutally beaten up for demonstrating peacefully to draw attention to their concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us turn from Turkey to Germany. A young Turkish woman in Berlin, who had left her husband, was executed by her brothers on the open street with a shot to the head. Her brothers seek to justify this brutal murder by reference to their family’s honour. This honour killing was the sixth in four months in Germany. Where is the outrage against these murders? Why is society not more up in arms about them?</p>
<p class="contents">Violence against women goes on everywhere, even in families. It is estimated that one woman in five is the victim of violence at least once in her life. Such a state of affairs is intolerable. Violence against women must at last find its way onto the political agenda, and not just on World Women’s Day. Women who have been mistreated must not be shamed out of going public and drawing attention to their situation. It is because they are victims, and have not committed any crime, that I am in favour of 2006 being declared the Year against Violence against Women, which is what the joint resolution on World Women’s Day calls for.</p>

Pay differentials vary from 6 to 30% for the same work.

<p class="contents">Commissioner, it would seem to be a matter of urgent necessity to set in motion aggressive policies to provide information on rights and to enforce existing laws in the Member States as well as to implement an effective policy of controls and penalties, because it is not enough to set ambitious targets and then see nothing change over 10, 20 or 30 years.

Yes, gender equality is one of the major values the EU stands for and it would be very helpful, in selling the new Constitutional Treaty, if we stressed that it is reinforced in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Huge differences also exist between the theory, or the rhetoric, and practice on the ground in relation to women's equality, the <span class="italic">de jure</span> and <span class="italic">de facto</span> situations. We must ensure, however, that we bring men, particularly young men, into this debate. Their role models might have dominated women and not understood the concept of equality and so might not have been of the type we want our sons to become today. We are talking equality and not dominance here. They might have been brought up in religious fundamentalism and other cultures, where there was serious oppression of women and physical and sexual violence against women.</p>
<p class="contents">This is about choice. Since we have been able to control our fertility, women can now choose to have one child, no children or ten children. This is all about ensuring that women have the freedom to choose. That is what the debate must be about. But we must structure society so that, if women wish to become mothers, they can actually do that and bring up their children without economic pressures that drive them out of the house when the baby is six weeks old.</p>
<p class="contents">We must structure society and family life today in such a way that it allows women to have a second child. The pressures on young women today in my country, for all its economic success, are such that they cannot afford a second child. They cannot afford not to work; they need the two salaries to pay the mortgage. They cannot afford childcare or care for elderly parents.</p>
<p class="contents">The traditional roles of women in childcare and care for the elderly are all part of this wider debate and it is not possible to do justice to the subject in two minutes. Mothers cannot be fathers and fathers cannot be mothers. Ideally our children should have both. That will not always be possible, but let us have a broader and balanced debate and restore choice for women. Then they can be properly liberated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As rapporteur for women’s rights in Turkey, I can say that, on paper, the situation of women’s rights is comparable to that of the European Member States, although practice leaves a great deal to be desired. Violence perpetrated against women, and the relative lack of participation by them in the labour market, in education and in politics, are still major areas of concern in which change is possible only if women acquire the right to be able to speak out and to demonstrate. The sixth of March in Istanbul, when a demonstration to mark women’s day was broken up brutally, illustrated how important it is still to have 8 March as International Women’s Day. If Turkey wants to be a modern democracy and to join the EU, it should prove that it can handle protests as an adult democracy. The European Union has an important role to play in this too, in that it must show that it will give the situation of women’s rights a prominent place on the negotiating agenda, closely monitor progress, and take immediate action in the event of violations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My thoughts go particularly to Simone Veil, who was president of this Parliament and who gave France a law allowing the voluntary termination of pregnancy. Thank you, Madam, for your courage because you had a lot of mud thrown at you. Today there are people who march through the streets shouting about your law: ‘Thirty years is enough’. For all the women who have known the distress of an unwanted pregnancy I say: 30 years is too little, because abortion is becoming taboo again! Thank you, Madam.</p>
<p class="contents">All of us women together, whatever our political parties and convictions, will continue your battle to drive back fundamentalism. And I will say to Mr Libicki, who was worried about post-abortion depression, that he should look at post-natal depression. That is the advice of a woman and a psychologist! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, what comes first for the European Union is also to help third countries – developing countries – reach a level which will allow women to be treated with dignity. Development aid and development cooperation must be evaluated and based on issues such as:</p>
<p class="contents">First, safeguarding women's rights as the core of human rights in a country.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, promoting special economic and social incentives for integration into the job market, effective dissuasive actions so that women's lives are not downgraded, wiping out violence, as occurred in Turkey over the last few days, and the participation of women with quotas in political parties and central and local government.</p>

<p class="contents">As I have already exceeded my allotted time a little while ago, I will be very brief. So far as equal pay is concerned, we need more good examples that we can exchange. We also need indicators to measure both progress and lost ground.</p>
<p class="contents">Poverty and social inclusion must remain one of the pillars of the Lisbon strategy in the same way as equality between men and women. I am in complete agreement with the European Parliament’s very committed fight against violence against women and children and, of course, the fight against human trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we have an obligation to keep both men and boys better informed and educated if we want the differences between men and women to be respected. In my opinion, we will only really be able to respect human rights if we agree to consider and respect each other just as we are.</p>

The fundamental fact remains that the European Union considers equal opportunities between men and women, and equality between men and women, to be one of the key political values that it upholds. We have made considerable headway in this field, but we cannot afford to stop now. The legislative base is relatively solid. This does not mean it cannot be developed further, but the key problem can actually be found in insufficient implementation. This is a matter we must focus on. It is quite clear that at one end of the scale of disparity between the pay of men and women, there are countries where this gap is 6%, while at the other end of the scale there are countries where the difference is 27%. These are absolutely unwarranted disparities, and it is up to us to make the corresponding effort to combat this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is absolutely clear that special issues are violence against women and trafficking in human beings. The group of Commissioners for human rights considers this issue to be one of its most fundamental tasks, and I expect that we will be able to make progress in this respect. It is a palpable matter, a challenge for us, and there is no time to lose.</p>
<p class="contents">Several times in the discussion the brutal intervention by the police against demonstrators in Istanbul, Turkey, has been mentioned. The European Commission responded immediately; it rejected the use of undue coercion, and I noted with a certain satisfaction (although we must reserve judgment at this point in time) that the Turkish side decided to launch an investigation into this action. I believe that this is an important illustration of how influential the European Union is, and that it is an important example of a case where our efforts have helped the position of women in a context broader than the confines of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no doubting the fact that mainstreaming remains a key issue, and it must be applied thoroughly; it is also clearly correct to continue a policy of developing the concept of gender budgeting, which, while still in its infancy, has already made gratifying advances in certain countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the role of women in the success of the European project in general, and for the success of the Lisbon Strategy in particular, is indispensable. I have clearly spoken about the fact that a society which does not make full use of the potential of all its members is unable to hold its ground in the face of global competition, so let us go back to my opening words, that is, the issue of equality is a profound matter and we must strive for this equality even if we were not to derive any secondary, perhaps economic, benefit from it. The establishment of a new institution will ensure transparency and will also provide professional answers to a whole number of questions which have been asked but which have not yet been adequately resolved. It will also evaluate and assess the techniques and procedures we have chosen that have often resulted in a certain progress but which have not provided a complete climax.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation of women on the labour market has been debated. There is no doubt that the proportion of women actively involved in the labour market has increased during the monitoring of the Lisbon Strategy. On the other hand, it is also evident that the total proportion is insufficient for us to achieve the Lisbon objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, equality between men and women is a concept; it is a political concept, a concept of values. It is a concept which has been observed for decades; International Women’s Day did not start ten years ago, it did not start today. It is part of the conscious efforts by people to achieve a certain value that we consider to be profound and self-evident. These efforts must not end, we can never be satisfied with the progress we have made, because as the world changes the problems will change, and we will be faced with new challenges. One of them is the demographic ageing of society, another is the balance between family life and working life, yet another, mentioned by several others here, is a deeper understanding on the part of our men within the framework of ordinary social customs. We have a long way to go.</p>
<p class="contents">There has also been a debate on a European Day Against Violence Against Women. Again, I stress that violence against any human being is repulsive and it is the obligation of the European project and the European Union to seek out effective ways of preventing such violence. Violence against women is violence which truly exists on an enormous scale in our society, and we cannot remain indifferent; we must use all means available to us.</p>
<p class="contents">One issue in the debate was whether it was more effective to declare a European Year Against Violence in 2006, considering that 2004 was a global year against violence, or to declare it at a time which is still open to discussion and which would ensure it carried greater weight and greater conclusiveness. This is the question; the point is not violence as such, because, as I have said, this is one of the key agendas which has been adopted by the current Commission and which it believes to be important, and which, I hope, we can fulfil as we strive to make progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to return to 8 March once more. This day highlights the decades of efforts which, in the face of difficulty, have resulted in progress at least in some areas of the world, in fact I am sure that in all areas of the world, but by different means. It is a symbol of the efforts we are now making and which we will experience in the future, because it is a symbol of the effort to achieve an ideal, and an ideal is always very difficult to achieve. We can but do our best to come closer to the ideal, and this Commission has five years to take action, which must be quantifiable. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
