<p class="contents">Since the regulation entered into force on 17 February 2005, the Commission has been watching closely to ensure that it is being enforced by the Member States and has been monitoring the airlines to check that they are enforcing it. In order to ensure that the regulation is being enforced uniformly in all parts of Europe, the European Commission has started infringement procedures against several Member States that have not yet taken the necessary steps to set the penalties to be imposed on airlines if they do not comply with the legislation in force.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, on the basis of the complaints that it regularly receives, the Commission has noticed certain practical difficulties in effectively implementing the regulation and in monitoring its enforcement by the Member States. This is particularly the case as regards the obligation placed on the national bodies to take the necessary steps to safeguard passengers’ rights and to investigate the complaints lodged. In this context, the Commission is currently working with the national authorities in order to arrive at a harmonised interpretation of the role that these bodies have to fulfil in terms of monitoring, and dealing with, complaints. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In June, a constituent of mine, Mrs Underwood, was stranded overnight in Alicante with her family, which included a ten-month-old baby; there was nobody there from the airline to give any information. In fact, they rang the airport of destination themselves, which was also unable to give her any information. The family had already checked in; they could not get their luggage back; there was no provision for babies nor any baby food. They eventually left at 4 a.m., although they were supposed to have left at 7 p.m. on the previous day. She wrote to the airline but was given no compensation; the national body also said that the airline had acted properly.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a piece of legislation here. I am pleased you are going to review the role of these national bodies because, at the moment, I am not convinced that this legislation is practical and workable for citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The national bodies are there to intervene in the event of the airlines shirking their obligations. I have said to you, and I will repeat what I said: we did not adopt this regulation for it not to be enforced. Consequently, we are going to look carefully with the national authorities at the practical conditions in which these complaints are dealt with. As your example has clearly demonstrated, the national authorities have to fulfil the provisions laid down in the regulation precisely to avoid the need to resort to legal action to deal with airlines’ conduct. The spirit underlying the resolution was a desire to avoid having constantly to resort to the law. Thank you, Mrs McAvan, for having pointed out to us this one example, among others. It strengthens my determination to see this regulation enforced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some airlines seem to be doing everything they can to avoid their obligations. I, too, have had letters from constituents, one where the airline in a case of lost luggage said of course they would refund the items in the luggage, provided the customer could provide the original receipts. As if we all keep receipts for everything we buy! Another airline refused compensation for a flight cancelled because of the weather, even though a rival airline was able to fly ten minutes later on the same day, from the same airport and to the same destination. There are numerous examples. Please be vigorous in chasing them up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This needs to become a regular practice. Furthermore, I believe that, insofar as these complaints are handled well, the way in which they are handled will also have a deterrent effect. By that, I mean that airlines will increasingly be encouraged to comply with the regulation and to pay compensation, if need be, because they will know that, if they do not do this, there will be an appeal and, undoubtedly, a penalty.</p>

<p class="contents">Following the recent ruling by the Court of First Instance regarding the takeover bid launched by the Portuguese electricity company EDP and the Italian energy company ENI for the Portuguese gas company GDP, the Competition Commissioner stated that the liberalisation of energy markets carried out in recent years must not lead to the creation of fresh monopolies, and that 'it is not acceptable for customers in one Member State to pay the price for a company to become a bigger player in other Member States'.</p>
<p class="contents">In that case, does the Commission believe that there has been a sufficient increase in the number of operators in the Member States in the gas and electricity markets, or is there still a high degree of concentration? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, energy markets have seen some new entrants in many Member States, either in the form of start-ups or through companies established in other Member States setting up subsidiaries. Therefore, consumer choice has increased in many parts of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">A high degree of concentration may negatively affect the level of competition in these markets. The price level of energy may be one indicator for this; however, it has to be borne in mind that the price of energy is also influenced by many other factors: oil, gas and coal import prices, prices of CO2 emission allowances on the carbon market, additional expenditure for the support of renewable energies, and increasing internalisation of the external cost of energy.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Commission is monitoring the competitive dynamics of the markets at issue very carefully and why it recently launched an inquiry concerning the European energy sector. We await the findings of this inquiry.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as energy mergers are concerned, their possible impact on the level of competition has to be evaluated on the merits of each case. The Commission is strongly committed to carrying out this assessment with great attention in order to protect European consumers against the risk of reduced competition and unjustified price increases. The Commission would like to draw the attention of the honourable Member to the fact that it is currently carrying out phase II in-depth investigations into the E.ON/MOL merger in Hungary and the DONG/E2 merger in Denmark. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Against this backdrop, and in light of the Commission’s decision of 9 December to block the EDP/ENI/GDP merger, I wish to ask the Commission how it can stop a merger that has cross-border repercussions and considerable implications for competition at a time when the prevailing desire is for an integrated Iberian energy market and a more complete internal market in Europe’s energy sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you are aware, he is unable to be here today because he has to sign a very important agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is very concerned about the sharp escalation in oil prices over the last two years. While the impact on our economy of this increase in oil prices is currently less severe than in the 1970s, it is nonetheless having serious repercussions, particularly for our most vulnerable citizens and oil-intensive sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is actively responding to the challenge of high and volatile oil prices and is following a five-point plan in this respect. The main elements are: to manage our demand for energy by measures to increase energy efficiency and energy savings; to increase the use of alternative forms of energy; to improve the transparency and predictability of oil markets; to increase the supply of oil and gas by promoting an increase of investment in production and refining capacities and, finally, effectively to manage energy disruption.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission is actively increasing cooperation with the European Union’s main external oil suppliers through initiatives such as the European Union-Russia Energy Dialogue and the European Union- Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also planning a proposal to implement an EU-coordinated system for security oil stocks. The Commission does not have the competence to regulate the price of crude oil or petroleum products, particularly given that the oil market is a global one. Nevertheless, the Commission intends to continue to work in close collaboration with all the parties concerned to increase the level of transparency in the market in order to reduce speculation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the face of this profit frenzy, the European Commission and the governments, anticipating the wave of anger from the workers about the unaccountable action of the multinational oil companies, issue warnings from time to time to the companies, which continue to reap huge profits.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically, and with your reply today, it must be concluded that this is a question of collusion on the part of the European Commission, the governments in the Member States and the companies at the workers' expense.</p>
<p class="contents">The governments make use of oil to increase taxes, given that every consumer, out of one euro paid for petrol, pays 70 cents in taxes, while at the same time the companies' profits are increasing.</p>

<p class="contents">In this respect, it is worth mentioning that some have voiced their perplexity at not seeing the authorities take measures to capture part of the oil companies’ windfall profits resulting from the latest oil price increases. Oil companies should behave in a responsible manner and ensure that a significant share of their profits are reinvested in increasing the capacity of the sector to cope with the growing demand, thereby laying the foundations for more reasonable prices in the future – and, by the way, creating business for themselves. That is, investing both in the production of crude oil and in the refining business.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, oil and energy companies should be strongly encouraged to develop new energy sources with a view to dealing with the future scarcity of oil. The Commission has continued to make efforts through its contacts with the industry to increase the awareness of oil companies of the appropriateness of reinvesting part of their profits in activities that allow for more sustainable economic growth, such as the development of alternative energies and energy efficiency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first question is the extent to which there is a binding obligation for the Member States to collect waste by category.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive on hazardous waste bans the mixing of different categories of hazardous waste and the mixing of hazardous and non-hazardous waste. Other legislative acts of the European Union relating to specific waste flows supplement this obligation regarding the separate collection of waste. In addition, the Member States can take additional measures in accordance with their national policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question is the extent to which the Commission considers that the practice, especially as regards collection, destruction and so on, is or is not successful. The Commission believes that more correct application of legislation is required without fail; we have major problems in the application of the legislation and it has undertaken to improve its application.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the policy on waste constitutes a priority sector of environmental legislation and, of course, there are directives for various waste flows, such as the directive on lubricants, the directive on batteries, which is being debated, the directive on electrical and electronic waste, the directive on end-of-life vehicles and so on, which lay down specific separation and collection and destruction methods.</p>
<p class="contents">The lady Member also asked a very important question about heightening awareness; in other words, the extent to which heightening awareness and publicity help to deal with the problem. Of course they help, because publicity and maximum awareness-raising among citizens are important elements in finding optimum waste management solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say that the 'polluter pays' principle must be applied as a preventive measure in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. In addition, it is the responsibility of the Member States to take the necessary measures to comply with Community legislation in the waste sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there was a question about funding. The European Union funds the combating of waste; this is, in fact, one of the priorities of the Cohesion Fund. This funding may be provided through the European Regional Development Fund and through the Cohesion Fund and of course it concerns the disadvantaged areas and less wealthy countries of the European Union, which are entitled to the corresponding funds in order to apply the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>in the environmental sector. This aid is expected to total approximately EUR 2 billion in the period from 2000 to 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, of course, various other sources of finance, such as LIFE, and a new LIFE+ is in the pipeline for various actions, such as raising citizens' awareness about environmental issues, especially waste. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To be honest, my greatest pleasure will be not to go to the Court and not to have procedures of this sort, but through cooperation, through awareness-raising among citizens, through better understanding and exchanges of experience by the various countries, through the application of modern technology, for us to be able to find solutions and answers to the problems which concern the various countries in the waste sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, I must tell you that, within the framework of the thematic strategies which the Commission is presenting at the moment, in a few days – if I remember correctly during November – we shall also present the thematic strategy on preventing, limiting and recycling waste. This is a particularly important strategy which is horizontal and holistic, which deals with the problem of waste as a whole and, of course, will provide answers to many of the problems which exist and which, due to disputes, often lead to the courts.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, in this way, waste in the European Union will, firstly, be limited. This is the main objective; in other words, for us to produce less waste and, secondly, will be recovered and recycled and, only if these possibilities do not exist, will it either end up in incinerators, preferably with energy recovery, or in sanitary landfills, about which I should like to say, because this interests Greece in particular, that we hardly even know how many there are, while in numerous cases they even constitute a source of contamination and reduce the quality of life of citizens and, at the same time, create problems both for biodiversity and for climate change because they release methane, which is one of the gases that helps to create the greenhouse effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The letter of formal notice stressed the need for Member States to ensure the adequacy of their collecting and treatment systems under the Council Directive concerning urban waste water treatment. A reply has been received from the United Kingdom, and this is currently being assessed. That assessment is being carried out together with that of cases raising similar concerns about excessive storm water overflows in other parts of the United Kingdom. If I remember correctly, two are in England and one is in Scotland.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission hopes to be in a position to decide what steps to take next in this matter before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is unable to comment on the legal advice given by the UK Department for Environment referred to by the honourable Member, as it was not aware that such advice existed or that access to it had been refused. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Environment Agency, which is the UK regulator, believes that there is a breach of the directive. Could I just say to the Commissioner that it is not just a matter of storm overflows: it does not need unusually heavy rainfall to have these outflows; they happen on average once a week. Only one of the 57 outflows is screened and so I have to leave to your imagination the sewage solids that go into the river.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly worried about the run-up to the 2012 Olympics. For water sports and for the image of London, this is a terrible situation, and the athletes’ village will overlook one of these overflows. I am amazed that the UK Government, as well as the Mayor of London, is content to put up with that situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, I shall work with you in order to help London, as you stressed in your question, avoid the embarrassment that this pollution from overflows of raw sewage would cause to the 2012 Olympics. It is interesting to know that, if the problem is not resolved by then, the site of the proposed athletes’ village will overlook the overflow at Abbey Mills, with its associated smells and unsightly mess.</p>
<p class="contents">It cannot be ruled out that athletes may be allowed to practise on the Thames or that events may take place on the river itself. The Commission is unable to take a position on the arrangements being made in London for the 2012 Olympics. I must repeat that our only involvement is to ensure that the requirements of the directive concerning urban waste water treatment are met.</p>
<p class="contents">You are right to say that these spills occurred not only during the very heavy rainfall in August 2004. According to an Environment Agency press release, these spills occur about 50 to 60 times a year. The Environment Agency, which is an adviser to the UK Government, has also reached the conclusion that the system of collection and treatment is inadequate. There were some suggestions on how to solve this problem. One was an interceptor tunnel underneath the river Thames, which would be about 20 miles long and would take about ten years to construct.</p>
<p class="contents">The Directive on Urban Waste Water Treatment is a results-based directive and so it is not my business to suggest what method the British Government should choose to solve the problem. That is a matter for the Government. But there is a problem and we have therefore started infringement proceedings against the United Kingdom. In December we will see whether we should proceed with the reasoned opinion in order to persuade the United Kingdom authorities to take the appropriate measures to carry out the infrastructure works necessary in order to treat the water in an acceptable way.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that, if untreated sewage is discharged into the river, then the Thames estuary, which is an important wetland, will be endangered. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Sewage sludge and biological treatment plant at Psyttalia</span></p>
<p class="contents">Recently, the situation in the area of Ano Liosia has become unbearable owing to the accumulation of thousands of tonnes of sewage sludge transported to the landfill site there from Psyttalia. As a report by the local authorities of Western Attica points out, cracks have appeared in the embankment surrounding the site where the sludge has been deposited, with liquid waste flowing from one particular point and lying stagnant in a natural hollow in the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">In a previous answer (<a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2005-1728_EN.html">E-1728/05</a>), the Commission said that it would examine the matter in close contact with the Greek authorities. Could the Commission say what the present situation is in regard to the treatment of sewage sludge and the works at Psyttalia? Could the Commission also say whether it has completed its examination of the Greek authorities' answer (in accordance with the answer to Question <a href="/doceo/document/P-6-2005-0916_EN.html">P-0916/05</a>) to the reasoned opinion which it set out in respect of the contravention of the directives on waste and urban waste water treatment, and what are its conclusions? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Psyttalia station has been operating fully since December 2004 and takes care of third-level treatment of urban sewage discharged into the sensitive area of the Saronic Gulf.</p>
<p class="contents">During the construction and upgrading of the station, complaints were submitted to the Commission about the handling of the sludge – the sewage sludge – produced. In October 2002, the Commission instituted infringement proceedings against Greece in accordance with Article 226 of the Treaty, on the basis of the fact that the Greek authorities had not made provision for the disposal of the sewage sludge in a manner which was compatible with Community environmental legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The infringement proceedings brought about results, in that in August 2003 the Greek authorities finally decided to construct a drying unit on the island of Psyttalia, at which the sludge would be converted to solid matter of adequate calorific value for subsequent incineration in suitable installations.</p>
<p class="contents">There are similar applications in other European countries. It should be emphasised that, in December 2004, the Commission decided to cofinance the project within the framework of the Cohesion Fund. The project must be completed by the end of 2007. This is expected to resolve definitively the problem of sewage sludge management. However, despite all these positive developments, there is still the problem of the management of the sewage sludge already stored on the island and of the sewage sludge which will be produced on a daily basis until the proposed drying unit is commissioned.</p>
<p class="contents">One solution is to transport large quantities of untreated sewage sludge by ship and lorry to the sanitary landfill site in Ano Liosia, on the mainland outside Athens. However, this solution presents certain environmental problems: possible contamination of the waters due to the discharge of sewage sludge into the sea, repercussions due to emissions from the transportation of waste over a distance of 21 kilometres through a densely populated area and danger of contamination due to spillage of waste during transportation.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the disposal of the treated sewage sludge in the sanitary landfill site at Ano Liosia is considered to be a factor which will lead to the saturation of the site.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the Commission considers the method of disposal of the sludge referred to above to be incompatible with Community environmental legislation. The national authorities are responsible for the selection and implementation of a suitable method for the temporary treatment of the sewage sludge, pending the completion of the proposed drying unit.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is evaluating the temporary solution proposed by the Greek authorities, a sort of soilification procedure, in conjunction with the operation of the sanitary landfill site at Ano Liosia and, if necessary, it will not, of course, hesitate to institute judicial proceedings against Greece, because this is required not only by Community legislation, but also by the need to protect citizens' health and the environment. Within the framework of its powers, the Commission is taking – and shall continue to take – all the necessary measures in order to safeguard compliance by the Member States with Community legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The problem, therefore, is in the interim period and what will happen with the sewage sludge which is currently being dumped at the Ano Liosia landfill using a partial soilification procedure, which is at the pilot stage at present, whereby the material produced can be used either to cover the landfill or to reinforce the ground in certain areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, I repeat that the way in which the sludge is transported through a densely populated area to the landfill is not right.

In particular for Greece and for me, what I can say is that I am neither more nor less strict with the country of which I am a national. I try to be objective and to do what is needed in order to protect the health of the citizens in the European Union and, of course, in Greece, and to protect the ecosystems and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, we deal objectively and with an effort to improve conditions for health and the environment and questions of recourse to the Court and, I repeat, I always try to ensure we avoid going to the Court and find other ways of dealing with issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member said that the Commission should have even more competences and should indicate specific methods. What I can say to you is that, depending on the conditions which apply in each country, the best method is applied. The method of waste management in northern Europe is not the same as the method in southern Europe or in one country in relation to another or even in areas within the same country. There are reasons why one country prefers incineration and recycling and another country prefers landfill in order to reinforce the ground and, of course, our basic objective is always to try to prevent the creation of waste.</p>
<p class="contents">On the specific question of Psyttalia, the European Union has intervened in the financing of the first project, which was third-level treatment of waste, and now the drying unit. That being so, as for what happens about the problem created by the Greek Government by collecting all this sewage sludge on the island, that is not the European Union's business to say what should be done with this sewage sludge.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a problem which was created by neglecting to build the drying unit at the right time, ten years ago, with the result that all this sludge has collected. However, it is not our job to say what should be done with this sewage sludge and how the government should address the problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: EU-Israel Association Agreement</span></p>
<p class="contents">In a question submitted in August, <a href="/doceo/document/P-6-2005-3040_EN.html">P-3040/05</a>, regarding the ICJ ruling on the Separation Wall in Eastern Jerusalem, I asked the Commission to outline a 'concrete plan to fulfil its own obligations...under the ruling of 9 July 2004'. The Commission re-stated the EU position on this issue and claimed that 'dialogue is seen as the most effective way to make known one's views'. The ruling articulates erga omnes obligations 'to see to it that any impediment, resulting from the construction of the Wall, to the exercise by the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination is brought to an end,' which clearly require more than a mere expression of views. Moreover, the fact that the Wall is still under construction today indicates that political dialogue has proved wholly inadequate in ensuring Israeli compliance with international law.</p>

I am therefore very happy to say that this has now been included in our Neighbourhood Policy. This was done last June and since then we have been preparing proposals for draft action plans with each of the three countries concerned. The partner countries themselves are developing their own priorities for such action plans.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will start consultations on those action plans very soon. An EU troika is visiting the region as we speak, from 24 to 28 October, and its assessment will indeed be very helpful as we start our discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">Strengthening democracy, the rule of law, improving business and the investment climate for sustainable economic development, and encouraging people-to-people contacts are matters of utmost importance. These are key EU priorities for the whole region.</p>
<p class="contents">Further priorities under the ENP include regional cooperation and conflict settlement. The EC countries will, in the meantime, provide substantial support to the partner countries of the South Caucasus region and, by way of example, I could cite our deep involvement in the reform of the judiciary in Azerbaijan and Georgia, our support for institutional, legal and administrative reform in Armenia, or our rehabilitation efforts in those parts of Georgia especially affected by frozen conflicts, such as South Ossetia and Abkhazia.</p>
<p class="contents">We also hope to encourage greater cooperation between and with the countries bordering the Caspian Sea. Let me give just a few examples. We regard the process of EU-Black Sea/Caspian Basin energy and transport cooperation, launched at the Baku ministerial meeting late last year, as a very important vehicle for encouraging broader regional cooperation. We are also giving due attention to the environmental situation in and around the Caspian Sea, because it is the largest saltwater lake in the world but also one of the richest oil reserves. So this is a region that will be an increasing focus of our attention under the Neighbourhood Policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What that means is that the neighbourhood policy quite deliberately refrains from addressing the issue of membership of the European Union. That is never, of course, generally prejudicial to future developments, but it is quite essential that Georgia, and its two neighbours Armenia and Azerbaijan as well, should now do everything in their power to push through reforms on the domestic front. That is quite essential, and much that will bring them closer to the European Union still remains to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">We regard these countries as future important friends, and will, to some degree, be prepared – provided that they carry out these reforms – to include them in the internal market and to open up options for them in the spheres of energy, transport and education policy.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Situation with regard to EU funding in Tunisia</span></p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission aware of the difficulties with EU funding in Tunisia?</p>
<p class="contents">Tunisia is a target country of the EIDHR and one of the MEDA partners which receives significant financial assistance for economic/social actions, human rights and democracy development. The Commission is, no doubt, aware that the grants awarded by the EU to various NGOs, targeted in democracy-building and training projects, have been frozen by the Tunisian authorities without any proper explanation.

<p class="contents">Parliament's Resolution on Tunisia of 29 September 2005 urges the Council and Commission to improve the management of projects under the MEDA programme and EIDHR and to work out the appropriate measures to be taken if no progress is observed in the release of blocked funds. What specific plans has the Commission drawn up, and what tangible steps have been taken to improve this situation? Does the Commission think that it should review the amount of financial grants to Tunisia (both under MEDA and EIDHR), bearing in mind that part of such funding has not reached its recipients and target? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have also met civil society representatives in Tunisia, notably the associations that are encountering difficulties in receiving support from the European Union, the Tunisian League of Human Rights and the Association of Women for Research and Development. I must say I strongly encouraged the Tunisian authorities to rapidly unblock the four projects that are still currently blocked, representing a total of EUR 143 000. I have also made it clear that the problems with the implementation of our civil society and governance projects will have very negative consequences for our future financial cooperation with Tunisia.</p>

The agreement follows the new partnership format which the Community has developed for relations with third countries in the field of fisheries. This new approach includes, among others, a clear commitment from the Commission side to promote the general principles of conservation and sustainable management of fishery resources. The new agreement paves the way for a permanent policy dialogue on fisheries between the European Community and Morocco and envisages initiatives and measures in support of responsible fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The previous fisheries agreement with Morocco, which covered the period 1995-99, did indeed provide for fishing possibilities for sponge fishing. In fact, it included the provision of five licences, which were never used.</p>
<p class="contents">The new agreement establishes different categories of fishing possibilities for Community fishing vessels, covering a total of 119 fishing vessels and a quota of 60 000 tonnes for industrial pelagic fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is well aware of the Greek interest in sponge fishing, since, as part of the preparations for the negotiations on a new fisheries partnership agreement with Morocco, Greece pointed out on several occasions its interest in including sponge fishing in the new agreement. During the negotiations, the Commission took account of the Greek interest and presented to the Moroccan side a request to include sponge fishing in the agreement. Unfortunately, however, at this stage, sponge fishing cannot be covered in the agreement. The scientific evaluations available do not provide sufficient data with respect to sponge fishing to allow us to cover this type of fishing in the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">However, were a favourable scientific assessment of sponge stocks to become available in the future, the Commission could propose to the Moroccan side the inclusion of this type of fishing in the agreement. This inclusion could take the form of a decision of the joint committee that is provided for in Article 10 of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I wish to emphasise that both the Community and Morocco have agreed to the possibility of carrying out certain experimental fisheries under Article 5 of the Protocol. In this context, experimental sponge fishing can be envisaged. Experimental campaigns could facilitate the preparation of a scientific assessment of sponge resources in the Moroccan fishing zone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">No less important are the regulation of river and estuarial fisheries and the maintenance of rivers in good ecological condition to ensure appropriate spawning success and the survival and growth of young salmon. But other aspects fall outside the direct competence of the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">An important drawback of the management of salmon fisheries at sea is that these do not target single stocks of salmon. In fact, salmon caught in these fisheries can belong to a mixture of stocks in unpredictable proportions.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important aspect of these fisheries is that they are deeply rooted in the tradition of coastal communities of fishermen and their consequent social importance. The challenge is then to establish a balance between the conditions by which fishing may be allowed to continue and to ensure that such fishing does not undermine the sustainability of stocks in need of recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States with sea salmon fisheries have developed management strategies to address that difficult problem. Measures taken range from total prohibition to the regulation of fishing gear, in order to target better the stocks of salmon in good condition and preserve those in need of recovery. The Commission has undertaken to review the situation and examine the success of these management strategies and subsequently report to the Council and to Parliament. This work is in progress and will be completed during the coming weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the result of the above-mentioned report and the discussion both with the European institutions and with other stakeholders, the Commission will consider proposing management measures within the framework of the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the reference made by the honourable Member to the use of driftnets, the Commission should clarify that the salmon driftnet fishery within the Irish 12-mile limit is not covered by the 1998 ban on the use of driftnets for highly migratory species such as tuna.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would also add that the question at stake refers to stock management issues but does not directly relate to the type of gear concerned. It should therefore not be confused with the 1998 prohibition on the use of driftnets because of cetacean by-catch and which, in the Atlantic area of interest, applies only to the catching of tuna and some tuna-like species.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision taken by the Council last year, with the full support of the European Parliament, for a progressive phasing-out and a total ban on using driftnets in the Baltic Sea as from 1 January 2008, which shall apply without any distinction on target fish species, including salmon, is aimed at protecting the extremely endangered population of harbour porpoise that remains in the Baltic Sea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There we have a total ban on the use of driftnets.</p>
<p class="contents">With driftnets that are much smaller in size and where there is no risk of cetacean by-catches, the Commission’s position is more open. If, on the basis of scientific study, it can be concluded that driftnets do not create undue pressures on the sustainability of salmon or any other fish stocks and there is no risk of by-catches of cetaceans, then we take a more open approach. That is why, because of the reports and criticism in Ireland, we have commissioned the study to see what the situation is and how the management of the stock is proceeding. If we see that there are undue pressures on sustainability then we will take the necessary remedial action.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps it is somewhat misleading to point the finger at one particular type of net. There could be other types of net that are not classified as driftnets but that, in particular circumstances, could have an even more negative impact on the sustainability of fisheries. Therefore the task of the Commission is to restore sustainable fisheries where they do not exist and where we are fishing sustainably – which is the exception, not the rule – to maintain sustainability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Fishermen who use traditional, environmentally sound fishing equipment (as is the case with Almeria's long-line fleet) are in a serious plight: they are the victims of unfair competition from certain vessels (French and Italian ones in particular) which use the banned <span class="bold"></span> though much cheaper <span class="bold"></span> drift nets and at the same time they suffer on account of the environmental damage caused by such practices, which result in a 40% reduction in catches. The rogue vessels are not pursued in any way by the authorities of the countries to which they belong <span class="bold"></span> indeed, some governments even make changes to their internal law which enable Community rules to be circumvented.</p>

It is, on the other hand, the responsibility of the Commission to evaluate and monitor Member States' compliance with this obligation.</p>
<p class="contents">For a number of years, the Commission has monitored Member States closely to ensure they are taking the necessary measures for proper control and enforcement of the driftnet prohibition. Although in the Atlantic the situation has proved to be satisfactory, in the Mediterranean serious problems persist. The last inspections carried out by Commission inspectors this summer confirmed that driftnets were currently being used in Italy, France and Spain. The Commission has already launched infringement proceedings against these Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Reasoned opinions were addressed to Italy and France and a letter of formal notice to Spain. The opinions and the letter from the Commission challenged the lack of proper control and enforcement by the competent authorities of the Member States concerned as regards the prohibition on driftnets.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also examining closely, on the basis of the information at its disposal, national legislation which is not, or seems not to be, in conformity with the Community probation on driftnets. To cite an example, in the infringement procedure against France the Commission challenged the compatibility with Community legislation of a French decree allowing the use by French fishermen of the thonaille, a driftnet targeting bluefin tuna. This legislation was recently annulled by the French Conseil d´État, which, in its decision, used the same arguments as the Commission had used in its reasoned opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress that, although the Commission is aware of the assertion that Almeira's surface longliner fleet has suffered a 40% reduction in catches, as stated by the honourable Member, there is no scientific evidence that such a reduction has actually occurred and that this is caused by the unfair competition attributable to non-Spanish fleets. Representatives of the Spanish fleet concerned have been asked to provide the data to support their allegation. In any case, I can confirm that the Commission will take all necessary steps in accordance with the rules of the EC Treaty and of the Common Fisheries Policy to ensure that Member States comply with the Community legislation prohibiting driftnets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is clearly well-known, as the Commissioner has demonstrated very well, that driftnets are still being used in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">The fishermen who conform to the Regulation have a sense that they are not being protected, but there is something more serious than all of that. It has come to light this summer that, of 37 vessels found with driftnets prohibited by ecological organisations, 18 had already received subsidies for their restructuring. I do not believe that this problem can be left solely in the hands of the Member States. I believe that the Commission must act and it has done so in relation to certain States, but that is clearly insufficient. We cannot allow non-compliance with the Regulation and we cannot allow certain practices to take place while subsidies are being paid.</p>

If the Commission receives information that there might be a breach of the <span class="italic">acquis, </span>i.e. of the regulations concerning the common fisheries policy, then it will investigate whether the Member States are effecting controls. The Commission carries out enquiries and it is as a result of these enquiries that infringement proceedings are initiated against Member States. This is exactly what has happened with regard to the infringement proceedings against France, Italy and Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to underline that we were hoping to have the Mediterranean regulation adopted in the Council last month. This would have included a definition of driftnets, which are banned by the 1988 regulation. Unfortunately, the Council did not adopt this regulation last September. We will be trying our luck again soon, in the hope that we can secure a long overdue regulation governing fisheries in the Mediterranean, which would give the Commission increased powers to ensure that fisheries are carried out properly and within the limits of sustainability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
