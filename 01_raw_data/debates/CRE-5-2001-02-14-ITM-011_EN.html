<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lucas (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, my report refers to the fourth consultation of the European Parliament on the EU/Mexico Agreement. Since it is also probably the last consultation for the foreseeable future it has particular importance. The report concerns aspects of the agreement that are not covered by the so-called interim agreement, i.e. services, investment and aspects of intellectual property.</p>
<p class="contents">From a European perspective, the EU/Mexico agreement is generally seen as a milestone in the forthcoming relations with Latin American countries. It has the largest scope of any agreement the EU has ever concluded with a third country, providing EC operators with more rapid preferential treatment than Mexico has ever before granted to any of its preferential partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, with this agreement, the EU has not only succeeded in achieving NAFTA parity but has actually achieved a result that goes beyond NAFTA privileges in a number of areas. Among those are the ones that I focus on in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I believe that some of these gains for the EU are being made at the expense of the people of Mexico. Although my report approves the proposal for a Council decision, it does so with some reluctance and with a number of serious reservations and recommendations for reform which I should like to set out now.</p>
<p class="contents">First and most important is the issue of poverty in Mexico. It is essential that the agreement more fully reflects the fact that Mexico has an ambiguous position in terms of its development status. On the one hand, it is a member of the OECD and thus is considered to be one of the industrialised countries; but, on the other hand, it is a country with 95 million inhabitants where well over half the population – 65% – live in poverty. That means it is absolutely essential to take seriously the coherence principle of the European Union. To me, the bottom line must be that a reinforced economic partnership with Mexico and better access to Mexican markets must not contradict development objectives and must not exacerbate the existing asymmetry between the two parties.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore of considerable concern that in a significant number of places the agreement is likely to hinder, rather than to support, poverty eradication, human rights and sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">I will outline some of these in a moment. A good example is the fact that the agreement foresees the almost total prohibition of performance requirements which will prevent the Mexican side from specifying the terms on which it would like to see trade and foreign investment. That means that Mexico will not be able to ensure that trade and foreign investment support its own emerging markets and its own development objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at the agreement in more detail, starting with services: For the Commission, the negotiated trade package in services is: "of key offensive interest". Indeed the liberalisation covers very nearly all sectors. So its terms and scope are very far-reaching. But, more worryingly, it contains a stand-still clause which, by prohibiting Mexico from introducing any further standards and conditions in the future, could seriously damage the social and economic development and policy autonomy of this country.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore the agreement states that: "no mode of supply is <span class="italic">a priori</span> excluded from coverage". If that implies that education and health might be covered without safeguards, this is an area of further concern. I am sure Members will recall that in the European Parliament in 1999, in our response to the approach to the Millennium Round, we made a specific demand that health and education be excluded from the revision of the GATS. It would therefore be inconsistent to include education and health in the EU/Mexico agreement as sectors that could be liberalised.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mexican civil society groups believe that the Mexican negotiators went beyond their powers in making this agreement, since the agreement establishes the powers of the Joint Council to dismantle Mexican trade and services legislation, which clearly should be within the remit of the legislative power. Parliament should support civil society in Mexico, which is asking for this unconstitutional provision to be changed.</p>
<p class="contents">On investment, the different economic crashes we have seen in Mexico make investment a particularly sensitive issue. However, the definition of investment in the agreement includes direct investment, real estate and purchases of securities, and therefore seems to open the door to speculative movements and thus to further financial instability.</p>
<p class="contents">I could go on citing more problems that we can see in the area of intellectual property rights, on conflict resolution and, indeed, on human rights. But to conclude in terms of where we need to go now, we need to have a clear statement from the Commissioner about the agenda of the Joint Council meeting on 27 February. There are a number of key issues which I have raised which must be on that agenda. I would like to know from the Commissioner present if and when we will get the agenda of this meeting, if he is going to include the kinds of issues that I have raised in my speech – and also in the report itself – and when we will get the results of that meeting of 27 February.</p>
<p class="contents">The Joint Council meeting must include the competences of the Joint Council along with the Mexican constitution, ensuring their compatibility. It must include effective monitoring of human rights. It must include a commitment to coherence and compatibility of trade measures and it must ensure that the European Parliament is closely associated with this agreement in all its future changes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no reason why citizens should know our Rules and certain statements may lend themselves to confusion and give rise to misunderstandings.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you, Mr President, and now I shall begin my intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a decision contained in the Commission proposal, which is the subject of the report we are beginning to debate, is the culmination of a long process that began in 1995 with the signing of a joint declaration between the European Community and Mexico. This declaration established some objectives that were to become an agreement that would replace the Cooperation Agreement signed in 1991, in order to strengthen and enhance the political, economic and commercial relations between the European Union and Mexico. The Economic Partnership, Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement, also known as the Global Agreement, was signed in December 1997. Therefore, the Commission proposal on which Parliament has been consulted must be considered in the context of the Global Agreement signed by the European Union and Mexico – the most important agreement the European Union has ever signed, I think it is worth remembering. This is also the context of the interim agreement dealing with the economic and commercial aspects of the Global Agreement, the aim of which was to allow negotiations to begin as soon as possible for the liberalisation of the commercial aspects of Community competence included in the Global Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the proposal for a decision with which we are concerned and the agreements it deals with, my Group sees them as being very positive because they strengthen the possibility for Community operators to act in spheres of particular interest by guaranteeing them access to the Mexican market on equal or even better terms than those enjoyed by NAFTA countries in the area of services, investments, payments and respect for intellectual property rights, with the resulting benefits and legal guarantee that all this may bring to the European Union. These considerations by themselves would justify the unreserved approval of the proposal for a decision by my Group and, I hope, by this Parliament as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in addition to the economic advantages, my Group is well aware of the political benefits arising from the adoption of this proposal for a decision, and also that the European Union-Mexico Joint Council, which will meet at the end of this month, needs to adopt it, because only once it is adopted can the provisions on political dialogue and cooperation in the areas of education, combating poverty, and social and environmental matters come into force. My Group in particular and this Parliament in general have always been highly sensitive to such questions, because they are the guarantee that the economic benefits which will undoubtedly accrue from the overall agreement will help promote a political system that is more democratic, more respectful of human rights and more in tune with social justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to take advantage of the presence of the Mexican Ambassador to the European Union, the diplomat, Jaime Zabludovsky, to congratulate him on his active contribution to this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement establishes the bases for closer relations between the European Union and Mexico. In this respect, I should like to emphasise that, on this occasion, we have managed not only to obtain institutional declarations, but we have created a legal framework that will bring together these two peoples who share many common values, if both parties are able to take full advantage of the potential of this agreement. To this extent, I wish to emphasise that, in addition to the mechanisms that have been established in the fields of political cooperation and trade, an instrument has also been created to boost and further cooperation in more than thirty different areas. Almost three years have passed since Parliament delivered a favourable opinion on the interim agreement between the European Union and Mexico. One year later, Parliament also expressed its support for the overall agreement, which was then ratified by the Fifteen Member States of the Union. Throughout this period, we have witnessed the great changes that have taken place in Mexican society and which have culminated in what can be called a genuine celebration of democracy: last July’s elections. On this subject, I should like to take this opportunity to pay public tribute to President Ernesto Zedillo for his commitment to democratic reform. I should also like to convey to the new leaders of the Mexican administration my sincerest hope that they will continue in the current direction and repay the trust that the Mexican people has invested in them.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we need to call for two things: firstly, we must ask the Commission, in the person of Commissioner Nielson, through the intermediary of the European Union delegation in Mexico, to undertake an assessment on the ground of the agreement’s potential for trade and cooperation and to ensure that his results are distributed to the various parties concerned. Secondly, we must once again ask the parties concerned in the Chiapas conflict to maximise their efforts in dialogue based on respect for democratic principles, so that an end can be brought to an anachronistic situation that has no place in modern society.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should also like to express our solidarity with the people of El Salvador, who have, once again, fallen victim to a natural disaster. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One of these could be the ‘tequila effect’ which has irradiated from Mexico since the last presidential elections, a genuine example of civic pride which, we trust, will have beneficial consequences to help shape the new political map of the United Mexican States. There we hope to see a separation of powers and guarantees that governments will alternate in power, and we are sure that the necessary interrelationship between economic modernisation and political modernisation will increasingly prosper.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course Mexico is a country of light and shade, like any country in the European Union. That is why I noticed the excessively critical tone used by the rapporteur of this report in her explanatory statement regarding the social and economic situation in this Latin American republic.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we should be careful in our statements and I am surprised by the rapporteur’s doubts on questions of Mexican constitutional competences when dealing with trade in services.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to investments, I do not think the assessments made are appropriate, since the degree of internationalisation of the Mexican economy in recent years has been remarkable, to the point where Mexico is the country that has most used the Community financial instrument known as the ECIP. This is clearly reflected in the growth in investment by foreign companies and in the free trade agreements, both the one signed with the United States and Canada and the recent one with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In the latter case, Mexico has made a strategic effort to diversify its relations, which had focused so much on the United States, and this will moreover provide European goods with tariff treatment similar to that given to US goods, especially with regard to industrial products. We shall obviously be voting in favour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">But this agreement, like everything else in life, can be improved. We understand of course that the agreement is a trading issue, but we feel there is a lack of concrete measures on the development of Mexico, our sister country.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, nowhere in the functions of the Joint Committee (Article 44) did we find provision for a study of the repercussions of putting the association agreement into practice, something that we believe is frankly essential.</p>
<p class="contents">We also regret that there is not even a mention of the environment in this agreement, not even –as my colleague Caroline Lucas has pointed out – a reference to the Protocol on Biosafety within the sections on intellectual property.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I must point out the profound inconsistency in the fact that, whereas in Mexico the agreement has been ratified by institutions elected by the people, in the European Union, which thinks of itself as a model of democracy, this agreement is not passed on directly for approval by this Parliament, which has been directly elected by the people of Europe, but it is simply consulted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When this agreement was completed, however, my first thought was lucky Mexico. Here is a country which can enter into a trade agreement with the EU without having to join the club, without having to pay the membership fee or take on thousands of directives and regulations every year. Why can't the UK do the same I thought.</p>
<p class="contents">On another level I must highlight the observations of the rapporteur that there is an increased sensitivity amongst Members of Parliament about who makes the decisions on trade: whether it is the Council or the Commission. Actually that sensitivity is not confined to this Parliament. Many of my party members and constituents share that sensitivity and are alarmed at the Nice developments which seem to place far too much power in the hands of unelected Commission officials. That is to say that I would not be content if the power was vested elsewhere in the EU, because the greatest sensitivity is that we as a country are having trade agreements affecting the UK negotiated and finalised by a third party, which may or may not be entirely in our national interests. Further, as to conflict resolution procedures based as they are on a WTO model, we have already experienced the banana war where innocent British companies have been penalised for matters which have nothing to do with them and over which they have no control whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">Altogether we are happy that the EU and Mexico have reached an agreement but we do not believe that the UK should be bound by it. We would much rather make our own agreements on our own terms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many of us present here have played an active part in preparing this agreement over the last few years.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the report we are dealing with, I should like to point out two aspects I consider important, the treatment of which is surprising.</p>
<p class="contents">First, this text mentions the Mexican constitution at least eight times, arguing that if Mexico signs the agreement with the European Union this will supposedly violate that country’s supreme charter. In this regard, I should just like to recall that on 20 May 2000 the Mexican Parliament approved this cooperation by 89 votes to 11 with two abstentions.</p>
<p class="contents">The same figures apply to the approval of the commercial decisions of the Joint Council for the Interim Agreement and also those of the Joint Council for the Global Agreement. No parliamentary group appealed to the nation’s Supreme Court of Justice, the body authorised to settle such matters, on grounds of unconstitutionality.</p>
<p class="contents">On another subject, with regard to human rights, it should be remembered that Mexico has signed more than 50 international treaties on human and workers’ rights, including many of those mentioned in the report on the table. It also recognises the mandatory jurisdiction of the Interamerican Court of Human Rights in such matters. It seems then, that the rule of law prevails in Mexico.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the current administration has signed an agreement with the United Nations and has set up a special embassy at that international organisation for human rights and democracy. I must also mention that in 1999 the democracy clause was included in this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I think the best guarantee of being able to exercise individual rights and freedoms is economic prosperity; as everyone knows and as has been demonstrated on many occasions, free trade agreements provide in the medium term a solid basis on which to achieve it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mexico is an important country. It is the largest Spanish-speaking country in the world. Accordingly, this agreement is of great political importance. But I would like to stress that it is also of great importance to us to approve this agreement, because it is evidence of the common foreign policy of the European Union. I address this remark in particular to the Commissioner responsible for foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In this, I differ from my British colleagues for whom it would be preferable that the Member States concluded individual agreements with Mexico. I regard the fact that the European Union is tackling this issue as a united front as a great step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">For us, the agreement with Mexico has a high priority. What is more, it is the first in a series of agreements we are currently negotiating with Mercosur and Chile. Implementing the Mexico agreement therefore serves a pilot function. As far as our foreign trade policy is concerned, this will improve our trading situation in Mexico. The share of Europe’s trade with Mexico has fallen back to simply ridiculously low levels. This situation must improve and I believe it is also in the interest of Mexico not to be solely dependent on trade with the USA but to have a well-balanced trade position, with Europe playing a role. This, I believe, is a truism. To this extent, the agreement is in our interest as much as it is in the interest of Mexico.</p>
<p class="contents">While approving the EU/Mexico agreement, we should nevertheless honour the fact that Mexico is changing. The election of President Fox means that, for the first time since the Mexican revolution, there has been a changeover of power. Mexico now ranks among the states in which democratic changeovers of power will become the norm. There is also hope that the conflict in Chiapas, in the south of the country, will be settled peacefully.</p>
<p class="contents">Mexico has opened itself up to the USA, but it is also prepared to open itself up to Europe. I would therefore very much welcome it if, for instance, the newly elected President of Mexico were to pay a visit to Europe in the not too distant future, and perhaps speak to us here in this Chamber, and if European heads of state were to visit Mexico.</p>
<p class="contents">A final word on the Lucas report: as is always the case, it is clear that we do not agree on the explanatory statement contained in the report. Here, the rapporteur is free to express his or her opinion. But I would like to say in this connection that cooperation with Mexico, a country with which we entertain friendly relations, is critical. What is more, this works in both directions. We want to have the freedom to say what we do not like in other areas and we also ask our friends to tell us what they do not like. That can best be exemplified by the situation with the USA: we have had some very serious clashes with the USA – and vice versa too, I might add – without that having changed our cooperation partnership and our mutual trust in any way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mexico is the European Union's most important trading partner in Latin America after Brazil, and I am particularly proud that Europe has reached a result that goes beyond NAFTA privileges in a number of areas which are good for Europe but also good for Mexico.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider this agreement a milestone in future relations with Latin American countries. In the context of today's debate, the European Liberals would like particularly to stress the importance of the standard human rights clause in this agreement, especially respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights. We would like to underline how vital it is to monitor the human rights situation in Mexico as I have seen with my own eyes. In this context I find the rapporteur's proposal to proceed to a reform of Articles 39 and 59 of the global agreement judicious. A side agreement on cooperation on human rights is to be envisaged. Our main hope is that the opening up of the Mexican economy will contribute towards economic and social development in Chiapas. We declare our willingness to start this process and I hope that the march of Marcos on Mexico City will mean a breakthrough in peace. It is now up to President Fox to make what he promised the European Parliament delegation during his campaign come true. I will follow it closely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, we would request the Council and Commission to provide the European Parliament with continuous and comprehensive updates on the mutual effects this agreement has. This explicit request is tied in closely with the promising initiatives which the new Mexican President, Vincente Fox, is currently developing. These are efforts which are clearly aimed at supporting neglected population groups, in the first place the country’s very extensive Indian community, by investments and considerable regional autonomy. A courageous goal in the face of huge resistance, both politically and socially.</p>
<p class="contents">This holds a pleasant, joint development task in store for the European Union and the United States. At the end of the day, we in Strasbourg and Brussels do not wish to have the reputation worldwide of being cool and collected customers. In short, wider market access and an improvement of the Mexican position in the world economy requires an approach which is more humanitarian than one-dimensional liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">We can certainly identify with the social focus which the rapporteur, Mrs Lucas, has opted for amidst the needs of the Mexican population. In her explanatory statement to the agreement, she mentions the adverse effects this agreement has on the Mexican constitution several times. However, that is primarily a domestic matter, in our opinion. But that does not affect our wish for the rapporteur’s commitment to rub off on the Council and Commission in their dealings with the Mexican partners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that a sharp mind must have worked on this report. The rapporteur has managed, in an exemplary fashion, to tease weaknesses out of an agreement and, reading the explanatory statement contained in the report, Mrs Lucas, I get the impression that it may be paving the way for some form of Euro-imperialism. I have two specific points to make. Firstly, as regards the democratic weaknesses which have been pointed out time and again in the explanatory statement, we are setting standards for Mexico which only a strong country can allow itself to set for a weak country. The need to adapt Mexico’s constitution to bring it into line with this agreement in particular is questionable to say the least. It reminds me of the deficits which the European Union has itself towards its own citizens due to a lack of democratic legitimisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point which, in my opinion, should not be forgotten is that Mexico is not only an important trading partner for the European Union but, in the mid 1990s, went through what the then President of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, called the first financial crisis of the twenty-first century. That is why, to my mind, it is especially laudable that special reference is made to problems which countries like Mexico and, especially now, Argentina have through being closely tied to the US dollar. It is very regrettable that the Commission does not follow mainstream opinion, which says that we must pay attention. From my own perspective, I would even prefer to go in the direction of the Bretton Wood system. The relevant precautions are lacking, as is positive assistance to Mexico. Perhaps the only criticism I would have against the report is that we do not point out in the recommendations that, in the field of financial crises, we should be extending our help. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has a larger area of application than any previous agreement between the European Union and a third country. I have always been very critical towards, but, at the same time, very solidly behind this agreement with Mexico. For us, it is not only a matter of keeping the interests of the European Union in mind – which is very much the case with many in this House – but also the interests of Mexico and its people, who mostly live in poverty. The agreement will therefore only be a milestone if it improves the living conditions of the overwhelming majority of Mexicans. Of crucial importance will also be how democracy and human rights are implemented. The Fox administration will have to be measured in terms of that and not just in terms of its economic success.</p>
<p class="contents">Special heed should be paid to the services sector and direct investments, since Mexico must not be regarded as an extended workbench. Rather, investments must contribute to enhancing regional development. They must be in line with clear social and ecological standards, which must not only be scrutinised but also adhered to. It also behoves us here in the European Parliament and the Mexican government to ensure that the greatest possible benefits are reaped for the people of Mexico. But how the Joint Council performs its tasks in connection with the further development of the agreement and how Mexico’s Parliament and the European Union will be integrated are also important for us. And as there is nothing that could not be improved, I hope Mexico and the European Union, as equal partners at the same eye level, will resolve the discrepancies and remove the errors which doubtless still exist in the contract. I say this as Vice-President of the Delegation for Relations with Central America and Mexico. I stand by this agreement and if these objectives, about which Mrs Lucas has said a great deal, are fulfilled, nothing should stand in the way of success. Then this agreement would really be a milestone in the history of the contracts concluded between the European Union and a Latin American country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to take this opportunity to inform Parliament that today I have decided to release another EUR 5 to 8 million to support people in El Salvador. This is quite significant.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the matter under discussion, Mexico has gone through a radical modernisation process over the last decade. The NAFTA agreement has played an important role in this. It led to a major increase of trade and investment flows between the US and Mexico and also Canada. Neither the EU nor Mexico wanted the NAFTA agreement to result in less intense relations between the EU and Mexico. We both accepted the challenge and decided to adapt our relations. This culminated with the entry into force last October of our economic partnership, political coordination and cooperation agreement, often called the global agreement. This agreement, which consists of a free trade area, political dialogue and cooperation provisions reinforces Mexico's existing relations with Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Due to the very complex distribution of competence between the Community and its Member States, the free trade agreement is made up of two separate legal texts. The first, Decision 2/2000, covers the areas of Community competence and was adopted by the Joint Council in Lisbon on 23 March 2000 after Parliament gave its opinion on 16 March 2000. It entered into force on 1 July 2000. The second text covers the remaining areas – services, investment and intellectual property – and should be adopted by the Joint Council on 27 February 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">The later text, which we are debating today, will liberalise services in two phases. Firstly by including a stand-still clause which prevents both parties from introducing new discriminatory measures or reinforcing the existing ones. This clause only applies to discriminatory measures and therefore does not exclude the possibility of adopting new, restrictive, non-discriminatory rules in order, for instance, to protect the environment further. Secondly, this decision provides for the elimination of substantially all remaining discrimination between the parties over a maximum period of ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision will comply with GATS rules – mainly the obligation not to exclude any sector from the liberalisation process. Moreover the text includes measures concerning investments and related payments which complete the undertakings already made by both parties at the OECD and through bilateral agreements signed between Mexico and most of the Member States. The European Parliament has been invited to give its opinion on this second decision. Once this decision is adopted by the Joint Council on 27 February 2001, the free trade agreement will be fully in place.</p>
<p class="contents">But this decision has also a bigger impact. The global agreement will be fully implemented and thus the political dialogue and the cooperation pillars will enter effectively into force. Mexico is traditionally one of the EU's most important trading partners in Latin America with a significant growth potential, and the EU is Mexico's second trading partner after the US. The achievement of the free trade agreement will provide EC operators with access to the Mexican market similar to NAFTA.</p>
<p class="contents">Our trading relationship, which has declined over previous years, should improve markedly now that we are able to compete on a level playing field with the US and Canadian products and services. We should be satisfied by what we have achieved in this area. The EU-Mexico Free Trade Agreement is the first agreement of this type which the EU has signed with a Latin American country.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from trade, we should make full use of this comprehensive agreement to further deepen our already excellent bilateral relations with Mexico. The institutionalised high level political dialogue will provide a good tool to agree on common positions, on issues of mutual interest: for instance, UN reform, efforts to launch a new WTO round and the human rights situation of both parties. The agreement will provide us with new possibilities for cooperation on the basis of the guidelines laid down for the period 2000-2006, whether on strengthening the rule of law, judicial reform, tackling poverty or investing in human resources. It is a new, very ambitious beginning. I share the views expressed by most Members in this debate, and we will be very happy to see this flourish in the coming years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
