<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Volmer, </span>  <span class="italic">Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad to have this first opportunity to speak to the House. Unfortunately, the matter we are about to debate is a regrettable one. Following the arrest of Mr Öcalan by the Turkish authorities, and the inability or impotence of the international community to find an international solution to the question of how he could be brought to trial, there has, unfortunately, been a rising tide of violence in nearly every European country, which has caused loss of life, injuries and very serious material damage.</p>
<p class="contents">We utterly condemn the use of violence. We cannot tolerate or accept political problems, however serious, being tackled by the use of this kind of violence. Ever since this issue erupted into a crisis, people at all levels, in all the European states and in the European Union, have been discussing how they can help to resolve the conflicts in south‐eastern Turkey. You, ladies and gentlemen, took note of the EU"s joint statement of 22 February 1999 on the subject. There are increasing calls to the effect that after the PKK riots in Europe this is now an EU foreign policy issue. I agree. We must not forget that the excesses of the last few days were precipitated by a conflict that is occurring primarily in the country of a NATO partner that will one day also be an EU partner, namely Turkey, where it also has its origins.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, the thinking behind much of what has been said in the public discussions over the past few days needs to be sorted out. Let me try to contribute to this. In my view it is true that the PKK has discredited itself by its acts of terrorism and violence. It has also discredited itself in terms of its claim to represent the legitimate interests of the Kurdish people. But Öcalan"s PKK, as it is seen and perceived today, with the role and power it has today, would certainly not have been conceivable were it not for the present internal situation in our partner state, Turkey, which lives in constant fear of its territorial integrity being put at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">In that sense the PKK, its aims and its methods are in part the symptom of a more deep‐seated problem. And it is precisely for that reason that we cannot regard it as the legitimate expression of Kurdish interests or as a warring party that we should recognise. On the contrary, because of its random acts of violence, the PKK has repeatedly discredited itself as a political force. There is now an unmistakeable risk that this will also discredit Kurdish concerns as such among large sections of European public opinion. The PKK is largely responsible for the fact that today Turkey still perceives almost any movement towards ethnic identity as a threat to its national unity and territorial integrity. If Turkey is to be in a situation in future where it can satisfy the legitimate demands of ethnic groups and distinguish them from terrorist threats, the first need is to allay these fears. The major if not only obstacle to such a process is that a group that is prepared to use violence and all too often does so in Europe too is presenting itself as the legitimate representative of Kurdish interests.</p>
<p class="contents">If we really want to see progress here, we must have the courage to speak the truth and the strength to promote reconciliation. The first step along that road is having the courage to speak the truth in all friendliness, however uncomfortable or inconvenient that truth may be. In my view we must recognise, first of all, that there is a Kurdish question. Secondly, in the end that question can only be resolved in Turkey. Thirdly, we should start a dialogue with Turkey on the best way of resolving this question.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that every nation and every ethnic group has the right to cultural autonomy and to at least partial self‐administration in this area. But that right must be clearly distinguished from the right to national independence, which implies separatism. This distinction between cultural autonomy and national separatism was the key to the Contact Group"s attempts during the Rambouillet negotiations to seek a peaceful settlement, and in our view this same distinction is also the key to resolving other regional conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope the Turkish Government will grasp the opportunity presented by Öcalan"s arrest and that it will perceive the difference between national separatism and cultural autonomy. We could also argue on the basis of international law. The people"s right to self‐determination does not automatically imply the right to form a state; but conversely minority rights, such as the right to cultural autonomy, must not be rejected and suppressed simply on the grounds of a justified or unjustified fear of separatism. We hope we will be able to start a dialogue with Turkey that has a fruitful outcome. Some statements from Turkey itself encourage us in that hope. For example, President Demirel suggested there could be an amnesty for PKK fighters who laid down their arms.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister Ecevit spoke out against the death penalty. The Turkish Parliament has drafted a bill providing for a degree of regionalisation in Turkey. These are encouraging signs, which we will gladly follow up in the hope of reaching a viable result both for the Turkish State and for the Kurdish minority. Our stand is entirely clear: Turkey has a quite justified interest in maintaining its national integrity. We will support it in that. On the other hand, the Kurds also have a quite legitimate interest in developing their cultural autonomy. We support that position too. We will discuss the open questions with the Turkish Government. The conditions for a dialogue are better than they were in the past, now that Turkey has been informed from various quarters that there is a prospect of it becoming a full member of the European Union if it satisfies all the conditions laid down in Copenhagen for all applicants to EU membership. In particular, these conditions relate to standards of democratisation and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussions on improving citizenship rights in Germany – to turn for a moment to the domestic politics of my own country – have also led to a considerable improvement in the terms of our dialogue with Turkey, which is one of the most crucial prerequisites if we assume that the problems of refugees and asylum‐seekers must be resolved in the country where their causes lie. In that respect our German discussions on reviewing citizenship rights fulfil an important function. I hope Turkey will grasp the opportunity inherent in the present situation and that by resolving the Kurdish problem on the basis of democracy, human rights and minority rights Turkey will itself move a step closer to Europe.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van den Broek, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (NL)</span> Time is short, Mr President, so I will be brief and simply echo what has been said by the presidency and emphasise that the Commission naturally endorses in every respect the statement adopted last Monday by the Council. That once again condemns acts of terror in the most explicit terms, but it applies not only to measures which Turkey takes against extremists when they break the law but also to acts perpetrated by the Kurds, of the kind we have regrettably seen subsequent to Mr Öcalan"s detention and removal to Turkey. Secondly, and equally, there is a reaffirmation of the territorial integrity of Turkey, which should not be an issue in this whole debate. We also want to see Turkey abiding by the agreements it has signed, allowing a fair and independent trial and respecting the rights of the accused to defend himself. We expressly urge Turkey to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we urge too that there should be no let‐up in resistance to terrorist activity, and we must of course support Turkey in this. We do not accept terrorism in our own countries either, but we should not leave it at that, and should look afresh at ways of finding a political, non‐violent solution to what has come to be known as the Kurdish question. Recognition that this question exists is the first step towards a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with the Council that it is not right simply and solely to criticise Turkey. On the question of upholding human rights, neither the Council nor the Commission has pulled its punches in criticising Turkey. But the Kurdish question as such is of course enormously complex and complicated, with broad repercussions in all directions. And with that in mind, I would remind your President and the House of earlier proposals which the European Commission made in an attempt to help improve the situation in the south‐east of Turkey, in particular the social and economic underdevelopment there, by means of MEDA programmes aimed specifically at that region, knowing as we do that areas of social underdevelopment are usually a fertile breeding‐ground for terror. The Kurdish question is not intrinsically an economic one, of course, but economic factors have to be considered alongside political action to find a lasting solution to the Kurdish community"s legitimate claims to respect for their cultural identity and their minority rights.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><img src="/doceo/data/img/hr.gif" width="100%" height="1" alt="" /></td><td align="right" width="16"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="buttondocwin"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><a href="#top" title="Top"><img src="/doceo/data/img/navi_top.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0" alt="" /></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></table>
<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Green </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, until today whenever we have raised the Kurdish question, the response from Turkey was that, firstly, it is an internal matter and, secondly, it is a question of terrorism. The events of the last days and months, and in particular, the recent demonstrations in Europe have proved that it is an international question with important implications for European peace, stability and security.</p>
<p class="contents">My group believes and has stated on many occasions that terrorism is a symptom of problems and that terrorism can only be tackled if the causes which nourish it are eliminated. Just as in Northern Ireland, Bloody Sunday created a ready‐made recruiting ground for the IRA, the destruction of villages in the south‐east of Turkey and the impact of the state of emergency on civilians have only served to strengthen terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">In my constituency in North London live many thousands of Kurdish refugees, mainly from Turkey. Anyone like me who has spent time listening and talking to those people cannot doubt their despair or their passionate desire for peace, and their genuine desire to exercise their culture, language and tradition as Kurds. Those of you who watched your TV screens last week will have seen a 15‐year‐old Kurdish girl set herself on fire in London. That young girl lives in my constituency in Wood Green. She and her family live as refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to reject any suggestion that those people, who we all saw demonstrating last week, were nothing but a bunch of terrorists.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">This is simply not true. Of course, amongst those demonstrators were those who support terrorist activity and we all actively condemn them. But the majority were people as concerned for peace as you and I. That is why my group would now make an appeal to Turkey to recognise that this moment represents a chance for the Turkish authorities and political parties. The arrest and forthcoming trial of Mr Öcalan provide an opportunity to demonstrate that even in the most sensitive of trials, Turkey's judiciary can act in a fair and transparent manner, fulfilling its international obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">People ask if we have a right to even ask that question. Of course we do. I have spoken to Turkish ministers who have told me that there are extrajudicial murders in Turkey and torture in prisons. So of course we have the right to state those demands.</p>
<p class="contents">However, a bigger opportunity exists. Turkey could now move to address the legitimate grievances of its Kurdish citizens. I welcome the Council's statement in that context. It could reform the political system to allow the Kurdish minority to express itself within the political system. It could move to address the stark economic inequalities between the south‐east and the rest of the country. It could ensure that Kurds in Turkey enjoy the right to have their children educated in their own language. As we approach elections in Turkey it could put an end to the harassment of HADEP and give them the chance to participate on an equal footing with Turkey's other parties.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">These are the steps which would convince us that Turkey is serious about its application to join the EU. These are the steps which would immediately promote stability and security both for Turkey and the European Union and would receive the most enormous support from this House.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Oostlander </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> <span class="italic">‐ (NL)</span> Mr President, everyone of course, including the press, is saying very clearly just now that there must be a fair and public trial for Mr Öcalan; even for someone who will probably be found guilty of manifest acts of terrorism; even for someone who has not shrunk from acts of violence, a kind of action with which we have never had the slightest sympathy, any more than we like the brutal repression exercised by the Turkish army in the south‐east of the country. Öcalan has to have a fair, just and public trial, and not just because of our concept of the values of the European Union, and because otherwise Turkey cannot aspire to become a member, since it would of course be strange to hold a fair and public trial for those reasons alone. And in any case, we have quite a few other political problems to resolve over our relations with Turkey before there can be any question of its joining the Union. I am surprised by the reactions we hear along these lines, sometimes from the foreign ministers too, the Dutch minister amongst them.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Union must realise that this trial is symptomatic of a deeper problem, a problem which is relevant to us all, since there are so many Turks and Turks of Kurdish descent living in the European Union. Year after year, generation after generation, they have become used to democracy and the rule of law, and many of them would be willing to hold talks, would really like to enter into a dialogue. I would urge those who speak for the Union, and the Council and Commission, to support the people in our Union, Kurds and Turks, who would be willing to engage in a dialogue from here, from inside the Union, in order to help Turkey to resolve its minorities problem, because these people are moderates who might succeed in finding a solution here. Mr Öcalan"s arrest prompted more than just violence. We unreservedly condemn that violence, but there were also demonstrations, including ones in Amsterdam at the end of last week, which were very dignified and in which the Kurds showed that their numbers include a moderate and democratic community of people. We ought to listen to them.</p>
<p class="contents">I think Turkey must now make use of this development and show generosity – generosity in resolving the problem of the Kurds. I think we all want a state which is seeking membership of the European Union to give proper heed to this minority issue. It can be resolved without disturbing the territorial integrity of Turkey. I think we all agree with the President‐in‐Office that you have to make a distinction between self‐determination and the justification for separatism. Self‐determination is possible when you live in a democracy where the rule of law applies. Turkey needs to seize the opportunity of moving resolutely in that direction.</p>

Firstly, we have here the man who is the tough leader of a terrorist organisation, the PKK. This House has never expressed the slightest support for the actions of this man and his PKK, however tragic and hopeless the fate of the Kurds might have seemed. But we are pressing for a public trial before a civil court. If Turkey seriously wants to join the Union, it goes without saying that it must show itself to be a state truly based on the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the arrest of Mr Öcalan once again puts the tragic fate of the Kurds on the political agenda. I would refer the House to a report by my former colleague, the Italian Liberal Mr Gawronski, which was adopted seven years ago in this House by a very large majority and which examines ways in which Parliament, the Commission and the Council might place the Kurdish question on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">This, as you know, is a people numbering 25 million souls, whose existence is not recognised. They were the victims, it is said, of internal discord, and they were scattered over seven countries, but above all they were denied a national identity by the international community at the beginning of the 1920s, when France and the United Kingdom were still world powers. The PKK is not the same thing as the Kurds. This radical movement speaks for only a fraction of them. There are many organisations among the Kurds which do respect the rules of democracy. The Turkish Government is wrong to ban all these organisations, and Mr Oostlander touched on this. In so doing, it alienates the forces of democracy and encourages the Kurds to be more radical, closing the door to possible solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">What can our Union do? The Union must continue to promote democratisation and the rights of Turkey, and we must send observers, yes, of course. The Union must press Turkey to respect the rights of its citizens and minorities. Its citizens must have the right to their own language and culture. Democratic parties, such as HADEP, must be given their rights too. When are all these Kurdish members of parliament, currently held in detention, going to be released?</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey must move forward with the social and economic development of south‐eastern Turkey. I have a whole list of other things it must do. Without meaning to, Turkey has indeed put the Kurdish question on the agenda. Perhaps, Mr President‐in‐Office, Commissioner, we too can put something on the agenda. We must have a common position on the Öcalan case. We did not have this before. As a Union and as Member States we should have determined our responsibilities, had our contingency plans ready, for a problem which has been in existence now for 20, 30 or 40 years.</p>

No other outcome for any other nation has occurred in history.</p>
<p class="contents">I am now seeing an attempt, especially among the representatives of the Council and the Commission, to turn the issue on its head. Mr Öcalan must have a just and fair trial. Yet the two representatives, especially the President‐in‐Office, have appeared here today in the role of a judicial committee in order to protect Turkey. He has said that Mr Öcalan lacks credibility and that he is unworthy of representing the Kurdish nation and therefore should be branded as a terrorist. What else? You invoke rights and agreements, yet you have dishonoured them. You ground them underfoot when, for three months, you failed to do anything to prevent him from being handed over to the American and Turkish secret services and now to the military rule of the torturers.</p>
<p class="contents">You do not have the right to invoke those rights and agreements. You are doing what you are doing so as not to lose a fistful of dollars invested in Turkey, so as not to displease the great boss on the other side of the Atlantic who baptised Mr Öcalan – along with all the others who are fighting for their people – as a terrorist. You, your fathers, your brothers and sisters, fought against the Nazi invader and you were called terrorists and were executed. The same happened with Mr Mandela and Mr Arafat, who is now officially welcomed and about to be received in this House. The same will happen with Mr Öcalan or with any other person who takes his place. You cannot turn back the tide of history!</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to say that this issue is not just about Mr Öcalan. At this very moment, three young Kurdish women are being held in an embassy in Nairobi. They are in danger of being captured at any time by the American secret services and by who knows what other mysterious forces, and of suffering the same fate as Mr Öcalan. A special paragraph, a special intervention, is needed in the resolution. I hope the representatives of the Council and the Commission will give assurances that these young women, who have Belgian and Greek nationality ...</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Pasty </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after years of guerrilla fighting and repression against the perpetrators of terrorist attacks, resulting in thousands of deaths, Turkey has now managed to arrest the main instigator of this violence, the leader of the PKK, Abdullah Öcalan. Our aim must not be to criticise, which is easily done when not personally involved in a conflict, but to try and highlight the positive aspects of the new situation caused by Öcalan"s arrest, in order to promote peace in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">For more than two decades, the only means of expression open to the Kurdish people living in Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria has been violence. Clearly, we condemn all forms of terrorism and all acts of violence, which are never helpful to a cause. However, now that the leader of the main organisation responsible for these attacks is in prison, an urgent solution must be found to the problem which this population of thirty million presents. The last twenty years of guerrilla war have obscured the cultural, linguistic and humanitarian rights of these people. The international community"s role should now be to work for a peaceful diplomatic solution which gives the Kurdish people the right to a certain degree of autonomy within the current borders of the four countries involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Öcalan"s arrest must also be used to highlight the fact that the PKK is not the only representative of the Kurdish community. It is our duty, in this respect, to stress to the Turkish authorities that the whole Kurdish community should not be held responsible for the actions of Öcalan, who has taken it upon himself to act as spokesman for all the Kurds. We must also insist that the Turkish authorities should ensure that the trial is conducted in such a way that the international community and also the Kurds themselves can assess the true merit of the reasons for his arrest and imprisonment.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point concerns the violence which has occurred in Europe and the hostage‐taking at various embassies by Kurds demonstrating against the arrest of their leader. Whereas these violent actions were clearly very well organised, it is apparent that the European Union was totally disorganised. This should act as an incentive for us to strengthen links between our respective police services in terms of exchanging information so that we can crack down on international terrorism in our countries.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Aelvoet </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> <span class="italic">‐ (NL)</span> Mr President, the Abdullah Öcalan affair started badly last November and it has continued badly. The countries of the European Union were agreed that Mr Öcalan should not be handed over to Turkey, but they did not give any answer to the question of where he should stay. No one, not one country either individually or as part of a group, offered him political asylum. That of course was the other side of the coin. If you state one part of your position, you have to state the rest of it as well. Europe did not do that.</p>
<p class="contents">In Turkey itself, despite the many triumphalist pronouncements made there, we now see the dawning realisation that Öcalan"s arrest has not resolved the Kurdish question. The question now is whether Europe can take any action which is politically relevant. It is true that the Kurdish problem is a political problem, an international one, but also that it is primarily an international problem arising within Europe. We do not have the feeling that the measures taken by the United States took account of the implications for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that what Europe can do in specific terms is, firstly, to continue exerting pressure on the way in which the trial is conducted. We see that the criticisms to date have already had some degree of success, in that Turkey is beginning to soften a little on the fact that the case is to be heard by a state security court, where normal independent jurisprudence does not usually apply, by starting to take some limited measures to appoint only civilian prosecutors and so on. We must persist in consistently attacking the idea of a military court. And we must send a delegation from the Union, with doctors, lawyers and people well versed in human rights issues, to ensure that Öcalan gets a fair trial and is kept in a decent state of health.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we think it is crucial that in the run‐up to the elections there should be room for democratic Kurdish voices to be heard. HADEP currently has great difficulties in this regard, and we need to make it clear that, in a normal and fair electoral process, all parties must be free to take part without impediment. That is not the case at present. The European Parliament should take an initiative here, and it can do that very well by sending a delegation. It is only in a democratic Turkey, a democratised Turkey, that a solution to the Kurdish question can be found.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Dell"Alba </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, in my opinion this House is too fond of giving lectures as an easy way of salving its conscience. We will once again be voting tomorrow to denounce the grave threat to the life of Abdullah Öcalan. We will also rightly be demanding a political solution to the Kurdish question.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, we should also take this opportunity to examine our own consciences, which we have not done either in this resolution or even in this discussion. Öcalan"s friends who have tried to support the PKK leader"s cause and who have actually, I believe, speeded his downfall should also examine their consciences with regard to the attitudes that we have been led to adopt in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">A country which should have requested Öcalan"s extradition did not do so. The very least we can say is that Italy hesitated too long instead of choosing the only route which might have prevented what happened subsequently. Öcalan is in Turkey, yet everyone said this was the last place he should go. Italy should perhaps have shouldered our responsibility for us, given that neither Germany nor the European Union managed to find the political solution needed, perhaps by strengthening the Schengen procedure and the asylum procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, Italy should have accepted the rules of the terrorism convention and shouldered its responsibilities by judging Öcalan itself. This has not happened and I believe that Europe must acknowledge that it was at fault in order to act as a lesson for the future. Without political union, such cases are likely to occur again, and the Union"s reputation is hardly enhanced by them.</p>

Turkey is oppressing the Kurdish people, and I have no confidence that Mr Öcalan will get proper justice. I believe that even now he is being tortured. I have never known of anything else in the course of my work with political prisoners in Turkey. Once I was with a group of politicians drawn from most Western European countries who accompanied two exiled politicians to Ankara. We were to be their shield. As soon as we arrived at the airport, they were arrested and sent directly for interrogation and torture. We tried to visit them in prison but were not allowed in. In the entrance hall I saw two boys of the same ages as my own children – 8 and 11 – in handcuffs with their hands behind their backs. How can adult human beings treat children as criminals before they have even reached puberty? When we visited Ankara for the second time during the trial, I delivered a personal letter from the President of Parliament, Lord Plumb, to the two detainees. In that way I was able to get through the barrier and talk to them. They told of serious torture. The worst was not the cigarette burns or electric shocks. The worst was that they were woken every time they fell asleep for fresh interrogation and torture. The European countries must tell Turkey once and for all that torture is a crime against humanity. It is not possible to have normal relations with Turkey as long as it continues to torture and as long as it continues to oppress the Kurdish people. May I propose that we send members of our Turkey delegation to take turns in attending the trial as observers?</p>

Firstly, the Kurdish minorities in Turkey, Iraq and Iran are entitled to recognition of their identity, specific character and aspirations to large‐scale autonomy; secondly, the PKK is neither the sole nor the largest party capable of representing these aspirations; thirdly, in its struggle the PKK has resorted to outright terrorism and deployed the most unscrupulous methods of funding itself, including drug trafficking; and fourthly, the Europe of left‐wing Socialist governments has proved unable to handle the Öcalan case in a united and coherent way.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, a summary trial by Turkey without any guarantees is unacceptable; we call for the trial to be conducted with respect for the rights of the accused, rather than under threat of the death penalty. It is equally unacceptable for our cities to become the scene of clashes and gratuitous violence on the part of those who are allowed entry for humanitarian reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would refer to the extremely serious statements made by the President‐in‐Office. It would indeed be a cause for concern if a Member State such as Greece really had been supporting the PKK – more or less indirectly – on the grounds of a deep‐seated and, these days, incomprehensible antagonism towards the Turkish people.</p>

Yes, this inability is there and it is a scandal how it has been demonstrated in the last few months. But what annoys me especially and what is particularly scandalous is that even after Öcalan ended up in Turkey – against his will – a statement was issued that is not worth the paper it is written on, for it does not once mention the Kurdish problem or the Kurdish situation. It refers to problems that need to be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, you are not specifically responsible for that document. You have spoken out quite clearly here. You did not treat the PKK gently, but at least you spoke clearly and unequivocally. I would like to see the foreign ministers or the Council get round to speaking unequivocally instead of producing documents that merely reflect their inability to reach a common position.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are also dealing here with the Öcalan case and not just with the Kurdish question in general, and Pauline Green very clearly described our position in regard to achieving a peaceful political solution. We regard Öcalan neither as a great hero nor as a particularly nice man, but like many others he deserves fair treatment, treatment that respects his health, treatment that is fair, decent, public and transparent, treatment that allows him to be visited by lawyers, whom we hope he really can choose freely. That is why we are also discussing Öcalan, because he has become a symbol, a symbol for many other proceedings in Turkey which unfortunately go unnoticed and which are unfair, untransparent and make a mockery of the constitutional state. For Turkey it is not just a question of humanity, it is also a question of political wisdom that it conducts at least these proceedings in an objective, fair and public manner.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on Turkey – and will not cease to do so – to change its approach and seek a political solution to the problem, to take a political approach to the problem of the Kurds and the rights of the Kurds – and here I entirely agree with what you said on the matter. If it takes that approach, then Turkey can be sure that every Member of this Parliament will try to convince the Kurds that they too must make their contribution towards a peaceful, political solution. It takes two sides, it takes Turkey and it takes the Kurdish organisations, who must do their utmost to achieve a peaceful settlement. But we in this Parliament will not cease to support a peaceful solution to a question that can only be resolved by peaceful, political means.</p>

We should have learnt as much from the Arafat precedent! In other words, just as the name Arafat was and is connected with the Palestinian question, so the Öcalan case raises the unresolved problem of the Kurdish people.</p>
<p class="contents">Like it or not, this should be Turkey's starting‐point in tackling what is a domestic problem, by granting autonomy to the Kurds and fulfilling one of the conditions that will enable it to make a dignified entry into Europe at some date in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">And yet the events since Öcalan's illegal arrest do not give us much cause for hope. When a prisoner is shown off – proudly – in the conditions in which Öcalan was shown, every human right in the book is being flouted. When lawyers find it difficult even to meet with their client, it is doubtful that the procedural rules are being observed. When a special tribunal is appointed, one of whose members is a colonel, one has the impression that the rule of law is no longer a valid concept. And finally, when the shadow of the gallows looms over the outcome of the trial, Turkey should be informed of Europe's views, for the sake both of Turkey and of Europe itself.</p>

Of course we must call emphatically on Turkey to observe the European Convention on Human Rights. Similarly, we must condemn the death penalty worldwide.</p>
<p class="contents">But over and above day‐to‐day politics, we should use the Öcalan case as an opportunity to take long‐term measures, to develop an active European peace policy; but that also means imposing the appropriate sanctions on countries that systematically violate human rights. Human rights and the right of the people to self‐determination must take precedence over economic interests. Unfortunately, at present the reverse is true.

Let me quote a Turkish newspaper, the Turkish paper <span class="italic">Radical</span> which praised this text as being ‘<span class="italic">rédigé avec finesse et précaution</span> " – carefully and delicately worded. So in other words it is an exceptionally hypocritical text. I agree with the Council that the problems in Turkey must be solved by political means. I welcome the Council"s statement that ‘... all genuine efforts to separate the fight against terrorism from the search for political solutions ..." must be made, but my problem is that the Council does not say that efforts of that kind are conspicuous by their absence at the moment in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">Mention was made of the HADEP trial before a state security court, a trial which significantly is being held before the elections, to be concluded after the elections, so that voters know that they risk voting for the wrong party if it has just been banned. The number of intellectuals sentenced or still before the state security courts for doing precisely what the Council wants to see happening in Turkey is alarmingly high. There is not a word about this in the whole of the Council document. That is what I regret most.</p>
<p class="contents">A word or two on what Commissioner van den Broek said just now about aid to south‐eastern Turkey. I agree with him. But I think it has so far been extremely difficult to give aid to an area where two parties are engaged in military confrontation. Aid is then always aid to one side which gets used against the other. The situation at the moment is somewhat clearer, in that the PKK really has been pushed back quite a bit by the army, so that rather more can be done in the region. But the Commissioner might also have said that the European Union, with Parliament"s backing, is currently addressing this, and that we have initiated some fairly sizeable health and vocational training projects aimed at that region. The problem remains, though, that the Turks have still not signed the cooperation agreement and therefore cannot currently accept this aid because the financial basis is not yet there, and that is their fault.</p>
<p class="contents">One more small point. I think it is essential for the Commission to support the NGOs in Turkey in order to bring about the civil society, the democracy and the human rights we need there. I think it is quite dreadful that the Commission, by insisting that the NGOs provide financial guarantees, sums which they do not have, has currently brought these kinds of programmes to a complete halt. Urgent action needs to be taken on that, and very soon.</p>

I find that the opinion delivered by the Committee on External Economic Affairs, Security and Defence Policy of 17 February does not do so, for in my view there is no doubt that the European Parliament must condemn the PKK"s terrorism most emphatically. We must also very strongly condemn the acts of violence committed by PKK fighters throughout Europe. So we call on all the states to take consistent action to combat this use of force and terrorism, as they keep declaring they will do.</p>
<p class="contents">Some EU Member States have not covered themselves in glory in recent years when it came to Öcalan and the PKK. Let me tell the state minister, Mr Volmer, that these states include Germany, not just Greece. I can only repeat what we said at our delegation meeting in Istanbul, as President Dankert noted: for Turkey, this arrest is a total success, given the attitude of the European states. The result is clear to see: acts of violence throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be clear about a number of things. One: Mr Öcalan deserves a fair trial, has a right to a fair trial. Two: Turkey must also guarantee an independent judiciary. Three: independent observers must be admitted. Four: if Mr Öcalan is, as expected, condemned to death, Turkey must allow him to live. Five: although we totally condemn the PKK"s acts of terrorism, Turkey itself must take steps to find political solutions to the Kurdish problems. Six: Turkey would be sending out a clear signal if it allowed the Kurdish party – which obtained 4.6 % of votes last time – to participate in the elections on 18 April. That is another demand that is not set out in the statement!</p>

Government propaganda, secret services, mutually opposed organisations, as well as a multiplicity of interests, have whipped up and continue to feed public opinion in Europe, thereby diverting it away from the responsibilities of the European Union. Amid all this confusion, we are overlooking the simple and universal principles which must be observed.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the civilised world abhors terrorism and condemns it whatever its aims. The end can never justify the means. Secondly, however, until guilt can be proven beyond the shadow of a doubt, everyone must be protected so that they can defend themselves. It is a sad fact that in Europe, the birthplace of these principles, their implementation was not called for. All those responsible tried, each for their own reasons, to rid themselves of the Öcalan problem. Germany could have tried him, since it acknowledges that he was the leader of a terrorist organisation in Germany. Instead, Mr Öcalan finds himself on trial in a country where there is not the slightest guarantee that he will get a fair trial. And now we are uttering vain wishes that Turkey will hold a fair trial, when just the other day the Council of Europe decision was issued regarding the tortures that are taking place there.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I very much regret that Europe will have to apologise, not to the terrorist organisation, the PKK, but to the blood‐soaked Kurdish nation, which has been persecuted by Turkey for 60 years.</p>

Many of us are nevertheless aware that what has happened is the natural outcome of many years of war, death and destruction throughout which Mr Öcalan has led the Kurdish Workers" Party. Those who resort to violence regularly must be aware of the danger of having it turned against themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent events are certainly regrettable inasmuch as they cast a shadow over Europe"s handling of matters of public order. We must hope for a solution to the Kurdish problem and continue to call for such a solution. The natural right of the Kurdish people to express themselves in their own language must be recognised together with their right to their own culture and way of life. Such recognition should not, however, jeopardise the stability of old European nations. Turkey is undoubtedly one such nation as although it is not part of the European Union, it is certainly an important member of the Council of Europe and of other European bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore appeal to all sides to remain calm. We must urge the Kurdish Workers" Party not to spearhead more violence nor to resort to the shows of force which have endangered their leader"s position. Let us hope that justice will prevail and that the legitimate rights of the Kurdish people will be recognised both within Turkey and in neighbouring countries.</p>

I get the impression from this debate that there is very far‐reaching agreement on some points, which I would like briefly to summarise again.</p>
<p class="contents">One: we very definitely condemn all use of force or terrorism. In any case the EU ministers of the interior will be meeting to discuss this question in the next few days.</p>
<p class="contents">Two: we must recognise politically that the Kurdish question does exist. The Kurdish question must not be suppressed any longer.</p>
<p class="contents">Three: we must distinguish clearly between the PKK and the Kurds. Only a minority of Kurds commit acts of violence. The majority of Kurds are peace‐loving people, as we all are, and simply want to live in peace and security.</p>
<p class="contents">Four: the Kurdish question is no longer a domestic Turkish matter, for the violence on our streets shows that it affects every European country.</p>
<p class="contents">Five: drawing a distinction between separatism and cultural autonomy can be a key to progress in resolving this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Six: we agree that we must call on Turkey to conduct a trial that is in accordance with the law and that we reject the death penalty on principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me add that a troika mission of political directors will be visiting Turkey before April, followed by a troika mission at foreign minister level. We will use these opportunities to hold talks with Turkey, drawing on the discussion we have held here and on the points I have just addressed.</p>
