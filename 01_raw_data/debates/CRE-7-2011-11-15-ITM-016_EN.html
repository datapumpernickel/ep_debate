Through the regularity and quality of its work, the Assembly has succeeded in establishing itself as a key player in North-South cooperation. We want EU-ACP cooperation to be a partnership, and in the Assembly this is, in fact, the case. The parliamentarians from the ACP countries are our partners.</p>
<p class="contents">The Joint Parliamentary Assembly met twice in 2010. The 19th session was held in Tenerife in April, and the 20th plenary session was held in Kinshasa from 30 November to 3 December. Nine resolutions and the Declaration on the Second revision of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement were adopted. One regional meeting was also held during the year, in the Seychelles. Lastly, in 2010, the Working Group on the Working Methods of the Assembly, established in order to enhance the Assembly’s political role as well as to provide for improvements in efficiency, began its work. The Commissioner with responsibility for development, Mr Piebalgs, who is present here today, took part in the work of the Assembly. The Co-Presidents of the ACP-EU Council also attended the first session, but only the ACP Council was represented in Kinshasa. The absence of the European Union Council for Question Time was acutely felt, and the Assembly agreed to communicate its regret over this matter to the High Representative, Ms Ashton, urging her to ensure that this was remedied for future sessions. I am pleased this matter has been resolved and that Ms Ashton has agreed that at the next session, which is in fact taking place in Lomé in a week’s time, the Council will be represented by Mr Stanowski.</p>
<p class="contents">The Assembly’s standing committees met four times: twice alongside the plenary sessions, and twice between sessions in Brussels. As you know, the committees’ main role is to draw up reports which are subsequently adopted at the plenary sessions. Moreover, the committees are responsible for following up resolutions by hearing the Commission officials with responsibility in the relevant areas. This also provides an opportunity for in-depth dialogue on the action taken on resolutions which have been adopted. The Committee on Economic Affairs, Finance and Trade was entrusted with an additional responsibility, that of scrutiny of the regional strategy papers for the different ACP regions. The Committee appointed co-rapporteurs for each regional strategy paper, the conclusions of which were adopted in the session in Tenerife.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission subjects country and regional strategy papers to parliamentary scrutiny by both the European Parliament and the ACP countries’ national parliaments. It is important for the Committee on Development and the Joint Parliamentary Assembly to monitor the situation and ensure that effective use is made of this means of parliamentary scrutiny.</p>
<p class="contents">The Assembly also plays a key role in monitoring the negotiations on Economic Partnership Agreements. Hearings of the head negotiators on both sides, meetings with economic and social players and interaction between European and southern parliamentarians have helped to make the process more transparent and have made it easier to take local issues into account.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2010, the European Commission and the ACP countries negotiated proposals for the second revision of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement. The revision provides for an enhanced role for the Joint Parliamentary Assembly in the scrutiny of other institutions as well as for the regionalisation of the ACP group being brought about by the Economic Partnership Agreement process. It is important for the Joint Parliamentary Assembly to monitor these developments extremely closely, because the future of the Assembly itself is going to depend on their results. I have tried to include these matters in my report. Thank you very much. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Andris Piebalgs, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, first of all, let me congratulate Mr Filip Kaczmarek on his excellent report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2010. As the honourable Members will know, attending JPA meetings has been a top priority for me since my appointment as Commissioner for Development, and it will remain so.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the EU co-Chair, Louis Michel, for his tireless efforts to enhance the leading role that the JPA has to play in nurturing and developing a truly democratic dialogue between the representatives of the European Union and ACP Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that strengthening the political nature of the JPA and its oversight functions – as reflected in the second revision of the Cotonou Agreement signed in Ouagadougou in 2010 – is of paramount importance. Not only will it ensure that the agreement functions democratically, more importantly; it will also usher in a new and more effective interaction between the joint institutions, namely, the Joint Council and the Joint Parliamentary Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">With the entry into force of the second revision, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly will be fully able to exercise its powers of democratic scrutiny by discussing and commenting on the ACP-EU Council of Ministers’ annual report on implementation of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, with the economic partnership agreements and other trading arrangements, the European Development Fund and strategy papers included as subjects for discussion, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly now enjoys greater parliamentary oversight functions. On this point, I would like to thank Parliament for acknowledging that, in sending the draft country and regional strategy papers to the JPA, the Commission had fulfilled its promises.</p>
<p class="contents">The improvements brought about with the revision of the Cotonou Agreement do not end there. I believe that developing the national parliamentary dimension, an aspect emphasised in your report, will help promote the broader and more inclusive partnership we seek. It is certainly a move that the Commission welcomes, in line with its policy to foster country ownership and democratic governance. The Commission encourages and supports efforts by partner countries to build up parliamentary oversight capacities so that the use of public funds is subject to proper supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">An assessment of European Commission support to parliaments in the ACP region during the past decade found that it amounted to just over EUR 100 million, spread across some 30 countries, most of them in Africa. While our initial efforts focused mainly on law making, recent support has increasingly addressed parliaments’ oversight duties. Building on that assessment, we have now completed the reference document entitled ‘Engaging and Supporting Parliaments Worldwide: EC Strategies and Methodologies for Action to Support Parliaments’.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with our already healthy collaboration with Parliament’s Office for Promotion of Parliamentary Democracy, this document will help the Commission both achieve more with the parliamentary support it offers and contribute to fulfilling its policy commitments in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the role of national parliaments is even more important in the countries where budget support is used. The Commission audit publishes on our website the exact amount each country receives in budget support.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind Members of this House that the Commission is rated as one of the most transparent organisations in the world. Furthermore, there is a wide range of reporting covering budget support issues, such as the Annual Report on External Assistance, country <span class="italic">fiches</span> on budget support sent to Member States and the European Parliament, country evaluations and, in ACP countries, the joint annual reports on the implementation of the country strategy papers.</p>
<p class="contents">On 13 October 2011, the Commission adopted a communication on the future approach of EU budget support to third countries. This revised budget support policy highlights the need to link budget support to the fundamental values of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, and to bolster the assessment of eligibility criteria. It also seeks greater transparency by ensuring that this becomes one of the eligibility criteria in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard too, the Commission is eager to take up the excellent suggestion contained in Mr Kaczmarek’s report and develop closer relations with the national parliaments when asked to do so, naturally while fully respecting the national sovereignty of each ACP country.</p>
<p class="contents">As for procedure, the Commission recently presented a proposal to the Council to conclude the agreement on this second revision of the Cotonou Agreement and to start the ratification process at EU level. We hope that Parliament will give a favourable opinion to the Council on this so that provisional application can begin at the earliest opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every year, we send hundreds of millions of euro to our partners in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. There are experts to see that this work is effective and sufficient, and that it has sensible structures and rules. They draw up reports, background documents, assessments and recommendations. Europe acts on the basis of these documents.</p>
<p class="contents">The significance of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, however, is a different matter – creating space for personal meetings between the elected representatives of parliaments, as well as an opportunity to discuss problems at this level. The joint discussions on problem topics enable us to understand one another, get down to the essential details that are not to be found in any report, and explain positions that would otherwise often remain misunderstood.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cotonou Agreement is vital for cooperation between Europe and the African, Caribbean and Pacific states. The Joint Parliamentary Assembly plays an irreplaceable role in fulfilling this agreement – if only by adding a genuine human dimension to the numbers and tables on amounts of development aid.

<p class="contents">Congratulations to the rapporteur because the report takes an integrated approach on the cooperation between the EU and the ACP countries. The JPA has played an important role in monitoring the negotiations on, in particular, economic partnership agreements. The report quite rightly calls on parliaments to exercise close parliamentary scrutiny of the European Development Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the EU Council was absent from the 20th session in Kinshasa, and that sent entirely the wrong message. So I hope that it will be present in Togo for the 22nd session at the end of the week: this would send the right message to ACP states. However, I regret that such issues as mass sexual violence, notably in DR Congo, are often only touched upon in order not to have a thorough debate. The JPA should be a platform to embrace such issues and get them on the table in a frank and robust discussion, especially as the debate could have happened in Kinshasa.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the Cotonou Agreement which Parliament is asked to ratify. However, the explicit refusal by the ACP in particular to include all grounds of discrimination and the principle of non-discrimination will make it extremely difficult for me to recommend to this House to agree the proposed Cotonou text. Let us be open and transparent on this issue. There is only one ground which is a cause of dissent between the EU and the ACP states, and it is non-discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="contents">Debates that we have had at the JPA level have been heated, often misinformed, and clearly mark a dividing line between us. But I want to send congratulations to the co-chair, Louis Michel, for his courage and his commitment to human rights and equally to others who have the courage to speak out in the JPA. The report insists that the principle of non-discrimination, including on the basis of sexual orientation, will not be compromised in the ACP-EU partnership. The EU will stand up for these values and will not back down.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me state the obvious: universal values declared at the UN must apply universally. Human rights conventions are not an <span class="italic">à la carte</span> menu; they define civilised societies. It is for that reason that we will defend what we believe is the principle of the universality and indivisibility of human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Charles Goerens, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the ALDE Group.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Madam President, the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly can be interpreted in both a positive and a negative way.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us start with the negative way, because I always like to end on a high. Overall, the responsibility of both African and European parliamentarians remains very limited, first and foremost, in the way the partnership is funded. Indeed, the European Development Fund does not come under the European Parliament’s budgetary prerogatives and with respect to the allocation of funds from the European Development Fund to African countries, there is every reason to believe that parliamentary supervision and the involvement of African parliaments in their country’s budgetary affairs leave a lot to be desired.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, considering the low level of commitment of many African parliaments in their country’s budgetary affairs, the ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly looks more like a club of people who talk a lot but have nothing to say.</p>
<p class="contents">As Vice-President of this Assembly, I have to say that I am not always very proud to be part of a Bureau of an Assembly made up of people who are given budgetary powers, especially in small doses. Every balanced political system has checks and balances. This state of affairs cannot go on. This anomaly cannot be made to last. The second reason for my negative interpretation is the Council’s insufficient – and the term is much too weak to describe what I feel on this matter – involvement in the Assembly debates. Last year, during our meeting in Kinshasa, the Council was absent. It was not represented at ministerial level; the European party should be ashamed of itself. This situation is totally grotesque. Who are they trying to kid? Who stopped the Union’s Presidency from sending someone to represent the Council’s position on the EU-ACP partnership? Let us remember that it is the Council that gives the Commission the mandate to manage the funds of the European Development Fund. It is the Council that has the power to approve the broad outlines of this policy. This situation, too, is unhealthy and cannot continue.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish on a slightly more positive interpretation. I believe that this more positive interpretation is materialised by the role of political driving force that our Assembly plays. This Assembly is vested with a power of political impetus, it is fair to say. The work is organised in such a way that information circulates on the main themes of EU-ACP cooperation. That is all very well, but for political impetus to bring to bear in the long term, those who can facilitate this work through their debates need to have a certain amount of power. A guard dog with no teeth will end up not being perceived as a guard dog any more. We have to be aware of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Another reason for my slightly more positive interpretation is that the Assembly is an interesting platform for exchanges and I believe Mr Cashman has just referred to that. Even the most sensitive issues can be discussed there. These are issues on social debates that are uncomfortable. All the subjects that relate to minority rights can be uncomfortable, but the EU-ACP Parliamentary Assembly knows no taboo and here, too, I would like to pay tribute to Louis Michel, our Assembly’s Vice-President, who has made sure that no aspect of these issues has been overlooked.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am also keen to congratulate Mr Kaczmarek, who found more positive elements than I did in his report. That shows how much research work he has done. I should like to encourage him to persevere along these lines. It could have an even more positive influence on the future speeches that I will be called on to make in this context. Thus, by way of conclusion, let us highlight that things are far from being perfect. Consequently, there is room for improvement. I hope that outside the European Parliament, other institutional players are also aware of what I have just said and we need everyone to be involved if things are to improve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is only a small number of us to discuss what is, after all, an Assembly that deals with issues of great importance that affect a large population and a region of the world that is paying an extremely high price, which, in the end, serves to reveal all the issues that we are raising today, be it climate change or issues around energy, finance and democracy. It is probably this part of the world, the African continent and the countries of the Caribbean and Pacific, that faces these issues most acutely. The parliamentarians who are here, who are doubtless those who are the most interested in being part of the ACP–EU Joint Assembly and maybe also the Committee on Development for some of us, or in other parliamentary committees, show to what extent we can be isolated when working on such an important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">To echo the words of Mr Goerens, is the Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) a club with a few well-meaning friends of Africa who chat in the sunshine while taking a bit of Malarone and anti-malarial medicine before leaving, or is it a genuine instrument?</p>
<p class="contents">On this point, I agree with him: probably a bit of both. A bit of both, because I think that this Assembly is both a remarkable sounding board, a unique and invaluable place of debate, meeting and dialogue – and I am grateful to the rapporteur for having highlighted these extremely positive aspects – but, at the same time, we must, at all costs, strengthen the power and levers of a parliamentary assembly, not only for the budget, but on other aspects too.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall take an example that is close to my heart, for which I had already put forward proposals in the context of the reform of the JPA: the follow-up of the economic partnership agreements. We have been overtaken, as it were, by another place, other follow-up places, the follow-up of the economic partnership agreements. Whatever one’s view is on the content, we need a democratic follow-up. I call for the Committee on Economic Affairs of this Joint ACP-EU Assembly to be the one that deals with the follow-up of the economic partnership agreements, otherwise it makes no sense. Our budgetary power is already small. Admittedly, we have a power of impetus, dialogue, meeting, of taking into consideration a series of problems, but if we cannot follow up on the economic aspect, whatever we may otherwise think and whatever our point of view on the economic partnership agreements, if we are not able, within the JPA, to follow up on them, question them and be the follow-up committee for these agreements, which really are the heart of economic policies in the relations between the European Union and these countries, I think we would miss an extremely important point.</p>
<p class="contents">I come back with the idea that we could reinvest the JPA committees with real subjects of democratic control, real issues and not only, as we are currently doing, quite well for that matter, motions, resolutions, debate texts like the one we have just discussed on precisely all the democratic issues, on political power changing hands in African countries, on a series of issues that are central, but that are, in the end, only reference texts. I urge us to take more power in this Assembly and to give ourselves the means to exercise real powers of parliament and joint assembly, in relation to the Commission which is working, among other things, on the economic partnership agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, therefore, that there is a very interesting link here. I ask you and I put the question, ladies and gentlemen: are we ready, yes or no, with this report and, in future, to go a bit further in the Joint Assembly’s application on a democratic and parliamentarian follow-up that is a bit more powerful than the one we currently have, or else we may turn into a mere club of friends of Africa, which is very well-meaning but altogether inadequate for the parliamentarian function that is ours? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Both the main points and the details have been presented with great skill. I have attended a large number of meetings of the EU-ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly, in Mali, Papua New Guinea, the Netherlands and many other countries. It is a much-needed instrument, not only in terms of aid, but also for the purposes of cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Of particular importance is the development of parliamentary scrutiny in these countries. We need to make our partners enthusiastic about this idea. Often, they are not entirely democratic countries. We must not export ideologies or impose our values, and much less our anti-values. We do need to help, but also – and I say this most emphatically – we should be keeping a very close check on the money we donate, because at a time of crisis, European taxpayers are demanding that we keep track of this money. What I am saying may not be popular, but it seems to me that it does need to be said very clearly. At the same time, I must emphasise that development aid is very necessary, and it is good that we are providing it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the issue of expropriation of land – known as ‘land grabbing’ – in ACP countries. A number of reports mention the enormous area involved in this process of expropriation of land for producing biofuels, and for feeding speculation on the price of land and foodstuffs.</p>
<p class="contents">The expression ‘expropriation’ is not misplaced, as that is what this is. The euphemistic description ‘land acquisition’ that is sometimes used obscures the effects and consequences of the process, which involves expelling farmers and local communities from their lands.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has responsibilities with regard to this, both because many of the companies at the forefront of this process are European, and because legislation on fuels of so-called ‘renewable’ origin is encouraging the race for the ACP countries’ arable land. This race threatens biodiversity, degrades soils and other natural resources, and tends to dangerously accentuate the food deficit in many of these countries, leading to hunger and destitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue that concerns us is the conclusion of so-called ‘economic partnership agreements’ (EPAs) and the European Commission’s insistence on free trade.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur rightly says, more attention needs to be paid to the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly. If you have paid attention to this body over the course of the last year, the repeated resistance of the ACP countries to EPAs – which is fair, legitimate and entirely understandable – cannot have escaped your notice. The way that they have been conceived means they could be very lucrative for some European multinationals, but will be disastrous for these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we would like to raise an issue here that is as old as it is current: that of debt and servicing debt.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic and financial crisis and its effects on the ACP countries require the cancellation of this enormous burden, which is a debt that has already been paid several times over yet is still growing, so as to bring an end once and for all to this unacceptable expropriation of wealth, and effectively help these countries to find a sovereign and independent path to development and social progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As well as listing the various activities of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA), the report draws attention to the discord among EU representatives over the implementation of the Cotonou partnership agreement. The absence of an official Council delegation at the 20th meeting of the group in Kinshasa, where discussions took place over a revision of the agreement, is clear evidence of this.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also draws attention to the dangerous phenomenon of land grabbing in poor developing countries, which leads to an exploitation of the food sources of small-scale local land users, and the loss of access to the land and of food security for the population. The urgency of this situation also gives rise to the challenge directed towards the JPA and the European Commission for ACP parliaments and governments to support the full right of the domestic population to the land, and to introduce effective measures to prevent the large-scale acquisition of this land.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though it can be stated, according to the report, that political dialogue on the floor of the JPA is improving, the attitude to certain topics such as the position of women, gender violence and human trafficking still remains an unresolved issue in many countries. The report describes the benefits and shortfalls of the JPA, and confirms the need to maintain a permanent dialogue with the countries represented in the Association of African, Caribbean and Pacific States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We do not all have the opportunity to be represented in the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, but I think that it is extremely useful for the entire Parliament to gain some idea of what goes on in this forum. As has been mentioned, it is the most important parliamentary body bringing together representatives from Southern and Northern countries. It discusses important issues, including conflict prevention and settlement.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, in actual fact, to mention one example. I remember that after the much-discussed, controversial elections in Côte d’Ivoire last year, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly was one of the first international bodies to state, during its meeting in Kinshasa, that the electoral process had been hijacked by Laurent Gbagbo. This was a first clear sign at global level that the Gbagbo regime’s attempts to ignore the wishes of the Ivorian people would not be tolerated.</p>
<p class="contents">In the resolution which we initiated in the European Parliament on the situation in Côte d’Ivoire, we obviously referred to this stance adopted by the Joint Parliamentary Assembly. Unfortunately, this does not always happen, and I would like to encourage my colleagues to take into account the texts adopted in this unique forum, if we want to be consistent. I believe that it is a real opportunity for us to be able to benefit from the contribution made by our partners in the South, one which we must not waste. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">After saying that I agree with a great deal of what has been said here and the text that we will vote on tomorrow, I would like to express some pleasure, some concern and a few ideas on the work that Parliament has done and will continue to do through the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased with the work done by Louis Michel, as co-President of the Assembly, and by our friends in the Commission, led by Mr Piebalgs, for the interest and care they have shown and their characteristically straightforward, sincere and efficient participation in our work.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am concerned that, absorbed by the rest of their work in Parliament, our representatives are becoming noticeably absent from the Joint Assembly, the work of which we are discussing here today.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems clear to me that members who give priority to other concerns should take a good look at the situation and either give their work in the ACP-EU Assembly the importance it deserves, or make way for other members who may have more time to devote to this activity.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I feel that Parliament itself should place more focus on this area of work and understand the political importance of the Cotonou Agreement, which is the most representative example of North-South cooperation, involving almost 80 developing countries around the world, as well as the 27, soon to be 28, Member States that make up the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when world governance needs to be coordinated on a multilateral basis, our ACP partners offer enormous political potential for organising joint actions on the international stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament should also pay greater attention to the resolutions that our delegates adopt with our ACP colleagues in the Parliamentary Assembly. We should not continue adopting all kinds of resolutions on Parliament’s behalf without any note being taken of these texts, at least by the relevant parliamentary committees.</p>
<p class="contents">Appropriate measures should be studied to ensure that Parliament knows what is being debated and adopted in the ACP-EU Assembly, so that the texts it adopts in the same areas are consistent and do not give rise, as can sometimes happen, to significant discrepancies that are frankly disconcerting for our partners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sorry that the Council’s representatives were absent from the Kinshasa meeting in 2010, but I hope that the European External Action Service will successfully strengthen its cooperation with this influential and extremely useful parliamentary body in the coming period, as highlighted by the election monitoring missions and the negotiations on concluding the Economic Partnership Agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the criticism voiced in the report about the absence from the agenda of the meeting in Kinshasa of any item about the increase in acts of mass sexual violence and the general sense of impunity across Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo. According to UN statistics, a disturbing number of 200 000 women and girls have been victims of rape or sexual violence in Congo during the last 15 years. This is why, in light of this, I call for progress to be made towards including on a permanent basis female leaders, local women’s rights organisations and civil society groups in all of these decision-making processes at every level.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, all these regulations about the participation of women, young mothers and children must feature as part of national and regional strategy documents. In the same way, closer EU-ACP cooperation at parliamentary level is vital to the process of strengthening democracy in African, Pacific and Caribbean countries and, by extension, to their parliaments taking a more active role in defending human rights. I should also stress the importance of the fact-finding missions and the interaction between MEPs and members of parliaments in Southern countries, which have fostered transparent processes and resulted, at the moment, in a better assessment of the situation on the ground. Before concluding, I wish to express the hope that all the points mentioned will be taken into consideration for future sessions of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is important that every year, the European Parliament take stock of the work of the ACP–EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA), insofar as this assembly plays a determining role in enhancing the North-South dialogue and in implementing a development policy that is founded on partnership and exchange.</p>
<p class="contents">2010 was an eventful year for the JPA, which met twice – as previous speakers have said – in Spain and in the Democratic Republic of Congo, to discuss, among other things, the impact of climate change in ACP countries, the impact of the global crisis, freedom and independence of the media, and food security. In 2010, the JPA also sent the first election observation mission of this parliamentary term. I had the honour of co-chairing this mission in Burundi for the presidential elections with Mr Assarid, a Malian MP. This election observation mission was a real success. We were able to meet all the political players involved and thanks to the dual origin of this delegation, both ACP and European, we embodied a different legitimacy from European and African missions.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call on the JPA Bureau to renew this experience, since it will make it possible to put into practice solidarity and the special relations that unite the European Union and ACP countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Vice-President responsible for Human Rights, I really welcomed the active work of this service on the ground in individual countries where there are problems particularly, of course, with open violence against women. It is also necessary for our ambassadors in these places to help with the creation of strategic plans, and with the implementation of what we are striving for in our Joint Assembly. In conclusion, I would like to ask again what steps the Commission has taken or is taking against enforced collectivisation of the land. This has already been said here. We cannot ignore the expulsions of white farmers, whether in Zimbabwe or Kenya or elsewhere. I would also like to ask how powers will be shared between the Commission and External Action Service.

We need only look back at the rebuilding of Haiti, the reinforcement of the peace in Southern Sudan or, for that matter, at the progress made in the field of food security. I do not think anyone is saying that any of these are wrong or inappropriate, but we also cannot ignore the fact that both the economic and the social climate of Europe has changed substantially in recent years. Good and close relations with the ACP states are an important and forward-looking development, but neither in economic nor in social terms can Europe continue with the sacrifices it has been making so far. As regards economic aspects, it is the economy of the European Union that should be helped first, as there are regions within the EU itself, especially in the Eastern parts, where conditions virtually resemble those seen in third world countries; it is these that should be helped first and foremost. As regards society, we should bear in mind the enormous problem represented by immigration and migration. The case of Libya, for example, has shown that nearly one million immigrants entering Europe in a short period of time causes social tensions that can quickly lead to tremendous problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The next meeting in Togo will now definitely be much more productive compared with the previous one.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like also to assure you that the issue of non-discrimination on a sexual orientation basis is also always on the agenda in my bilateral meetings, because we should also clearly understand that there is a need to discuss with partners why we believe that there should be change in their legislation. It cannot be done by force but by conviction and explanation, so I believe that the whole process of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly helps us to address the issues where much discussion is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the issues that I have been asked about in one of the interventions was to do with land grabs. We definitely ask our partner countries for full transparency with land deals when we work with these countries. On the separation between the External Action Service and the European Commission, we do not make artificial boundaries. Basically, we all work for good and productive relations with our partner countries, so we try very much to work together on the issues at the same time. To make a rough distinction: the EEAS is responsible for external relations, the Commission is responsible for development cooperation, but there is no simple boundary and both services work together to achieve the best possible results.</p>
<p class="contents">I would finish with again thanking the rapporteur for a lot of positive things in the report. Expectations are always high, but I believe it is a very difficult assembly because, on one side, the EU is very coherent, while the ACP countries are definitely much more divergent. It is not therefore an easy assembly, but it has proven its value and the leadership of Louis Michel is very helpful in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I agree with what Mr Goerens said – not everything about the Assembly is good or as good as it could be. Please look at paragraph 2 of the resolution, in which we appeal for more participation and involvement of MEPs in the meetings and activities of the Assembly, because if we are going to change something for the better, we have to start by changing ourselves. We have had long discussions about this. It seems the only way to increase our involvement is better correlation with Parliament’s calendar, and we hope this will be possible in future.</p>
<p class="contents">The comments made by Mr Cashman are also to be found in our resolution. We note the deficit of the principle of non-discrimination, and refer to this in paragraph 18, and we note the fact that in Kinshasa, we did not say enough about the violence in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, so aspects which are less favourable are also to be found in the text. However, I am very pleased that there are more positive than negative aspects, because this means we can look to the future with optimism, and I hope that it is, in fact, these positive aspects which will determine the course of the further work of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These countries are often rich in natural resources and culture, but their wealth is shared unevenly. Women and children, in particular, are very vulnerable in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The promotion of women’s equality is, above all, the promotion of human rights. Furthermore, men benefit from a society in which there is equality between women and men. In families in which the women are educated and earn an income, a larger share of the money is spent on the welfare of the children and of the entire family. The family of a woman who enjoys equality is also better educated and healthier. This accelerates a society’s economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP) must make much more of an effort to promote the inclusion of women, when matters to do with gender-based violence or human trafficking, for example, are being considered. The Commission and the Joint Parliamentary Assembly must include a lot more women than now in their work groups that deal with such issues as family life, child care and education. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
