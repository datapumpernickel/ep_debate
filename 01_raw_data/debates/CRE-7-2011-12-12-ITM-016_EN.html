<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Véronique Mathieu, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is currently undergoing a massive transformation: in economic, monetary, social, demographic and migratory terms. The changes sweeping across and shaking up Europe are considerable and call on us to reconsider European policies. Europe is at a turning point and we have a duty to address these challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the main challenges facing us in the years ahead is a shortage of labour. Our low population growth is the Achilles heel of Europe. By 2050, one out of three European citizens will be over 65 years old and 20 million skilled jobs will not be filled. We would need 3.2 million immigrants a year between now and 2050 to keep the age structure as it currently is. Resorting to immigration is justified and made necessary by this demographic deficit. It is high time we accepted this state of affairs, got to grips with these changes and ultimately did something about it.</p>
<p class="contents">Aware of this problem, the European Commission has proposed a package of measures: the blue card Directive in 2009, the Directive on the single permit, the Directive on seasonal workers or even intragroup transfers seek to address these issues. We should now seize the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The ‘single permit’ Directive provides a partial response to the labour crisis looming on the European horizon. It also makes it possible to control the workforce. To regulate and simplify legal migration, it is better to control all forms of migration and remove any temptations for fraud and illegal migration. The ‘single permit’ Directive allows workers from third countries to come and work in Europe with standards and regulations in place. It protects workers from third countries from people traffickers and other criminal gangs profiting from and abusing their fragility.</p>
<p class="contents">Permit application procedures have been greatly simplified. A single residence and work permit can be obtained in a maximum of four months. Applications can be made either by the employer, in Europe, or by the worker, in the third country in which he or she resides. What is more, there is a right to appeal in the procedures of Member States in which the applications are made. Similarly, the information shown on the single permit is standardised and simplified throughout the European Union. It is the same information shown on the work permit. Additional information may be requested. It is optional and its content is closely supervised.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as significantly simplifying procedures for work and residence permits, the single permit will therefore allow us to give third-country workers and workers from the European Union a common set of rights. Until now there has been a genuine disparity between Member States, and we could not put up with this any longer. Failing to recognise the rights of foreign workers who bring so much to our economies was wrong. This step forward is both fair and necessary. The equal treatment of workers is at the heart of this directive, which puts third-country workers and European workers on an equal footing. Third-country workers enjoy the same rights as European workers in terms of pay and conditions for dismissal.</p>
<p class="contents">The same rules also apply to the recognition of diplomas, freedom of association and membership of a professional organisation, social security, tax benefits and access to public goods and services. In addition, those with a job will enjoy equal treatment when it comes to access to education and to employment. Employment services will also be accessible to the unemployed and thus to those most in need of such services.</p>
<p class="contents">The export of pensions will no longer be conditional on the existence of bilateral agreements between Member States and third countries. Equal treatment will again be the rule here. This step forward means we can recognise the value of work carried out by citizens from third countries and take this into account when giving them pension rights.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I am immensely proud to have taken part in these lengthy negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the European Commission and, in particular, Cecilia Malmström and her services, which have enabled the directive to see the light of day.</p>

Thank you also, Ms Mathieu, for the nice words you said about Cecilia Malmström. I will certainly convey these words to her.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are aware, the Commission presented this proposal back in 2007, which seems like another century because since then we have arrived at the Lisbon Treaty, but at that time our aim was – and still is – to simplify procedures by introducing one permit for residence and work, while protecting migrant workers by guaranteeing them employment-related rights on an equal footing with nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal is one of the main building blocks of the European Union’s labour migration policy. It is a complex proposal as it addresses both immigration and employment issues. If adopted by Parliament and the Council, this directive will confirm the important contribution third-country workers make to our economies and to our societies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already confirmed that the text agreed upon is in line with the original objectives. If the text is endorsed by Parliament, this directive will be the first one on legal migration under the ordinary legislative procedure introduced in this area by the Lisbon Treaty. Indeed, Parliament’s involvement as a fully fledged legislator has made it possible because there is a substantial contribution by Parliament to achieving a more rights-based instrument, ensuring, for example, social security rights for registered unemployed workers who have earned them through previous contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I would like to raise an institutional point. The Commission is very pleased that the last pending issue, the reporting mechanism on implementation, was also solved in a satisfactory manner. In line with that interinstitutional agreement, the Commission decided to propose in this specific case that Member States provide explanatory documents when putting these EU rules into national law. Given the wide scope and the wide range of rights and policy areas involved – social security, education, labour law – this was a very important issue and we are pleased that the Council accepted this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me hope, Ms Mathieu, that Parliament will endorse the agreement and thereby adopt the directive, which will facilitate matters for potential employers and guarantee legal security for non-EU workers throughout the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As others have mentioned, this is the first time that we are passing a law under the codecision procedure on the possibility of having third country citizens work legally within the European Union countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This law provides certain advantages: an advantage to third country citizens wishing to work in the European Union, because for the first time we will be providing a legal means by which this will be possible. It also presents an advantage to European Union countries by granting them the faculty to accept workers from third countries via a legal form, without depriving them of the discretion to decide on how many work permits to issue. A further advantage of the possibility to work legally is that it cuts down upon, or attacks the possibility of illegal immigration. This law therefore, is in itself a means of combating illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">It is ironic and unfortunate that when it came to the vote within the Committee, the Socialist Group chose to abstain, when one would have thought that it would have approved of such a law, which, for the first time opened up this right to third country citizens - a right that will also provide certain guarantees of rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this abstention proves that there are those who seem to prefer the law of the jungle rather having a law that sets clear standards for those who come to work in our countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot, therefore, vote against it.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this is not the directive that we had promised in Tampere and that we had promised for ten years in the Green Paper; this is not the directive for equal rights: there are still very significant exclusions in terms of working and social security rights; decisions still remain in the hands of the Member States, which shouldn’t be discretional in nature, but rather regulated.</p>

A large number of countries outside the European Union and a huge number of NGOs from within and outside the EU expressed their disappointment and frustration. We promised at the time that measures to send home people who came and stayed irregularly in the EU would be accompanied by genuine legislation dealing with legal migration, making it more coherent and human.</p>
<p class="contents">This task has become one of the main priorities of the Commission, whose ambition is to see the entire package on migration adopted by the end of 2012. I hope Parliament shares this ambition.</p>
<p class="contents">The single application procedure for residence is the first one to be adopted; it was discussed at length and negotiated not only with the Council but also among political groups in this Parliament. I want to congratulate Véronique Mathieu for her determination during the entire process; it was not easy at all. I am convinced we did the right thing and I regret that our Socialist colleagues abstained during the last vote. Certainly the single permit in its actual wording is not the best it could be. However it is much better when compared to the situation in many Member States. I dare to say that it is an honest attempt to provide people who want to come and study and work within the European Union with a better mechanism to do so, and also maybe to protect them from the humiliation they have to suffer in various Member States at present.</p>

However I think many of us see it as a positive step forward, and certainly analysis of it that has been done says that it may be positive in terms of integration for the many thousands of people affected by the legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a simplification in terms of putting together the residence and work permit as a single piece of paperwork. That, we know, was controversial, as well in the way in which it was discussed. But it should be a simplification and, as has been pointed out, there is a due requirement of time so that these applications should not be left sitting on desks as they so often are in many of our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the rights section of it – which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was largely dealing with – I think we have made some progress there. The most important part of it is that we are looking at equality of treatment with Member State nationals in a large number of places, not least in terms of pay, rights of freedom of association and the right to educational/vocational training so that people are actually able to improve their skills base, which is for their own benefit and for the benefit of the company with which they work.</p>

This in no way opens the way for a truly simplified regulation for third-country nationals who would like to work in the EU. That remains the case even if residence is increasingly being linked with work. In many cases that may be all well and good – but it is the only focus here, and we see that as a problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we do not feel that this directive is a step in the right direction. Firstly, this is because its scope is too narrow. Its provisions are narrow-minded and provincial. It is not just that it is only to be applicable to the executing Member State and not to the EU as a whole; that does not even get mentioned any more. It is also that the regulation is not to apply to family members of Union citizens if they are third-country nationals, nor to seasonal workers, intra-corporate transferees or people under international or temporary protection. This gives rise to all kinds of individual directives, and as a result there are different classes of third-country nationals with differing rights.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that there is no real simplification or legal harmonisation, and this is true through the mere fact that the Member States actually have the final say on all matters – such as whether it is the employer or the employee who is to apply for the permit. If it is the employer, the potential employee may not even get to see the application, such as in cases where it is rejected. He will have absolutely no opportunity to comment legally in any form whatsoever. We are also critical of the fact that an application may be deemed inadmissible if the Member State sets quotas for the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point I would like to make – and I will concede this to the rapporteur – is that it is good that pension entitlements will be recognised. It is absolutely unacceptable, however, that there is not completely equal treatment with employees who are EU nationals. There are to be considerable restrictions – and these will depend on the class of person – when it comes to vocational training, social benefits – such as for family members – and access to public housing. That is really not acceptable. If that is made a fundamental principle, then it is a mistake and we cannot support it. That is why we are rejecting this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Immigration which has, after all, brought with it so much alienation, so much uprootedness and also so much crime in recent decades, the real costs of which should be considered huge for the societies of most of our European countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, obviously, I am not going to be foolish enough to draw, with no valid reason, any links between what is known as ‘the blue card’ for highly skilled immigrants and the massive non-European immigration of the past decades. However, I do have, and will continue to have, the greatest misgivings about the official European policy, which have today, once again, been confirmed. That policy continues, for ideological reasons, to favour mass immigration, despite the real situation on the ground and the dramatic unemployment figures, for example, when this flies in the face of all common sense.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as what we call ‘legal immigration’, or even the immigration of the highly skilled, is concerned: what is the situation with the legal and semi-legal immigration which directly results from the immigration of those we designate ‘highly skilled’? Who can guarantee that those people will leave when the highly skilled person leaves, even if they desire to do so? I still have major issues with an economic policy which is reliant on immigration, which, in turn, causes us constant problems. This kind of policy has proved to be totally disastrous in the past and we ought to take lessons from that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Historically, numerous federations of independent states have drawn very close when they adopted uniform policies for dealing with the presence of third-country nationals in their territory. The uniform policy for dealing with foreign nationals in the various states in the US is often cited as an example of immigration policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are again debating a draft directive which, any initial reservations notwithstanding, goes one step further, by making provision for common rules for addressing the residency status of third-country nationals in the territory of the European Union. Also, the role of the rapporteur, Ms Mathieu, whom I too should like to take my turn in thanking, in overcoming any disagreements is a truly well-established role and I cannot understand why the socialist group abstained in the vote in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The immediate benefits of this directive are obvious: less bureaucracy, greater security of law in the Schengen area, confidence-building between the Member States, more effective action on illegal immigration, common rules for assessing the work qualifications of third-country nationals and benefits for social insurance and health care.</p>
<p class="contents">There are even greater benefits in the medium term. The fact that third-country nationals are treated in the same way in Greece, the Netherlands, Sweden and every other Member State of the Union is also a step towards a standard approach to our common future. I therefore believe that a vote in favour of this directive will be an important step for the legislature, for the European Parliament, a huge step towards the adoption of a common European immigration policy and, ultimately, an important step on the route towards European integration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Negotiations took some time because we attempted to reach the best possible solution that would be acceptable for all third-country workers legally residing and working in our European Union Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Although agreement could not be reached on all issues, I am pleased that, in the final agreement on this Directive, provision was made for the portability of pensions. This is something we should welcome. However, it is disappointing that we failed to find a common solution in the European Parliament itself regarding the inclusion of individual categories of workers in the content of this Directive. Here I have in mind seasonal workers, workers transferred within a company or asylum seekers.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, this Directive does not exactly strengthen the principle of legal equivalence for all third-country workers. Clearly, I would like to congratulate and thank the Commission (because we have a Member of the Commission here) for making proposals both regarding seasonal workers and workers transferred within a company, and intensive discussions are currently taking place in Parliament. I hope that we will find an appropriate solution and will adopt a common decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to wish that, when addressing migration policy issues in future, we will understand that third-country workers have the same rights as European Union citizens if they are residing and working legally, because their contribution to our countries’ economic growth and the growth of our social well-being is inescapable.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore underline that we need to appreciate and understand this, and finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur Véronique Mathieu because she really put a lot of work and effort into helping us find a common solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should be pleased that the citizens of third countries want to come to the European Union and our Member States to work. We need them because we are short of workers in many areas and we also have an ageing population.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, it is self-evident that we need to make it as easy and as problem-free as possible for these people to live and work in the EU. I therefore welcome this report concerning the creation of a single application procedure for third-country nationals. Those who come here to work will in all likelihood want to live and spend their lives here, too. We should be able to provide that opportunity with as little red tape as possible. That would benefit everyone involved, and we will achieve it with this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that we will finally have this directive in place. It will benefit many people who help to maintain welfare standards in our Member States and it will bring prosperity to the EU once the crisis that we are currently experiencing is over. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These rights truly underpin our economies and social systems.</p>
<p class="contents">In some cases, the measures contained in this report would even give workers from third countries staying in a Member State preferential treatment, such as tax benefits and ad hoc forms of assistance to enter the job market.</p>
<p class="contents">To be perfectly honest, I think the European and national institutions should support our own citizens first and foremost, especially in an economic and social crisis such as the one we are experiencing now. Adding to the range of rights enjoyed by third-country workers would mean ignoring the terrible situation in which tens of millions of families find themselves in our countries today, and turning our backs on our own vulnerable groups, such as the young, women and unemployed Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">The statistics on poverty in Europe reveal a striking picture: over 60 million people are at risk of poverty; in other words, 15% of the population have to make do on less than 60% of the national median income. One in eight people lives in a family in which nobody is working, and one in five children is at risk of poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with this situation, European do-gooders are thinking about how to sort things out for third-country workers, but in actual fact they do not even know how to ensure decent living standards for our own workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Joint residence and work permits are to be issued generously. It would be better, however, if residence were linked to specific job opportunities in the labour market. Even then, wholesale migration is unlikely to be the answer. In addition, a bunch of rights are intended to make migrants equal to nationals – in other words, equal working conditions, recognition of professional qualifications, tax relief, trade union rights and equal social benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">Who, ladies and gentlemen, is supposed to pay for this? Our indebted euro area countries? Certainly not the migrants, because their income is around 30% lower than that of the average EU citizen. Naturally, this also means that less tax will be paid. Furthermore, migrants are much more likely to suffer unemployment and are less well qualified. Under this system, it is mainly migrants who would benefit from claiming social security – because they are a population group that has a particularly low employment rate and tends to have a higher level of poverty. As a result, migrants would be overrepresented in the social security systems. That will certainly not help our labour markets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the coming years the IT sector will be short by about 700 000, and the health care industry by nearly 2 million employees. Europe is increasingly losing its appeal among highly qualified third-country employees. It is less appealing than the United States, Canada, Australia or Switzerland. In order for us to become more attractive it is important to establish a common migration policy, and in this respect the current proposal for a ‘Single Permit’ Directive represents a major step. The political compromise over the scope of the Directive is the result of long negotiations. There have also been extensive debates regarding equal treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">We are glad that the transferability of pensions and the right to continuing vocational training were eventually included; to my fellow Members in the Group of the European People’s Party I would like to say that with our abstention we intended to express that we had wished to achieve much more in the course of these negotiations. We must carry on with this work in several fields in order for a true common European migration policy to be formed. On the one hand there is some backlog in respect of the blue card in the transposition and application of adopted directives. On the other hand, headway must also be made as regards the directives on intra-corporate transfers and seasonal workers. In conclusion I would like to state that if Europe truly wishes to be competitive it needs to open up its labour market to employees from the new Member States. In the following days we will be discussing Romania and Bulgaria; we need them, too, partly in respect of seasonal, and partly in respect of highly skilled labour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">But of course not all Member States have the same level of social security and public services, and of course a citizen of a state, by definition, enjoys the benefits of that citizenship, or should enjoy the benefits of that citizenship that non-citizens do not. If citizens do not have exclusive rights, then the concept of citizenship itself is meaningless. What this will mean is that third-party migrants will flood to those states that have the highest levels of public housing, social security and public services. No prizes for guessing that Britain will be top of their list as a destination. Equally unsurprisingly, I can tell you that UK Independence Party MEPs will vote against this directive.</p>

<p class="contents">The frequently complicated administrative steps for the adoption of economic migrants must be simplified, as there are substantial differences between the various Member States at present. I welcome the fact that the Directive provides the possibility of combating the exploitation and discrimination which working immigrants are often exposed to. The draft stipulates equal treatment on the basis of a common set of rights in areas related to the labour market. Another advantage is ensuring better protection than such workers enjoy at present, on the basis of the international agreements currently in force, which have been ratified only by some Member States. Since economic migrants take part in the economic life of their host countries, they must have a legal status that protects them from exclusion and discrimination. This status will make it possible to combat the unfair competition which often follows on from an absence of legal status. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The agreement negotiated with the Council is not entirely satisfactory, but can be considered a step forward. The single permit will, in actual fact, be applied solely to a limited category of workers, which goes against the very principle of the single procedure that this directive was intended to introduce at the outset. At the same time, it is unfair that working conditions and derived benefits will not be entirely equivalent to those applicable to EU citizens. However, I cannot claim that this comes as a surprise, given that Romanians and Bulgarians, who are European citizens, also continue to be afforded discriminatory treatment on the labour market in some Member States.

In my opinion, the effort to define a common set of rights for workers from third countries reminds us in particular that European citizens, as well as employees or workers in another Member State, cannot always count on the same set of rights. Our friends from Romania and Bulgaria cannot even get work legally in some Member States, and seasonal agricultural workers in southern Member States often report experiencing appalling working conditions. In this context we should perhaps be talking not just about the employment rights of workers from third countries, but rather about equal EU employment rights for all workers in general. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first one is that labour from third countries cannot be treated otherwise, or at least I cannot treat it otherwise, than as strike breakers in a strike. Because Europe, realising that there is nothing it can do about its own employees and unemployment, takes the easier path: why, let us import employees from outside Europe cheaply, at low wages, and disregard the problems of the European people.

Why is it not first ensured that a Hungarian employee earns as much as, say, a German, a French or an Italian employee? The third problem is the issue of immigration itself.

If immigration remains at a high level in times of rising unemployment, then clearly local people will be crowded out of the jobs market. It is also strange that the supposedly highly qualified workers who are to make up for the supposed shortage of skilled labour in the EU all too often end up in unskilled sectors of the economy – in agriculture, in the building trade and in the hospitality sector; in other words, in precisely those areas in which workers are laid off more quickly than skilled workers. That also increases the likelihood of their having to be supported by the social safety net.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of recklessly giving third-country nationals access to social security via the EU’s back door, we need to seriously investigate which sectors are recruiting immigrants, what level of education and training they have, and what costs this imposes on the general public. EU migration policy must not result in unchecked mass immigration and in workers being crowded out by competing labour – all at the behest of big business. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reality is the exact opposite. We are talking here about those with a proper work and residence permit, and if they are doing the same work as an EU citizen, then such people should also receive the same usual types of social benefits within the European Union as any other person would get. This safeguards those who work properly and with the right papers; it is not opening any floodgates.</p>
<p class="contents">I also find it most amusing that some Members are complaining that too many groups are excluded, while others are complaining that mass immigration will take place. I congratulate the rapporteur. She seems to have found the golden middle way between giving the Member States the necessary individual powers of differentiation in certain decision areas and, on the other hand, providing a certain guarantee of social security for those working according to the rules. It should be a matter of course that family benefits depend on length of stay, but that someone who has earned a pension is able to take it with them if they have worked according to the rules. I therefore find it rather strange that people’s concerns that many workers will be crowded out of the labour market are being fuelled here. This directive has nothing to do with that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think this is a question to be solved by the House itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the numbers of migrant workers, I would like to say that this proposal gives the freedom to each Member State to decide for itself how many migrant workers it wishes to accept. Let me also underline that those migrant workers pay taxes and social security contributions when working legally, as well as contributing to the cultural richness of our societies.</p>
<p class="contents">To those who suggest that the equal treatment provisions allow for too many limitations – I agree that the rapporteur seems to be right in the middle because there are opinions on both sides, to one extreme and to the other – I would like to underline that the primary aim of the Commission was to ensure workers’ rights as regards employment-related rights and those earned through contribution. This means, for example, the need to ensure work-related vocational training but not necessarily completely equal treatment as regards education in general.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, one of the objectives of this directive is to establish a level playing field for migrant workers from day one without any minimum employment period. Let me also point out that the outcome of the political agreement resulted in provisions which are even more inclusive than the original Commission proposal as regards access to social security for unemployed migrants and freedom of association. Some restrictions are introduced on access to education and housing, but the work-related rights in vocational training are kept, which in the Commission’s opinion results in a balanced approach. Here of course I am also speaking for the relevant Commissioner, my colleague Cecilia Malmström.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of this long but fruitful negotiation process on a highly important proposal in the area of legal migration, I sincerely hope that Parliament will come to an agreement and adopt a directive that will ensure the equal treatment of legally residing migrant workers so that they can benefit fully from employment-related rights. Such a directive should be seen as a first, and an important, step to be completed later on by other instruments, such as the ones dealing with seasonal workers and intra-corporate transferees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This directive on the single permit is a major achievement for European institutions, for the European Union, for third-country workers and also for European Union employers and for our labour market over time, because – as we have said before, as some of you have said before –, we will be needing workers in the years ahead and we will be relying on workers from third countries. I will therefore be particularly pleased when Parliament adopts this recommendation for the single permit and this proposal for a directive which the Commission first presented back in 2007. We have had numerous debates on this matter over the last four years.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I regret that some members of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament did not want to vote for this proposal last week in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE). I also regret the remarks made by Mr Cercas a while ago, and I am sorry that he is not here. I will be speaking to him about this and, in any case, I was upset by his remarks about minor pen pushing officials – who, may I remind you have always been at our side during trialogues or meetings of shadow rapporteurs –, that they belong to political groups, the Council, the Commission or Parliament. Let me tell you that it was very pleasant and highly informative; fortunately, we had them alongside us, which cannot always be said of Mr Cercas as we have not seen much of him lately in the trialogue. I am pleased they are there and I thank them greatly for their support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
