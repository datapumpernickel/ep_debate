The Belgian Supreme Court has upheld a previous ruling that declares the Vlaams Blok a criminal organisation and effectively bans it. Nobody in my Group supports the ideology or the practice of the Vlaams Blok, but in a democracy that is not the point. It is for the electorate and not the courts to make political decisions, and actions such as this can only increase political extremism and perhaps the use of violence.</p>

Almost exactly two weeks ago today I was standing in a place in Tel Aviv called Carmel Market, looking at the tragic aftermath of a suicide bomb. To witness for myself the horror that Israeli citizens have to live with every day was profoundly moving and deeply upsetting. The prosaic and everyday nature of the scene of bustling shoppers and market stalls contrasted brutally with the clear-up operation that was taking place, with human remains being scraped off the canopies of the market stalls.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that all MEPs will join me in condemning those who send 16-year old children, strapped with explosives, to blow themselves up together with innocent shoppers who have just popped out to buy something from the local cheese shop.

Parliament decided that the delegation for relations with Serbia and Montenegro would send a fact-finding mission to Vojvodina, in Serbia. Two months have already passed since then. I do not understand. There is a danger – as mentioned in our resolution – that incidents will multiply and that the harassment of national minorities will spiral out of control. The delegation for relations with Serbia has not found five Members to send on the fact-finding mission. This beggars belief. Parliament’s good name is at stake; this is a case of non-compliance with a European Parliament resolution. I ask you, Mr President, to look into why the delegation for relations with Serbia has sabotaged Parliament’s resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we see it, and further to the legal opinions we have in our possession, the European Parliament has allowed a situation to arise whereby the European Commission has acted without legal authority since 1 November. In other words, it has been acting illegally. This means that all legal, formal and other administrative decisions taken by the European Commission may be appealed against and overturned. Such a state of affairs must not be allowed to continue. Mr President, I believe it is necessary to establish interim legislative measures, which would serve to provide a legal definition of the measures to be taken by Parliament when it is unable to appoint a Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All of the methods that were employed are incongruous with the concept of European pluralism and democracy. The same organisation, the Hungarian Civic Union, was discriminatively excluded even from local authority elections in July. The European Commission’s Annual Report disapproved of this, and at that time the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats set up a committee to investigate the case. The discriminatory regulations of the Election Act, the discriminatory action on part of the authorities and the exclusion from elections harshly violates the European standard of democracy and pluralism as well as the Copenhagen Criteria, which provide the basis for a stable constitutional state and a working democracy. A working democracy is indeed a condition for membership within the Union.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you know, on 2 November, the Dutch filmmaker and critical columnist, Theo Van Gogh, was brutally murdered by an Islamic extremist. In reaction to this, various attacks have ensued on mosques and Islamic schools in the Netherlands. So far, the European Union has failed to condemn these acts of terrorism emphatically as something that affects the whole of Europe. There is much speculation as to what the reasons could be. Apparently, the Council does not have the courage to hold a debate about Islamic extremism at this moment in time, or the events are being regarded as an exclusively Dutch matter. I do not know whether those speculations are true, but a condemnation from the whole of the EU would be very welcome indeed. We should not avoid a debate about Islam in Europe, even if it were to unite all moderate forces, religious or otherwise, in order to isolate and fight extremism and racism. After all, the events in the Netherlands could occur anywhere in Europe, and the Netherlands and its citizens could really do with the EU’s solidarity and support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact is that Slovak and Czech establishments and businesses apply a dual-pricing system for tourists who visit their countries. Both Polish citizens and citizens of other EU Member States are discriminated against in restaurants, hotels and museums. The very same services used by local citizens are offered to foreigners at two or three times the price. In practice, this is done by showing a higher price for entry to a museum in the English language price list than in the price list written in the local language. The use of different price lists for citizens and foreigners is a violation of the basic consumer rights guaranteed within the EU, as all citizens of the 25 EU Member States are EU citizens, along with Czechs and Slovaks, and they are entitled to the same rights and responsibilities within the EU. I therefore call on you, Mr President, as well as on the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection and on the Slovak and Czech Governments, to take action on this matter.

The Polish nation has had first-hand experience of the two most recent totalitarian regimes, namely Nazi fascism and Communism. My nation and my homeland had no time at all to recover. It was destroyed not only materially, but also intellectually and spiritually. In view of the threat that such totalitarianism could return, I should like to protest against certain comments by Members of this House, especially those by Mr Schulz concerning the Member States’ governments, which he called servants. Our nation and homeland are what is most sacred to us, after God and the family. That is where our most important values are enshrined. Current trends in the European Union promote a world in which people live without homelands and without religion, and where patriotism, culture and language have become almost completely devalued. All this being promoted in the name of some sort of soulless common state with a single government. Europe will only be able to develop if it is a Europe of homelands. Consequently, the democratically elected governments of the Member States should be respected, by this House in particular. A Europe without Christian roots, without religion and without homelands, based merely on Mammon, is not a place where human beings can thrive. It is simply heading towards destructive totalitarianism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
