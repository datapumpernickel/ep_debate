<p class="contents">The new text, which we trust the European Parliament will adopt, reflects the outcome of systematic efforts by and successful cooperation between the three institutions of the European Union. It also reflects changes in economic and social conditions in the Member States of the European Union and efforts to update our social model. However, it also reflects the roles which women have to play today if we are to achieve our development targets and the obligations and responsibilities of the state and society towards working women.</p>
<p class="contents">The new directive will therefore be an important tool in achieving sexual equality in the workplace. New concepts have been included in the area of discrimination, such as sexual harassment, as have company action plans and employer's responsibilities. Equality monitoring bodies are to be created and, more importantly, subsidised at the insistence of the European People's Party. We believe this is an important directive and we must all work to ensure it is implemented, because our ultimate objective is the impact it will have on the life of working citizens. So we need to ensure that it is transposed into law in the Member States as quickly as possible and, more importantly, that information is broadly available to citizens, especially women, social agencies, the judicial system and the administrative system.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not overlook the importance of this information and awareness raising, because we all know that we have progressive legislation and policies in our countries, but they are not applied, which is why we have the effect of discrimination against women in the workplace. This directive must give laws and policies on equal treatment a chance to flourish and be applied. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am convinced that this amended directive will prove to be a milestone in the improvement of women's career opportunities. It was quite literally at the last minute that we managed to come to a compromise on the definition of the concept of sexual harassment in the workplace, one which prohibits any form of unwanted verbal, non-verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature violating the dignity of the person affected. For the first time direct and indirect discrimination come within the scope of an EU law, with binding effect in fifteen Member States and soon in ten more.</p>
<p class="contents">It also constitutes a breakthrough of massive dimensions that women may not suffer any disadvantage in employment in connection with pregnancy or motherhood, and that they are accorded the right to their former job or an equivalent post after maternity leave. It has taken a tenacious struggle to give paternal leave to fathers and the protection of the directive to adoptive parents as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States and the candidate countries now have until 2005 to see to it that businesses are required to set up independent units to draw up equal treatment plans, also to take preventive action and equip themselves with the resources they need to do this. Real sanctions are to be imposed for non-compliance. It is an open question whether the arrangement in Germany, with a voluntary joint commitment by the federal government and the employers' associations which goes in this direction, will meet the high standards of our EU directive. If businesses do not noticeably redouble their efforts to promote women, it is inevitable that the way ahead will be via a referral to the European Court of Justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In spite of stubborn and, in certain cases, fairly uninterested and uncommitted ministers, Mrs Hautala succeeded in crafting an excellent agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The work on equality within the EU has taken a major step forwards. Both women and men can now call upon the law in avoiding sexual harassment. We know that it is women who all too commonly suffer harassment of this kind. Now, we are obtaining a legal definition in EC law, and the employer is being given a clear responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Many European women have had their working days ruined by men who will not take no for an answer. Between 40% and 50% of professionally employed women in the EU have at some point been exposed to sexual advances.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also particularly delighted that the right to parental leave is being strengthened, and for women as well as men. I should nonetheless have preferred clearer wording concerning people’s right to return to the jobs they had before taking parental leave.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would once again thank the Commissioner responsible for her assiduous work. I would also thank my fellow MEP, Mrs Hautala, for the characteristically Finnish refusal to give in that she has shown in the interests of European work on equality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Hautala has not just lived with it herself but has also involved quite a few political groups in the course of a very long period, and that has paid dividends.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish particularly to mention that both parents are now entitled to return to the same, or similar, jobs following parental leave. That only applies, however, if this right is established in the Member States’ legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I really do hope that knowledge of this directive will quickly be disseminated among people and also be taken due note of by those Member States which still do not have this type of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also worth mentioning that the directive in actual fact gives concrete form to the political ambition always expressed in formal speeches: namely, that of being able to combine family and working life. The directive entails practical action that can contribute to realising this ambition. A lack of will and understanding is revealed when our political ambition collides with employers’ absolute unwillingness to reflect upon their role when it comes to low birth rates in the European Union.</p>

Both in Parliament and with the Council, we have striven long and hard for a workable compromise, never losing sight of our objective, which is to safeguard equal treatment for men and women as regards their access to work.</p>
<p class="contents">The definition of sexual harassment was being honed right up to the end, although opinions can still differ as to whether it should form part of a legal text. A compromise was reached on the setting up of one or more independent units to analyse and oversee the transposition and implementation of the directive. Units of this sort, which can also form part of existing facilities, are worthy of support. The directive also deals with the rights of adoptive parents in those Member States in which adoption leave is recognised. The right to return to a former job or to an equivalent post at the end of maternity leave has also been incorporated.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States will now be obliged by this directive to introduce a range of binding measures on equal treatment, but businesses should not, in my view, be left to implement these on their own. To do it, they will also need support. It is only when the family, the raising of children, and the care of the aged are the responsibility of men and women equally, and only when men avail themselves of educational leave for family commitments as a matter of course, that we will have moved nearer to the goal of equal opportunities, equal rights and equal duties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The directive addresses issues as important as the definition at Community level of sexual harassment; it bans discrimination against women on the grounds of pregnancy and maternity in the workplace, and also includes the issues of adoption and paternity, guaranteeing the employee’s job or an equivalent job; positive measures have been included for sectors in which one gender is under-represented; preventive measures have been drawn up to prevent discrimination in the workplace on the grounds of gender – especially harassment and sexual harassment – ensuring that real sanctions will be imposed in the event of non-compliance with the directive; equal treatment in the workplace is to be planned and systematic, and reports are to be drawn up every four years to help us determine the real situation women have to cope with.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is a good directive, which deals with the problems women face far too frequently, in the workplace and in professional life and will be a genuine tool to prevent discrimination. The excellent work done by the Spanish Presidency deserves mention as well as its efforts to ensure that the Council and the Commission were able to reach agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This agreement would not have been possible without Parliament and the Council’s willingness to compromise. The political agreement of 17 April 2002 considerably strengthens the text of the common position which was adopted in June 2001. We can all be very proud of what we have achieved, because we have taken a significant step forward towards our shared objective of equality between men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we have successfully resolved all of the major issues and that we have, to a large extent, met the European Parliament’s concerns. The dossier was a complex one and provoked various amendments. I believe that the final approved text is a compromise in the noble sense of the word, because we are giving the men and women of Europe a tangible result, a very robust directive. We have made considerable progress in the fight against discrimination on the grounds of sex and we have ensured that a fundamental principle of the Treaty will be implemented effectively in the Member States for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="contents">A striking feature of the new directive is its clarity, which guarantees legal certainty and ensures consistency with similar legislation seeking to combat discrimination. I particularly welcome the new provisions that have been introduced: the approval of a common European definition of sexual harassment, with a responsibility for employers; the prevention of harassment and sexual harassment and the establishment of company equality reports, and the extended mandate given by the directive to bodies responsible for implementing the principle of equality. The institutions have shown their determination to reach the compromises necessary to conclude this dossier, and I hope that this will set a precedent for future collaboration between them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
