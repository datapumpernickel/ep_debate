<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Méndez de Vigo (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, four years ago, when I had the honour of presenting the statement on the Treaty of Amsterdam to this Parliament, together with my friend Dimitri Tsatsos, I ended that speech by recalling the words of Miguel de Cervantes who, when old and tired and weary of life, said that there were times when one had to chose between the road or the inn, between moving forward and staying put, and I said: ‘we must chose the road, we must move ahead’. Amsterdam is one more step in that direction. I remember that the Commissioner,<span class="bold"> </span>our good friend Marcelino Oreja, replied to me with more words from Miguel de Cervantes, telling us of the sorcerers, who can deprive us of everything, but never of our hope.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Treaty of Nice, therefore, represent that hope which the European Parliament had put its faith in? The answer is clear: no, it is not what the European Parliament was asking for, because the European Parliament wanted a thoroughgoing reform of the institutions; because the European Parliament wanted to prepare the Union for enlargement; because the European Parliament wanted to deal with the problems of concern to the citizens. The truth, however, is that the governments, which control the agenda at an Intergovernmental Conference, took a different decision and the agenda was, therefore, not the one the European Parliament wanted.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Nice has not resolved many of these issues. It has only resolved some of them, satisfactorily in some cases and insufficiently in others. I believe that the merit of this resolution – if it has any – and of this report that Antonio Seguro and myself are presenting, is that it is a balanced document, which reflects that nature of a Parliament which is no longer merely there to provide impetus but is now a co-decision maker. A co-decision-making Parliament means a responsible Parliament and, therefore, a Parliament which has to do things in a balanced way.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to pay tribute to all the members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs who have worked extremely hard to reach a consensus, starting with its Chairman, Giorgio Napoletano, and also my good friend, Antonio Seguro, who has not only been a solid and intelligent contributor, but also an honest one.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, therefore, talking about a balanced document, in which we explain what we do not like and what we want to see modified in the future, because agreements, and the Treaty of Nice is an agreement, do not last forever – forever is no more than an adverb of time – and are liable to be reformed. The Treaty of Nice itself contains the seed of such a reform. I believe that this resolution looks to the future, towards that Declaration No 23, which lays down the basis for reform.</p>
<p class="contents">In this constructive spirit, we wanted to help the Swedish Presidency, with which we have had much contact over the last few months, so that this European Council in Gothenburg may show us the future of the European Union through the responses of its institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, we want to see national committees set up in all the Member States so that the people may hold a genuine debate, not a phoney one, and in that way we will discover what the citizens want of Europe in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament also wishes to see the Intergovernmental Conferences prepared by means of a democratic method. We believe that the convention that drafted the Charter on Fundamental Rights should provide the model for this democratic method. Today, when we are seeing so many proposals from different people, all on the convention – which is a positive start – I would say that what the European Parliament wants is a convention based on the model of the convention which drafted the Charter of Fundamental Rights: on that one and none other; because that model was shown to be successful and it brought together various authorities in order to achieve the desired result.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the convention model, we want the result of that convention also to be the role played by the governments in the Intergovernmental Conference. We are going to make constitutional proposals, and we must not be afraid of the term ‘constitutional’ because, when we talk of competences or institutional structure, we are talking about constitutional issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The result we are seeking is a European Constitution, and I wish to make this completely clear, a European Constitution which makes everybody’s competences absolutely clear and, above all, makes it clear what each institution does within the institutional structure. We want this to be ready before 2004, before the European Parliament elections, so that the political groups in this House can go into these elections defending our choices.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I believe – and I recall my initial comments – that this is a path of hope. We are facing the Europe of the euro, the Europe of enlargement, and it is up to us whether this is a path of hope or a path which leads us to a situation of stalemate in the European Union, which none of us want to see. I therefore want this resolution to make a constructive contribution to this road of hope becoming ever broader and our becoming ever more European. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Seguro (PSE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Barnier, it will come as no surprise if I begin my speech by restating our disappointment at the outcome of the Nice Conference, at the options taken and at the timidity of the Conference’s work in Nice. We feel that Nice was just a continuation of Amsterdam and was therefore a wasted opportunity for Europe to take a solid and far-reaching step forwards, in its process of gaining political and social depth. The European Parliament strove to ensure that the Charter of Fundamental Rights was incorporated into the Treaties and the Conference approved the Charter but failed to incorporate it into the Treaties. The European Parliament wanted more subjects to be decided not by unanimity but by qualified majority, because the situation is already difficult with fifteen countries, let alone twenty-seven and the Conference decided on precisely the opposite. The European Parliament wanted the qualified-majority rule for Council decisions to be changed to co­decision with this Parliament, and the Conference did not do what we felt was right. Nice had the shortest agenda in the history of the Intergovernmental Conference and yet took the most cautious step of any Treaty reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Contrary to what we wanted to see, Nice left an image of a Europe of ‘national self-interest’, instead of a Europe of ‘a community of values’. An image of a Europe in which it seems that every State was looking after itself more than it was looking after Europe. Europe is not about each country looking after its own interests, but about all countries looking after all the others, in homage to the founders of this European project. Yet, the Council was aware of this when it adopted ‘Declaration 23’, saying and acknowledging that it had achieved a very minimal result in Nice. It also acknowledged, to a certain extent, that the method of preparing for this Conference was completely inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we feel that one of Nice’s other, positive aspects, was to enable us to make progress on the enlargement process. It is precisely within this triangle and this balance, which my colleague Iñigo Méndez de Vigo was discussing, that the European Parliament is positioned, bearing in mind the results from Nice, which were a disappointment, bearing in mind the opportunity to make progress on enlargement, and bearing in mind the fact that a debate and a new method of preparing and revising the Treaties are being initiated. This new method will enable us to take a more global, more serious, more coherent and, above all, deeper view of Europe. We will not achieve this by saying ‘yes’, as we did in Maastricht, to the Treaty of Nice or by saying, as we did in Amsterdam, ‘yes’ to the Treaty of Amsterdam, and nor will we achieve this by contributing to bringing the enlargement process to a standstill. What we must do, therefore, is engage in positive cooperation, in order to ensure that enlargement does actually take place. To put it in another way, the European Parliament does not wish to be part of the problem, it wishes to be part of the solution.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore state once again that our report does not attach less importance to the assessment of the Treaty of Nice than to the Laeken Council conclusions, but we shall take account of the Gothenburg and Laeken Council conclusions when the European Parliament has to deliver an opinion on convening the next Intergovernmental Conference. Why do I say this? Because we want serious and far-reaching solutions. We therefore propose, firstly, a new method of preparing for a revision of the Treaties. We want a convention. As a matter of fact, there is something I cannot understand: if the intergovernmental method failed in Nice and if the convention was successful in drafting the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which the Council signed, why do we not take the good example of the convention to draft the reform of the Treaties? In fact, I fail to understand why the national parliaments and the European Parliament cannot participate in this convention. I cannot see what the Council is afraid of, because we are not seeking to replace governments, but to participate on an equal footing with governments in the debate and in making positive proposals for the future of the European Union. Secondly, we want a wide-ranging debate, not one limited to the four issues listed in ‘Declaration 23’. The debate must, however, have a human face: we do not simply want a web site. We want committees, to add dynamism to the debate, and Minutes that show proposals which agree on the convention and we want the convention to produce a constitutional proposal that can form the basis of the future reform of the Treaties, which we want to be a convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I shall conclude by offering my thanks: firstly to my colleague, Iñigo Méndez de Vigo, for his experience, his competence and also for the honesty and rigour with which he worked on this project. Next, I wish to thank all of my colleagues in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and its Chairman, Giorgio Napolitano for the exemplary way in which he led the committee’s work throughout. I am also grateful for the way in which everyone contributed, even though at times extremely varying positions were held, to enabling us to reach a firm and strong position for the European Parliament, with practical proposals. Lastly, I wish to thank the secretariat of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which made it possible for us to have the amendments and the proposals in all languages in good time. Our aim, Madam President, is to do our bit to ensure that Parliament is contributing to a Europe that is closer to the citizens, a Europe that gives more backing to the Commission and Parliament and less to the Council, a Europe with institutions and bodies that concentrate more on looking after the welfare of all citizens living in this area and not on the national interests of Member States. Reiterating my utmost respect, esteem and admiration for you, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I feel sure that you will accept a memento of your attendance at this debate and I wish to say that the political significance of this event gives us great satisfaction. This is a small sticker, which says ‘Yes to the convention!’ I hope that you might take this sticker with you when you present your proposals and when you vote on them with your colleagues and the other members of Union governments.</p>

We are concerned with the historical task of uniting Europe and welcoming the applicant states back into the European family.</p>
<p class="contents">In the western Balkans, the Union is doing everything to prevent new wars in Europe, a new Srebrenica or further ethnic cleansing. So far, we have been able to help prevent full-scale conflicts in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and in southern Serbia. The EU’s future lies in coordinating foreign policy so that we can prevent armed conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union is also currently working on developing its cooperation with Africa. An EU troika is visiting West Africa at this moment. The responsibility and future of the EU also encompass a global responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Cooperation is now being deepened in a number of areas in Europe. Europe must mean more than a market. Full employment, equality and social and economic balance are aims for the EU of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union’s ways of working are now being developed with the legislation on public access to documents and with the reform work within the institutions. The future of the EU lies in an open and democratic union.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we know that there is a lot left to do in respect of justice and free trade, the fight for human rights and work on environmental issues. The debate on the future is about how we can succeed in these issues of the future and how we can create institutions that make us successful.</p>
<p class="contents">Through the Treaty of Nice we prepared the Union for new members joining and, at the same time, made clear our commitment to continued deeper cooperation. We succeeded in moving from unanimity to majority decisions in respect of a further thirty-five or so provisions. However, I myself – and many others like me – had hoped that we would have got further in respect of social matters and the third pillar. We also succeeded in extending the codecision-making procedure to encompass new areas in which the European Parliament, together with the national governments, can ensure that the decision-making process is democratically rooted.</p>
<p class="contents">These were important decisions, and we succeeded in getting further than just the three matters that were selected in Amsterdam. At the same time, most people are agreed – and I am convinced that we will have many examples here today – that the next Intergovernmental Conference needs to go significantly further than Nice and that we therefore need this broad debate on the future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">An important aim must be to make citizens more active participants in the European project. The Swedish Presidency which, together with the coming Belgian Presidency, has been given the task of getting this debate going has taken it very seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">The common website that the Commission is running went live back in early March. It already contains contributions from many heads of state and government and plenty of comments from European citizens. The website will be expanded to encompass all eleven EU languages, and I hope that it will live on in the debate which will continue up to and in parallel with the Intergovernmental Conference. The institutions are also planning a number of common seminars and conferences. In addition, there are all the national initiatives that have been started, both in Member States and in applicant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now turning for the first time directly to the citizens of Europe in our preparations for an Intergovernmental Conference. Their hopes and expectations will undoubtedly extend further than the four institutional issues pointed out in Nice. I think this is a good thing. I believe that the debate on the future is primarily about policy, and secondarily about institutions. Before we attempt to define our tools, we must know what the tools are to be used for. At the same time, we must, of course, also conduct the arguments of principle concerning the nature and being of the Union. That is why, as President-in-Office of the Council, I welcome the more long-term visions that we are now beginning to see in the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">It may be tempting to simplify the debate by looking too much at the terms themselves and too little at what the terms actually represent. For example, we see many people wanting to draw a clear dividing line between the radical ‘federalists’ and those who have more modest ambitions in respect of the institutional issues. However, each country has its own history and its own reference frameworks that help decide how the terms are viewed in that country. The very term ‘federalism’ is interpreted positively and as decentralisation in some countries, whilst it can be like a red rag to a bull and seen as centralisation in other countries. The same applies to the debate concerning a ‘constitution’. As quite a few people have said, the existing Treaties already form a kind of constitution. They contain provisions concerning the tasks that we are to have, the distribution of responsibility between different institutions and the rules of procedure. What is of interest is what the fundamental rules contain, not what we decide to call them.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, a contradiction is often painted between those who believe that democratic legitimacy emanates from representatives elected by the populace in their own country and those who believe that it must be sought in a new political model of European cooperation. I believe that we must try to find different ways of strengthening the link between European policy and national policy. Democracy is not a zero sum game. I am convinced that we can do a lot to strengthen European democracy without rebuilding the Union from scratch. When the interaction between the European and the national level develops, then democracy is the winner and the influence of citizens is strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">We must get away from the artificial division between what is European and what is national. Both national and European parliamentarians have a direct mandate from the people. What is to prevent national parliamentarians appearing more regularly in the European Parliament and European parliamentarians more regularly in the national parliaments?</p>
<p class="contents">The requirements for grassroots support and the extensive agenda will make special demands of the preparations for the next Intergovernmental Conference, and many people have said that we must find a more open way than previously. Some think that a small group of so-called wise men should table proposals. Such a group can work quickly, but at the same time this would mean that not all the countries could be represented.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people, especially here in Parliament, have proposed that we should use an open forum similar to the convention that drew up the Charter of Fundamental Rights last year. However, quite a few countries have stressed that an open forum, a convention, must not restrict or forestall the debate with the citizens. Once an open forum has completed its work, the result must be subject to debate and comments, and grassroots support must be sought for it.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may take a moment to speak as a Swedish President and Swedish Foreign Minister and not just as President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to say that I would wish us to be able to set up an open forum early in 2002. Such a forum should be given around a year to complete its work and have the task of submitting recommendations for matters to be included on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference and also of putting forward various suggestions in respect of the responses to, and viewpoints on, these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it is important that the broad debate continues and that we also take on board what is happening in the national debates. One way of ensuring this may be to summarise the national debates and to report to the European Council every six months. It will also surely be necessary to have technical investigations carried out, since the matters addressed in Nice are fairly complicated.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, I believe – based on the discussions I have had with Member States and applicant countries – that it will be difficult to find an individual form of preparation that is appropriate to all issues. We need a combination. I believe that we need a convention, that we need technical preparations and that we need to report the national debates.</p>
<p class="contents">The Swedish Presidency will continue the discussions with the European Parliament alongside the deliberations in the Council. The resolution that you are adopting today – I would really like to thank Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro – will be a very important contribution to that debate. This will naturally also form an important basis for the presidency when we present a report in Gothenburg. These issues will be given a prominent place there and hopefully contribute new impulses to the continued discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">I now look forward to your viewpoints.</p>

Please allow me therefore to illustrate and expand on it a little.</p>
<p class="contents">We totally agree with the phrase in paragraph 2, which says ‘profoundly regrets the fact that the Treaty of Nice has only given a timid response’. This is one of the great frustrations of the Committee on Budgets: that we have not been able, at this time, to deal with and resolve the budgetary issues before entering into the effective process of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">In paragraph 3 of the proposal of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs it says that the Conference makes ‘the decision-making process within the Union more confused and less transparent’. In this regard, and from the point of view of the budget, I will just say that if you look at the budgetary payments and compare them with the votes of the Member States in the Council, the voting procedure will perhaps not appear so confused.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to certain budgetary aspects, we, as I said, expected more ambition from the Member States, we hoped that they would now deal frankly with the issue of the budgetary procedure and that they would even choose, if you like, a model such as that in the German constitution, which has a ‘financial constitution’ section, which provides for financial compensation (<span class="italic">Finanzausgleich) </span>between the Member States, the <span class="italic">lander </span>of the German Federation. This was the right time to do it without waiting any longer.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still complete ambiguity with regard to the meaning of the Interinstitutional Agreement, to the point where there are 5 articles in the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline which provide for majorities not laid down in the Treaty. This legal problem has not been resolved in Nice. This frankly causes frustration in Parliament. We would have liked to have seen the financial perspectives set and defined, knowing that it was going to be a particular advantage to the European Union but not to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">This time, the financial perspectives are mentioned in the Treaty but not defined, which means that we are not progressing much. New activities and new spending are proposed, and it is presupposed that the European Parliament will agree, but the financial means for it are not provided for.</p>
<p class="contents">Because time is at a premium, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to address the President-in-Office of the Council because I have pointed out our different cultures, policies and traditions, but there is one thing that unites us all: Parliaments were born in Europe to represent the citizens by controlling public spending and approving the spending of the sovereign. The budget is at the centre of representative democracy and if we want a representative democracy in Europe we must make much more progress on the budgetary procedure.</p>

The European Union is strong wherever the Monnet method is used. The European Union is weak wherever the intergovernmental method is used. We see it in the area of foreign and security policy with the twin structures that hamper our freedom of action. We also see it, for example, in the fact that closer cooperation is used everywhere where it is not necessarily needed; but where it is needed most urgently – in defence – it is not used.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to remind ourselves why the Nice Conference took place. It was meant to strengthen the European Union’s ability to act for enlargement and at the same time to reduce the democratic deficit. In neither area were the desired results achieved, and as far as the decision-making structures are concerned, they were actually made worse. We therefore have to recognise that the present method is no longer working. I have twice had the honour of representing Parliament – in Amsterdam and in Nice – and I know that this method of preparing for the Intergovernmental Conference does not bring us the necessary progress. Only the convention can do that, with the national parliaments and the European Parliament, too, suitably involved alongside the Commission and the governments.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the open forum is no alternative to the convention. It may be helpful in making preparations, but the convention – consisting of parliamentarians – can channel that open forum, the public debate, so as to present to you as heads of state and government an outcome that will form the basis for your negotiations. It therefore builds on the public process, but it is not an alternative to the public process.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to see to it that the citizens of this Europe enjoy their rights. That is why the Charter must be made binding. We must therefore ensure that where this European Union has powers it is able to take decisions, so that its decision-making ability gains it acceptance. We must make this European Union democratic. There must therefore be codecision in all matters of legislation, including agricultural policy. We must make it transparent so that citizens know who is responsible for a bad decision. That is why the Council as legislator must meet openly. These are the decisive measures that we must get accepted at this Intergovernmental Conference!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it is also necessary to strengthen the national parliaments. It is not enough, as Mr Jospin has suggested, to bring a Chinese People’s Congress to Europe for major debates once a year. No, we must strengthen the national parliaments at home so that they can control their national governments as members of the Council! That must be the starting point!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We are now in a situation where the next two and a half years will shape the face and the size of Europe. We shall shape its face by conducting this constitutional debate in a reasonable manner and bringing it to a conclusion and by bringing about enlargement – both things together.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope we shall have the strength and not the vanity of many governments who think their job is to sit around where they are and stand in the way of progress! That is why we should give the convention a chance, so that Europe’s elected representatives, the European Parliament and the national parliaments can play a part in shaping that face!</p>

I represent fisheries policy. This is one of the few European policies, however, that lie in the sole competence of the Community. As a result, all the legislation coming out of Brussels in this sector affects the Union’s citizens directly. The democratic deficit of which we rightly complain is all the more obvious to all concerned. We, Parliament, the only institution legitimised by popular vote, continue to be denied any real involvement in making those laws.</p>
<p class="contents">I am referring to the codecision procedure, which, despite our demands, has still not been opened up for fisheries policy. The future of Europe’s fisheries from 2003 is being rewritten at this very moment. I therefore particularly want to reiterate, indeed to emphasise, our pre-Nice position today in the post-Nice era. A mere consultation of Parliament is not enough. We want to be really involved in defining the most important themes. We therefore emphatically call for the codecision rules to be taken into Articles 32 to 38 of the EC Treaty and ask for your support!</p>
<p class="contents">I find there continues to be a further deficit in Parliament’s involvement in fisheries matters when it comes to concluding international agreements. We demand that the European Parliament’s assent be made mandatory for international agreements negotiated by the Commission, which do after all have an impact on the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we want our own title in the EC Treaty, all that, dear Elmar, in addition to agricultural policy. It is only logical. Only then will we be able to keep up with all the rules and regulations of that now highly developed European policy!</p>

<p class="contents">On the broader institutional issues, presently under discussion, we welcome the report's call for a convention to prepare for the next IGC and for a debate involving the active participation of the European citizenry as a whole. We would ask that the convention engage closely in the course of its discussions with the social partners and with civil society. In particular, we would seek consultation, both within the Member States and with the applicant countries on the issue of the provision of a legal base for the involvement of civil society in the decision-making processes of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also like to see Member States being encouraged to establish fora where citizens can interact with their own Parliament's on the future of Europe.

It therefore deserves full support in this House, I hope by a majority.</p>
<p class="contents">As Chairman of the Industry Committee, I have presented an opinion which I would sum up by means of four points. The first refers to paragraph 3 of Article 157 on support measures for industry. The second is the financial consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty in 2002. The third relates to Article 181 A on relations with third countries, above all in the field of financial and technical cooperation. Finally, the fourth aspect relates to the unsatisfactory amendments of Article 133 on the common trade policy. All of them have the same defect, and that is that they do not resolve the clear democratic deficit which exists in these areas, where the role of the European Parliament, in some cases, is completely absent and, in others, is restricted to a mere consultation when it should have gone further.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that this opinion which is appended to the motion for a resolution will soon be included in a new European Parliament document, and I also trust that these issues will be included in the agenda for the coming convention which will lead to an Intergovernmental Conference.</p>

Our group believes it is important that we should also reach agreement between the groups in fundamental questions because we, the European Parliament, must be the guarantor of Europe as a community. We therefore have a joint responsibility. It was therefore also good that our two fellow MEPs presented a joint report.</p>
<p class="contents">This contribution by Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro is also a contribution to a neighbourly relationship, because partners who are very close together geographically often find it hard to work with each other. So this was a good Spanish-Portuguese contribution to the development of Europe, another positive effect.</p>
<p class="contents">I naturally welcome the fact that the President-in-Office is present here today. So far as the Commission is concerned, we always have the pleasure of its presence. Madam President-in-Office, we appreciate that. It is true that we were rather critical earlier. I hope that your positive example in being here today will also be an example for future presidencies. We hope that the presence of the Council of Ministers here in the European Parliament will improve decisively and that we will also come to an agreement on that.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to Nice, as many have said, we are not satisfied with Nice. The Council’s decision-making procedure is more complex than before. There has been no significant extension of majority decision-making in the Council. Above all – and this is very critical for us – there is no significant extension of codecision between the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers. We are actually rather surprised that in his speech, which of course also has positive aspects, the French Prime Minister says nothing about extending the powers of the European Parliament, but only says, and I quote: “The competences of the Strasbourg Assembly should be more clearly defined.” We expect the Prime Minister of a great country to speak out for greater democracy in Europe, for more powers for the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">What we need – as Mr Brok has already mentioned – are clear competences of parliamentary responsibility. The European Parliament is the Commission’s parliamentary watchdog at European level and in matters of legislation is of equal standing with the Council of Ministers. It is the duty of national parliaments to exercise more control over their own governments. We do not want a congress of national MPs, but we want the European Parliament to discharge its responsibility in Europe and our national colleagues to do so at national level!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The second and third pillars remain in place after Nice. We must correct that. That is intergovernmental cooperation, if we now look to the future. Intergovernmental cooperation does not simply mean that we are incapable of action, but intergovernmental cooperation also means that there is no democratic parliamentary control and no review by the European Court of Justice. Intergovernmental cooperation is therefore not only an expression of a lack of ability to act, but it is also in contradiction with our values of democracy and the rule of law. We must therefore change it for the future!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Madam President-in-Office, let me conclude by saying that you have achieved something in your presidency. There will come another time when we shall have to assess matters of, for example, transparency and similar questions. For our group, however, the crucial thing is how the future will go on to be shaped. We are not expecting Gothenburg to bring any obstacles that will prevent a decision in Laeken about a convention, but we expect Gothenburg to show the way for good decisions in Laeken so that we can proceed into the European future on the basis of a convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President-in-Office, I am not giving you a present, but not because I have anything against red as a colour. It is a nice colour. The content, when it is used politically, is sometimes not so acceptable. You spoke yourself of a red scarf, which is not always such a good example. However, we wish you much success for Gothenburg!

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to say on behalf of the Socialist Group that we support, and are going to vote in favour of, the report jointly produced by Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro, which has been produced seriously and elegantly and in a spirit of not only Iberian but also European cooperation. I believe that that spirit of cooperation could be extended to other fields because I notice that, in this post-Nice debate which we have started, the illustrious leaders of the PPE-DE are criticising the proposals made by the leaders of my political family: Mr Jospin (Prime Minister of France) and Mr Schröder. I only have one thing to say: we impatiently await the contributions of Mr Aznar and Mr Berlusconi. We all remember <span class="italic">(protests and applause)</span> the contributions of Mr Berlusconi in this House in favour of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, Mr President, I am not going to enter into a critical analysis of the Treaty, which has been the job of our two colleagues. I would like to address the President-in-Office of the Council because she has said some important things. Firstly, she has said that she has launched a virtual forum. This forum is already on the Internet; it is a forum and I am grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council that the European Parliament has finally entered the forum, in the latest edition. We could also seek formulae so that we can connect to our own debates. The forum now exists. It is a tribute to the Swedish Presidency that this forum is open and democratic in the best Swedish tradition.</p>
<p class="contents">She has indicated that it might be appropriate to create a committee of wise men. I am in favour of the idea that experienced political leaders should not go on the dole. We could look for some political leaders to advise us. However, in any event, no forum can replace the convention, because – and I would like to remind you that it is an invention of the Council, not Parliament, at Cologne – it is a method by which we do not make recommendations but rather we debate the issues and make proposals for the Intergovernmental Conference. In this respect, I believe that we have to be clear: it is not only a request of the European Parliament at this point. If am not mistaken, after a lively debate in Stockholm, the COSAC last week expressed its support for the convention. This clearly means that the representatives of the European people, elected on both European and national levels, agree that this convention should exist, in order to produce something which we consider to be essential, Mr President – and with this I will end – that is, an open, public and transparent debate, which will allow us to create treaties which are constitutional and, above all, comprehensible to our co-citizens.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cox (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, my group shall support the work of the rapporteurs and I congratulate them on its elegant balance. It is entirely appropriate at this stage that the European Parliament does not express a definitive view on the qualities of the Treaty of Nice, because we recognise – as the Treaty itself does – that more needs to be done. We want to be active persuaders and influencers in doing more, hence our commitment to the convention idea. I am very pleased to hear the President-in-Office's positive remarks in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">You have talked also about factoring in both the national dimension and the wider public debate. I hope I am not listening to the creation of a convention, which will be a sort of pub with no beer. We would actually like to see these things incorporated in a way that it would be vigorous and representative of a wider opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">In my country, the Republic of Ireland, in eight days time, there is a referendum on the Treaty of Nice, unique among the 15 Member States. In the run-up there has been a very active anti-campaign on three broad themes: Anti to say that it is not necessary to say "yes" to Nice for enlargement; anti to say that the reforms with regard to qualified majority and the role of smaller states go too far; and anti regarding the so-called militarisation of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Normally I do not engage in national politics, but today it is for a European reason that I want to state clearly for the record of the House that to vote "yes" to Nice in Ireland is to vote to remove the last formal obstacle to a significant enlargement. In good conscience, I ask people to vote yes and I myself, in good conscience, shall vote yes. It is a "yes" to make sure that we meet the political conditions agreed in Helsinki that we in the EU should be ready, no later than the end of 2002, for this historic journey towards enlargement. A "yes" vote is a vote to reunite Europe. I urge my fellow citizens in Ireland to take that into account.</p>
<p class="contents">There are plenty of criticisms to make of Nice with regard to qualified majority and the role of smaller states, but for people who are fair-minded and rational, none of the criticisms should be that it went too far. The problem with Nice is how much more was left to be done. Anyone who argues the opposite is playing to the gallery of populism, rather than dealing with substance and fact.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the argument about militarisation: as a Irishman it makes me sick in the pit of my stomach to listen to lectures from Mr Adams and other people in <span class="italic">Sinn Féin </span>who today still maintain an armed ceasefire in Northern Ireland, who refuse to decommission weapons, and who, prior to their entry into a peace process, sullied the name of Irishmen through a campaign of murder and terror for three decades. It is a travesty for these people to describe the one great peace movement of Europe, which is the European integration process, as heading towards militarisation. These people are themselves still incomplete democrats. We should not accept lectures from them on this topic.</p>
<p class="contents">General Morillon, here this afternoon, served at Srebrenica and other places with dignity, despite having a very difficult and effectively impossible UN mandate. We know that NATO and the US would not act and did not act. We, the EU, could not act. If not NATO there was nothing. We have a moral and ethical duty to ensure we are prepared for such missions in future with the likes of the Rapid Reaction Force. This represents responsibility and maturity in Europe, not militarisation. Again people in Ireland should not listen to those who preach about militarism, for this is a false premise.</p>

It would be a power-based generosity that I would not like to think you capable of!</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, if we are to resolve the crisis of European integration it is time to speak openly. We are witnessing and involved in a struggle for power in Europe. It is not a matter of federal state versus confederation or about a superstate versus subsidiarity. It is about democracy versus the national executives’ desire for power, versus a Europe of clandestine cooperation between governments and <span class="italic">de facto</span> legislation by governments. It is about transforming the European project from a thing of administrative elites into a <span class="italic">res publica</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">The Intergovernmental Conference in Nice was a failure. The EU has become neither more democratic nor more capable of action nor ready for enlargement. The Intergovernmental Conference has proved to be an unsuitable instrument. The heads of state and government are making Europe into a bazaar of national interests. At half past three in the morning between their calvados and the fireplace they exchange fish quotas for basic rights, agreement on enlargement for farm subsidies. After Nice they called for a celebration not for what they had done for Europe but for what they had deprived Europe of. Instead of doing their duty under the Treaty of moving Europe forward, they turned out to be advocates of national identity while expressing surprise about the likes of Haider and Berlusconi.</p>
<p class="contents">The same people who failed in Nice now want to be not only government and legislator and lords of the Treaties, but also the creators of Europe’s constitution! Honourable Members, it is time for Europe’s parliaments to remember why they are really there, that it is for them and them alone to create a constitution. It is time to show Europe’s princes that there is another Europe, a European democracy and a Europe that is a social area. It is the hour of the parliaments. It is the duty of the parliaments and I am glad that this Parliament is forging an alliance of parliaments for a European democracy! Ladies and gentlemen, I am terribly bored with the debate about a federal state or a confederation! We can confidently leave that to the next generation, but not the question of European democracy. That is the challenge if we are one day to be able to say: <span class="italic">Vive la République d'Europe</span>! Long live the European Republic!</p>

I and my group, too, are deeply worried about the future of the European Union, because many of the questions affecting people’s everyday concerns and needs have still not been resolved or are addressed only half-heartedly. Nice has weakened the Community. Nice was a step backwards in terms of integration. There is no trace of a strengthened democracy, more transparency, more freedom of action and ability to take decisions! As the report says, the Treaty has rightly removed the obstacles to enlargement in the most formal way possible. From this point of view, I should like to thank my two colleagues, Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro, for their commitment to their work as rapporteurs because their report reflects the predominantly critical view of the Treaty taken by this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The Nice Council revealed that the governments are in the end fighting only to preserve their national rights of veto. The Union itself is facing the greatest challenge in its history, but instead of energetically tackling the pressing problems, the governments dissipated their energies behind closed doors. In my opinion, the time after Nice must therefore be used to rescue the Union from Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to take up a few points here that I consider important. It is absolutely essential that the number of seats for the Czech Republic and Hungary in the European Parliament is corrected immediately. There can be no discrimination against these two countries in their parliamentary representation in this House. Post-Nice must tackle an ambitious, really far-reaching reform, a reform that must achieve two things. Firstly, the progress made towards integration must not be reversed, and I should like at this point emphatically to stress that I do not share the German federal government’s position on the renationalisation of agricultural policy and of the Structural Funds in particular because it amounts to calling into question one of the Union’s central pillars, the principle of economic and social cohesion and solidarity between Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need a reform that will actually make the Union viable for the future. A constitutional process must therefore be initiated the outcome of which will be the formation of a united Europe by the will of its citizens. This naturally involves a Europe-wide, broad and open public debate, that is essential, but I should also like to stress that Nice has shown that the Intergovernmental Conference method is out of date. It is no longer the appropriate way of carrying Europe substantially forwards. We need a method, the convention method that many here have already mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Important and essential as decisions about the future institutional structure of Europe are, we must not forget to question the contents of European policy. Europe’s future cannot remain confined to the market and common currency. I welcome the fact that French Prime Minister Jospin put the objectives of Union policy at the centre of his latest speech and did not, like Germany’s Chancellor Schröder and Foreign Minister Fischer, largely confine himself to questions of EU institutional reform. The debate over the content of European Union policy is in fact at present more urgent than the discussion about its final institutional shape and I welcome the fact, Madam President-in-Office, that you also raised the matter today.</p>
<p class="contents">Justice, solidarity and social policy must be central values and tasks of the Community. Jospin’s proposals for a closer coordination of economic policies and the formation of an EU economic government as well as for setting up an EU economic fund to assist EU Member States in times of crisis are therefore extremely topical. Social dumping must no longer be commonplace in the European Union, harmonisation of corporate taxation is in fact urgent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe the Treaty of Nice is a balanced agreement which guarantees the go-ahead to the enlargement process whilst at the same time protecting and promoting the entries of the smaller Member States. The Treaty of Nice does not build a two-tier European Union whereby larger Member States can dictate the pace of change within the Union at the expense of the smaller states. There will not be a fundamental shift in the balance of power within the Union as a result of the enactment of the provisions of the Treaty. The European Union will remain a Union of peoples and states. All Member States within the Union will retain the right to appoint one member to the Commission until 27 countries become full members of the Union, and even at that stage, positions in the Commission will be distributed between all Members on a rotation basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Decisions concerning key national entries will remain the exclusive domain of individual Member State governments, and any changes concerning taxation policies or social security matters will be left to individual countries to decide on. The unanimity requirement for tax changes remains the order of the day within the Union. This is very important, because I believe that issues of taxation should be addressed by national parliaments and not decided centrally by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement of the Union will promote and consolidate democratic structures in Eastern and Central Europe. It will help to strengthen new free-market economies of these countries, and it will contribute to making these countries more competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">The enlargement process provides the basis for a truly historic reconciliation on a continent which has been divided over the past century by wars and ideologies. It is incumbent on all of us to grasp the opportunities which are before us to help build a more stable European continent at peace with itself.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware in this House that a constitutional referendum on the Treaty of Nice is being held in Ireland next week. The Treaty is certainly a good deal for countries of Central and Eastern Europe, but equally for existing Member States of the Union. There is no doubt that the operation of the internal market has been a success, particularly over the last ten years, and from an Irish perspective economic success in our country could simply not have been achieved if we were not a Member of the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Treaty of Nice increases the distance between the EU élites and the people of the EU countries, who are being taken hostage as part of what might be described, at its mildest, as a warped understanding of democracy which also finds expression in this Assembly. What really was the background to the Treaty of Nice? All right, it had to do with the enlargement and integration of the European continent. There are only two remarks to be made about this. Firstly, that what is necessary for securing enlargement is not to be found in the Treaty and that what is to be found in the Treaty is unnecessary for the sake of enlargement. The crucial element of this Treaty and of the refrain that forms the basis of this report is to be found in the ambition expressed in recital F and in what follows on from this. It is a question of developing the EU’s institutions and, in particular of course, this Parliament as a surrogate for the national democracies.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of our group can essentially concur with the minority opinion, expressed by Mr Ribeiro e Castro, to the effect that what we have here is a warped view of democracy. We can see this in the curious provision whereby the EU élites are to supervise the democracies. What kind of talk is that? Is it not the people who supervise their democracies? No, it has to be the EU élites. We can see this in the curious proposal tabled in the last part-session, a foretaste of the new Article 191, ‘European political parties’. These are to be financed by the European Union because they cannot acquire money in any other way, partly because they do not have any members. What kind of view of democracy is that? Finally: are the various populations being asked about this Treaty? The Danish people are not being asked. The only people who are being asked are the Irish people, and I sincerely hope that, on behalf of all the populations of Europe, the Irish people will tell these élites that their conception of democracy is a misunderstanding and then vote against the Treaty on 7 June. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union increasingly resembles one of these useless machines seen in contemporary art, where the only important thing is the complexity of its workings. The whole thing has spiralled so far out of control – I actually heard the word ‘extravagant’ being used earlier – that some of the social democrats are beginning to openly call for a new type of nationalism, but, this time, one with a European edge, whereas even they are proving to be unable to shoulder their rightful responsibilities on behalf of their own countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Treaty of Nice was a failure, let us move swiftly on to a fifth European Treaty, which will surely be better than the previous ones with their countless directives and regulations. Of course, however, European integration is something that is so distinctive, paradoxical and uncertain that it is untouchable. The gestures made by the institutions favouring a ‘federation of nation States’ or a ‘United Europe of Nations’, as in the slogan used during a certain election campaign, cannot hide the reality that today’s Europe is merely a trading post that has one or two environmental concerns and is dominated by media finance.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone is well aware that the common agricultural policy is on its last legs. Guaranteed prices have been widely replaced by grants and a policy of high productivity has driven most farmers from their land. In this respect, the recent proposal by Chancellor Schröder, to exchange maintaining the common agricultural policy in return for a step towards European federalism, should remain unanswered, as, in actual fact, in order to save the last farmers, we must move towards phasing out the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Structural Funds, the grants of which gave rise to countless cases of irregularities, it is utterly unrealistic to claim that it will be possible to maintain the Fund beyond 2006. Let us keep the money that is still available for the candidate countries, in the shape of an increased Cohesion Fund, in the hope, of course, that these countries do not become disillusioned too quickly about the actual advantages that they will gain from European utopia.</p>

Almost everything has already been said about Nice. I should like, however, to take up one thing that Mr Poettering touched upon but did not really emphasise. I consider the call for the Intergovernmental Conference proposed in Nice for 2004 to be brought forward to 2003 to be mistaken. The arguments put forward for that are not convincing. For one thing we also have important elections in Europe in 2003. Secondly – and there is extensive agreement about this despite differing ideas about the run-up to it – the next Intergovernmental Conference is to be of short duration. It can therefore easily be accommodated after the elections to the European Parliament. Above all, however, the best way to meet the desire for a broadly-based discussion about the future of the Union would be to make it a subject of the election campaign. Bringing the meeting forward looks like evading the electorate and the electorate will see it that way. Be warned! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is true that the Nice Summit and the Treaty of Nice contain numerous contradictions and a great many lacunae, especially as regards the role of the European Parliament within both the future of Europe and the institutional framework on the basis of which Europe is to move forward from now on. However, the questions which we need to address from now on, as Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro have clearly stressed in their report, are important questions such as the separation of powers, the role of the European parliaments, the constitutionalisation of the Treaties and the future of the common foreign policy; questions which we shall be addressing between now and the Summit in Laeken and beyond, questions which will link future summits with the outcome of Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">I listened very closely to the President-in-Office and I have to say that I am not bothered about fora or websites one way or the other. They are all extremely useful. What I am bothered about, however, is the fact that we have not yet said ‘yes’ to the need for a convention at which all the political forces in Europe can express their official, coordinated views and can conduct an official, coordinated dialogue on its future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the fruit of long, thorough discussion in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, with Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro making decisive contributions. It is a resolution which combines effectively severe criticism of the Treaty of Nice and serious concern about the risks arising from its immediate application at this new stage of European integration which is now in progress. The resolution contains precise guidelines for preparing adequate responses to the fundamental questions on the future of the Union in constitutional terms. We set great store – I want to stress this point particularly – by the role of the national parliaments and our cooperation with them in every possible way.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not pretend to give instructions to the national parliaments on what they should do as regards ratification of the Treaty of Nice. What we do hope for is convergence on the proposal for a convention. Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the convention is not meant to be a mere discussion forum producing, at best, polite recommendations, but a working body that can draw up documents to be submitted, eventually, to the Intergovernmental Conference. When we talk about a convention, we are not claiming a role for the European Parliament alone, but a shared role for all the parliaments, all the institutions directly representing the citizens at national level and Union level, which is the only way to guarantee openness, transparency and democracy – as you have said, Mrs Lindh – in the preparation of the future conference. None of the governments, whatever their political persuasion, are hesitating over the choice of a convention. Ultimately, they should also be concerned about not finding themselves back in a cul-de-sac, back in the cage, back in the nightmare of that last night at Nice! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament will bring wisdom and commitment to the process and focus upon common European solutions. However, we also require the Member States to play a full part inside the convention and there are currently certain signals that some prime ministers are preparing to concede us the convention but then to withdraw their own representatives from it. This would subvert the convention and it would be an insult to this Parliament. It would also ruin the pretence that the European Council respected the role of national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">For the governments to absent themselves would leave us with a grandiose talking shop, it would be insufferable for this Parliament to be fobbed off in this way.

As the President-in-Office has said, it is an odd view that the European Union does not already have a constitution. Of course it does. It has an implicit and not very intelligible one, and the task is to make it explicit and intelligible and properly adopted. That does not necessarily imply a full-scale federation along the lines of Mr Schroeder. Those of us who believe in a confederal Europe believe just as much that it must be marked by respect for human rights, by clarity of democratic principle and by interaction of pluralistic constitutions, rather than a strictly hierarchical model.</p>
<p class="contents">Too often in this House we hear the term “nation” used as though it were purely co-extensive with the term “Member State”. It is a well-known fact, to those who reflect upon it, that there are more nations in Europe than there are states. One of the interesting features of our time has been, partly under the guidance of the growth of democracy in Europe, the re-emergence of internal democracies in small ancient nations of Europe like Catalonia, the Basque country, Scotland, Galicia and Flanders.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Free Alliance hope that the process which we start today will be marked by a respect for subsidiarity in a generous and extensive sense: Amendments No 5 and 18 from the Liberals and Amendment 28 from my own group are for us keystones of this process.</p>
<p class="contents">Surely indeed, this Union must recognise subsidiarity in a generous and broad sense, it must acknowledge the political and national diversity of the European Union and the debate on the future must take full account of the powers of the internal political units of the Member States, not only of the Member States themselves. In this election in Scotland, there is a debate going about whether there should be full fiscal autonomy for the Scottish parliament: autonomy is growing in all these small countries and it is vital that it be recognised. I was delighted that the recent statement by the Commission on tax harmonisation made it perfectly clear that there can be wide subsidiarity in these matters.</p>

I do not believe that this is correct. This is because the institutional issues involved in the enlargement are not resolved by the Treaty of Nice. Moreover, most of what was decided in Nice has nothing to do with enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">As pointed out in the report, the seats in the European Parliament must be redistributed since there is direct discrimination against Hungary and the Czech Republic. This can be changed in the accession Treaties, just as these matters can be regulated in general in the accession Treaties as they were, for example, in the cases of Sweden, Austria and Finland when we joined the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Nice is actually in the main about something else. It is about the power of the large EU countries being strengthened at the expense of the small countries. All the candidate countries except Poland are therefore also losers, because they will be small countries in the European Union. The decision-making process in the Council of Ministers will become more complicated, not simpler.</p>
<p class="contents">The second main feature of the Treaty of Nice is the increasing move towards a superstate and the disappearance of the right of veto in more areas. There are also some clearly federalist elements, for example, as regards the support of European political parties and a new process for appointing the European Commission, which will mean that the Commission will increasingly resemble a government with a prime minister.</p>
<p class="contents">The real significance of the Treaty of Nice is thus that an enlarged Union will be dominated by the same large countries as dominate today’s European Union and that the march towards the formation of a federal state in the EU is continuing, even if this development is not progressing as quickly as some in this assembly would like.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore not difficult for my party and for me to vote against both the Treaty of Nice and the report that we are to vote on tomorrow. However, it is important to point out that the report does contain some positive elements. It calls for open meetings of the Council of Ministers. It would have been reasonable for such a decision to have been taken in Nice, that is, to open up the legislative assembly to inspection. Moreover, it calls for a redistribution of seats in the European Parliament, which is an essential democratic requirement.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we do not believe in the convention method. We cannot really see the point of having a convention in order to draw up the next treaty amendment. However, if in the end we are to have a convention then we believe that it must be a convention for those who decide on the treaty, namely the national parliaments. We hope that the Swedish Presidency and the Swedish government will not move <span class="italic">an inch</span> from the idea that it is the national parliaments that must have decision-making rights over the treaties and that it is they who must control developments when the treaties are produced.</p>
<p class="contents">So what should have been done in Nice instead? Well, we would have liked to have seen a democratisation of the EU, a reduction in the power of civil servants and the Commission, an increase in the power of the national parliaments, increased openness and inspection in the Council of Ministers, a change in the dominance of the free market over environmental aspects and social aspects and a re-examination of the dogmatic monetarism which forms the basis of monetary union. Now we are instead seeing the social democrat governments starting to fall around the EU. There has been no actual change in the foundation of the EU during the time that we have had a ‘red-green’ dominance in the EU. The opportunity is about to be lost and the EU’s basis has not changed in either a ‘red’ or a ‘green’ direction, which we find regrettable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report does not concern the Treaty of Nice; it is about the post-Nice process, the start of the political circus at the Laeken Summit, which will be held at the end of the year. Nice is no longer an issue – it has galloped off into the sunset. The so-called crisis facing the European Union is a result of this federalist obsession. We could concentrate on reforming the institutions so that they function more effectively. We could begin here in Parliament, where democratic representation is so lacking in authenticity and so mediocre. But no! Instead, you want to reform everything else. You spend all your time discussing changing the balance between the institutions and this is the source of the fight for power that you are so ready to criticise; the struggle between the Member States and the struggle between the institutions. This has opened up the fight for power.</p>
<p class="contents">The federalists like invoking the founding fathers, but they would do better to read what they said. In his famous speech of 9 May 1950, Robert Schuman, said: “Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity”. This should suffice for us to disregard this report, which is full of attacks and plans, completely ignoring the practical actions that have been taken to achieve a lasting, de facto solidarity. Where is the real cohesion?</p>
<p class="contents">By the same token, I must thank Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder for having debunked one of the myths of federalism once and for all, which is the erroneous idea that it serves the smallest and the weakest States. This is a proposal to centralise power, to wipe out Member States, and to destroy social and economic cohesion. Exactly the opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want to see a United States of Europe, but a Community. We do not want a federation of nation states, but a Union made up of the nation states that we are. Nothing more and nothing less. Who is abandoning ship here? Who is actually destroying the Europe that has been successfully achieved? Drafting a European constitution is another perverse fantasy. If there is no single European people, there can be no legitimate constituent European power. If there is no constituent European power, there can be no European constitution. Treaties can only be reformed by Treaties. There is an Arabic proverb that says, ‘words are man’s invention for concealing his thoughts’…</p>

To think that two French people joined forces to undermine the European edifice, the cornerstone of which, for fifty years, has been parity between France and Germany. Everything tells us to respect this parity – geography and history, the head as well as the heart.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately since Nice, the Franco-German twosome looks like one of the couples made popular by the French artist Albert Dubout, and we now know who is wearing the trousers. This is primarily why, whether or not you are in favour of European integration as has been pursued for fifty years, no French citizen should ratify the Treaty which spells disaster for the interests of France as well as for the future of the European Union itself. I believe, if I may say so, that no one in Germany should vote for this Treaty either, since it seems obvious that the unexpected advantage gained at Nice by Germany is only due to the desire of our two national politicians, who behave much like Edouard Daladier, to come to an agreement, come what may.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this Treaty is not only worthless, which is what we are hearing from the whole of this House, but it is also dangerous, and Parliament would do itself credit if everyone of every political hue sent back their copy to those who, at Nice, made such a poor prediction about the future of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the very first Article, the report claims to believe that this text could remove the final obstacle to enlargement. That is not our view. This Treaty will not facilitate enlargement – on the contrary, it will complicate the issue. The protocol, which is supposed to prepare the institutions for this important deadline, is not at all convincing. The reform of the Commission will only take place after enlargement, and even then its content is extremely vague. The only clear issue, which is putting an end to the second Member of the Commission for the larger States, seems to hold little interest for us. As for the redistribution of seats in the European Parliament and re-weighting of votes in the Council, this makes the Community veer from an approach centred on States towards an approach centred on populations, which might help to lay the foundations of a superstate, but does nothing to help enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">In actual fact, the pursuit of a superstate justifies almost all the provisions of the Treaty of Nice, which are devoted to strengthening the institutions and the supranational procedures by extending majority voting to the crucial issues of sovereignty. One of these, which is the appointment of the Commission by qualified majority voting, would eventually transform the college into a government of Europe and would thus cause a radical upheaval of the philosophy of the European institutions that we know. The move towards the superstate relies on the belief, which the federalists hold dear, that we must react to the growing diversity within Europe by stepping up centralisation. In our view, this belief will make enlargement more difficult and, at the same time, it will increase the democratic deficit within today’s European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to explain this position, the Movement for France delegation to the European Parliament has just published a counter-report to the Treaty of Nice which, Mr President, I shall send to you and which is, sadly, our preference over the report by Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Very rarely has a European Summit taken place which has had such ill after-effects, as is mostly the case in very problematic births.</p>
<p class="contents">Presidents, a Chancellor, Prime Ministers and Foreign Affairs Ministers are falling over each other with articles in prominent newspapers, with speeches for prestigious institutes and statements on what Nice should have been like and what should be Europe’s future. It would have been much better if that work had been delivered before and not after Nice. Maybe we would not be facing this debacle now.</p>
<p class="contents">A great deal went wrong at Nice, but the most serious mistakes have been the complicated decision-making processes that have been created, which are even more complex and opaque than before, and the fact that on a number of scores, a qualified majority vote was taken without approval from the European Parliament. If this were to happen in a developing country, we would say, it was high time a good governance programme were drafted.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore best not to look back any more, but to look to the future instead and to improve on Nice. In this connection, I welcome Chancellor Schröder’s initiative to adopt the PPE-DE ideas of the 70s and 80s and to give them a new lease of life. Mr Barón Crespo wondered what had happened to the proposals by the PPE-DE Presidents and Prime Ministers: reinforcement of the European Commission, a European Parliament with proper powers, and a Council which has to hold public meetings in the form of a Senate or a <span class="italic">Bundesrat</span>. Our PPE-DE – both group and party – have stood for those ideas since the 70s and 80s. The question is now how to ensure that these proposals actually take shape. We are no great fans of wise men – we have had 20 such committees since 1979 – or of a forum which can be convened at any time. Quite simply, a convention should be set up of national parliaments and the European Parliament. When national ministers meet in the European Summit, they would then at least be covered by national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, it would be better if you were to adopt this idea. I wish you good luck in Gothenburg, and I hope that a convention will ensue. That appears to be the best solution to me. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Some indeed, as we heard just now in the debate, still seem to have the fanciful idea that this Treaty is setting up a centralised superstate: I find it astonishing that they can read the Treaty of Nice and genuinely believe that. Also outside this House, the British Conservative Party is campaigning in the UK election saying it would not ratify the Treaty of Nice if it were to come to power. This is not the case with their Members here, or at least not all of their Members here – I noticed that the two British Conservative Members in the committee voted for the Méndez de Vigo/Seguro report and I pay tribute to them for having done so. Conservatives back home, however, are coming up with this idea that this Treaty sets up a superstate. That really is nonsense and it does not seem to be doing them much good in the opinion polls. The public can see through this particular fanciful idea.</p>
<p class="contents">If you were to look behind you, you would see in the bouquet of flags that the Irish Flag has been placed where the European Flag usually is, in the middle of the bouquet, presumably because Ireland is the only Member State holding a referendum on the Treaty of Nice. Why is only Ireland holding a referendum? Why not Denmark and others? Precisely because in this Treaty of Nice there is no further transfer of competence to the European Union. It is not a centralising treaty and the critics, of course, know that.</p>
<p class="contents">Others have been disappointed with the Treaty of Nice, because it did not go far enough and because of some of the questionable compromises it contains, such as the voting system in the Council and the extra seats in the European Parliament. As work went on in our committee, however, we realised that Nice also had a lot of positive points. In any case if you feel that it had shortcomings, the best way to improve it is to use the process of 2004. Rejecting Nice would have caused delay and confusion. 2004 offers us opportunities to improve what our President of the Council refers to as the existing European constitution, the Treaties. Yes, it needs improvement, but so does our method for working on it. That needs to start with our preparation for an IGC: Not the usual group of foreign ministry officials, with all due respect to Mr Gunnar Lund, but a wider more representative body. Hence Parliament's demand for a convention of the Council, not just a forum. The forum is the wide debate that is taking place with civil society. We need something to channel that debate into a set of conclusions that the IGC can work on. That is what we need, an IGC at the end remains something that can distil the debate...</p>

It is positive that the informal barriers to enlargement have been cleared away and that the Union is now constitutionally ready for its important task of uniting Europe. Now we hope for a clearer timetable and preferably a date at the summit in Gothenburg in a couple of weeks’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, of course, major problems with the Treaty: it makes the decision-making process no simpler, no more efficient and scarcely any more comprehensible to our citizens. It also leaves much to be desired in democratic respects. Far too many decisions will continue to be made behind closed doors in the Council – without the democratic control, inspection or participation of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The method for the Intergovernmental Conference is rather reminiscent of that for choosing a new pope. The delegates are locked away in negotiations for several days whilst the world outside waits impatiently for the white smoke, a sign that a compromise has been reached. During that time nobody knows what is happening. However, now the next treaty is to be prepared differently – together with the citizens. It is important to remember these fine speeches when the plans are being made for Laeken. Perhaps it will be a convention after all. After all, it is no secret that the majority in this chamber advocate that in any case. It is the most open and democratic way of preparing proposals. However, now there are rumours that it will be a convention without government representatives. So what will it be? A talking shop, an alibi that the ministers then ride roughshod over? It is not a good solution!</p>
<p class="contents">It is also time to turn away from Nice and look to the future. We are doing this in the European Parliament as well, possibly not so much today, but we <span class="italic">shall</span> do so. Some Heads of Government are also doing so. Moreover, I hope that more Heads of Government and ministers will participate in the debate on the future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Foreign Minister spoke of ‘the term federalism’ and the different feelings that it invokes. This is true, and the substance is of course more important than the term itself. Federalism – with the different interpretations that it may be given – is, however, a vision of a more democratic Europe. Different visions of the European project are essential to the European debate, so that citizens gradually find out what issues they are to take a position on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They gained more votes at the expense of small countries. Large countries were also given a new right of veto based on their population. The Treaty of Nice was justified by the needs of enlargement. The leaders of small countries have approved the principle according to which the number of votes of large countries grows, even if the EU is not enlarged. This misjudgement on the part of the leaders of small countries alone is sufficient grounds to reject the Treaty of Nice. Declaration 23 adopted in Nice will increase federalist pressure for the EU to adopt a superstate constitution and use the convention method in its preparation. This is an unparliamentary and undemocratic method. The Treaty of Nice supports a federal republic along the lines of the German model and does not recognise the demand of the French Prime Minister for a Europe of independent states.</p>
<p class="contents">This report supports the development of a federal state and must be rejected, and national parliaments should reject the Treaty of Nice.

I have signed a written resolution – and I hope it will collect as many signatures as possible – stating that Parliament considers the Treaty of Nice a backward step for the European institutions. However, the deed is done and, at this point, we need to look forwards and try to ensure that Parliament and the European institutions march towards the goal of a constitution, no longer handed down from on high but built from below. I believe in that, and I also believe that it is a great goal, which does not eliminate the nation states but unites the peoples of Europe, as it is and as it will be, in a greater dream.</p>
<p class="contents">That seemed to be the path before us, but there is no point in ignoring new developments. The French Prime Minister, Mr Jospin, has, in recent days, been making statements to the contrary. The French government’s statements make no reference or allusion to progress via a European convention towards a European constitution. If I have understood them correctly, those statements – but that is how they have been interpreted – are saying the exact opposite. This is a huge new political fact which cannot be disregarded.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope France is not going to maintain this position in the future. I also hope the President of the Republic, who has the power to intervene, will correct this approach, but if the Seguro resolution is passed tomorrow – and I would have liked to make it even stronger – we have to recognise that it is a proposal contradicting the recent statements by Mr Jospin and the French government.

In the seventeenth century, the Netherlands consisted of seven provinces which were each independent and sovereign. Only certain matters were regulated by a common authority.</p>
<p class="contents">How did they deal with decision-making in those days? Every province used to have veto right in all decisions. Furthermore, the representatives were not authorised to render decisions binding upon their provinces. That was only possible following approval from the province. You can imagine that in an era of coaches, tow barges and carrier pigeons, this caused quite a bit of delay. Despite this, the Netherlands was in those days a prosperous world power and had, relatively speaking, a great deal of freedom. The complex political system evidently did not cause any obstacles.</p>
<p class="contents">Many in this Parliament do not spell a bright future for Europe. The European Union is said to head for a deadlock, unless more far-reaching and in-depth centralisation takes place. I would call that into question. Decision-making will mainly depend on consensus among governments. The past has shown that this can also be reached unanimously.</p>
<p class="contents">More important, however, is the EU’s future stability. That will depend largely on the extent to which its decisions are experienced as being legitimate. The EU’s legitimacy is a far greater problem than its complex political structure. However, the legitimacy of decision-making cannot be enhanced by centralisation. It is distressing to see a lack of attention for this point in the Méndez de Vigo/Seguro report. That is why I shall be voting against it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They deserve our sincere thanks.</p>
<p class="contents">Political closeness to the governments in the home countries obviously plays some part in the evaluation of the results of Nice. Whether the practice of appointing two rapporteurs from different groups will still be meaningful for the European Parliament in the future needs to be looked at carefully. As Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I should have liked the language to have been clearer. I know that large parts of the PPE-DE Group and not only my German colleagues agree with me. In our view, the results of Nice are not sufficient to create the institutional conditions for enlargement. We regret that precisely because we want enlargement and want it as quickly as possible. We have reservations in particular about the complicated voting procedure in the Council of Ministers, but also about the number of MPs and the composition of the European Parliament; that this should not be settled until 2009 is completely unsatisfactory, will create legal problems in the meantime, create injustices for some candidate countries and also cement the continuing democratic deficit because it fails to link the codecision process to majority voting in the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">Nice set out four topics for the new Intergovernmental Conference, of which the definition of competences is of the utmost importance for us and must be settled before the first accessions. Unfortunately, the draft repeatedly speaks of a constitution. I want to argue here for the clear legal concept of a constitutional treaty. Lastly and most important of all: the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference must not only be prepared for more carefully, it must be over by the end of 2003, and that means that the way must be definitively paved in the form of the convention, timetable and content by the time of the European Council in Laeken at the end of 2001 at the latest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have taken up the challenge of winning over a broad majority of Members, given a project, which, at the outset, seemed to be impossible to defend. Nice was the summit of interests, not to mention the summit of national egoism. In reality, no major European project, no exciting inspiration could come out of an agenda which was confined to the leftovers from Amsterdam. The post-Nice process now gives us the opportunity to reassert the importance of politics.</p>
<p class="contents">Before we start another rush-job on the institutions, let us clearly establish why we want more of Europe, to protect and consolidate our fundamental values and our social model, in order to give more weight to the European Union, and occasionally to give it more balance, in international politics, to say loudly and clearly that internal and external solidarity must take precedence over any prevailing egoism.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not need any new institutions. Let us strengthen the existing institutional triangle. First and foremost, let us find a better way to involve citizens in the preparation of the future of the Union. The new method of the convention that our two rapporteurs have been hoping and praying for gives us the opportunity to do this. Some new inspiration, some groundswell, must reinvigorate the old method of intergovernmental negotiation. In order to unveil this new round of European integration, let us allow our imagination to run free, and let us begin by saying ‘yes’ to the convention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The kind of late-night dealing and smoke-filled rooms that finalised the treaty was the unacceptable face of the EU and it is not worthy of a Union of 350 million people.</p>
<p class="contents">The focus should be accountability and democracy, but Nice was a shambles with the outcome for Ireland that we lose our automatic right to a Commissioner. I believe Ireland will vote "no" on 7 June in spite of the sneers of some elites here and elsewhere and that result will be welcomed all over Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Nice allows a core group of Member States to form an elite inner circle. They have hijacked the EU institutions and this will mean that some states become second class members including the new applicant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We need an accountable Europe that makes human rights a core value and brings progress on social and environmental rights also. The EU, which brought former enemies together for peaceful cooperation, is now being militarised. The Treaty of Nice could mean that a number of Member States could decide to go ahead with a nuclear-armed force even though other states do not agree. That should be unthinkable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first concerns its view of the Treaty of Nice’s content. It adopts an uncompromising approach in its criticism of the positions that were adopted there, considering them to be timid and inadequate, when what it should have done was criticise the steps towards federalism, which threaten the fundamental interests of some current and future Member States, since the applicant countries could not take part in a process of decision making on changes that will affect them. It is also unacceptable for the European Parliament to criticise the position taken in Nice on increasing the number of MEPs in order to ensure a more pluralist composition following enlargement, although it then tries to achieve some fairness with regard to the number of representatives from Hungary and the Czech Republic. The lowest possible number!</p>
<p class="contents">My second point of disagreement concerns speeding up the process of preparing the new Treaty when the Treaty of Nice has not even been ratified by the Member States’ national Parliaments. It is unacceptable to insist on a proposal that seeks to make rapid progress on revising the Treaty in order to conclude it by the end of 2003 without even guaranteeing participation on an equal footing for the applicant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point of disagreement concerns the method that has been laid down for following up the proposal to draft the Charter. This method excludes the participation of parties with different political views, which threatens the pluralism and the genuinely independent and democratic participation of national parliaments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After proposals from Mr Fischer and Chancellor Schröder, this week it is Mr Jospin’s stance that augurs a European future based on nation states. I listened to the news with approval, both because I belong to the Union for Europe of the Nations Group and because, since I was elected to this Parliament twelve years ago, I have supported achieving political union without sidelining the nation states. A confederation of states, respecting the principle of subsidiarity and respecting differences, would enrich a united Europe and its peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not agree with the emphasis placed on the convention model as the body to prepare for the coming umpteenth Intergovernmental Conference, because a Parliament which cannot change a comma in the text drafted by the convention becomes a democratic fiction. We have already endured that situation. We do not want the bill on the future of the Union submitted to us for consent as well, because that is the same as being told that we can debate as long as we like but we cannot amend the text. The future of Europe cannot be entrusted just to a convention, however enlightened and elite, but it must remain a prerogative of the representatives of the institutions and of the people's elected representatives.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also puzzled by the fact that there is talk of the role to be played by the national parliaments before our own Parliament has finally been granted the prerogatives proper to an institution elected by direct universal suffrage. We are beginning to eliminate the democratic deficit Altiero Spinelli spoke of long ago, but it still exists and we fail to eradicate it because we talk too much and do too little. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have had the work in committee and now we have to make a choice in plenary. Conservative MEPs will be opposing this report, not as a verdict on the Treaty of Nice, but rather to initiate a change of procedure in preparations for the next IGC and to raise the subject of galvanising public awareness and participation in the post-Nice debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The hallmark of the report is its proposal for the formation of a convention to prepare for the next Intergovernmental Conference This convention would consist of representatives from the Commission, national governments, the European Parliament and national parliaments and it would prepare the agenda and the proposals for the next IGC. We are not convinced this is the right course. Moreover there are a number of clauses that we Conservatives are unable to support in this report, such as the inclusion in the Treaty of the Charter of Fundamental Human Rights or the extension of QMV to cover taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, despite the connotations surrounding the subject of this report, there is no explicit "yes" or "no" given to the Treaty of Nice itself. It raises however the important points of increased democracy and transparency for the next IGC. We believe that there should be an early IGC. I agree with that part of the report, which calls for this, because this would place the main choices before the European public, including I hope by then some enlargement countries, so that they could make their choices at the next European election. I look forward to the debate at that time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a failure because it does not contain the necessary reforms for the Union to appropriately confront all its present and future challenges. For example, it does not include either co-decision as standard or the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Nice is also an opportunity, however, because the announcement of the next IGC leaves the door open to a new phase in European integration, whose objectives are to respond to the demands of the citizens, to put an end to the democratic deficit, to implement the European social model, to intervene, with our own ideas, in globalisation, in order to regulate it, and to complete enlargement without turning the EU into a mere free trade area.</p>
<p class="contents">Today more than ever it is essential that we opt for a bigger and better Europe, for a more political Europe with more European policies, for an enlarged federal political Union which is more democratic and efficient. Because our present situation must not be weakened in the future, by renationalising policies such as cohesion. On the contrary, we must complement the euro with an economic government for the Union, build a social Europe and provide a realistic budget which is sufficient and progressive.</p>
<p class="contents">The key to this new cycle must be to adopt a European constitution by means of a radically democratic process which goes way beyond Nice and is led by a convention, made up equally of the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament – whose final composition will have to be set within this framework – and national parliaments, which produces a constitutional proposal which will have to be formally adopted before the European elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, on voting by a majority for this magnificent report by Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro – who I congratulate on their work – the European Parliament, as we hope also national parliaments will do, will demand of governments that they accept this option and understand its message; Constitution and convention – not more Treaties or more intergovernmental deviation – and that they do not once again respond timidly to the great challenges facing us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All right, perhaps that is the case, but democracy is a human creation after all, and only a human creation. One thing is quite clear, however. Those who vote against the Treaty of Nice are voting against solving the EU’s most important problem right now, namely that of enlargement. That is how simple it is, irrespective of the reasons given for voting against. Those who establish the ground rules have defined the Treaty of Nice as the turning point for enlargement of the Union, and that is the case, irrespective of the fact that others want to see different ground rules. We could therefore try to find new ground rules for the future, but ones which do not affect ourselves alone but, above all, involve the people. Moreover, I must appeal to the media to participate in this process and, it might also be said, perhaps to take their public service remit seriously for once. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I regret that since it has gone on longer I must leave the debate in order not to miss the last flight to Sweden.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to the beginning of the debate and the contributions that were made then, I do not know whether I can promise Mr Cox an Irish pub with beer, or whether I can promise Mr Voggenhuber a European bazaar, but as I said in my introductory statement, as Swedish Foreign Minister I believe in a genuinely open forum – a convention. I can agree with what Mr Poettering, Mr Barón Crespo, Mrs Kaufmann and others have said, that a convention is an important part of the preparations. However, at the same time we must remain open to other preparations as regards national committees and debates, as regards technical preparatory groups and the like.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to come back to Mr Cox’s comparison with the Irish pub, where no doubt the beer represented the convention. I have also been to Irish pubs and I agree that the beer plays the most important role, but there has <span class="italic">also</span> been the possibility of having a mineral water, a fruit juice or a glass of wine, so we can no doubt show the same generosity when it comes to preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision on whether or not to have a convention will be taken in Laeken, but it is my hope that we will move in the right direction in Gothenburg.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like briefly to touch on the criticism of Nice. I believe that it is over-hasty to say that the decision-making process is worse following the Treaty of Nice, as some speakers have done. After all, we know the problems that we see arising when decisions have to be taken unanimously. Now we are making decisions by qualified majority in many more areas. At the same time, in practice it is often the case that where we have the right to take decisions by qualified majority compromises and decisions are forced through, and it is <span class="italic">very</span> unusual for there to be a formal vote. When we evaluate the Treaty of Nice I believe that we will see that in practice the decision-making process has actually been improved.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I would like to agree with the speakers who said that Nice was decisive for being able to continue with the enlargement and that Nice has therefore played an important part in ensuring that what is the most important matter for the Union today, namely enlargement, will continue to be important. As far as that is concerned, as President-in-Office of the Council I also think that it is pleasing to be able to state that we now have an agreement between the Member States concerning free movement of labour, which also allows us to move on in the enlargement negotiations.</p>

<p class="contents">The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development believes that the non-introduction of co-decision is one of the main issues left undealt with at Nice. Therefore, agriculture is still receiving discriminatory treatment in comparison with fields connected to it such as public health, consumer protection or the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the Nice Summit has left the public with the image of States which are excessively concerned about the distribution of internal power within the institutions and has led to serious doubts over the Council’s capacity and political will to reach the necessary agreements required by agricultural policy. These reforms must respond to the increasing demands of the European citizens, to the challenges of enlargement and to our commitments within the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we believe that following Nice the complex process of decision-making is becoming even more complicated, if that is possible, and this may paralyse the coming reforms of the CAP. We do not want this situation to endanger the guarantee of the European farm model which – we must not forget – is a fundamental element of the European social model.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, we ask that the next Intergovernmental Conference consider the modification of the agricultural chapters of the Treaties in order to introduce co-decision. We sincerely believe that the new agricultural policy, based on the principles of multi-functionality and sustainability, requires and demands co-decision in order to achieve greater democratic legitimacy, greater transparency and also – of course – greater coherence in the agricultural policy which European society is demanding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report under discussion today applauds the anti-democratic and reactionary provisions of the Treaty of Nice and lobbies for even more anti-democratic arrangements, such as the abolition of the veto and various other issues, the integration of foreign policy and defence and security policy, the inclusion of fundamental anti-grass roots rights in the Treaty and the facility to circumvent national parliaments by creating a special convention to table a proposal for a constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an unacceptable proposal; the people of Europe are already fighting against the thrust of it and will continue to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reunification of Europe is indeed a historic turning point, but a turning point which calls for a far-reaching reform of the institutions of the Union. The Nice Summit exhausted the intergovernmental method which necessarily involves difficult mediation between national interests. What is needed now is a constituent convention to define, before the European elections, a model capable of guaranteeing democracy and efficiency in Union action. The report avoids exacerbating the argument about the Treaty of Nice, but clearly condemns its limitations. However, we cannot remain silent, waiting for Laeken, at a time when influential spokesmen of national governments are addressing issues fundamental to the future of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Chancellor Schröder has spoken of a European federation, Prime Minister Jospin of a Europe of nations. I do not know what Aznar and Berlusconi will say, but I do know that the specific problems of the Community and the reform of the institutions are two sides of the same coin, and I do know that Europe must become a political area with a democratic soul. Parliament cannot stand on the sidelines of this debate. The future of Europe cannot be left entirely to market forces and confrontation between national governments. Parliament must promote a debate going beyond the pragmatism that ties the hands of the national governments. Because of the things we have heard, that debate also tells us we must be braver and more forward-looking if we claim to be realists. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sure we will find that tomorrow in the vote. I should also like to note, however, that this is the first time the European Parliament is not saying a clear yes to a European treaty. This is something new and different from Maastricht and Amsterdam. I think it should sound an alarm to the governments that negotiated this treaty. We are not saying a clear yes because we are not satisfied with the results and because we believe neither freedom of action nor, of course, democratic control are guaranteed in a Union that is now being extended to 20 or 25 states.</p>
<p class="contents">The formal obstacles have been removed, but there are still material problems of efficiency and transparency. This is a cause for concern. It is why we cannot say a clear yes.</p>
<p class="contents">We want something to be done about what happened in Nice. I can only agree that there must now be a convention to prepare for the next European treaty. It must have a clear mandate to produce a treaty that the citizens, too, can read and understand. It must be a mandate for a constitutional treaty, a document that will create the basis for this enlarged Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to confine myself to a core subject for this convention, namely removing the democratic deficit in the Union. We all talk about it, but we still have different ideas about how it should be done. I believe the most important institution for the citizens is the European Parliament, not the Council of Ministers. This Parliament must therefore be strengthened. We unite people, not states. We therefore need the Europe of citizens and not just a Europe of governments! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Until now, all the treaties, each in their turn, have been treaties which push Europe forward to a greater or lesser degree. This is the first treaty which puts Europe back.</p>
<p class="contents">For a long time, there have, in fact, been two stakes on the table and two historic stakes at that: the first is to build up European power and the second is to give those in charge of this power, those in charge of this European power, democratic credentials. Power on the one hand, democracy on the other. Then along comes the Treaty of Nice establishing European impotence for a long time to come; it brings impotence to the heart of the European institutions and it brings a lack of transparency, which is the opposite of European democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">These were the two stakes, and both have been lost. Which is why the Europe of Nice will not work. What we are, in fact, offering the countries which we have invited to join us and which are joining us, and some enthusiastically so, is a fools' bargain. They are entering a house in which European impotence and a lack of transparency are the main features. That is why I fear, even though I hear what is being said about post Nice, that post Nice will fail to come up to our expectations. In Nice, we bought a one-way ticket, which is why the Méndez de Vigo/Seguro resolution is a critical resolution. I would like it to be even more critical, however, which is why I shall abstain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to join in the praise that many Members have given to Mr Seguro and Mr Méndez de Vigo. I share Mr Corbett’s view that if the rapporteurs had not done such a good job then Parliament would in all probability have recommended voting against Nice. Despite the fact that I share the criticism that has been advanced, I believe that a no vote would have been much worse than a yes. The reason for this is that the important enlargement process would then have been delayed, which is not something that I want to see happen.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with much of the criticism. The major critical viewpoints concern the fact that following Nice the Treaty is more difficult to understand, which also affects our citizens’ ability to participate in the Europe debate. It is a difficult treaty that is difficult to understand. Moreover, it risks becoming ineffective through the fact that we have made it more difficult to make decisions by qualified majority. It is true that more areas are covered by qualified majority voting, but these are not that important. The really important areas were not brought into this form of decision-making, which is unfortunate now that the Union is being enlarged.</p>
<p class="contents">This is something that we must change. We need more decisions by qualified majority and codetermination rights for Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The second form of criticism concerns openness and the way in which the Treaty was negotiated. I have heard that some have likened the negotiations to the choice of a pope, with people having shut themselves away in a room and then come out with a compromise. No outsiders were allowed to participate in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not do this again. Let us start the convention, and let it become the starting point for the next Intergovernmental Conference. After all, it does not mean that we must not carry on national debate with organisations and others. In this connection I also think that it is important that we accept our responsibility as politicians. We must not make the institutional debate the main issue; we must start from the objective questions: What do we actually want to do with the EU? How is this to be done? What tools shall we use?</p>

This was also its main task. All fifteen national parliaments in the Member States will ratify the Treaty during 2001, irrespective of how dissatisfied and critical the majority here in the European Parliament are.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, we Swedish Christian Democrats feel that item 42 concerning the consent of the European Parliament to the accession Treaties for the candidate countries could be worded so as to be considerably more positive and welcoming. How will item 42 be received in Estonia, in Poland or Cyprus?</p>
<p class="contents">Neither can my party approve item 25, which opens the way for the introduction of a common European level of taxation – and with decision rules based on a qualified majority. All our historical experience shows that new tax levels and new decision levels for tax deductions lead to higher taxes and less money left for the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Another core issue for the decision-making competence of every national parliament and national government concerns defence policy. Sweden’s Christian Democrat party therefore cannot approve item 34 either, which calls for defence policy to be included in the so-called closer cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time my party wishes to welcome two historical improvements that are proposed in the report. Firstly, it is time to improve citizens’ and the national parliaments’ insight and control of the Council’s work and to make the Council’s meetings open when the Council acts as legislator. We must have this openness if we are to be able to talk about democracy and not just about diplomacy within the EU. In other words, we are in favour of item 11 and Amendment No 68.</p>

The debate that we are having today and the report that we are discussing is a first step in that process. It is important, however, that we do not allow ourselves to become prisoners of old ideas. Despite our misgivings about one aspect or the other of this report, we should be brave enough to give the leadership that the people of Europe expect from this Parliament, the elected representatives of the people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This report does not close off any options. It does not seek to give a view on the ratification of Nice. That is being left to the Member States whose responsibility it is. I happen to be campaigning in Ireland for a "yes" vote but it is a critical "yes". I have my criticisms of the Treaty of Nice, but it is important that we be brave enough to say, "Of course, we have problems, but it is important that the enlargement process gets under way". Most importantly in the debate about the future of Europe is the kind of Europe we want: do we want a democratically participative Europe, do we want a socially inclusive Europe? If we do, it will not happen by accident.</p>
<p class="contents">We must get involved in the debate, we have to persuade people here and in our own Member States. We must provide not only a forum at European level through a convention, but also ensure that there are fora in every Member State, so that people in each Member State can talk and debate with each other with other people in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Before the end of this decade, instead of being a major beneficiary of EU funding, we will become a net contributor to the EU budget. Fortunately, this is not having any significant impact on the attitude of Irish voters to the Treaty of Nice. Unlike the Spanish and Italian governments, Irish citizens are not being selfish about the effects of enlargement on our future share of structural and cohesion funding. Instead there is the positive recognition that we have an obligation to assist the fledgling democracies in the former communist countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, they have real fears about aspects of the Treaty. They are particularly concerned that the traditional, consensual, decision-making process of the EU is being abandoned in favour of a system whereby larger Member States will exercise power at the expense of smaller countries. They are also worried that enhanced cooperation could create a first and second-class citizenship within the EU. Furthermore, the establishment of the Rapid Reaction Force under the Amsterdam Treaty has worried some people that it will bring to an end Ireland's military neutrality.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not share these concerns, but Irish citizens need assurance in these points, not only in the context of this debate, but also with regard to long-term Irish interests within the EU. If they want to maintain Irish influence in Europe, and especially the respected reputation that we have painstakingly built up over the years, the best way of achieving this is to ratify the Treaty of Nice: to reject it is to reject enlargement and unravel the process.</p>
<p class="contents">However, no one can afford to be complacent about the outcome of the Irish referendum. Bearing in mind that voters will be going to the polls in both Britain and Ireland next Thursday, it would be somewhat ironic, indeed tragic, if we were to witness a massive rejection of euro-scepticism in Britain while at the same time it gained significant ground in Ireland.</p>

<p class="contents">Another reason for casting a positive vote is because what seemed inconceivable until six months ago, even in this House, is now increasingly becoming a possibility in Laeken, namely a true convention of the European Parliament, the national parliaments, the governments, the European Commission, together with the social organisations and the citizens. The citizen’s input is crucial to ensure that the convention does not degenerate into a technical debate for experts which is unintelligible to the citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, that convention may not turn into a no-strings-attached talk shop: practical compromises must be reached which only in the final stage are rounded off formally by the IGC.</p>
<p class="contents">Prior to that convention, we, as European Parliament, will this autumn have to put our own specific ideas about Europe’s future on the table, and the resolution is right to point this out. I would like the following: a European government whose prime minister is elected with a mandate on all matters which are best dealt with jointly, for example agriculture. This would lead to more political integration and a new European federation. I also want more subsidiarity, however, for that means that we will be better able to meet the local and regional needs.</p>
<p class="contents">More than anything, I want more democracy. A valuable, powerful, democratic European Parliament, elected by the European citizens, with codecision in all areas of policy, and with a European constitution founded on the Fundamental Rights Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we have a fine future ahead of us, and I believe that we did some sterling work in this resolution. I therefore hope that we as a group will be achieving a decent majority for a better approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Take the very topical example of the common European trade policy. It is based on common principles and there is in principle majority voting. The small extension now being made in Article 113, Services and Intellectual Property, is counteracted by six exceptions and three proposals to the Council itself not to go beyond the spheres assigned to it.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the consultation of the European Parliament provided for up until now is eliminated with the result that today, unlike in the USA, there is no possibility for Parliament to play a formal part in Europe, either at national or European level, in broad areas of trade policy. We therefore demand, as clearly formulated in item 27 of the Méndez de Vigo/Seguro report, that the European Parliament be fully involved in the common trade and external economic relations policy, both in the framing of policy and in the negotiation and conclusion of agreements – and here with codecision – because if the national parliaments no longer have any powers over common trade policy it is urgently necessary for the European Parliament to take their place as an element of democratic control and that formal provision be made for it to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Otherwise, when it comes to negotiations with the World Trade Organisation we as the European Parliament will be faced with an American Congress with full powers to act and able to give guidance to its administration whereas the European Parliament still has no formal powers in this respect. I therefore call on the Swedish Presidency to show the way forward so that the Belgian Presidency can get an effective revision of Article 133 adopted by the Council in Laeken when it comes to rectifying the Treaty of Nice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barnier,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, honourable Members, may I say a few words on behalf of the Commission at the close of this long debate, starting by reiterating how much I personally, who am in charge of the reform of the institutions for the Commission, have appreciated the quality and efficiency of the parliamentary debates held here or in your Committee on Constitutional Affairs under the chairmanship of Mr Napolitano over the ten months leading up to Nice. I should like, therefore, to thank you for that and to thank the pairs of MEPs who have addressed these questions in turn, be it Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, Elmar Brok and Professor Tsatsos during the IGC or Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Seguro, whom I should like to thank today.</p>
<p class="contents">We, the Commission and the European Parliament, have worked well together so it is hardly surprising that we have the same take on the contents of the Treaty of Nice. I have already had occasion to say, and I shall repeat today, that this treaty is, in my view, a useful, short-term treaty. It is useful because of the advances which it makes: Article 7, the reform of the jurisdictional system, which certainly needed reforming, more flexible reinforced cooperation, which we certainly need and the legal basis which you wanted for a clear and transparent statute for the political parties. It is useful, above all, as many of you have emphasised, because it changes the light from amber to green as far as enlargement is concerned. It is a useful treaty, but it is a short-term treaty. </p>
<p class="contents">What I mean by that, ladies and gentlemen, is that, in my view, the answers which it provides to the institutional challenge of creating a Union of thirty members which functions properly will not stand up in the long run to the problems which this Union of thirty members will encounter in the medium and long term. There are too many unanimous votes and too many rights of veto. We know full well that, with thirty members, this right of veto will be a source of impotence or collective weakness. Codecision does not apply generally to all Community legislation, as we wanted, and it is a pity that the European Parliament plays no part in commercial policy. Finally, to say that the voting system will remain or become more complex is an understatement. </p>
<p class="contents">At this stage, and before you return your verdict in all good conscience and responsibility, I should like to repeat that this treaty is useful, that it is a short-term treaty, that we need to take note of it, that we need to use it and that we then need to move on. Its main merit is that it paves the way for proceeding smoothly and quite quickly towards enlargement. Another of its merits is contained in the annex, as if the heads of state and government realised, at five o'clock in the morning once they had signed the text, that they could not leave it at that and they decided to start a new exercise there and then, as if they too had a bad conscience. Well, both the European Parliament and, more importantly, the Commission, will have to commit to this new exercise, which takes us up to 2004 and for which a new method has been authorised, proving that the intergovernmental method alone has had its day. </p>
<p class="contents">So now we have time to start a real public debate. As I said to the ministers of foreign affairs the other day we must find a way, in Gothenburg first of all, and perhaps in Laeken, but mainly in Gothenburg, of making an overall assessment of the national debates which are held, rather than holding a series of juxtaposed debates, a way of exchanging practices and information, of sort of cross-fertilising these national debates. The Commission, like the European Parliament, will be standing by at the Council's side, ready to turn these national debates into a European debate when the time is right. This public debate should enable us to make a sweeping examination of the weaknesses of the institutions and, over and above institutional questions, to start discussing the European project once again. </p>
<p class="contents">What is our common objective? Do we want to remain a large market which functions well with a single currency or do we want to go beyond that? How can we reinforce the community of values, the community of solidarity which has existed between us for the past fifty years? To prove that this European project obviously needs to evolve, but that it has borne fruit, especially with the Community model, which has functioned well, and with Community policies, which have been so useful. I should like in particular to remind you of the fruits of the policy for which I am responsible, the policy of cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what is so important about the major debate to which we are committed. Then, in 2002 and 2003, we will need to find a way of structuring this debate, of structuring our work so that we can prepare the final Intergovernmental Conference properly. That is why, in 2002 and 2003, as President Prodi said, we too are in favour of setting up a convention of all four institutional partners, along the lines of the model which worked so well for the Charter of Fundamental Rights, that is, national parliaments, the European Parliament, the national governments and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said which, I have not replied to all the questions raised, especially concerning the association of the candidate countries because we hope, in 2004, to carry out a major reform which will affect them directly, just as if affects us, today, in the Union. I think they too should have a place at the convention table. We shall also have to decide how best to organise the work of this convention.</p>
<p class="contents">We know full well, ladies and gentlemen, that this convention – and I say this to reassure the Member States which have concerns on this count – will not take any decisions; it will make proposals for the Intergovernmental Conference, which will then have to take the final decisions quickly and at the highest level. This convention, however, from my point of view and in the light of the different experiences which we have had and which I personally had in Amsterdam, Nice and in the fundamental rights convention, this convention is, I think, the best way of ensuring that the next IGC is a success. It is the best way of achieving greater transparency, of having a real debate, because the four institutional partners involved in this preparatory work and in these proposals have the means, just as you have the means, of going beyond these doors and explaining what is happening to the elected representatives and citizens of our countries. This therefore is the <span class="italic">sine qua non </span>to transparency and it is the <span class="italic">sine qua non </span>to proper democratic explanation. </p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to say, on behalf of the Commission, that we are in favour of this convention in 2002 and 2003, because it is instrumental to the success of the exercise started in Nice and to real reform – this time in 2004. In all events, as far as the European Commission is concerned, it will participate fully, you may be sure, in preparing the various stages which will take us towards major reform between now and 2004.</p>
