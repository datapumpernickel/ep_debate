<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sornosa Martínez (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, the real reason it has been possible to draw up the European Parliament’s own-initiative report on the implementation of the directive on urban waste-water treatment is that we in the Committee on the Environment concerned ourselves with this directive and followed its development very closely.</p>
<p class="contents">With this report we have shown that there are serious shortcomings in the implementation of this directive, despite the fact that it has been in force for a long time – it is more than ten years old – and that, furthermore, it is extremely important for all European legislation on water.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that many Member States have failed to comply with this directive. In 1998 there were many agglomerations of more than 150 000 inhabitants that had still not resolved the issue of waste-water treatment. Many Member States had still not submitted information on the condition of sensitive areas. Currently, many other cities of more than 15 000 inhabitants are still not treating this waste water in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that throughout this time the approach of the Member States has been so carefree, having implemented neither this nor other directives on the issue of water, that I believe Member States have been censured on more than 42 occasions for failing to comply with 17 directives in the field of waste water.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States have been censured because they have not provided the information that the Commission asked them for and because, of course, they have not complied with this legislation when they should have, and they failed to comply in full in 1993, 1998 and even in 2000. But, Commissioner, the Commission also considered that their behaviour towards the European Parliament was unsatisfactory, since the information we were provided with was insufficient and, in some cases, wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say that, initially, this report had an annex, which, following two debates in committee, we were forced to remove, because the data that the Commission had supplied us with was wrong. In our view, the Commission has shown neither the necessary strength nor will in this case to demand that the Member States provide data and demand that they comply with this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to say, Commissioner, that when we in the Committee on the Environment requested that this own-initiative report be drawn up, what we really wanted was for you to consider us as your ally, in order to strengthen the binding nature of this directive and to enable the Commission to force the Member States to comply more energetically with the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">In this report we ask you to admonish the Member States, to initiate proceedings against those that have not complied and to continue using all legal means within your power, all in order to ensure that this legislation is complied with. We also asked you, of course, to continue keeping the European Parliament informed, requesting information from the Member States and holding seminars. Lastly, we ask you to adopt all necessary measures to ensure that, with the proper will to create such legislation, and the willingness to provide as much information as possible, compliance with this legislation can be enforced.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, there is currently a serious discrepancy between the enormous quantity of legislation we have approved and which we are continuing to approve but with which, nevertheless, the Member States are still failing to comply, which is why we have before us two own-initiative reports – on nitrates and habitats – by the European Parliament. These have shown us that the Member States are also failing to comply with other environmental directives.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my view that, as European citizens, it is our right to have the Treaties protect the environment. In the European Union we already have certain principles (such as the precautionary principle and the principle of prevention). We also have objectives, such as the strategy for sustainable development. We have tools, such as the Sixth Framework Programme and legislation. The European Union is even considered to be the world leader in protecting the environment. But, Commissioner, if all of this is really nothing but words, nothing but reports, if the Commission does not demand that the Member States comply with this legislation in its entirety, it will be quite useless. You can count on us to be your allies in ensuring that this legislation is complied with, because otherwise, we will lose credibility and I believe that we are here precisely to support the Commission and to prevent ourselves losing this credibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schleicher (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the 1991 directive on urban waste water is intended to guarantee the construction and maintenance of sewage-treatment works in all large towns and municipalities of the European Union. Since these measures involve considerable financial expenditure, very liberal implementation deadlines were set. As my honourable colleague Mrs Sornosa Martínez has said, we must conclude today that not all Member States have made use of the time at their disposal; on the contrary, they have engaged in delaying tactics and – regrettably, in view of their failure to submit reports, we must also say quite bluntly – in obfuscation. The Belgian metropolis of Brussels, which is so keen to call itself the capital of Europe, sets an appalling example in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The fine report compiled by Mrs Sornosa Martínez mercilessly exposes the inadequacies. Most Member States have not even fulfilled their reporting obligations for the first date in 1998, let alone for the second date in 2000. That is bad enough. What is far worse, however, is that the Member States’ waters continue to be polluted by untreated municipal sewage. We are addressing many demands to the Commission today. It cannot act, however, as long as it does not have the power to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the large number of default actions and legal proceedings instituted before the European Court of Justice proves that the Commission is doing its duty. It is unquestionably the Member States that are in the dock. As Members of Parliament, we too should take action in our own countries. The call for wider direct powers of on-the-spot scrutiny for the Commission in the Member States, enabling it to intervene in the same way that it can already intervene in the realm of agriculture, is vehemently rejected by most of the Member States. Be that as it may, if we identify such gross violations by national governments of their obligations to implement European legislation, we must also find out why this is happening.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention at least three reasons. The first is the high cost, to which the European Parliament has drawn attention time and again since the directive was first debated. It is estimated that an eleven-figure sum in euros is needed for investments alone in the 15 Member States. Current estimates also put the cost of implementing this one directive in the applicant countries at about EUR 30 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason is that many directives require the Member States to submit reports, which considerably increases their administrative workload. I urge the Commission to examine, as a matter of urgency, whether this task cannot be simplified, perhaps by means of standardised returns. Some initial moves have already been made in this direction, of course, within this very domain of activity in connection with the various directives for the protection of water resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The third reason is that those Member States which have transposed the directive have gone about the designation of sensitive areas in very different ways. Should the Commission not spell out the precise criteria for the designation of sensitive areas? That might perhaps make the directive easier to implement as well as having the desirable side-effect of enhanced comparability. I should be grateful if the Commissioner could respond to these points too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jackson (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, very briefly, this is a very sorry story. It has been a bad story for some time and it is particularly embarrassing if you are Belgian, of course, or indeed anybody visiting Brussels, because the city of Brussels is one of the cities which has been in breach of this directive for the longest period.</p>
<p class="contents">My questions to the Commissioner, which she might like to consider answering either now or later at some time, are, first: does she not agree that the situation in this directive proves the need for a much more thorough impact assessment to accompany legislation such as this? I recall that when the urban waste water directive went through, the impact assessment was very feeble and never really gave any figures as to the likely costs. I am told that in the United Kingdom between 1989 and 2005, GBP 26 billion will be spent on upgrading the water system to deal with this directive. That figure was not known at the time when the directive was brought through – not in my country and not in any country; so the question is: can we obtain better, more effective impact assessments? Not just cost-impact assessments in terms of a global figure, but impact assessments as to the disadvantage of doing nothing set against the advantage of doing something.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I wonder whether I might ask the Commissioner to be very bold, because this really does come down to the question of Mrs Wallström's debates with the Council of Ministers. One of our problems is not only that the Commission does not produce impact assessments, but that the Member States are not honest about their capacity to put in place what they sign up to. What we really need is a system whereby each Member State is asked at a Council meeting whether or not it can comply with the legislation that its ministers are about to sign up to. A very good place to start would be the new directive on packaging waste. I am sure that every Member State wants to send its minister to Brussels to agree to environmental directives; that is just our problem. They agree to far too much; they do far too little; and this waste water directive illustrates the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate Mrs Sornoza on doing this report so well. We had many problems getting the information out of the Commission, for the simple reason that the Commission did not have the information because the Member States had failed to furnish it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Water is one of the areas which I prioritise in my capacity as Commissioner for the Environment, and I am especially interested in this question. Treated waste water is one of the most important tools for protecting our water and human health.</p>
<p class="contents">I have examined the information on the Member States’ implementation of the directive and share very many of the opinions put forward by Parliament in its resolution. Water quality has improved in larger rivers and many lakes but, nevertheless, the majority of Member States have either not done enough or they have acted too late. They have also been late in submitting information on the implementation of the directive, which has slowed down the Commission’s assessment work.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Commission, we have used a number of controls to ensure that the directive is implemented. These include traditional controls – including legal measures, which can now also include the imposition of fines – and financial support within the framework of the EU’s funds. We are currently taking proceedings against seven of the 15 Member States, and further proceedings will be brought.</p>
<p class="contents">The new controls are focused on raising the level of public awareness and on exchanging skills and information. A year ago, we ran a name, fame and shame seminar. I have also ordered wide-ranging reports on the implementation of the directive. This exceeds what the Commission is legally obliged to do. We think that the reports should be written in a way that is easy to understand and that they should be accessible to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already responded to most of the demands in the resolution. This is the case regarding legal measures to ensure that the directive is implemented, the publication of information on implementation of the directive by the Member States, including details of court cases, the condition that the requirements in the directive must be met if financial aid is to be received, the development of a comprehensive monitoring and assessment system linked to the Geographical Information System and, last but not least, cooperation with, and support for, the candidate countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to comment in English on some of the points that have been raised.</p>
<p class="contents">What about the cost-benefit analysis? Nowadays I cannot present any proposal without attaching a cost-benefit analysis. We do that regularly nowadays. That improves the quality of our legislation. I assume that when ministers come to the Council to decide on a new directive, they have also examined what kind of basis they have for taking that decision. Throughout the preparation of a directive we try to prepare it in such a way that Member States are consulted at a much earlier stage; that all other stake-holders are consulted. This takes time of course. But in the end it will result in better implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the idea behind this: to be sure that we have all the arguments, the whole debate, and that we have also looked at and scrutinised all the possibilities to implement a new directive which will improve the situation. We are moving in that direction but perhaps we should do it in a more organised way.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that this is up to the Member States. I would also remind you that the Commission implementation report does not stem from a legal obligation. We have decided to publish this assessment for reasons of transparency and awareness-raising. We have to rely on the data and statistics provided by Member States. It is also a considerable technical and scientific challenge to assess the facts and figures in 15 Member States. It is not an easy task.</p>
<p class="contents">You will also be aware that in the new water framework directive there will be a process of coherence and simplification. We have tried to organise it in such a way that we help Member States to report. That is definitely on track. We will continue to fight to ensure that Member States implement this directive and all other directives. In the future I am sure we will succeed in getting better regulation that ensures that there is also effective implementation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
