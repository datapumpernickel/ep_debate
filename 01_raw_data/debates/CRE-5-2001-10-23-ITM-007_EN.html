<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Costa Neves (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, guided by the ‘guidelines for the 2002 budgetary process’, approved on 3 April, Parliament has attached particular importance to improving the efficiency of the European institutions, with particular emphasis, in this field, on the Commission reform that is currently underway and on the quality of the budget’s implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, we must once again state our continuing political support for the reform of the Commission and mechanisms are being put in place to effectively monitor it, in an attempt to avoid both the delays that we have seen and those concerning staff regulations, in which we want to see the position opportunely adopted in the European Parliament resolution respected. These are the mechanisms of the long-awaited reform, which must be implemented by all the European institutions: an increase in the size of the external delegations, and also better coordination between the legislative and budgetary procedures, amongst others. These are well-known objectives and we shall continue to work to achieve them.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, and with a view to improving the monitoring of the budget’s implementation, we expect the Commission to produce a definition of clear objectives for implementation and a timetable for this, and we will see how the timetable is being respected in the course of the year by means of sources of information that are now being made available. It is not possible to effectively assess the implementation of a budget if we do not have both clearly defined objectives and the means of finding out whether these objectives are being met. It is also widely known that the European Parliament attaches clear priority to producing a more detailed study of the budget’s implementation. We feel it is important to be able to forecast the budget for the following year. Indeed, the budget is, by definition, a forecast. Equally important, however, as establishing the forecast for the following year is being able to see how this forecast is being put into practice and, in cases where this is not being done, to know the reasons why.</p>
<p class="contents">This will also contribute to making good delays in payments that have already been identified and to being able to pay out new commitments more rapidly. We want to eliminate outstanding payments as far as possible and also to ensure that new payments outstanding, or new RAL, to use the commonly accepted term in this field, do not occur.</p>
<p class="contents">Increased operational spending will also be promoted, with corresponding reductions in administrative spending. This is also related, as you all know, to a set of horizontal amendments, in other words, amendments that cover the whole budget proposed by the Committee on Budgets, and which are designed to provide an real reduction in the RAL, greater speed in making payments and also increased operational spending rather than administrative spending.</p>
<p class="contents">Along the same lines, we state once again our intention to only decide on the basis of the most complete information and, consequently, we hope to have the following information supplied by the Commission soon: on the one hand, and most importantly, the study examining the impact of the various measures that have already been adopted in the field of agriculture under the reforms laid down in Agenda 2000, as well as their budgetary consequences and also those of the BSE and foot-and-mouth crises, in addition to the prospects for changes to the agricultural budget. The European Parliament cannot be a budgetary authority in name only. In order to reach a decision on a given budget line and, even more, on a given category of the budget, we need full and up-to-date information. It is clear that, at the moment, with regard to the last reform of the common agricultural policy and the impact of the foot-and-mouth and BSE crises, we need more information. This is why we have been asking for information since at least March of this year, so that we can make an informed decision, both on the 2002 budget and on the Letter of Amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">As important as our concern to have information, we hope that new measures will be identified, which will provide a response to the situation arising from the terrorist attacks of 11 September, specifically concerning Europol and Eurojust in the fields of justice and home affairs. We would also like to see measures in the field of external action, on increasing humanitarian aid and a diversification of development cooperation, without, of course, undermining previously given commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we all accept that the situation arising from 11 September has changed many aspects of world policy and therefore, since the budget acts as a mirror for this policy and reflects this policy, there are bound to be budgetary consequences for the new situation. The consequences of this new situation are being felt in 2001 and will be in 2002 and in the future. We see these consequences chiefly affecting refugees, and the tragic problem they create, but they also affect concerted action in terms of the European Union’s external policy. We do not want to be systematically faced with <span class="italic">faits accomplis</span>. We can now, therefore, certainly forecast changes in these situations and these new situations must be reflected in the budget. The budget must accommodate them although they must not endanger other commitments already given by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We have the greatest respect for the 1999 provisions on the financial perspective but we also have great respect for social and political dynamics and where political dynamics are concerned, we cannot fail to draw the necessary conclusions. We have also stated on various occasions that we will not accept new needs and new challenges being met to the detriment of longer-standing needs which are still as topical as they ever were.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have great expectations of the report to be drafted by the Secretaries-General of the institutions on the multiannual study of administrative spending on preparations for enlargement. We even feel that, as a natural consequence of this work at a technical level, it could then be followed up at political level, with cooperation between the two branches of the budgetary authority. At this level, therefore, we will be able to draw political conclusions from information that we obtain technically, which is already being done.</p>
<p class="contents">Continuing with a different type of issue, but which is also pending, in the case of the Commission’s proposal, we are waiting for the drafting, in the very near future, of the proposal to mobilise the flexibility instrument that will ensure the means necessary for the conversion of the fishing fleets that were dependent on the old Fisheries Agreement with Morocco. This flexibility instrument is a mechanism provided for in the Institutional Agreement. It has been used year after year and we are waiting to see the corresponding proposal for the year 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of sectoral objectives, I should like to highlight a few to which we attach particular importance, such as that of improving the European Union’s competitiveness, to which the priority of more and better employment has been linked. It is not sufficient for declarations to be made at European Councils and summits. What we need is for these declarations then to be put into practice. More and better employment also means more and better support, more and better support mechanisms for small and medium-sized businesses, progress on the <span class="italic">e-</span>learning<span class="italic"> </span>initiative, which we would very much like to see have a corresponding legal basis and also the consolidation of common policies in the field of asylum and immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also worth making special mention here of the intention to support the competitiveness of Member States’ border regions in the context of the forthcoming enlargement, as well as extending the benefits of the Leader programme to cover the future Member States. All of these aspects are considered, in our guidelines, in the proposals for amendments that we have tabled on the budgetary proposals, and in the comments that we have included on the budgetary proposals. Of course, we shall also continue to fight to improve the level of payments. I know that this is something that the Member States often attempt to avoid, but the fact is that, if we want to see more effective European institutions, if, furthermore, we want their actions to have greater credibility, and if we want to see their results being more successful, we must have the necessary means to make payments. I would also remind you that under the terms of the Interinstitutional Agreement, in terms of the financial perspective, in 2002, the level of payments should stand at 1.08% of the gross domestic product of Member States and the Council’s proposals fall considerably short of this figure.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by expressing my complete willingness, in the period between this first reading of the budget for 2002 and the vote on it in December, to work together with the Council and the Commission in a systematic process to reach the most appropriate allocation of available resources and to find the appropriate responses to the challenges we are currently facing. Hopefully, after the vote that will be held this coming Thursday, the European Parliament’s proposals will lie clearly on the table. We would also like to see that our priorities are considered in all the discussions that take place between now and December and that they take account of what I have just said, which is that the position of the European Parliament and that of the Council must both be respected, so that, ultimately, it will be possible to use the best from each proposal. What we cannot, of course, accept now is something that we have never accepted in the past: a dialogue of the deaf, in which some people state their wishes and other people accept what some people say they wanted. In this specific case, and to ensure that real negotiation takes place, there must be respect for the positions of all parties involved, attention must be paid to everyone’s priorities and that a close look is really given to everyone’s priorities. Only by adopting this approach will the discharge of the budgetary process be worthwhile. Only through this approach will we ultimately have any guarantee of success and only in this way can we have any hope that the budget will receive a favourable vote in December and be approved. We do have strongly-held positions but we are also willing to negotiate and what we want is an in-depth examination of the proposals of all sides so that the final outcome is a balanced one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This week, we are hoping to take a big step towards establishing the 2002 budget. I, as rapporteur, have worked towards this for the past couple of months, and I have received a great deal of support from the MEPs of the other groups, Mrs Gill, Mr Ferber, Mr Virrankoski and the other MEPs, as well as from the rapporteur for the general budget, Mr Costa Neves. I expressly want to thank them all here for their pleasant and also very fruitful cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The trilogues involving the Council have also proved useful, and let me therefore count our blessings for once. From this year onwards, the Council budget contains a special chapter dealing with the common foreign and security policy. Since the Council now covers operational costs in its budget – which, unfortunately, do not fall within the remit of the Commission – such as for military planning capacity, it is necessary for democratic control to be possible. It is also important to gain a clear insight into the administrative structures which are being set up, so as to avoid overlapping with Parliament offices. That is not possible in a general Council budget if it is not clear how much is being spent on what and if Parliament does not give its opinion on those administrative expenses in general. We are therefore pleased with a separate chapter since, in this way, Parliament can try to gain some control.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that we have chosen this path, I hope that the Council will approve a number of rational and very logical requests by this Parliament at second reading too. For example, there is the issue of long and wild nights at the European Councils. In the midst of all this wheeling and dealing, do Heads of Government still consider the financial implications? I wonder about that.</p>
<p class="contents">During the meetings of the European Councils, the Dutch government is always equipped with a special calculator which closely monitors the implications for the Dutch contribution. But who is accountable for the impact on the European budget?</p>
<p class="contents">A pertinent example of this is the Nice Summit. In order to facilitate an agreement on vote weighting in the Council, compensating seats in the European Parliament were distributed lavishly. Who will pay for this?</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Amsterdam stipulated a maximum of 700 seats; we are now sentenced to 732 seats and the buildings are not designed to cope with this number. In the short term, the number of MEPs could run well into the 800s, and I had better not hear a squeak from the Council when it is presented with the bill for this.</p>
<p class="contents">An example of a totally different nature is the Balkans. Whilst, in front of running cameras, billions were given for reconstruction with one hand, the Council took away development aid with the other. In order to avoid any repeats, it would be wise to add a financial picture to the political conclusions at important summits. How much is it all going to cost us and does it involve new money? It would be a sign of honesty if this were presented along with political conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, the situation in heading 5 has changed dramatically since the Berlin Agreement because, in those days, no consideration was given to, for example, developments in the second pillar, the common foreign and security policy, the third pillar, Eurojust, Europol, or expenses for the European data protection supervisor. I welcome these developments, but I would equally welcome an explanation as to where the funding is coming from and at what expense that funding will be granted.</p>
<p class="contents">A second subject on which I should like to ask the Council to adopt a positive stance, quite apart from the annual budget discussion, is our request to consider how we want to give the taxpayer more value for money. During that trilogue too, Parliament talked in that context about setting up a political working party, which will enable us jointly to examine how we can give more value for money for, each year, we discuss the nuts and bolts and minor changes to the budget, but the institutions, once they are up and running, are not subject to thorough reviews as far as their objectives and working methods are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, we should have the courage to move away from the way things have developed and question, once again, whether all the institutions, for example, all the agencies, should continue to exist in that way. We are making a start this year at micro level by asking all the institutions to draw up a list of negative priorities. After all, we should not only add items to the European budget, we should also learn to scrap some of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Interinstitutional cooperation is another area where huge savings could be made. In this respect, I should like to make a concrete proposal. Since the Treaty of Nice, it has been mooted that the Council would need a new meeting place for its half-yearly summits. But the impact on the taxpayer and on the quality of life in the Leopold Quarter if yet another huge building were to be erected would be enormous. Let us therefore examine together whether some of the Council meetings could take place here in the parliamentary House, in Brussels or in Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">Look around you, as you already are doing. It is a beautiful building, and you will understand that we would not mind if cooperation were to develop in such a way that Parliament were to meet in Brussels only, and we would be delighted to make this environment available to you. Until such time, and until the seat issue has been solved in another way, we really are stuck with two buildings that need to be altered to cope with a larger number of MEPs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Bureau has drawn up a three-year plan which serves as an indicative framework for expenses related to enlargement. The other institutions, too, are working hard to ensure that the effects of enlargement are ironed out, and we cannot wait for these adjustments until 2004. It is not an option for us to be in the middle of activities, still, when the first new Members join. This means, therefore, that more funding is required prior to the accession of the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgets has noted that, by means of rigid budget management, it is possible, in the coming year, to remain within the self-imposed maximum of 20% in the category of administrative expenditure, although we have always said that enlargement and buildings do not fall within this maximum.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the subsequent years, however, I am not convinced that this will work again. Even if the other institutions implement their plans in preparation for enlargement, and even if Parliament faces higher costs because, by that stage, preparations will have got well and truly under way, in my opinion it will then be difficult to remain within the established ceiling.</p>
<p class="contents">Berlin in itself does not, therefore, merit unconditional praise. However, the intention to enlarge by spending tax money in an efficient, effective and desirable manner does merit such praise. Let it therefore be the guiding principle in the budgetary procedures which follow.</p>
<p class="contents">You will have gathered by now that I am greatly irritated by the Council’s stance, and despite this, I shall try to mention a few other elements from my report. I shall, first of all, focus on what it does not say. The report does not contain any judgment by Parliament of the basis on which expenses must be paid as soon as a new statute for Members has been approved, and that is something which I very much regret. Precisely because Parliament wishes to retain the power to decide on its own arrangements and does not therefore want expenses to form part of a package involving the Council, it is important for us to indicate at this stage what we want.</p>
<p class="contents">I should particularly like to ask the PSE and PPE-DE Groups to endorse the position which was initially included in my report, namely that, once the statute enters into force, only expenses actually incurred will be reimbursed.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention something which <span class="italic">is</span> in the report. I am delighted that the institutions reacted in a quietly positive manner to the request by the Committee on Budgets to take part in EMAS, the EU’s Eco-Management and Audit Scheme. I should like to warmly congratulate the European Commission on the fact that it has already committed itself to this, and I hope that it will set an example for others, including the European Parliament itself.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still room for improvement on many levels, including in our House, for example with regard to differentiated waste processing and the use of environmentally-friendly materials, saving electricity and setting up a mobility plan for staff and Members alike. Parliament has a model role to fulfil, and this also applies to realising sound environmental objectives. I would be grateful if we were to make a start on that next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Seppänen (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="italic">– (FI)</span> Mr President, the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community was signed in 1952, and was to run for fifty years. It comes to an end next summer and there is no intention to extend it. We are therefore to debate the last ECSC budget, now, with expenditure to cover the period up until 23 July of next year. Thereafter its assets, estimated to be worth EUR 1.1 billion, are to be transferred to the EU’s general budget, to be invested safely and profitably. Earnings from the assets are to be used for funding research in the coal and steel industries. It has been estimated that around EUR 45 million in earnings per annum will be available for these purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">The ECSC has not attracted payments for many years. Its expenditure has mainly been financed out of a reserve intended for funding under the operating budget. The largest item of expenditure in the last six months of the ECSC’s existence will, according to a proposal by the Commission, be in respect of social aid. Of that, most is intended to be spent on special adjustment aid in countries where production in the coal and steel industries has been wound down. In many countries the industry has social problems associated with it, and, consequently, the Committee on Budgets has decided to propose that EUR 16 million more than the Commission originally recommended should be paid in adjustment aid to Great Britain, Ireland and Belgium with regard to the special problems associated with their steel industries. When the ECSC ceases to exist, social aid for employees in the coal and steel industries will end. The Commission has not promised to distribute special aid out of the EU’s general budget for social purposes in these industries. When the ECSC ceases to exist, the social dimension it represents will not continue in another form.</p>
<p class="contents">The ECSC’s resources have been used to finance important research. Although earnings from the ECSC research fund will be channelled exclusively into research after it ceases to exist, there will be less money available than there is now. For example, early next year EUR 72 million will still be channelled into research. That is a considerable sum compared with the EUR 45 million that represents the earnings from the ECSC’s net assets that will be used for research. Consequently, we could say that the fact that the European Coal and Steel Community is coming to an end makes for a negative situation from the point of view of social action and research.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is charging quite a sum in compensation for earnings from ECSC funds under the guise of managing the investment of the ECSC assets and allocating money for research: EUR 3.5 million a year. That will pay the salaries of more than 30 officials employed to manage the ECSC’s remaining functions. The activities involved are so limited in scope that the officials seem to form just one group, which will not suffer from the ECSC’s cessation of operations the way the workers and researchers in the coal and steel industries will. The Treaty’s cessation will have surprisingly little effect on the lives of the officials who have been attending to the ECSC’s banking business and are managing its effects. This brings to light the inefficiency of the new organisation of the Commission’s functions.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a problem I wish to draw attention to, although it is not strictly relevant to this report. The legal basis for the Coal and Steel Community Research Fund was established by the Treaty of Nice. If the Treaty of Nice is not in force next July, there will be no legal basis for any subsequent management of the estate. The Commission must adopt a position on this swiftly.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is good reason to say a few positive words in memory of everything the ECSC has achieved, not least the fact that the European Coal and Steel Community has probably been one of the institutions that had an impact on building peace and international co-operation in Europe after the Second World War. While it was in operation its Member States did not wage war on each other. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vande Lanotte,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in a few days’ time, you will be voting at first reading on the amendments to the draft budget as it was drafted by the Council in July. I already had the honour of making an explanatory statement concerning this draft budget at the part-session in September. I will therefore not enter into any detail today. Instead, I should briefly like to outline the aspects which will undoubtedly be on the agenda in the framework of our dialogue. I hope that this dialogue will be fruitful, so that we can reach an agreement which is satisfactory to everyone, but particularly to the European citizens, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to reiterate quite emphatically that the presidency would like to reach an agreement on the 2002 budget as early as November at second reading of the Council. A few days after your first reading, the overall structure will be in place and the different positions will be known. In November, we should consequently be able to put the finishing touches to the activities which will culminate in a sound budget for 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, it seems useful to me to remind ourselves briefly of the guidelines which the Council used when it compiled the draft budget, in respect of which you will be proposing amendments in the next couple of days. This draft budget is able to fund all policy components and priorities of the European Union, without imposing too great a burden on the Member States that work towards achieving stricter control of government finances. At the same time, however, notably under the ceilings of heading 3 of the financial perspectives and of heading 4, it creates some leeway for coping with new priorities. For that purpose, the Council has made sure that the different actions of the European Union are funded appropriately within the available financial means under the ceilings of the financial perspectives, in connection with which no changes have been made to the funds allocated to programmes on which a decision was made in the codecision procedure, whilst the extent of the commitment appropriations has been determined on the basis of implementation options.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Council has paid particular attention to the development of payment appropriations by curbing and controlling their growth compared to 2001. In this context, particular consideration was given to the implementation options and the expected rate of payments in connection with commitments outstanding and national budgetary requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">After these general considerations, I should like to broach a few subjects which will be on the agenda in the next couple of weeks and these concern, of course, agricultural expenditure. As you know, the Council did not adopt the Commission’s proposal at first reading and has asked the Commission for a detailed analysis of the requirements. During the conciliation meeting of 20 July, Parliament sided with the Council, and I have every faith that, once we have discussed the letter of amendment which the Commission will be sending us shortly, we will reach an agreement through which we will be able to cushion the effects of the different crises. I think that I can already say that, at the moment, it is becoming increasingly clear that, in this connection, a solution is certainly in the offing.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the other agricultural expenses are concerned, when the Council’s draft budget provided for an increase in the appropriations, although they were still slightly below those which the Commission had initially put forward in its preliminary draft, consideration was given to the effects which the decisions by the European Council of Berlin would have on the reorganisation of the common agricultural policy. When we analyse the final appropriations to be included in the 2002 budget, we must obviously take account of the most recent data in the letter of amendment concerning agricultural expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to turn to a second point which, according to the Interinstitutional Agreement, is also pertinent, in the framework of the letter of amendment which the Commission will be sending us shortly, namely the financial implications of the delay in the fisheries agreement with Morocco, together with the funding and restructuring of the fishing fleet in question.</p>
<p class="contents">In July, the Council followed the Commission’s preliminary draft of the budget as far as the international fisheries agreement was concerned, and the Council asked the Commission only to use these appropriations for other fisheries agreements. It is unfortunate that this position by the Council in July did not lead to an agreement. With regard to the structural measures, heading 2 of the financial perspectives, the Council insisted on including this entire heading in the budget in the form of commitment appropriations in accordance with the conclusions of the European Council of Berlin of March 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I should like to point out that the Council, at the time of compiling its draft budget, did not have a full overview of the situation, and that it stated that it would review the situation in the light of the letter of amendment in the autumn, which is prescribed according to the Interinstitutional Agreement. The Council will do this as soon as it has received the letter. I would remind you that the appropriations for international fisheries agreements, in accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement, fall within compulsory expenditure, whether they are indicated in the budget line or in the reserve.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the letter of amendment, to which some of our discussions in the coming weeks will relate, I should like to note that the Council expects a balance estimate for the 2001 budget year to be included. This request is an illustration of the principle of good management, which means that the budget burden for the individual European taxpayers will, where possible, not become any heavier.</p>
<p class="contents">I know how much importance the European Parliament attaches to the expenditure under heading 3 of the financial perspectives. That is why the Council has ensured that its draft budget sufficiently covers the priorities of the EU’s internal policy, notably the honouring of commitments concerning the funding of multi-annual programmes, in respect of which both our institutions have taken a decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also point out that, at first reading, the Council increased appropriations in its draft budget in order to launch Eurojust and the SISII system for Schengen. The Commission had proposed the budget lines for this in its preliminary draft. In the current climate, these objectives are more topical than when we compiled the draft budget back in July. In this way, the Council has created a margin of EUR 110 billion which is wider than the margin in the Commission’s preliminary draft budget. This margin should be sufficient to cover priorities, some of which, including <span class="italic">e</span>-learning and immigration, will undoubtedly be mentioned by your rapporteur or, in any event, will be suggested at our forthcoming dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> I would now like to turn my attention to the funding of the EU’s external measures, as included in heading 4 of the financial perspectives. The Council has largely followed the Commission’s preliminary draft budget. The Council has also made an effort to allocate resources to the different priorities in the field of external measures. For example, the Council has created a margin of EUR 100 million under the ceiling of heading 4 of the financial perspectives, which should enable us to shore up the priorities in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to this heading 4 of the financial perspectives, I should nevertheless like to point out one particular aspect pertaining to the appropriations for the common foreign and security policy. I very much regret the fact that, during the conciliation meeting of 20 July involving the European Parliament and the Council, an agreement was still not reached with regard to the level of appropriations to be included. That is why the Council has adopted the amounts in its draft budget which the Commission proposed in its preliminary draft. I have to confess that I do not fully grasp why requests for a reduction in these amounts were made. You will agree with me that these amounts, which are already lower than in 2001, are very modest as they are and are really the bare minimum to ensure that Europe can play a prominent role on the world stage. The wish to reduce these amounts at such a crucial time as in the current international crisis could particularly harm the EU’s credibility. I do not believe that that is what is intended.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to move on to the administrative expenditure of the institutions. When the Council compiled the draft budget, it was motivated by the wish to meet the needs of the institutions as much as possible, taking into account their specific characteristics. In the draft budget, there is a surplus left over to the tune of EUR 53 million under the ceiling of heading 5 of the financial perspectives, which allows new needs in the field of administrative expenditure, notably for the budget of the European data protection supervisor, to be accommodated. In this connection, the Council recently sent you its letter of amendment No 1 for 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, I am of the opinion that each of the institutions represented here are acutely aware of the pressure which the ceilings of heading 5 are under. A first step in this connection was the agreement that was reached during the conciliation meeting of 20 July involving the European Parliament and the Council concerning a request to the Secretaries-General of the institutions to compile a report for the benefit of the budgetary authority by the time the Budgetary Council is held in November. This report should comprise a multi-annual analysis of heading 5, as well as proposals concerning necessary economy measures to prevent the maximum allocated to this heading being exceeded, also in the framework of enlargement. In the light of this report, the follow-up action that needs to be taken should subsequently be determined. I should already like to underline that a number of suggestions made a moment ago in connection with the report are certainly worth looking at further.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to mention another aspect concerning administrative expenditure, notably the Commission’s staffing requests. The Council continues to support the reforms on which the Commission is working, and agreed at first reading to the creation of 78 new offices requested by the external delegations in the framework of decentralisation. With regard to the other 239 offices, the Council failed to adopt a position on 20 July because, on the one hand, it requires more clarity concerning the decision on the regulation for the definitive termination of service by Commission officials and, on the other hand, it nurses the hope that your discussions on this matter will yield a solution which can accommodate our respective wishes.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish this list of the different points which will be occupying our minds for the next couple of weeks by returning to a question with which you are all too familiar, namely the extent of payment appropriations. First of all, I am delighted that the European Parliament and the Commission share the Council’s concern as to the commitments outstanding (in our Community jargon also known as the ‘RAL’). The progress report of 30 June 2001, requested by the Commission in the framework of the previous budgetary procedure, is certainly useful in this connection. However, I should like to point out that the vast increase in payment appropriations is not a cure-all for RAL absorption. This is evident from the extent of the balances over the past budget years which were repaid to the Member States. On the one hand, there will still be commitments outstanding as a logical extension of the split appropriations, while, on the other hand, the improved follow-up of the commitment appropriations, notably by an opt-out policy, is also an effective means of absorbing potentially abnormal RALs.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the extent of payment appropriations in the draft budget, the Council has expressed a preference for limited and controlled growth. Indeed, the Council is striving to include payment appropriations which correspond to the actual implementation options. In this way, we prevent the individual European taxpayers from being faced with too heavy a burden.</p>
<p class="contents">I have given you a brief outline of the points which will undoubtedly be the topic of discussion over the next couple of weeks. The seriousness with which the Commission and the two arms of the budgetary authority are treating the start of this new budgetary procedure is obvious to me, and a source of real pleasure to me. It is my wish for the budgetary discussions, after you have cast your votes in a couple of days, to be continued in the same spirit and, if possible, for agreement to be reached as early as November about a budget of the European Communities for the 2002 budget year which will provide us with the resources to meet the priorities and challenges which the European Union will be facing shortly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Flexibility and provision for a rapid and appropriate response to new financial demands on the European Union and on a common European policy. The current year has indeed shown what demands can be made on a budget, demands that cannot be planned for or envisaged in advance. We had the BSE crisis and foot-and-mouth disease, we now have the new Global Health Fund<span class="italic"> </span>project that has come into being this year, greater demands are being made on our humanitarian aid, not only in Afghanistan, but also because of the escalating situation in the Middle East; Palestine's dependency on external aid, including from Europe, has continually increased.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU's budget quite clearly needs the capacity to respond to crises and to surmount them, and we have – I believe – managed in the past two years to draft the Budget so as to cope with this demand. I am optimistic that we will manage it for next year too.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, I would like, on behalf of the Commission, to thank the rapporteurs for the 2002 Budget, first of all you, Mr Costa Neves, but also Mrs Buitenweg, Mr Seppänen and of course the entire Committee on Budgets for the work you have put in. Anyone who has seen the mountains of amendments that the Committee on Budgets again had to get to grips with this year, will know what is meant by hard committee work.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, though, a great deal of work ahead of us, and we have a long way to go. Flexibility and willingness to compromise are required of us all. Of course, I know that the Belgian Presidency of the Council is endeavouring to pass a good EU Budget, which will fulfil all requirements. I thank you, Mr Vande Lanotte, for re-emphasising in your speech this aspect – the willingness to negotiate – for I believe that this demand must also be addressed to the Council, that flexibility is necessary in negotiations and that what is said in the various sittings must not be merely a repetition of what was decided by governments in the capitals. It is just at the point where the Committee on Budgets does not want to respond to increased responsibility and to greater demands with an expanding budget, that our proceedings need flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I intend now to discuss individual aspects of the European Budget, beginning with agriculture. The Commission's preliminary draft for the budget, which we presented at the end of May, planned for a EUR 1 billion reserve to facilitate a response to the demands of the BSE crisis and foot-and-mouth disease. We have now moved on a bit, and the Commission will next week be adopting the letter of amendment. Developments in the livestock sector have turned out, thank God, to be less dramatic than had at first been feared. We have indeed managed to put aside EUR 400 million from the Budget in this year already for the costs of foot-and-mouth disease. The consequence of this will be that we have to plan for less of an increase for foot-and-mouth in the Amending Budget for next year than had at first been feared. This means that current developments make it possible for us to release the reserve we had proposed in May.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, developments in some areas of the agricultural sector that still give cause for concern from the budgetary point of view. The key word here is ‘wine’. Here, there is a production surplus whose constant increase is reflected in the financial results. Expenditure in this field has, in the meantime, doubled in two years, with the natural consequence that we have to observe carefully what steps can be taken to stem this overproduction and slow down the growth in the agricultural budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The letter of amendment that we will be laying before you concludes by saying that we can release the reserve and that we require less expenditure on agriculture than our calculations had originally provided for, so that a fairly substantial margin remains. At this point, I must however state quite clearly that agriculture ministers must not take this margin to mean that there is plenty of scope for every kind of shiny new expenditure package; this year has shown how quickly such a margin can be required for things which could not have been planned for. So, in my judgment, caution demands that we keep this margin in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I might mention in passing that I welcome the fact that the Committee on Budget's various amendments and resolutions show its desire to look into the agricultural sector more deeply, including with regard to the Midterm Review, which is due next year. We do have an agricultural aid programme for the acceding countries, which I would now like to mention briefly, namely the SAPARD pre-accession instrument. I share your absolute dissatisfaction with this programme not yet having, so to speak ‘arrived’, in the sense of aid payments being able to be made from it for agriculture, and with our still being at this preliminary stage in which the appropriate administrative structures are being set up.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course it is important to have absolute control, and certainty that nothing will go wrong, but if this leads to the other extreme of the programme not working at all, then that is not what its inventor had in mind either. You have now, in this Parliament, come to the logical conclusion and said that a new stage in the programme is to be set up, in particular to finance information for the agricultural sector about the EU's future agricultural policy. I must now, despite this, ask you to please reconsider this proposal, which would mean that we would have to create a new legal basis for this programme. All of SAPARD's components would have to be reprogrammed, with even greater delays as a consequence. That cannot be what you meant. Hence my plea to you to negotiate it again with great precision, in order to find room in SAPARD for your demand for more information along the lines of the LEADER programme to be made available for rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">On this point I must also address a few words to the Council: In your first reading of the preliminary draft of the Budget, you made substantial cuts in the means of payment for the pre-accession aid packages. It is of course contradictory to say on the one hand that we want better implementation and a reduced backlog of payments, and on the other to cut funds so drastically. So I must ask you to keep an open mind on the Commission's reasoning. Of course we have to produce evidence that next year we will need the items we have proposed, but that we shall surely do.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming to the topic of enlargement, I, of course, have to mention the ‘frontier regions’, as Mr Costa Neves, the rapporteur, has already done. Of course we all know that the frontier regions, the regions that are at present situated on the borders of the European Union, will profit in the long term from the enlargement of the EU, because they will at last be frontier regions no longer. Despite this, we also know, on the other hand, that there are problems with adjustment. In order to absorb the impact of these, or, to put it the other way around, to work towards making use of the opportunities that will be available, the Commission has proposed this programme for the frontier regions. The Budget provides for an additional EUR 150 million to be made available for transport infrastructure measures in the frontier regions and for a further EUR 15 million for cooperation with small and medium-sized enterprises, an additional EUR 20 million from the INTERREG programme and EUR 10 million more from the youth programme, in order to promote this programme for school students' exchanges and so on in the perspective of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, Parliament had adopted, for the 2001 Budget, the new pilot project "Cooperation with small and medium-sized enterprises in the frontier regions with a view to enlargement". I have to say, with the benefit of hindsight, that this was an excellent idea of Parliament's, as a great deal can now be done with this programme. I welcome Parliament's statement that this project should continue to be supported, and I, of course, follow with interest, Parliament's endeavours to activate supplementary funds for this area as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Mounting demands on European policy, of course, also mean that greater demands are made on personnel and also on the Commission's staff. For years, the Commission has faced ever-increasing tasks which have had to be dealt with without additional human resources. Last year, this brought us to the conclusion that we would have to take stock by analysing our workload. As a result of this, we presented a claim for 717 new posts. The budgetary authority approved 400 additional posts for the Commission last year. Let me take this as an opportunity to thank you again for this on behalf of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We also ask for approval of the second tranche of 317 posts, however. I would again point out that some departments are really not lavishly provided for. To take only one example, that of Mr Vitorino's Justice and Home Affairs Directorate-General. It has 189 established posts. The temporary posts bring the total to 215. The Scoreboard for more intensive cooperation in judicial matters decided on in Tampere, is really not a bad thing. Indeed, it is, of course, justified. The post-11 September situation has now shown that it is in the field of more intensive judicial cooperation that joint action is required. Not enough has yet been done about this at European level. We must, therefore, make the effort to move forward in this area, which means, of course, a need for staff to work in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank you for your support for the Commission's reforms as a whole, which you have reiterated here today. You have now tabled various amendments which you will probably adopt on Thursday, and the Commission, in consequence, will be asked for further reports, for example on the delayed presentation of the Budget. We will of course do all in our power to satisfy this demand for reports. I must also point out that the Commission has responsibilities as an executive, and so it is also necessary to find a balance. I would, though, like to thank Mr Costa Neves for reiterating your offer of negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the ability to use budgetary policy to react to crises and intercept the unexpected is of course particularly necessary in the field of foreign policy. This was true when we had to work together to find the wherewithal for the reconstruction of Kosovo and incorporate it into the 2000 Budget. Together, we managed it. It was the case last year, when additional funds for Serbia had to be added to the 2001 Budget. As I have already mentioned, we are now in a situation in which a contribution is to be made from the European Budget to the Global Health Fund. We are talking in terms of EUR 60 million for this. We will be presenting to Parliament the relevant proposal for a transfer, in order to use the fisheries reserve, which is still in this Budget, for this purpose among others. When we sat together in our three-way talks last week, you supported making EUR 25 million from the emergency humanitarian aid reserve available for Afghanistan, EUR 7.5 million for Palestine and EUR 7.5 million for the Caucasus region. That shows what current demands are.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to return to one point in particular, which you, Mr President-in-office of the Council, mentioned: I refer to the funds for the common foreign and security policy. Public opinion sometimes misunderstands this and takes it to mean that this is the only budget line where foreign policy is concerned. On the contrary, of course other measures are of a foreign policy nature, that is quite clear. We have, though, this specific line for the common foreign and security policy. The Commission has proposed EUR 35 million for it. Parliament proposed its reduction by EUR 14 million. Now we have to give more careful consideration to precisely why. Parliament does not, indeed, believe this to be an unimportant area; it is far more a question of how decisions are reached, of whether it is actually right that the Council should have sole discretion as to how the funds are applied. We note – I note in my capacity as Commissioner for the Budget – that this principle, according to which the Council decides on the use to which funds are put and the Commission then writes the cheques out, does not work well, as there has to date been under-utilisation in this area, even though everybody knows what demands are made.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we have to talk about the fundamentals of how future finance for the common foreign and security policy is to be secured, quite independently of the 2002 Budget. In my judgment, it is not tolerable that the Council attempts to appropriate ever more operational duties in this area; we need, on the contrary, a common foreign and security policy that will also provide the necessary financial security. There are a whole lot of related issues to be sorted out. We must also consider the people's expectations in this area when we really thoroughly discuss, investigate and then define, what we want to do in future. This demands a common response and, I believe, in many respects a stronger Community response.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to the Budget for 2002: the Commission had until now envisaged a EUR 125 million reserve for the fisheries agreement with Morocco. That fisheries agreement has now finally collapsed. In the letter of amendment that the Commission will be discussing next week and then presenting to you in due time, this reserve is released. The funds will be used in part for other fisheries agreements, which have been extended. A large amount will become available.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say it would be a mistake to budget all these additional funds which have become available from the reserve, at this early stage. I know we are going to need this money. It is not a matter of saving this money but – and I urge this – not already allocating it all. Why do I urge this? Let me now make only one point: battle is at present being waged in Afghanistan against international terrorism, and the European Union is keeping humanitarian aid in readiness for the civilian population, and the amounts involved are not small. The European Union will be providing a total of over EUR 310 million. Let me also, however, point out that the USA was a great donor of funds for humanitarian aid in Afghanistan even before 11 September.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, though, we should already be thinking of what the period after this conflict will mean for the region and for the country of Afghanistan, and it is quite clear to me that this means the post-Taliban era in Afghanistan. I think we can all agree that the European Union will then also have an obligation and a responsibility to build up a democratic society, a society that has regard for human rights and makes it possible to live with human dignity. In this Budget, we should make provision in such a way as to enable us to meet this obligation financially as in other ways.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking back over two years as Budget Commissioner and on two years of Budget discussions with Parliament and the Council, I can truly say that the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have together managed to meet well the demands made on the European Budget, and I am very optimistic that we will achieve this again for 2002.</p>

<p class="contents">Mr President, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy would like to remind you that we are at the first reading stage, which, although this seems obvious at first sight, makes it clear that many of the balances and agreements we must achieve will be of a general nature and will have repercussions upon the final appropriations under this heading.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I would like to give a vote of confidence to the general rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets, as long as he, of course, takes on board to the greatest extent possible the priorities set out by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which are balanced, given that they seek an equitable distribution between different geographical areas, and aim to respond to the European Union’s various commitments on the international stage.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner referred to the finely balanced measures we have had to take in the last few years: Commissioner, we cannot continue in such an unmethodical fashion, we cannot continue to finance new priorities with the same resources. I understand that this is not an exercise in revising financial perspectives, but we cannot continually take on new priorities to the detriment of the commitments that the European Union has already made. We will have to look for formulae that are more imaginative and more creative in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the Committee on Foreign Affairs has given its opinion: we want to strengthen the Commission’s administrative reform policy, particularly with regard to the decentralised management of external aid. With regard to the proposals made by Commissioner Patten, the Committee on Foreign Affairs has expressed its strong support on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Committee on Foreign Affairs gives its support and vote of confidence to the general rapporteur from the Committee on Budgets, Mr Costa Neves, we affectionately urge him to pay very close attention to the objectives that the Committee on Foreign Affairs has set out in its opinion for this 2002 budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have been asked by my committee to raise a number of points, the main one being the amendment that we are retabling on the Court of Auditors. As the House will know, the Court of Auditors asked for a number of new staff.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council recommended that only five new staff be granted and various positions have been taken on the additional staff requested and the money for them. The Committee on Budgetary Control decided quite wisely, in my view, that we should take an apolitical stance on this. We should ask the Court of Auditors to assess the performance of financial control systems in the applicant countries; improve the Court of Auditors' cooperation with the national audit institutions – which is a requirement of the Treaty of Nice – and establish more detailed specific DAS assessments – again, a requirement of the Treaty of Nice. We would therefore be fairly apolitical and once those issues had been clarified, we would ask for the money to be released for the other posts.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in the Committee on Budgets a completely different amendment was tabled. It is much more political, and we are very worried about the independence of the Court of Auditors in relation to the requirements set down by the Committee on Budgets, so I do hope that will be considered.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also been asked to say a word about implementation. We have looked at the implementation figures and we will continue to look at them in the future and use them for future amendments to the budget. You have our full backing on everything you have done in getting better information on implementation for us so far.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also looked at tabling amendments. We have an amendment coming through asking for money to be tied up and asking the Commission to tell us whether an evaluation unit has been set up in DG V.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are very concerned about the future of the A-30 lines, or rather how they are going to be spent. Those are the points that the Committee on Budgetary Control would like to raise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(DE) </span>– Mr President, on behalf of my Committee, I would like to emphasise one point, namely the PRINCE programme. We see it as very important that the information campaign on the euro should be carried on for another half-year, for we find an information deficit here despite great campaigning efforts. It is particularly marked among small and medium-sized enterprises, and this programme is intended to make good this deficit.</p>
<p class="contents">As permanent rapporteur for the agencies, I can say at the present time that the most acute problems have been resolved with the help not only of our colleagues in the Committee on Budgets, but also that of the general rapporteur. We decided, on the basis of the facts, to consider the agencies individually. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to say a few things for future reference.</p>
<p class="contents">The agencies carry on growing, as they have done for years. Everyone who works in one seems to have a vested interest in the agencies' expansion. To give an example, between 1995 and 2001, the personnel complement of the agencies increased by 366%. We are creating another 99 posts this year alone. I get the impression that many of the European agencies maintain to some degree a separate existence. In the Budget procedure, we always have to deal with one demand – they say they need more money. The consequences of this development are clear to see. The agencies take up all the scope for other programmes, and at some point the Community ends up having to pay the pension costs as well.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make changes here. No longer must the Budget be adapted to the programmes decided on by the Management Board, but the programmes must fit the resources provided by the Budget. We need a working audit of the agencies, involving all the actors concerned on a permanent basis. In other words, Parliament's specialised committees must likewise carry out an evaluation. We urgently need to examine the question of whether the services provided by the agencies are actually needed and then put to good use. The Budgetary Control Committee, the Court of Auditors and all the other actors must be involved in helping us get a grip on the whole thing. Over the coming weeks, I will be attempting to create a structure for this purpose, one which can be put to use in the next Budget procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I congratulate both the rapporteurs for successfully completing the mammoth budgetary task, and also the chairman of the committee, Mr Wynn, for getting through the votes in record time.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking on behalf of the Committee on Industry, I am disappointed with the outcomes in this budget because many of the priorities which we highlighted have been totally ignored. Let me single out three issues. The e-Europe initiative, launched with much fanfare at Lisbon, highlighted how it would increase the competitiveness of European industry; increase employment opportunities; and acknowledge that a knowledge society is indisputably a fundamental prerequisite for future economic prosperity. The extension of e-Europe to the applicant countries was again much heralded at Stockholm, but we are proposing not to extend this programme. I would like to remind everybody that the Council and Parliament confirmed e-Europe as a priority. By not supporting it we are undermining one of Europe's priority programmes and this will be to the detriment of the applicant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to ensure, as the rapporteur stated, that rhetoric is matched by action, that the EU citizen is not left to ponder. We have all these programmes; they are acclaimed; and then they seem to dissipate into thin air! This applies equally to my second point on Save. This has been a parliamentary priority for a number of years. Here we have a proposal to decrease the funding for the coming year. An environmentally-friendly European energy policy is at the top of most people's agendas and it is important that Europe leads the way in our Kyoto obligations. Therefore, to reduce programmes that promote sustainable energy consumption and impact on climate protection is extremely short-sighted.</p>
<p class="contents">The third area in which the Committee on Industry will be retabling amendments is the decommissioning of weapons of mass destruction, and waste management. These are key to promoting a safer world. This is even more critical in the light of the recent atrocities of 11 September and to ensure that states have a proper strategy for dismantling chemical weapons so that there are no opportunities for these weapons to fall into the wrong hands. I would urge the rapporteur to rethink and support these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to the other institutions, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Buitenweg, for the open and inclusive approach she adopted in arriving at the budget for the other institutions. This year, as she said, Heading 5 was under tremendous pressure for a number of reasons, including the preparation for the forthcoming enlargement. My group's efforts have been to continue to improve effectiveness, efficiency and transparency. As far as Parliament is concerned, these are not just hollow words, but words of substance. We have demonstrated our commitment to improving efficiency by staying under Parliament's 20% self-imposed ceiling, whilst absorbing the costs of preparations for enlargement of some EUR 18 million. However, this will be extremely difficult in the coming years. I would urge the Council to address this, so that the costs associated with the proposed enlargement are dealt with before we commence the budgetary procedure next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I welcome the three-year enlargement plan that the Bureau has approved. At this stage, it is fairly sketchy and perhaps conservative – with a small ‘c’ – and not very radical. This is a shame because enlargement offers a real opportunity to make Parliament more dynamic in its operation. Some of the ideas outlined in this plan need to be developed further and we need to have a broader view of how things are done.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday we heard in plenary that Parliament was unable to look at the money laundering proposals, which were agreed by the Council, for another three weeks because of the need for translation into 11 languages. This is extremely frustrating for everybody concerned, but what will this mean when we have 10 more languages? We must address this issue because it causes us fundamental problems in terms of the image of Parliament. It creates negative perceptions in the minds of European citizens, in that the European Parliament is seen as undynamic and unresponsive.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst we are on the subject of radical thinking, I would like to make some suggestions to the Council to improve their own efficiency. The under-utilisation of Parliament's buildings, for instance. We have buildings in Brussels which are almost empty for one week every month, and a building in Strasbourg which is hardly used and remains empty for three weeks a month. As the Council is consistently pointing out waste, here is an offer it cannot refuse. It could share and make full use of our buildings by holding its meetings in our buildings. I hope that will also benefit transparency in the way it works. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Looking back historically, we are doing a better job every year and this is certainly due partly to the work done by the rapporteurs. Things are going along much more smoothly than they were, despite the fact that we are considerably squeezed for money because of external demands upon our budget. Nevertheless, I am pleased to see that the Committee on Budgets has supported the view of Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in restoring some of the budget lines which we are particularly concerned with, at least to the level of the PDB.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, it is worth mentioning that we look with approval upon the work that was done in terms of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets with regard to the tobacco subsidies. They urge the Council to take a good look at this. We urge the Commission to take a good look at this. We know something must be done. I am pleased that the Committee on Budgets acknowledges this. Its proposals for a gradual reduction over a period of time of that subsidy make sense, and it is time the Council and the Commission started talking about this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">One particular success is on the issue of the budget line associated with the approval of orphan drugs by the medicines agency. I am very pleased the Committee on Budgets has accepted our point of view and I hope the Commission does as well. This has been a very successful budget line since created last year together with the SAB procedure. We were concerned about what the Council wanted to do in terms of the massive cut it demanded in that line, which was completely unjustified. We are pleased about the restoration to an appropriate level of that budget line and we hope the Commission will also defend that point of view to the Council. This is a budget line which does genuinely good work for the people of Europe and brings real and genuine benefits and it must be protected.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would say that we have some concerns about the way in which the agencies have been handled. I can fully understand why money must go into the reserve and I can fully understand why there is increasing concern about the way the agencies operate, but we need to give them the appropriate resources to do their job and that particularly applies in the case of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know how complicated that is and how many changes have to be made, but we will carry on demanding this whenever budgets are laid before us, until our demands have been met.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposal on the introduction of a reserve meets with our explicit support. That is needed. We are sure that we do not have to explain why it is necessary. We also assume that the Commission will act responsibly if it becomes necessary to make use of it.</p>
<p class="contents">Our colleagues on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy have just spoken about tobacco. We too on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have had to return to the tobacco issue. We are most dissatisfied with the inadequate use being made of money from the Tobacco Research Fund. On the Agriculture Committee, we, too, are fed up with forever flogging a dead horse where this subject is concerned. We have, on the one hand, the demand for preventative health education, and, on the other, the need to promote tobacco growing. We must, though, face reality. For as long as we have farmers who grow tobacco – and they are not the richest – and have no alternative crop to offer them, we cannot help them. This sector therefore needs possible alternatives not only to be examined, but also offered.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of all, I would like to say something more about SAPARD: we are glad that the appropriations have been increased, but, like the Commissioner, we are critical of the way the Council has cut by EUR 100 million the amount of funds SAPARD is authorised to pay out. This is not on! It is absolutely not on! Please, Commissioner, let there be no fear of a new implementation along the lines of LEADER. Take your courage in both hands!</p>

That does not mean that he was able to agree on all counts as far as the fisheries budget is concerned, but he listened carefully to everything we had to say and created, in any event, a basis for further collaboration, which we found useful.</p>
<p class="contents">The huge problems in the fisheries sector and the partial failure of the common fisheries policy have left their mark on the fisheries budget. Clearly, the multi-annual orientation programme and the unilateral closure of areas have not proved successful.</p>
<p class="contents">Failure to conclude a new fisheries agreement with Morocco has led to an explosive situation along the Spanish and Portuguese coasts, an area which is already facing major social problems in connection with illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for that reason that the Committee on Fisheries has asked for nearly EUR 200 million in order to be able to tackle these problems. The rapporteur suggests including a token entry first and challenging the Council to meet the pledges made in Nice. The Committee on Fisheries endorses this view.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Committee on Fisheries is disappointed by the fact that the budget proposal for more money for quota control, which was desperately needed, has been watered down by a liberal amendment in the Committee on Budgets, while the original amendment did receive wide support from all groups in the Committee on Fisheries with this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">In the capacity as shadow rapporteur of the PPE-DE Group for the agricultural budget, I note that, of the original request for EUR 1 billion extra for food safety and animal disease control, eventually 580 million was left over, but what we say is: better some of a pudding than none of a pie.</p>
<p class="contents">In actual fact, we also regret to some extent the Commission’s failure to adhere to the original request for EUR 1 billion extra. Fortunately, the PPE-DE position, that more money must be earmarked for animal disease control, has met with approval. In general, we are of the opinion that, in order to restore consumer confidence, it is vital to bring the European markets, including those for beef, back to normal.</p>
<p class="contents">As a final point, I have to say that I am delighted with the fact that, with regard to foreign policy, the PPE-DE Group will be tabling an amendment for more attention for Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tadjikistan, and I should also like to recommend this amendment warmly for further discussions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Despite the current circumstances following the tragic events of 11 September, tourism will soon be the largest service industry in the European Union. The World Tourism Organisation anticipates a doubling in the number of tourist arrivals up to a figure of approximately 720 million per year by the year 2020. The 9 million people who already work in the tourism industry will be joined by a further 2 to 3.5 million between now and 2010, to reach 12.5 million people employed. The Committee on Budgets, however, rejected our proposals. Fortunately, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has once again been able to put forward an amendment to this House so that, at European level, resources are assigned to stimulate the promotion, monitoring and evaluation of a tourism policy that is both ecological and socially sustainable. I trust that the majority of my fellow Members here will have the sensitivity necessary to support this reaffirmed proposal with their vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, a separate appropriation of EUR 12.6 million is being proposed for the implementation of the <span class="italic">e</span>learning initiative. It is justified because IT studies have a key place in the EU’s strategy. A considerable increase in the appropriation for IT teaching would also be wise, as if it is to be financed merely from the Socrates, YOUTH and Culture 2000 programmes this might put the implementation of the fundamental aims of these programmes in jeopardy. We have to remember that information technology is a tool, not an absolute value.</p>
<p class="contents">The second new feature is connected with sport, which still does not have a legal basis in the Union. Sport is mentioned, however, in the Treaty of Amsterdam, and the conclusions of the Nice Summit stressed its social importance. The Committee on Budgets has approved a proposal for a EUR 5 million appropriation for sports club work to prevent exclusion amongst youth.</p>
<p class="contents">The third new matter in our Committee’s budget is the EUR 1 million appropriation for establishing a centre for monitoring cultural co-operation. In my opinion, the co-ordination of cultural co-operation could be practised in association with the Council of Europe, which has much experience in the field.</p>
<p class="contents">Chapter A-30 again caused problems. I am very disappointed with the work of the Committee on Budgets in item A-3042, which concerns the funding of European cultural organisations. We in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport had done a lot of work in connection with this point. We took the Commission’s report on the funding of organisations into account as well as the recommendations of the Committee on Budgets’ working party. We, above all, tried to assess how money might be used in the best possible way from the point of view of European culture. I cannot accept that the Committee on Budgets has interfered with a proposal that required the expertise of a special committee the way it has. I warmly support the proposal contained in the report drafted by Mr Costa Neves for a legal basis and proper rules to apply to A-30. Parliament cannot act as if it were in a ‘grab as grab can’ type of wrestling contest, in which the most unscrupulous party of all is the victor. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The aim of these amendments is to enhance the information given to citizens and to stimulate the debate on issues relating to the future of the European Union, pursuant to Declaration 23 of the Treaty of Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of Amendment No 223 is to restore the commitment appropriations granted to the Prince-Programme, as proposed by the Commission in its preliminary draft budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The increase in these appropriations has, in fact, been reduced by the Council. We feel it is inconceivable not to support strong investment to provide more information for the public on the euro, enlargement, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and, of course, on measures in the area of justice and home affairs. All these subjects are extremely topical. I would also like to reiterate that we are already involved in a period of reflection and consultation on the future of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that it would be counter-productive to enter, as suggested by the Committee on Budgets, a part of these appropriations into a reserve. We know that using the appropriations entered in the reserve is a much more complicated procedure, and we see no reason why the Commission’s room for manoeuvre should be hampered in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that, in any case, monitoring is undertaken by Parliament by means of its presence within the inter-institutional working party on general and specific information.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has also expressed its support for maintaining, and even increasing the financial support given to the European Movement. We know that this Movement’s actions are effective, and it would be surprising if the European Union withdraws its support for the European Movement at a time when we need, more than ever, to encourage dialogue with the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, all Member States should support European Union day, which is organised for 9 May, as this would greatly contribute to developing the rapport with the public that is severely lacking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Social exclusion is another concern of the Committee on Women’s Rights, given that we are unfortunately witnessing the phenomenon of the ‘feminisation of poverty’. In order to achieve these priority objectives, we have put forward a series of amendments to the budget, which have been well received, and I would like to give special thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Costa Neves, for his support in obtaining a majority in the Committee on Budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">A small proportion has been rejected, because it was already included in other budget lines: information actions in the common agricultural policy; methods to combat exclusion; the information society; the fight against poverty and the illnesses that arise as a result of it: malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS; care in the field of health and welfare; consolidation of democracy and human rights, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Aid for women’s organisations that work for the promotion of women in the European Union should also be pointed out, not only the women’s lobby, but also other organisations that monitor the respect for pluralism in our society. We cannot affirm that one sole organisation represents all of Europe’s women. This action is therefore intended to promote justice and recognition for many other European organisations that have been working towards the equality of the sexes for a long time now, which also have a right to receive financial aid from the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Women’s Rights is therefore very pleased that the rapporteur and the Committee on Budgets has accepted its proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Deep in the Buitenweg report is Amendment No 2022 on Budget Line 250 and this makes a new proposal to allow in certain circumstances, individual expenses to be paid to particular petitioners if they feel it appropriate to come to Parliament to put their case. I want to thank the rapporteur for accepting this report and the committee for passing it.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliaments, you know, have various responsibilities. They decide who is to be the government, of course, that is not a responsibility of this Parliament. They decide budgets, but you know, we have only partial budgetary powers. We have no powers over taxation, we have no powers over 50% of the expenditure more or less devoted to agriculture. Parliaments decide legislation: that is a power we have to share with the Council of Ministers and we have no powers of legislative initiative. But parliaments also have a responsibility to protect the rights of the individual citizens in dealing with the bureaucracy and that is a responsibility that we discharge in this Parliament through the work of the Committee on Petitions and the work of the Ombudsman.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say to Parliament this afternoon that the money spent on petitions and the EUR 3 million that we make available to the Office of the Ombudsman is money that is extremely well spent. It works out at less than EUR 0.1 per person per annum, so it cannot be said to be a great deal of money, but it is money that is being spent on real European democracy and we want to ensure that we keep that up and that we see that we do more in future years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are pleased about the role played by the ECSC as a pioneer in the European integration process and about the way in which the ECSC has made a positive contribution to peace in Europe. We note that the ECSC was financed by means of revenue of a fiscal nature which facilitated the development of economic and social intervention measures associated with sectoral industrial policies. At present, the coal and steel sector employs 357 000 workers and, as we enlarge the EU by means of the candidate countries, enlargement will mean that coal production in the EU will be doubled and that steel production will be increased by a third. We can note with pride that, thanks to the ECSC, something was constructed and further developed that led to the European Union as we know it today. The Committee has approved the Commission’s draft operating budget of EUR 151.8 million in 2002, and it is of course on 23 July 2002 that the ECSC Treaty expires. We might have wished that, when it came to both operations and research, there had been a little more money for future energy needs relating to clean coal technologies, and we call upon the Commission to take account of this in the other programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As other speakers have already done, I should like to congratulate our two main rapporteurs, Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg. It is never an easy job to steer something through this House, as I know, and I think that they should be warmly applauded.</p>
<p class="contents">With the Commission budget this year, we have a proposal in front of us which, at 1.06% of GDP, is one of lowest budgets we have seen proposed in this House and therefore well below the ceiling as foreseen in the Financial Perspective, but I guess that with enlargement on its way, the Financial Perspective could well be tested before we reach the end of 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">In referring to the Costa Neves Report, I should like, first of all, to congratulate the rapporteur on having focused on the progress report, on what had been done in terms of following up on the Joint Council/Parliament Declaration at the end of last year which has shown its worth in our budgetary procedure. It may well be a useful idea to think of continuing this on an annual basis, because where we have gained is looking at the efficiency and effectiveness of the operations of the European institutions, and this for us in Parliament is a point of major importance which I shall come back to at the end of my speech.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to raise a few points on the particular matters of the Commission budget where we would, as a group, be looking for value for money – a tried and tested position with us.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, in terms of agriculture: we do not believe in having a reserve – we already have some money which has already been made available and a letter of amendment on its way, and I feel that it is quite sufficient. But we think there should be an enquiry into the management of foot-and-mouth by the Commission and the British authorities, and we will be pushing for that.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we believe that in information policy there is a continuing problem: every time we see Commission proposals come through without the interinstitutional working groups, we as a Parliament have to put them back on the information policy lines. I urge the Commission to make sure that they become a permanent part of your proposals – this will save some effort on our part to ensure that this interinstitutional work is continued.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, in terms of the food safety agency – I noted that was raised in the European Council in Ghent – I would remind the President-in-Office (instead of laughing, he might listen to parliamentarians when they are speaking) that Parliament's position is that the money will stay in reserve until we are satisfied about the operations and the location of this agency. I therefore assume that you will consult Parliament before any final decision is taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, as regards Afghanistan – and I turn to the Commission again here – there is an amendment down to create a ‘pour memoire’ entry for aid to Afghanistan, and we will be asking the Council with Parliament to put this into the budget on second reading because we want to see in our Group that there will be an international alliance to help the reconstruction of Afghanistan once the conflict is over, and initial thinking on this issue is already under way in the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to refer to the question of the posts which we have put in reserve and we would like to ensure that the conditions for the reserve are met before the posts are released – including the fact that the Commission has the capacity to use the posts during the next year in terms of the vacancies.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, one more very critical point, and I turn again to the Council of Ministers here. Rumour has it, Mr President, that the early retirement package which is being negotiated in the Council at the moment is not open to Parliament. I would like you to confirm in any future remarks that it will be open to us – that is a critical point for our Group as we wish to see it applied across all institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude, Mr President, on a point for our institution. Yesterday evening, the Bureau decided, in opposition to the resolution of Mr Harbour, to go against the idea of having a linear career structure – I quote paragraph 38 of the Resolution which we voted in this House last November – "urges Parliament's administration to introduce a linear career structure in parallel to the Commission allowing for easy interinstitutional transfer". It is unacceptable that Parliament's Bureau seems to have gone totally AWOL and decided for itself: under pressure from Parliament's administration, Parliament's Bureau has chosen to ignore what this Parliament has voted for.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, you will have to answer three questions, and I end on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is the organisation and the function of Parliament so distinctive from the Commission as to require a different career structure?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, how can a career structure retaining four different categories meet the objectives of a linear career structure with progression on merit as strongly supported by Parliament?</p>
<p class="contents">And lastly, how can staff mobility between institutions be encouraged if Parliament and the Commission have different career structures? The Bureau has to come and justify before this Parliament the decisions it has taken as they are not in line with our resolutions.</p>

I congratulate the rapporteurs. Their work is never easy. This year they have done a particularly good job under difficult circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the President-in-Office's statement that at the next conciliation he hopes we can get an agreement with the Council. I hope so too because on 20 July, at the last conciliation, we agreed virtually nothing. There is no point in having conciliation meetings if that is the level we are going to reach. Hopefully, in November we may get something more positive.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the situation regarding the margins, which the President-in-Office also mentioned, there will not be much of a margin left by the time we vote on Thursday. One of the reasons for that is because, once again, we could not get into any discussions with the Council; we could not get any agreements with the Council. I made the point on several occasions in July that the three institutions must seriously discuss the problems of trying to finance categories 3, 4 and 5 for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council cannot ignore these categories as though there were no problems. At times it seems it is like an ostrich with its head stuck in the sand trying to ignore all the problems around it. When the Council takes that attitude, we are left talking to the backside, although sometimes we get more sense out of the backside of an ostrich than out of some of the people that we do have to speak to! That is not a reference to you President-in-Office! There are times when it is so frustrating trying to get the message through that we waste our time having conciliation meetings. Hopefully, in November we will get something a lot more concrete.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of reform, James Elles has just touched on a very significant point. I was going to refer to the concern that we have about the progress that is not being made, but Parliament has not helped itself with that decision last night by the Bureau. One has to hope that can be changed rapidly. Realistically, it is now left with the Council: almost three years have passed since the resignation of the Commission, and we still have not seen the reform that everyone is looking for. The general public, the taxpayers of Europe, are looking for the reform which we promised almost three years ago. Where are we? It is stuck in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">President-in-Office, you are aware, because I have discussed this issue with you, that the message must get through that we need a solution to this as quickly as possible. Otherwise the whole process will be bogged down in the mire. Hopefully, Parliament can play its part and unravel last night's decision and continue on the track of getting a speedy process going so we can get the whole issue sorted out, not just for the Commission but for all the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to turn to the Global Health Fund which we have a budget line and a relatively small amount of money for next year. As we are all aware, the Commission will be bringing forward proposals to finance that from this year's budget, taking EUR 60 million from the general budget and EUR 60 million from the EDF. I need to ask the Commission a question: on the monies from the EDF, once that budget is agreed, it is agreed with the ACP states, so can we be assured that the ACP states have agreed to the use of EUR 60 million for the Global Health Fund? Several of my colleagues have asked me that question, and quite frankly, I do not know the answer to it. So if Commissioner Schreyer could reply to that, I would be grateful.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the contentious issue of the A-30 lines. It seems that whenever we vote on the A-30 lines, we please very few people and displease a lot of people. I would hope that the situation that we found ourselves in this time will give us the courage for next year to make proposals which envisage a more transparent system. We are concerned that if we hand the whole process over to the Commission, it will be no better. The Commission will take the decisions instead of Parliament. I hope we can get some sort of an agreement within Parliament on how we handle A-30 in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to make a plea to the Council and to repeat what I said in conciliation and at the recent trialogue. What we need is a working group of the Council and Parliament at a political level to start looking at value for money within the European Union, to look at the institutions, to look at the activities and to make sure that we can persuade the taxpayers that they really are getting value for money. I hope you will take that on board.</p>

At the same time I wish to thank Terence Wynn, as chairman of the Committee on Budgets, who has proved a competent leader in the work of the current year. The job of general rapporteur is a tough and demanding one, but Mr Costa Neves has managed well and my group supports his policy on the Commission’s budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget’s general lines include cancelling the cut in agricultural expenditure, attending to arrears in payments, and the Commission’s reform. The strengthening of the policy on the northern dimension in the budget’s explanatory statement may also be regarded as a positive move. The handling of the budget is based very much on last year’s financial statements, which showed a surplus of EUR 11 billion. Expenditure was EUR 8.5 billion less than anticipated and EUR 6.5 billion of the Structural Funds remained unspent. For that reason, we now have to pay special attention to improving administration and not producing such large estimates for expenditure. Otherwise, the bottom will fall out of budget policy altogether.</p>
<p class="contents">One particular focus in the budget is the reduction in payment arrears. At present they stand at more than EUR 60 billion. My group supports this goal. It also supports the reform of the Commission, which is one of Parliament’s most urgent priorities. It will increase efficiency and the importance of personal responsibility. It is being proposed that a part of the appropriations should be placed in a reserve, so that the Commission may quickly propose a reform of its staff regulations and clarify its ideas on the early retirement scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">Heading 4 is difficult. The Commission and the Council are proposing EUR 125 million for the Moroccan fishing agreement, although this agreement is not forthcoming. This is clearly a matter of a concealed reserve which, indeed, contravenes the Financial Regulation. It must be dissolved. As a counterweight, it is being proposed that a flexible instrument should be used to modernise the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets. This could be partly acceptable. On the other hand, our group cannot accept the cut of EUR 84 million in the CARDS Programme. We, as liberals, like participating in joint agreements to carry through the budget in Parliament, but we cannot be party to this idea. The CARDS Programme has been an undisputed priority with Parliament, and, for that reason, we are hoping for similar cuts in the budget for other programmes where payment appropriations have not been used to the extent they might have been in any case.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the small programmes, the most considerable is the A-30 appropriations, which are earmarked as assistance to organisations. These appropriations take up a totally unreasonable amount of Parliament’s time in relation to their importance. For that reason, the whole system should be clarified. In addition, the way the organisations are selected is very rarely based on objective criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">We particularly support Mrs Buitenweg’s recommendations concerning discipline in Parliament’s budget, as mentioned in her report. They remain beneath the ceiling we, ourselves, set, that is to say 20% of all administrative costs, even though it includes the costs relating to enlargement. The question of eastward enlargement itself is one that must be dealt with in such a way that Parliament’s work is not made any harder and that in the future we may congregate in our own united assembly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If you consider the conflicts that arose from attempts to pass budgets in the past few years, it seems as if greater calm prevails this year, as if the conflicts were not so evident to the public eye. But it must be recorded that, this year too, the Council is not actually facing up to its responsibilities. As a component part of the budgetary authority, it has the task of supporting a Budget with real commitment and in a politically explicable way.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst Parliament worked very carefully for a balanced budget, in long debates, discussions and negotiations with most of the interested parties, weighing needs against the duty to budget prudently in the taxpayers' interests, the Council again merely cut lump sums without any underlying political thought. At any rate, its political thinking is not clear to us, and the question arises of whether it ever engaged in any.</p>
<p class="contents">Problems are needlessly exacerbated by the way the Council acts, for, this year too, the Budget is below the margin, far under 1.27% of Gross Social Product, despite special tasks, preparations for enlargement and many other problems.</p>
<p class="contents">This year, the Council has cut payments by 10% across the board, something made all the more incomprehensible by the delay in implementing programmes in many areas. Parliament is now reinstating these figures. We cannot, on the one hand, build up expectations in areas such as the Structural Fund or overseas aid, but then live up to them only with great hesitation. This undermines trust in the institutions of the EU. So the Council must bear its share of responsibility for this if its action is to be approved.</p>
<p class="contents">This action is particularly problematic in Category IV, foreign policy. Whilst the Foreign Ministers and Heads of Government make great speeches about the Common Foreign Policy, the Finance Ministers narrow-mindedly cut the supply of funds, without considering the prestige lost by the EU institutions. It is far from clear why the instrument of a flexible reserve is not fully available to us this year. We still have major problems in the Balkans, new tasks await us in Afghanistan and in its neighbouring states and more new tasks await us in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a response from the Council too on the way that the EU is losing its capacity for flexible reaction. The Council must explain how the EU is to continue to be flexible and capable of political action. We, as a group, are more critical of the A30 lines procedure. The great number of individual motions – including those from Parliament – has led the two major groups to attempt a solution by dealing with them en bloc. Our committee would then no longer be able to do any fine-tuning in this area, and we would thus be inadequately performing our monitoring function. Now Mr Wynn has clearly mentioned that changes are to be made to the Budget process next year. I hope we will be able to work together to produce an intelligently thought-out procedure which will also enable Parliament to perform its function of monitoring the A30 lines. We must not lay ourselves open to the accusation that we are engaging in economics for the benefit of special interest groups. This really is not what we should be doing in the Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">No, I do believe there must be a certain amount of self-criticism. I am perfectly aware of the fact that there is a great deal of pressure on the time available to us, but every individual item in this field in particular must be politically justifiable even to people outside this Parliament. I would like to sum up and end my speech by referring back to what previous speakers have said and, again, challenging Parliament to push ahead with its own reforms. Our demands to the Council and the Commission for reform will only be credible if we strive credibly for reform ourselves. Yesterday evening's decisions from the Chair did not, I believe, take sufficient account of that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the GNP for the EU Member States has grown faster than the increase in payment appropriations, the amount the EU budget represents in the figure for combined GNP has shrunk to 1.03%. That indicates that next year’s draft budget will not exhibit any special areas of focus. The permitted ceiling in the EU budget is 1.27% of the combined GNP for the Member States. There will consequently be room in the budget for areas of special focus, but the Council and the Commission do not seem to have the political will or the ability to prepare any such areas. Examples of them might be employment or healthy food.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU political élite no longer even debates the matter of the prevention of unemployment, let alone try to combat it with appropriate policy. Our group has traditionally stressed the importance of preventing unemployment. In most cases unemployment is not the fault of the unemployed person him or herself: that person is at the mercy of the economic situation as it happens to be at any one time. We must have a policy against unemployment. The political élite and EU officials certainly look after their own interests. We are to have an early retirement scheme that will generously reward those who no longer, even through retraining, can be made into functional tyres to go on EU wheels. If there are hundreds of officials no longer needed, that shows just what a bad state EU staff policy is in.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s ability to implement Parliament’s political decisions is nothing less than wretched. The gap between the budget that has been decided and the budget implemented by the Commission is always much too wide. There are no delays in payment when it comes to issues that are important to the Commission, whereas there often are in issues important to the Parliament. The EU budget is a political document, as it channels money to the EU élite bodies, and now also to the European political parties and for EU propaganda. That is not the way to make a citizen’s Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">If an illegal war was waged in the bombing of Yugoslavia, assistance for the country’s reconstruction should not be the object of cuts. Let us hope that the CARDS vote does not take the large groups by surprise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this first reading, our group supports many of the choices made by the rapporteur, such as the horizontal amendments, in principle, and particularly when this involves a systematic reduction of the RAL and the desire to prevent further RAL from building up.</p>
<p class="contents">As for agriculture, almost all of the appropriations for this sector have been restored, and this can only reassure our farmers, who are greatly in need of these funds. The package of EUR 180 million approved by the Committee on Budgets in favour of other agricultural interventions also helps, even if we must condemn the obvious lack of appropriations for the emergency fund for veterinary complaints, for the distribution of agricultural products to the less wealthy sectors of the Community and for the setting up of young farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to cross-border regions, it is worthwhile reiterating that these regions already benefit from extensive financial support, and we might well consider whether, in view of their diversity, a unique instrument could be the appropriate response.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as internal policies are concerned, the interests of small- and medium-sized businesses are safeguarded, and Parliament can welcome the increase in appropriations that aim to combat violence against women and children, such as paedophilia and misuse of the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, however, the reduction made by the Council concerning advertising for the euro, and which was increased by Parliament, is sufficient. This advertising, for which the citizens of our countries pay a high price, seems to be nothing more than propaganda.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the French delegation of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group is opposed to the appropriations included on a multitude of headings in Chapter A 30, which do nothing more than to encourage federalist presuppositions and these alone, whereas other tendencies are not recognised, in spite of the choice of the electorate.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Europol, and this thinking also applies to Eurojust, all our energies must of course be channelled into the fight against terrorism in all its guises, as reiterated by our Chairman, Charles Pasqua, who has relentlessly pursued this fight. However, the necessary strengthening of solidarities and police and judicial cooperation between our nations would only serve as a pretext for the rampant communitarisation of policies and actions that fall fully within the remit of national sovereignty.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, Europol is funded by national contributions, and, in our view, has no place in this budget.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as external actions are concerned, whilst our group appreciates that the appropriations in favour of the MEDA 2002 programme have been doubled, we condemn the drastic reductions in appropriations for the fishing agreement with Morocco. You cannot achieve good policies from figures alone and this decision by the Committee on Budgets is the worst message that we could send our counterparts in Morocco, particularly during this difficult time when there is an international crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, although we are able to welcome the method used by the rapporteur, we must admit that the excessive level of payment appropriations put forward by the Committee on Budgets will certainly not help to control public spending, as this would represent an additional cost of some FFR 27 billion, even for France alone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And those choices, I should like to underline once more, must serve the interests of all European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The on-going debate on the final form to be taken by the Union indicates that there are many different opinions on the subject. I am alarmed by the fact that this diversity of opinions is not reflected in many European projects. The fact that a unilateral propaganda megaphone is resounding from Brussels across the Union, and at the citizen’s expense, concerns me greatly. Those concerns were recently intensified when the Committee on Budgets rejected an amendment tabled by our Conservative English MEPs to inject impartiality into the Commission’s information policy.</p>
<p class="contents">There is more. The Commission, as well as the majority in this Parliament, want to press on. Driven by the intense desire to bring about political Union as soon as possible, the European Commission has submitted a proposal for making contributions to European political parties from community funding.</p>
<p class="contents">This is highly peculiar, for those European parties hardly exist. The citizens are not familiar with them, yet we are expected to sponsor them. Once again, the EU’s political diversity is being overlooked. In this way, only mainstream European parties qualify for European subsidy, while the national political parties – which are closer to the citizen – do not. Time and again, polls illustrate that the citizens in the Member States are not keen on interference from Brussels. Promoting European political parties will only further alienate the citizen from European politics. This is why we warmly recommend our amendment which proposes scrapping these contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s and Parliament’s urge to stress the distinctive features of the European political parties does not end at the Union’s borders. I should like to quote one example by way of illustration. More than EUR 180 million is pledged annually to the Palestinian Authority. If the schools paid from that budget use inflammatory school books full of racist and anti-Semitic language, the Commission washes its hands of the matter. Why does the Commission continue to ignore this evil and keep running away from its political responsibility?</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that the Union is punching above its weight. The Union should confine itself to those areas of policy where European action has an obvious added value. The fundamental choice which I, apart from all the positive things, miss in this budget, is that of prioritising the EU’s core tasks and leaving the other tasks where they belong: with the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must not, though, in doing this, forget the 23 frontier regions which will be particularly – even adversely – affected by the accession of these countries. Being a Member for one of these regions, Carinthia, I am disappointed. I am sorry that the Commission, the Council, and also the Committee on Budgets are not giving these regions adequate support by allocating sufficient budget resources. To cut resources for these regions is to play a dangerous game with popular feeling. If the population of these regions suffers overwhelming disadvantages, as is to be feared, the possibility cannot be excluded that they will vote against enlargement and thereby jeopardise the whole undertaking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ferber (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if, today, we are discussing at first reading stage the Community budget for the coming year, we are of course talking about politics coated with figures. A lot of the European Parliament's initiatives can be seen in that way. We want to exert pressure on the Council – those who have spoken before me have pointed out how urgently that is needed – but also on the Commission, because many points have not yet been given the consideration they deserve.</p>
<p class="contents">I will push on with the subject on which Mr Ilgenfritz has just finished speaking, that is to say, the frontier regions. It is just not the case that we have cut something, rather we are of course waiting, Commissioner for a rather feeble communication to be followed up by the presentation of something more from the Commission for the frontier regions, as the Commission has a monopoly on initiative. You were perfectly well able to propose legal foundations for other things in quick order. When it comes to the frontier regions, though, you cover yourself with modesty. But it will not do for you to tell us that you observe Parliament's intentions with great interest. The Commission is being called on to produce an initiative. That is your duty – it is an honourable one – and you cannot evade responsibility for it. So I hope that we will succeed, here in this Parliament on Thursday, in adopting the inclusion of EUR 10.8 million in the reserve for the PRINCE programme. I think this will motivate the Commission to present a corresponding proposal on the frontier regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The same goes for the issue of the 317 new posts that the Commission has asked for. I think it high time to synchronise the Budget procedure and the Commission's legislative process. We cannot have the situation where we briefly discuss the annual reports on the legislation in preparation if the Budget has, in principle, already been passed. Here, too, it is a matter of ensuring synchronisation of these two activities. So it is right to keep these posts, and the resources for them, in reserve.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the same is true of the common foreign and security policy. It is enough to make me weep when I hear your disquisitions on how we would be making savings here in an important area. Please bear in mind that we have an interest in dealing with these things as part of the Community Budget, where, to a large degree, they rightly belong. Correspondingly, of course, cuts must be made in the relevant Budget line. The Council cannot get itself a savings tin for this and thus develop activities independently of the Commission and Parliament. There are papers to this effect in the Council. You may be sure that Parliament will not let that go through. The same goes for Europol and Eurojust. I do not propose to go into further detail about this.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to extend heart-felt thanks to the rapporteurs, in particular to Carlos Costa Neves and of course Mrs Buitenweg as well, for making our work together so pleasant. We got a bit further with the Parliamentary budget in terms of truth and clarity. It makes little sense to put funds in reserve for the purposes of a law, and then end up spending it on buildings. It is therefore more right and proper to put it straight in the Budget line for buildings where it will be used at year-end anyway. We will, though, have to ensure – and this is a lesson from this year's Budget procedure – that all proposals for our Parliamentary budget are presented by the Bureau as early as May. A procedure such as today's, with many important decisions being taken only in September and immediately before the discussions in the Committee on Budgets, is something we cannot accept.</p>
<p class="contents">I still have grave concerns about the state of health of our colleagues in the various institutions. We had requested a report on sickness absence for this year. Working in certain institutions is indeed very dangerous, as a lot of people in them are off sick. We will have to get to grips with this and take steps to improve the health of our colleagues in the institutions in question.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I really would like to ask – and Terry Wynn has already mentioned this to great effect – that we should now make progress in November on the issue of cooperation, so that, in December, we can adopt a proper and orderly Budget for 2002. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Anyone who follows the process as intensively as the coordinators sometimes do, can see how much work is actually involved. Hence my special and wholehearted thanks on behalf of all my group.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that the President-in-Office of the Council is still here, as I think every year's Budget process must bring with it the opportunity to point out one thing: this Budget process is not complete. Its ability to contribute notwithstanding, this Parliament is not yet in full and complete possession of the power that citizens' Parliamentary representatives must have when the budget for the coming year is at issue. I have hinted that I will say that over and over again. I will do as Cato the Elder did to the ancient Romans – he was the one who wanted to see Carthage destroyed – but perhaps I will not go quite that far. I desire only the destruction of an undemocratic process and I will always be reminding you of that. This Budget process, even as regards the agricultural budget, is complete only when it has got us well and truly on board, and when we have complete responsibility for receipts and outgoings. I know that I am not meeting with much resistance on your part, but of course we have to develop this further in discussion and argument. Only then will the citizens of the European Union be able to decide by their votes whether we, this Parliament, have done well or not.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Council and the Commission must of course have a part in this process in future. We will accord them high honour for it. I believe, though, that Parliament, being composed of elected representatives, is the primary partner in dialogue. We will in future continue to point to the need for further developments here. We are working on Budget matters in a very restricted framework, which itself is prescribed by the Financial Perspective, to which we adhere, even though we see that additional demands are made on us which were not recognisable as such at the time the Financial Perspective was adopted. We must adapt to this and facilitate further developments within our Budget framework.</p>
<p class="contents">At present that is surely still possible, for we see from the backdraughts at the end of every year that there is still enough air. So, either there is not proper implementation – a fault which will have to be tackled – or the items really were estimated too high. Even there it is still possible to let some air out. I will tell you though, Mr President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner, that we will in the foreseeable future – in other words by the expiry date of this Financial Perspective at the latest – have to talk about further developments. When it comes to the further development of the Financial Perspective, we will have to do some thinking about much more intensive and definite ways of meeting new challenges. Up until then, we will have been letting air out all over the place. We will be back on the launch pad, and will have to discuss what appropriate terms for this House's budget and the Budget as a whole might look like. We will be ready to energetically dispute over further developments with you.</p>
<p class="contents">On the road to this destination, we will give the Commission the support it needs when it comes to modernising its administrative procedures. We will be at its disposal when needed staff are to be taken on. But, on the contrary, we will also be making quite massive demands. We will be demanding a great deal so that our programmes, which we cast in numerical form in the Budget, actually come into being in the course of the year. No longer will we stand by and watch payment arrears being built up. Progress is being made – I will admit that here and now. I certainly would not claim that we are where we were two or three years ago. But despite this progress, there is still a need for a massive amount of further work. As I have said, we will support you, but we will also make demands.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of individual Budget lines and categories, too, we will hold fast to that which has proved its worth. The people who rely on us to give support when it is needed, will be able to rely on us in future too. That starts in Category I, with the farmers who cannot change everything around from one day to another, but need a certain headstart. These people must also know that there is to be a change in this European Union. We, as a Parliament, will help to bring it about. In future, we will take an intensive look at Category I and bring in modernisation. We will introduce innovation. If there is no discernible development in these areas, which are in Category VII rather than Category I, but still affect agriculture, if SAPARD is not implemented, we will ask you to take the innovative resources that made LEADER such a success and transpose them so as to provide rapid short-term help. We will bring this in, and we will also take care that all the security for farmers will not prevent the consumers, too, being certain that produce will be safe for them and not injurious to their health. At first reading, we will vote to add the necessary resources to the reserve, resources that formerly seemed to be needed in order to properly treat BSE and foot-and-mouth disease. We are aware that these diseases have recently appeared among sheep and elsewhere. I do not know whether appropriate steps will be taken on this front. We will act accordingly in the first instance, until the letter of amendment has been presented and we have an overall view of things.</p>
<p class="contents">We will make it our concern to meet and overcome the two great challenges presented in Category II. The reconstruction of the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets is crucial and of the utmost importance. People there have relied on being able to pursue their livelihood subject to certain restrictions. The failure of the Morocco Agreement means that will no longer be possible. I am now addressing both the Commission and the Council when I say that we found that provision of these EUR 125 million, even though it was clear at the beginning of this year that the money could not be used, hardly a serious way of doing things. Despite this – or indeed because of it – the fishermen have a claim on help from us, and we will ensure in the Budget process that appropriate action is taken.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to the frontier regions, which are not always rich and able to help themselves. I think, for example, of Bavaria; regions like that are a bit better off. There are other regions which really need more aid, with which we will be concerned. What we will be developing in Category III will be oriented towards the future. Developments following 11 September have shown us that developments are needed in this area. Europol and Eurojust must be developed further, and national sensitivities must be overcome. If terrorism is to be combated, all its advantages in the game must be done away with. We must not stand on old rights. There is room for progress here. What we want is to continue with what was begun last year, that is to say, the inclusion of people in society by means of access to the labour market. We must not simply forget this a year on from it having been a crucial point in Mrs Haug's Budget report, now that new problems are in the offing. People also have a right to social inclusion through training in modern information and communications technologies. This applies not only to cultivated and highly educated people, but also to those who perform very simple work. Thank you very much for your attention. I again thank the rapporteurs and hope that, in cooperation with the other two institutions, we will be able to bring this process to a successful conclusion.</p>

It is, in my experience, the first time that the rapporteur has not tampered with the financial perspectives. I welcome this, especially since we have ended up with a budget surplus of some EUR 11 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make some observations concerning the different headings. I will start with the first heading. I am in favour of the reserve for foot-and-mouth disease. I do not know what other disasters could be heading in our direction, but I believe that the end is not yet in sight. I repeat once again, but I have said it so often: in my opinion, the Commission should not stop thinking about possible alternative ways of funding the fight against crises of this type. We can look into insurance systems. We can put all kinds of restrictions in place, but I do not think that we can rely on the fact that, in the years to come, there will be an annual surplus of one to two billion in the agricultural budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I should particularly like to recommend the amendments on further foot and mouth research, tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, to the Council of Ministers. Can we develop marker vaccines, or new testing methods? Can we examine whether a vaccinated animal is still infectious?</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to heading 2, I endorse the gist of the rapporteur’s policy designed to achieve an improved expenditure and commitment policy. I am thus in favour of the amendments which he has tabled in this connection, with only one exception: the increase in payment appropriations is rather extreme in my opinion. Along with the Commission, I fail to see how this can be spent in a reasonable manner. Consequently, I will in this connection vote differently from the way in which many of you will probably vote.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the proposals to use the flexibility instrument in order to restructure the fishing fleet in Spain and Portugal, I am anxiously awaiting the Commission’s proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, I think we ought to bolster Eastern Europe. The SAPARD payment periods must be extended to 2003. The fact that the payment bodies have not yet been approved should not put those countries at a disadvantage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What are they about? In the first instance, they are about aid to the partner countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Central Asia is an unstable region and has, since the outbreak of the war in Afghanistan, really been at the epicentre of world politics. We all know that military action on its own will not bring a sustainable solution in the region and that we will need to invest in democratic institutions, in a civil society, in socio-economic and ecological reforms, in the fight against drugs and poverty and in sound education. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that is the key aim of our efforts in Central Asia. Hence our call to increase that budget line by 5% for commitment appropriations and by 20% for payment appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to ask you to give your attention to the aid for victims of radiation, particularly in the Semipalatinsk region in Kazakhstan. In that region, the Soviet army carried out 607 nuclear arms tests between 1949 and 1999, the bulk of which were above-ground. The Soviets obliged the population to come out of their houses and watch the huge nuclear mushroom. The effects are catastrophic: the incidence of cancer is five times higher than the national average, birth defects are three times more common than the national average, many young men are impotent and twelve-year old girls suffer from breast cancer. Psychological disorders and suicide are very common, and the average life expectancy is around 52. That is the reason why, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we would like to increase the payment appropriations in budget line B7-524 from EUR 45 million to 60 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Vande Lanotte, you are visiting our House and attending the sitting. You said you have come to listen, rather than make any comments, and I can understand that. However, I should nevertheless like to draw your devoted and kind attention to these two important amendments and maybe, upon completion of this 2002 budgetary procedure, we could visit Semipalatinsk together to witness the disastrous effects of the nuclear insanity and to see how European money could be spent in a effective and useful manner. I would be much obliged. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Because of the restrictive guidelines of the Stability Pact and also because of the problems resulting from a major economic slowdown, the Council is continuing to suggest cuts, which creates real problems for the budget’s implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">This year’s procedure once again betrays true budgetary chaos, with new needs arising and the number of priorities increasing and appropriations becoming smaller and smaller, leading to cutbacks that can only be overridden by revising the Financial Perspective, which is what we have always advocated. Hence, by subscribing to the Council’s way of thinking, the European Parliament is doing no more than vainly attempting to disguise these needs, which are undeniable. This also clearly highlights the absence of clear priorities and a coherent strategy for guaranteeing the proper funding of Community policies in various fields, specifically those of cooperation, agriculture and employment. This is a concern that increases yet further with the creation of considerable reserves which, in the current context, can only give rise to greater doubts.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to category four, the only chapter of the budget that continues to show a consistent reduction in sums, the lack of appropriations is striking, particularly if we take account of the needs of and the commitments given to the Balkans, to Palestine, to Afghanistan, on the World Health Fund or for the conversion of the fleets operating in Moroccan waters.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur’s idea, which is not new, seeks to cut spending, particularly on the Balkans, in order to be able to increase the remaining aid for cooperation and to force the Council to negotiate. Let us hope that this does not lead to further cuts in cooperation such as those we saw last year. We shall see in December what happens.</p>
<p class="contents">These are some of the reasons why we do not support this budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that they have both done an excellent job. They presented a proposal to the House that is, on the whole, acceptable and which, in any case, the radical Members will support. I would also like to highlight the participation of the President-in-Office of the Council in the overall debate, to thank him for taking part and who demonstrates a willingness for dialogue. I hope that his participation will bear fruit at second reading and even that, looking beyond the budget, it will have a positive effect on other very important budgetary issues, particularly the financial regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would simply like to make two comments on the rapporteur’s overall strategy. The first comment concerns the RAL. I fully support the strategy used to attempt to reduce their levels, which are becoming rather unmanageable, and to send a clear message to the Commission for its help in trying to do this. I ask myself, and I ask the rapporteur, the following question: how do you know it is right to apply this strategy to a very specific situation, that of Afghanistan? The RAL are obviously related to the issue of providing aid to refugees, of providing humanitarian aid. I therefore wonder whether or not this could be the time, perhaps – and I put this to the rapporteur, although I understand that it may be difficult at this late stage – to put money – and, in doing so, send out a political message – in the reserve for Afghan refugees. Of course, this should be part of an overall strategy, which is perfectly justified, but I wonder whether or not, for this specific message, we could possibly change the strategy, in any case, at second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment concerns the reform of the Commission. I strongly deny what James Elles said. Furthermore, I believe that yesterday’s Bureau meeting and the Conference of Presidents unanimously supported the proposals from the parliamentary group responsible for this dossier. I reiterate that this group suggested – or indicated in any case – to the Commission, and in particular to the Vice-President charged with reform, that the path that the Commission recommended was not the correct path and was not the path that Parliament advised. Furthermore, given the misunderstandings regarding the number of non-assigned posts, I even question whether the previous system, with one commissioner responsible for both budget and staff, was not the best approach, insofar as the overall picture can be seen. I therefore reiterate that Parliament supports the proposal that runs counter to the proposal outlined by the Vice-President, Mr Kinnock. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">From a budgetary point of view, by 2002, the rhythm of implementation of appropriations must have reached cruising speed: there is no overlapping with the previous programming period and there can be no delay in the implementation of programmes. It is a year in which the forecasts contained in the financial perspectives can be fully achieved. In order for the two powers responsible for implementation (the Commission and the Member States) to achieve this fully, the rapporteur offers us a strategy for reducing the backlog; in order to support his strategy, he uses the performance targets identified by the Commission at the request of an initiative presented by the European Peoples’ Party for the 2001 Budget. It is important that this House accepts the Costa Neves strategy in the field of payment appropriations. Without decisive action by the European Parliament, it is going to be difficult to achieve an interinstitutional political commitment on improving the quality of expenditure, which has always been our priority.</p>
<p class="contents">We also support the strategy of the general rapporteur in relation to the new demands, the Commission’s letter of amendment, where it refers to the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument in order to finance the new structural needs, the restructuring of the Spanish and Portuguese fleets which fished in Moroccan waters, which is awaiting the proposed funding the Commission has promised but has still not presented.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has also presented both <span class="italic">pro memoria</span> in the budget lines for that restructuring, and also in relation to a programme for increasing the competitiveness of the border regions with a view to the enlargement of the Union. Let us hope that between the first and second readings, the Commission will clarify the situation of this programme and the possible funding proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we have the insoluble problem of the lack of financial resources in Category 4 for external action. This problem threatens to tarnish budgetary procedure after budgetary procedure. The Union takes on more and more external commitments, often without consulting this House. Later, unilateral cuts are decided on in the traditional external action lines under the pretext of deficient implementation, responsibility for which is always attributed to external factors and never to the functioning of the Commission or the Member States themselves. Parliament must therefore, year after year, become embroiled in a pointless fight to remove the cuts which both the Commission, in its preliminary draft, and the Council, in its first reading, carry out. This prejudices the role which must be played by such important committees as Foreign Affairs, Development and the Committee on Budgets itself. A very good example this year is the EUR 125 million for the never-signed fishing agreement with Morocco. It has never been explained why the Commission included these appropriations in the reserve, but the true consequence is that the rapporteur has had to employ (and the political groups support him) a strategy of cuts in order to achieve the mobilisation of these fishing appropriations which were never used.</p>
<p class="contents">Honest interinstitutional cooperation must be based on recognition of the budgetary prerogatives of each of the institutions. To wait for the November conciliation to resolve fundamental issues weakens the role of the parliamentary negotiation and the role of the tripartite dialogues for the whole year. We in the European Peoples’ Party consider essential to the good operation of the budgetary procedure, amongst other things, the harmonisation of legislative and budgetary procedures, the genuine participation of the European Parliament in the creation of the rules of the game, that is, the Financial Regulation, prior knowledge of the Commission’s working programme, more active involvement by Parliament in the budgetary element of the Commission reform, etc. All these aspirations are contained in our amendments, which we will put to the vote on Thursday, and which we hope will receive majority support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Färm (PSE).</span></span>   <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like many others, I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Costa Neves. The cooperation has been really good. As ‘shadow rapporteur’ for the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I have also encountered a very constructive attitude, and that is something for which I am grateful.</p>
<p class="contents">By this time, almost all practical proposals from Parliament have been dealt with, and I must therefore concentrate on a number of more theoretical points of view. The budget is the ultimate expression of democracy and social development. It is through the budget that we decide that our public institution needs to use tax revenue in order in some way to influence society, and it is the EU’s budget that is relevant when it comes to transnational European issues.</p>
<p class="contents">It is always difficult to strike a balance between, on the one hand, the desire to do important things and, on the other, the need to respect budget discipline and to ensure that taxpayers genuinely get value for money. In the EU, this balancing act is unusually complicated due to the fact that it has to be carried out both by two budget authorities in tandem and by each authority in its own right. In the case of the Council, it even has to be performed within each and every one of the fifteen governments.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the problem is often that, with one voice – for example that of the agricultural and foreign ministers – the Council pledges a whole lot of money to, for example, agriculture and the fight against BSE and foot and mouth, to the transformation of poor regions, to fishing fleets, to the Balkans and to Afghan refugees etc, while, with its other voice – that of the finance ministers – it says no to increased expenditure. The problem is not made any easier by the fact that those who promise aid do not so often ensure that the Commission, which is to implement all these measures, has the resources needed to turn the promises into a reality. There are often considerable commitments made, but the level of implementation is low and the funding insufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of this criticism, I believe that, for the most part, taxpayers get value for money. I am an MEP for Sweden, the EU’s most Eurosceptic country and, at the same time, the country in which the individual taxpayer contributes most money to the EU. This situation means that it is not always so easy to persuade people to believe that the money is in actual fact used well. The myth of the EU as a hopeless colossus is so strong that I am scarcely believed at home when I say that, even for Sweden, the net cost of the EU amounts to only 1 per cent of the State budget, that the budget is not increasing in real terms and that it is implemented in such a way that the Swedish exchequer gets back a large part of its contribution each year. Indeed, a tenth of the whole budget is in practice paid back to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, as I say, that we get value for money, but there are still a lot of shortcomings. We need to do quite a lot in the future in order to convince people that the funds are being properly used. First of all, I believe that we must simplify the budget procedure itself and ensure that it is made more transparent. The new budget regulation and activity-based budgeting should contribute to this. Secondly, we must speed up internal reform. We have certainly now placed a number of services in the reserve, but the aim of this is not to slow down, but to force the pace of, reform.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also convinced that, as Commissioner Schreyer pointed out in his speech, we are going to have to make the budget more flexible and increase our ability to respond to new events. In order to achieve this, I also believe that a new spirit of cooperation is needed between the two branches of the budgetary authority. Most obvious, perhaps, are the deficiencies in category 4, that of external expenditure, to which the Council has added new expenditure year after year on, for example, aid to Kosovo and Serbia, new fisheries agreements etc. This year, we have had far-reaching discussions on assistance to refugees, the Global Health Fund and other efforts to combat AIDS etc.</p>
<p class="contents">In both 2000 and 2001, we solved this problem by means of the flexibility instrument, which gave us a further EUR 200 million per year. The problem this year is that the programmes for Kosovo and Serbia which necessarily gave rise to this flexibility instrument must still be implemented at a high level but without our being able this year to use the flexibility instrument’s EUR 200 million. In spite of this, the Council will prevent us from using those funds that are not needed for the fisheries agreements, and that is something I do not understand. Why are we not allowed to use them when we, in actual fact, have major costs for the programmes to which we have agreed? This does not hold water. With this policy, the Council is forcing us to do something I should preferably have liked us to avoid, namely to say no to a proportion of the major expenditure on the Balkans, even if we are obviously using this to protect the most sensitive areas, that is to say Serbia and Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us conduct an open dialogue in this area, characterised by trust. We understand the Council’s priorities when it comes to the Balkans, AIDS etc, but then we should also ask for a certain amount of understanding for the fact that we cannot prioritise away all the issues closest to our hearts. We want to rescue aid to the Balkans. Let us get around the negotiating table. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The increase of 5% over the outgoings of the Budget year 2001 corresponds to the Berlin agricultural guidelines. That is not only good but also inevitable, as no other policy is as thoroughly submitted to Community methods as agricultural policy. I note with particular concern, however, that this great chunk of agricultural expenditure is increasingly the object of covetous desires on the part of not a few politicians who see it as a sort of disposable object which can be moved around at will.</p>
<p class="contents">If this intention is to be countered, the Financial Perspective will have to be qualified by the Commission, any kind of speculation eliminated and the across-the-board cuts that are always being sought in the agricultural budget not in fact implemented. The appearance of foot-and-mouth disease eleven months ago has meant a very unbalanced situation in animal husbandry, especially as regards food safety, animal protection and the internal market. Distorted competition in markets leads to the loss of jobs and income. Pricing is becoming chaotic and nobody can explain why. So I wish to advocate a temporary increase in the financial allocation to the market organisation for animal husbandry. I urge that the so-called interim balance sheet of Agenda 2000 should not be put off simply to do a favour for a particular country. I urge moreover that the reserve should be kept until an explanation is given of the contradiction by which we were talking about EUR 1 billion last year and only EUR 400 million now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Go on, blame the citizens! In the few minutes’ speaking time that I have, I will give one example; that of the B3-500 budget line, to which the European Parliament would like to allocate EUR 7 million in order to fund the so-called European political parties. This appropriation is without legal basis and has no moral justification. Of course, the citizens have never given their opinion on this, but if we asked them if they want to pay more taxes to fund political parties in Brussels, they would obviously say no. On the other hand, the MEPs would say yes, as this is of great interest to them. These European political parties are inter-party organisations that have no militant base to speak of. Their funding – provided thus far by the parliamentary groups of this House out of their administrative appropriations – has been the subject of a recent report published by the Court of Auditors. Because of this, the so-called European parties are seeking other sources of funding. And since the citizens do not seem to want to pay of their own accord, we are going to make them pay by means of tax and social security deductions, so that they have no choice.</p>
<p class="contents">For reasons that I have already explained during our debate on the Schleicher report on 17 May 2001, and in my explanation of vote given on the same day, the B3-500 budget line has no legal basis, no more than the draft regulation on the status and funding of European political parties. The Council has still not reached agreement on this regulation. Admittedly, the Treaty of Nice provides the possibility of a legal basis by adding a second sub-paragraph to Article 191 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, but there is no need to remind you – especially in the wake of the negative outcome of the Irish referendum – that there is still a long way to go before this Treaty can be ratified. Lastly, the draft regulation without legal basis and currently being examined by the Council aims to put in place an underhand funding system that runs counter to freedoms. To cap everything, the chairs of the five European parties have recently written to Council and to the Commission to demand that the funding from Europe is increased to EUR 15 million instead of EUR 7 million. Such is inflation!</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the political parties in Europe must be freely financed by citizens and by the national political parties, who are themselves funded according to national regulations in line with their respective legal system and constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, Mr President, the MEPs of the <span class="italic">Mouvement pour la France</span> group, along with the Members of the <span class="italic">SOS Démocratie</span> group, will vote against the B3-500 budget line. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish at this point to return explicitly to something about which there are some rather vague conceptions in this House, namely that, since 1992, there has been a fundamental change in the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, in announcing a letter of amendment, you reminded me that this is the same procedure as every year, with, first, the spectre of a budgetary crisis being conjured up, and then the discovery of room for manoeuvre in the agriculture budget. At this point, I say an emphatic ‘Yes’ to a contingency reserve, but when there really is a crisis, this reserve must actually be used, for many sectors currently find themselves fighting for their very existence.</p>
<p class="contents">I would very much like to take up the debate on the eastward enlargement, in order to make one thing clear: I have no problem whatever with the full integration of the acceding countries' agriculture into the Common Market by 2004, if at the same time the free movement of persons, capital, services and goods, which is part of full membership, is also made a reality, so that there can at last be a fair debate on the whole context of this topic.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusions of the Heads of State and of Government at Nice have, on the one hand, highlighted the need to start restructuring the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets. I support this, but would point out at the same time that we cannot, on the other hand, let a very restrictive approach in the next two years keep the remaining European fishing fleets at arms length and wasting away. We must have discussions with the Commission about this.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say quite explicitly that the 25 July communication from the Commission on the frontier regions was held by Parliament, in its resolution of 5 September, not to comply with the requirements laid down by the European Council. For that reason, Commissioner, we call upon the Commission to produce definite proposals for a regulation on the frontier regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now address one further point. We made 400 posts available in the 2001 Budget. We are now talking in terms of 317, which are still being kept in reserve. Commissioner, please just take a look at the posts in the Commission which have not yet been filled. I will remind you, in addition to the points we have mentioned in connection with the release of the reserve, that we spent last year reiterating that reform includes the simplification of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, without the Community patrimony being substantially affected thereby. There is, in my judgment, a need for further negotiation on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">One final point, Mr President: We expect, before the second reading, to have a comprehensive report by the Commission on the re-examination of the fundamental concepts of foreign policy, so that we have, with reference to current demands, a conclusive plan for combining conflict prevention, decisive humanitarian aid and the alliance against terrorism in a rational Community package, which we will be able to adopt at second reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a comprehensive report which addresses all the problems of the final stage of the ECSC’s life, but it also takes into account the problems of the future, if it is true – which it is – that, although the ECSC is dying, the coal and steel industry must continue to develop in Europe. The sum set aside for the ten remaining months of the ECSC budget is sufficient, and the increased appropriations for research are in line with the forecasts for after the Treaty’s expiry. Parliament wants to play a leading part in our endeavours to give a reassuring response to the 357 000 workers who are employed in the sector and to provide a secure future in terms of the growth and restructuring of the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to focus, in the last part of my speech, on the Union’s general budget. As the members of my group have already said, starting with the coordinator, Mr Ralf Walter, our opinion of the work carried out by Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg is positive. There are many elements which deserve a mention here: the undertaking to improve the quality and speed of expenditure, and here I refer to the Structural Funds, which require an extraordinary measure from the European institutions to motivate, coordinate and carry out prospective and retrospective assessments so that European federalism does not fail this major test; the attention given to the issue of border regions, mentioned by Commissioner Schreyer – I, too, agree with Mr Böge when he says that it is right to clarify the concept of a border region – not least in relation to the enlargement process: regions which must not be the only ones to benefit, Commissioner, and I would stress this point, for the pilot project approved last year does not and must not, as it progresses, just concern the border regions.</p>
<p class="contents">We have got off to a good start: the negotiations will take place and I feel that, ultimately, we will achieve a sound budget, but when I think of this great asset which is Europe, an asset which is ours and ours alone, a supranational political entity which others look to for guidance, as they will have to in the face of fresh challenges, I wonder whether we really ought not to review the financial mechanisms of the European budget if we want to consolidate a great supranational institution which is the envy of all and which needs more resources and a role that is more clearly defined. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a budget for managing interests which presents no central objectives for resolving the problems being created by the recession, not even as a propaganda exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft budget makes no serious or fundamental attempt whatsoever to redistribute income to the less developed areas or to the working classes hit by unemployment, underemployment and poverty. The austerity imposed on the Member States and the European Union as a whole means that even the budget lines available in the past have been cut back. Agricultural spending is being constantly eroded, with tragic consequences for farmers, in a bid to make national budgets pay for the anti-farming policy decided in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, following the terrorist attack on 11 September, the European Union is being called on to fund intergovernmental cooperation in the so-called area of justice, that is, to keep files on and prosecute citizens who go beyond the bounds of resistance and reaction tolerated by the system.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will vote against the budget because, instead of resolving the current problems, it will create new problems for workers, farmers and small enterprises, instead of contributing towards peace in the world, it promotes war and an imperialist hegemony, instead of protecting individual and collective democratic, political workers' rights, it suppresses them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is with satisfaction that I at least observe that, for the first time in quite a few years, there has been no serious talk about revising the budget ceiling. That is, for me, the sign of a rapporteur who, in a real sense, chooses to respect and apply the budget as a <span class="italic">ceiling of expenditure</span> and not as a <span class="italic">target for expenditure</span>. That is something I think bodes well for forthcoming negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of this, there is nonetheless good cause for warning against an unduly expansive budget, especially when it comes to categories 3 and 4. The limited margin in both these categories is cause for concern, especially when, in the wake of the terrorist attacks on 11 September, we see an approaching need for measures of humanitarian aid for Afghanistan, as well as a need for measures in the area of justice and home affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is already expensive for taxpayers. I believe it to be obvious that we must ensure that it does not become still more expensive. I see it as self-evident that, at this stage, Parliament should create room for negotiation in relation to the Council. There is, however, reason for calling for a general tightening-up, on the parts of both the Council and Parliament, before the second reading so that, from a purely budgetary point of view, they are able to handle the situation that has arisen in the wake of the terrorist attacks in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, just a few brief words about Mrs Buitenweg’s report. The rapporteur has made progress in the preparatory work before enlargement in 2004. That is good, and there is cause to thank her for this. I must however note that a very great deal remains to be done in order to prepare and adapt the administration before an enlargement that will soon be only two years ahead of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I will firstly mention an issue which I had not included in my notes: the Council is pleased that Parliament shares its concern about the backlogs, the RALs. If I had not lived through 17 European budgets, I would be amazed. In fact, it is the governments who have the greatest responsibility for the creation of RALs and the Council could make a more useful contribution to the reduction of the RALs by renouncing the systematic underbudgeting of payment appropriations, which do most damage to the pockets of the Finance Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">What really concerns me most in this budget, however, is that, in real terms, in euros, aid to third countries has decreased since 1999. If one thing became clear after 11 September it was precisely that it is going to be necessary to maintain and develop humanitarian aid and our contribution to development aid. And this is in no way guaranteed by the Community budget, despite the efforts of the rapporteur, and I salute those efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial perspectives are clearly not sufficient and we have a TV-addicted Council of Ministers, that is to say that their external priorities are led by the latest TV headlines. We have Kosovo: we have to help Kosovo. We have Serbia: we have to help Serbia. We have Afghanistan: we have to help Afghanistan. And the next headline will become the priority. And what price do we pay? The price of having to make cuts in previous policies. We still have problems in the Balkans. We still have a serious problem in Africa. We still have problems of underdevelopment in Latin America and Asia. But we have to make cuts.</p>
<p class="contents">The other question I wanted to raise, which is related to the last point, is whether there are first- and second-class European Councils. Why is Berlin more important than Nice, in terms of expenditure? Why? In Berlin, financial perspectives were set which had to be agreed with Parliament, but in Nice, the same European Council, composed of almost the same people, said that we had to create a special programme for the restructuring of the fleet that fished in Morocco. Why is that not budgeted for? Why has the Council, with a Commission proposal valued at EUR 197 million, not budgeted for it? It should have done so.</p>
<p class="contents">And I regret that Parliament has not fulfilled its obligation, because what we have to do on first reading is budget in the way we want. The Council will then come in at the negotiation at second reading. I regret that we have not been able to do this, but I trust that we will be able to resolve it between now and December. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I apologise if I have made a mistake, but if not, I would like to receive an official explanation.</p>
<p class="contents">Having made my point, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank the Members of the Committee on Budgets and particularly the general rapporteur, Mr Costa Neves, for the attention he has given to the requests and concerns of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights. We asked a great deal, Mr President, and we received a great deal in return, and this is something I welcome. We only made legitimate requests. We asked for an increase in the funding granted to the European Refugee Fund, and this was given. We asked for an increase in the resources for measures to combat violence towards women, children and teenagers, and this was given. We asked for an increase in the resources to combat child pornography on the Internet, and this was granted. We asked for no less than six new budget lines, and these were given. We have a new European Migration Monitoring Observatory to enable the European Union to anticipate the arrival of waves of migrants and to be better prepared for these. We have a specific research and evaluation programme on respect for fundamental rights of the European Union, so that the Charter of Fundamental Rights becomes an operational reality and not just a reality in words alone. We have a new budget line that should enable Eurojust to become operational. We have funding for the Schengen line with a view to adapting the Schengen Information System to the realities of enlargement, and, lastly, we anticipated – and this, Mr President, is an urgent request to the President-in-Office of the Council – we anticipated, given the current situation, exceptional appropriations for use by Europol in the fight against terrorism. We are well aware of the limits of Europol’s actions, we also know that it is founded on conventions, and thus we could experience legal difficulties in using these appropriations. However, we would like to address a formal appeal to the Council not to allow these appropriations to escheat, to create the legal basis, which will enable Europol to become fully operational and will allow Eurojust to develop to its full potential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Guy-Quint (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I am going to follow Mr Colom i Naval’s advice by speaking on the problem of reform, for which I am the permanent rapporteur. This problem is quite fundamental, because we have to reiterate on a regular basis that the European Parliament is firmly in favour of administrative reform of the institutions. The polemics that are currently raging between those with differing views should be less important than the fundamental problems, and the fundamental problem is to make the Union’s action clearer and more effective in meeting the public’s expectations, so that citizens start to trust the European Union again.</p>
<p class="contents">You know that, in this budget, we noted several delays in implementing this reform, particularly as regards the Commission’s response – which we have yet to receive – on the rewriting of the financial regulation, and also with regard to setting up base management.</p>
<p class="contents">The report's fundamental concern is with the reform of the status and organisation of a career in European civil service. We had to take a precautionary measure and put funds into the reserve for creating the new positions that were requested. This is nothing more than a precautionary measure, and I would like to reiterate that, for the time being, this is only at the first reading stage as we asked the Commission to provide clarification on the implementation of the single Statute, so that we could have very precise and realistic answers, particularly on the problem of early retirement schemes for civil servants and temporary staff, but also on the problems caused by absenteeism and vacancies. We believe that the Commission will be able to provide us with the answers to all these issues, but, nevertheless, I wanted to draw your attention to the fact that hypothetical positions will not help this reform to move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">We have 15 countries and seven institutions, but we have only one European Union, for which only one statute is needed. We must not take refuge behind the reports published last year, because the linearity is no longer what it was. We therefore want a clear budgetary framework in order to adopt a position, and I shall repeat the request made by all the Committees of Parliament to the Council: the Council must start talking and give us answers on a regular basis so that all our procedures – and reform, in particular – progress within a framework that is efficient in terms of budget.</p>
<p class="contents">This reform is vital: it must not just look good on paper, but should also be realistic and applicable over time. Nothing will stop when we reach 2004. Everything must continue. The reform process must provide renewed motivation and must modernise the way we work, but it must retain a European civil service that has one objective: to implement the political plans of the European Union that restore citizens' confidence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The effects that will be manifested by this integration must also be taken into account when planning the Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">We see, looking at the Four Freedoms, that there will be no difficulties in some areas, but problems with adaptation in others. There will be no great changes to the movement of goods, because substantial liberalisation has occurred, nor in freedom of establishment, because the person or business is subject to the laws of the state in which they establish themselves. We will, though, have problems with integration as regards the free movement of labour and the freedom to provide services, for the precise reason that there has been to date no competition in these areas, and these markets are only regionally oriented unless they choose to be otherwise. The frontier regions will therefore come under particular pressure when the freedoms in question are introduced. Specific aid measures are therefore needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The recommendations of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market make it clear that it advocates endowing the frontier regions programme that you, Commissioner, mentioned, with additional resources.</p>
<p class="contents">We are grateful to the Committee on Budgets and especially to the rapporteur for their accepting these suggestions and, in part, adding to them. One point in particular is of importance to me: the instruments proposed by the Commission are not sufficient to strengthen competitiveness in the frontier regions, as they promote only cooperation between East and West rather than the specific situation of the frontier regions themselves. A specific programme is therefore needed, and so we request the Commission to present a legal foundation for it; I take their statements to mean that they are prepared to do this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They apparently considered our opinion as individual amendments tabled by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. I hope that this kind of procedure will run more transparently in future.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the budget, thanks partly to a tremendous effort by our rapporteur, this has become a budget of consolidation. There are, of course, always disagreements about all kinds of sections of the budget, but we have been through worse. I also have to say that there are clearly fewer disagreements at the level of our committee, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. Also, the Council has made far fewer attempts at scrapping sections than has previously been the case, so, as far as that is concerned, my congratulations to the Council. In my view, the problems that remain are at the level of open coordination. The Council is still tempted to say that that should be financed from the coffers of Parliament. However, Parliament must rubber-stamp this budget, yet it is not allowed to let its voice be heard fully on that score. We will need to hold extensive discussions on this matter once again in the years to come. We have a number of differences of opinion on this, and I hope that those can be settled in the next couple of years.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another problem concerning EQUAL, one of the components of the Social Fund. Once again, the Council has made some serious cutbacks in that area too. Despite this, I hope that it is possible to restore the Commission’s preliminary draft in this respect. That seems extremely important to me. I gather that the Commission has thought very carefully about how precisely that proposal should be structured. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It can be done another way. So, as every year, we urge progressive reduction of tobacco subsidies and their replacement by increased aid for rural development with a view to alternative forms of income, which could benefit workers upstream and downstream in the regions. The same thing happens every year, yet so far nothing has changed. But we must always hope.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the NGOs, we are always advocating support for them. We want to know, though, what is done with the money that is granted to them, which is only right and proper. We therefore demand that information on them be made accessible to the public on a regular basis. Only then will we have a chance to check whether our financial support for them is justified. Believe me, we already find it extraordinarily difficult to get any kind of overview on what organisations we are supporting.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally opaque, though, is the Commission's decision to stop funding the environmental organisation ‘Globe’. This is quite unjustifiable and so seems positively wilful. It must be added that the funds accorded ‘Globe’ in the current budget year were not paid out. Yet even NGOs need to be able to plan ahead with certainty in order, for example, to be able to carry on paying their office staff. The Commission's action in this regard is anti-social. Where there is political will, Commissioner, one can find a way, or another budget line for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the agencies, it does indeed appear as if some agencies had already developed active lives of their own a long time ago. They simply exist. So we finance them; more money every year, irrespective of output. That seems to be all that matters. This cannot go on, for this money is needed elsewhere. Our task is to ensure that the organisations we support work efficiently. Efficiency and effectiveness are not achieved merely by blindly piling-up resources, but by regular observation and monitoring, on the basis of which any necessary adjustments can be made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to start by thanking my colleagues in the Committee on Budgets for the fact that nearly all the amendments produced by this committee were adopted. We have reinstated the substance of the budget estimates for regional and transport policy that you, Commissioner, proposed. I really must appeal to the Council not to be such a two-faced split personality.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not tolerable for a great hullaballoo to have been made at the Göteborg Summit about our desire for a sustainable transport policy, only for the Council to cut resources in the area of sustainable mobility<span class="italic">.</span> This sort of ambiguity cannot go on, and we hope that the Council will admit that. If you want to have a rational, environmentally responsible transport policy, you cannot cut funds that are allocated for that purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">My main point, though, is to do with tourism, something which did not, unfortunately, meet with favour in the Committee on Budgets. I would, though, just ask you to think again about it. We proposed estimates for funds to promote tourism in Europe. You all know about the debate over many years about the 'Philoxenia' programme to attract tourist from overseas, with its slogan ‘tourists to Europe’. This topic has taken on a whole new dimension since 11 September. Not only are the airlines getting 20%-30% fewer customers, but so are hotels in Brussels, Berlin and in all European cities. The same is true of restaurants, souvenir shops and boutiques. We are seeing a massive slump in tourism, specifically from the USA and Canada. This situation is leading to major difficulties in the economy and putting jobs at risk. I put it to the Council and the Commission that, if we are to discuss the consequences of 11 September next month, we should re-examine the question of what we are to do to promote tourism in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am deputy chairman of the delegation to Slovakia, and we were in Slovakia last week. Our programme included, among other things, a visit to the 'green frontier', the Ukrainian border near Kosice, where we saw that a very large number of refugees, especially from Afghanistan, were crossing the border, probably not with a peaceful purpose; it is estimated that 10% – 30% could have other activities in mind – of a terrorist or military nature, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">So I wish to ask the Commission and the Council, as a matter of urgency, to do everything possible to secure our borders, in particular, by immediately using the pre-accession support framework to make available the necessary apparatus on the borders that candidate States share with States not in the EU. We are talking here about basic equipment such as night vision devices and motor vehicles, so that these frontiers can be better watched with immediate effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Committee concerned itself intensively with problems in connection with the support provided by the PHARE programmes and with the Toth case. The Committee decided, from both a Slovakian and a European standpoint, not to put funds in reserve. In Slovakia, the inevitable conclusions were reached. The deputy prime minister with responsibility for this has resigned, which represents the political outcome. The director dealing with the case has also resigned – a replacement has been appointed – and, in addition, the Slovak parliament has just passed a new law on financial monitoring and internal auditing. So we will, I am sure, be able to take these funds out of the reserve by Second Reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My first point is addressed to the Commissioner and concerns B-1 items where the Commission pays an enormous amount of money for subsidies for growing rice, bananas and the distillation of wine. These are items I would have thought we were by now starting to reduce the payments for. I would ask her to look at them. I tabled many amendments amounting to hundreds of millions of euros. I hope that rather than compulsory expenditure like that, being left to grow year by year, it should be looked at very closely. Perhaps I could ask her to do that in advance of future budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">The other matter is a perennial matter which comes up each year: the European women's lobby and finance for women's organisations generally. We tabled an amendment, and so did Mrs Avilés Perea of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, to say that the money that is voted for lobby organisations for women following the Beijing conference should not all go, as it has for many years, to the European Women's lobby.</p>
<p class="contents">I know many of my colleagues in the Chamber receive all sorts of letters and e-mails from around Europe saying it all must go to this one organisation. This is wrong, we need to encourage new organisations in this very important field. It is right and proper that the amendment that was put forward by the United Kingdom delegation was in fact passed. This made it clear, in the remarks column, that one organisation, any single organisation within that spending line should not get more than 65%. I trust that the approved amendment will be held to when the budget comes out. I thank the Commissioner for her consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have not known a Commissioner who has followed the proceedings so closely or who has spent so much time with the Committee on Budgets as the present Commissioner. Of course, in many ways this is a highly technical exercise and, unlike national budgets, it does not have much effect on the course of economic development in the European Union. It is too small for that, even in the area of Structural Funds, for even the most generous beneficiaries receive a very small percentage of GNP. Ireland, at the best, was getting 2%, Portugal and the poorer areas of Spain are getting between 1% and 2% of GNP. It is not a very generous outlay of money, but if we can use it in order to guide their economic policies in the direction that we think is best, then the money can be usefully spent.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one idea and one hope that I have always entertained. I believe I said some years ago that compared to national parliaments we were like children playing shop. The amount of resources at our disposal is so small and there is so little we can do with them, but there is one area that I would like to see developed. I do not want to see an expansion of public spending at European level. But in the area of economic cooperation and development, if we could only pool at European level the resources which the countries of the European Union and the European Union itself devote to international cooperation and development cooperation, we could convert individual national efforts into a common European effort without increasing the sum of taxation. This is essential if we are to develop a common foreign and security policy. I believe we could have a much greater impact on the development of the poorer countries and redirect our foreign policy in a way that we could help the poor, help to establish peace and give us real influence in the world. If there is one area in which we should demand subsidiarity from the national states to the European Union, it is here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One relates to the general amounts and the other to the deficiencies in the rules on budgetary management. Our differences on each of the spending categories are clear and I am not going to go into the detail.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, representatives of the Council, we need the budget to be an effective and credible tool which works for employment, for research, for support for small businesses and for the construction of a genuine area of justice and security. Parliament has shown flexibility and austerity in this procedure and it is therefore in a position to ask the Council not to be politically autocratic and to show unequivocal signs that it is prepared to negotiate. I trust that you will take advantage of the flexibility demonstrated by our rapporteur, Carlos Costa, whose work – as well as the efforts of the other two rapporteurs, Mrs Buitenweg and Mr Seppänen – deserves to be congratulated.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the resources intended for external Union action, we demand that this Parliament’s undeniable political objectives are guaranteed, and these include providing resources for areas which are essential to world balance, such as the Mediterranean and Latin America. In this procedure, the Commission proposes using the flexibility instrument to finance the restructuring of the Community fleets which fished in the area of the defunct fisheries agreement with Morocco. This decision is fair, technically correct and necessary. It deals with a very serious problem which affects employment and a key activity of many regions, and which arises in a context of crisis. We must remember that we are about to implement a new common fisheries policy which has been dogged by intolerable discrimination for decades when compared to other economic activities, from the point of view of internal market rules.</p>
<p class="contents">As for budgetary management, this Parliament has repeatedly condemned the Commission’s inability to put an end to the problem of the so-called anomalous RAL. In this respect, we have produced a good strategy, which our rapporteur has mentioned, which is closely related to the reform of the Commission. We must bear in mind that in the last three financial years very high payments were not used. We must therefore find rules which work, methods which allow faster implementation and rules which shorten the cycle of projects. As the last speaker, I hope that the Commission and the Council obey the evangelical maxim when it comes to paying attention and that the last are put first, not only in the Kingdom of Heaven, but also here in Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, I take the floor again not for a fine conclusion, but because I would like to give consideration to a few points addressed directly to the Commission, which I had not previously mentioned, or to which I would like to respond.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me first return to the flexibility reserve. The question was asked as to when the Commission was going to submit its proposal. We will do it along with the letter of amendment on the use of the flexibility reserve, in accordance with the proposal on the restructuring programme for the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets. In accordance with the proposal, provision will be made for EUR 197 million from the flexibility reserve to be used for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">On the second point, the frontier regions, I must again bring it to your attention that regions currently on the frontiers of the European Union receive a very great deal of financial support from the Structural Fund. The situation is different from that which obtained when the European Union was enlarged to the south. I am ready and willing to produce a special report for you on the extent to which the frontier regions are making use of the Structural Fund programmes for their particular problems and the extent to which there is also some need here for reorientation. I repeat that the Structural Funds pose, at present, the greatest problem with regard to implementation. This year, we again have the situation where the Member States have drawn up comprehensive prognoses on how intensively they will be implementing the programmes, but there are major delays. I do not know how we will be able to catch up by the end of the year, and frontier regions will, of course, be affected.</p>
<p class="contents">I have again explained what the Commission has proposed, and you have already worked through it in your Committees. There is very little room for financial manoeuvre in the Budget; even in Category 3 I can see little of it, even after the resolutions that you will probably be adopting on Thursday. I will now take note of your demand for new regulations or proposals for legislation. We are talking about 2002; we are talking about enlargement taking place in 2004, which means that Member States, too, must implement the pre-accession aid packages in 2002/2003. The issue of new legislative initiatives is therefore, of course, double-edged. It was for that reason that the Commission reached for the available programmes in order to build on their foundations, the trans-European networks programme being just one example. We have now also submitted a definite proposal on how this building-up is to be achieved, and the same is true of the youth programme. This is an already existing programme which needs no new legislative basis but onto which the resources can be built as appropriate. It goes without saying, though, that the Commission will undertake very careful analysis and observe which way Parliament votes on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to respond briefly to Mr Wynn's question on the Global Health Fund. My fellow-Commissioner Mr Nielson will now be producing a proposal for EDF 9 on the subject. It concerns EUR 60 million from this special allocation intended for contributions to international initiatives. Mr Nielson will propose that these EUR 60 million be allotted to the Global Health Fund. This is, I believe, a good use to put it in terms of the overall expenditure incurred in relation to the EDF. We are working on the assumption that EUR 60 million can be paid out from the EDF's resources for 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat: we are proposing to use resources remaining from 2001 for the Community Budget. There was also a demand for revision of the Financial Regulation. In order to take account of the changes Parliament would like to see made, our proposals will be submitted in time for the next plenary debate in Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I am still highly optimistic, for a certain amount of effort – above all by the Council – could mean that we may well still have the old Financial Regulation in 2002, but may be able to bring the 2003 Budget to a conclusion on the basis of a new Financial Regulation. I believe that would represent a very significant modernisation in view of the many concerns you have expressed today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
