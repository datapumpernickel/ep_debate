<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lienemann (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that together we have produced a useful piece of work in this water framework directive.</p>
<p class="contents">We have produced a useful piece of work; it may be a collective compromise, but it is a compromise which incorporates stringent requirements, which I think will clear the way for a qualitative and quantitative leap in water management. In the long term, our fellow European citizens must enjoy high quality water everywhere, whether surface or groundwater.</p>
<p class="contents">This compromise was made possible by active commitment, by the balance of power that the European Parliament was able to create, by the participation of all the groups, in particular the shadow rapporteurs who assisted me, and by Mr Provan, the chairman of our delegation in this difficult conciliation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, also like to thank the other participants who are, of course, the Commission, which had to play the role of intermediary and technical innovator, and did so extremely rigorously and effectively, the Commissioner and also all the staff of the Commission. I would also like to thank the Council, especially the Portuguese Presidency and their Minister of State, Mr Pedro Silva Perreira, who made this agreement possible. I have all the more reason for saying this, because this directive certainly requires a greater effort on the part of the southern European countries than it does from other Community countries with easier access to water.</p>
<p class="contents">In which areas has significant progress been made? Firstly, the directive is strictly binding in legislative terms. Second, the implementation of measures concerning the issue that we in Parliament considered absolutely crucial, that is the elimination of priority hazardous substances and a complete end to discharges of such substances. You are aware that this House wanted our directive to be compatible with the commitments given under international conventions, in particular OSPAR, as stated in the directive. The arrangements introduced will clear the way for a list of priority substances to be gradually drawn up every 4 years, that is, priority substances which must be reduced in quantity, and priority hazardous substances, which must purely and simply be eliminated.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, there was the important and sensitive matter of groundwater. We were faced with the problem of producing a rigorous definition of what we called good groundwater status. In order for this good status to be specified, it was decided that a ‘daughter’ directive should be drawn up, that is, a directive that will implement the framework directive. Parliament was rather afraid that the new directive would provide an opportunity to delay requirements to combat pollution and immediate measures to prevent the pollution of groundwater.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we wanted, and secured, the stipulation, first of all, that if the directive were not approved by the Members of the European Parliament, the Member States would draw up rules guaranteeing good groundwater status. If the Member States did not do this – it is a kind of Sword of Damocles – if 75% of the level laid down in the applicable pollution standards governing good groundwater status is reached, then the Member States will have to reverse the trend. In general, the directive takes account of Parliament's determination to ensure that action by the Member States enables any upward trends in the pollution of groundwater to be reversed.</p>
<p class="contents">So you see, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that in this way we have come up with a system that enables us to make significant progress, and not just in terms of the main principles, but also in the overall effectiveness of the decisions that have been made.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, we shall all have to be vigilant. Firstly with regard to all the daughter directives, which will implement the framework directive. We shall be involved in the codecision procedure to determine the list of priority substances and priority hazardous substances. A first report has already been examined by the Commission and a rapporteur has been appointed. The second major task for this House will be the substance of the framework directive on groundwater.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, I think we have done the bulk of the work. We will continue to work together, but I have a feeling that at the dawn of the 21st century, with this framework directive, Europe is entering a new age where the protection of water, that most fundamental resource, will become a priority in terms of policy and the behaviour of all those involved, whether they be farmers, industrialists or consumers. In any event, this is the intention of our directive and I have no doubt that the Commission and the Member States will ensure that it is implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, however, we are, as a result, standing on the threshold of new tasks that are at least as important. Since the end of the 1980s, a range of Commission proposals had been submitted to the House, aimed at revising existing directives and made necessary by scientific and technical developments. When those of us in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy initially examined the proposals, we found that no effort had been made to coordinate their provisions or the concepts behind them.</p>
<p class="contents">In June 1995, and at our group’s insistence, the European Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy held a hearing of experts on the European Union’s water policy. The experts’ statements confirmed our concerns. The Council and the Commission complied with the call for comprehensive European water protection legislation to be drawn up. The idea of the current Water Framework Directive was born at that time. In February 1996, the European Commission tabled its proposals in the form of a communication. In a very comprehensive report, our fellow PPE-DE Group member, Mr Florenz, has clarified the European Parliament’s aims and identified the current shortcomings. In the light of the discussions between the Commission and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the Commission proposal of December 1996, which had been produced under great pressure of time, was supplemented in two stages in 1997. The definitive, official Commission proposal was finally ready in February 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">By working together closely in this way, Parliament and the European Commission gradually moved towards a consensus, a process also helped by the intensive discussions during the first and second readings in the European Parliament and the conciliation procedure. I should particularly like to thank the Commissioners responsible, Mrs Bjerregaard and Mrs Wallström, and especially the Commission officials involved, for this constructive cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">In Parliament’s view, the result we now have before us is a great success of a kind which would still have been unthinkable two years ago. This success is reflected in the removal from the statute books of the hitherto fragmented EU legislation in the field of water protection, the coherence of the relevant water directives at EU level, the legally binding nature of the measures taken pursuant to Article 4, the shortening of the deadline for complying with the aims of the directive, the satisfactory way in which the issue of costs has been settled, also in accordance with Ireland’s wishes, the introduction of the combined approach whereby limit values and quality objectives are established with a view to reducing the levels of pollutants, significant improvements over the common position regarding the requirements for groundwater protection and, finally, the inclusion of the goal and the definition of the OSPAR Convention with no stipulations in terms of time.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like once again to make explicitly clear in this connection the particular importance we attach to reconciling Community law and international conventions, albeit in such a way that the substance of international conventions does not automatically become legally binding in Community law. Finally, mention should be made of the guarantee that codecision will apply in connection with future procedures. Welcome as this result is, we cannot, however, rest on our laurels. The Water Framework Directive now needs to be put into effect.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also, of course, particularly like to thank the Portuguese Presidency and, finally and most especially, the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann. Our shared success has only been made possible by her incredible commitment and the huge amount of time and energy she put into her work. It was a pleasure for me to cooperate with a colleague in this way. My own special thanks go to you, Mrs Lienemann, and our own staff here in Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition, Parliament got its own point of view across quite well, especially with regard to the important issue that, at last, we have the prospect of attaining a situation in which hazardous substances can no longer get into groundwater supplies. In my opinion, it should be as clear as day that when we know a substance is dangerous, in no case should it be able to get into groundwater, as water, apart from anything else, is a very important resource for people in terms of health. Obviously it is just regrettable that the deadlines for implementation are an unreasonably long way off.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all it has to be said that in certain fields of industry in the European Union we have made progress. In many areas, for example, the community and industry have played their part relatively well. Agriculture and forestry, however, are still problems, with their diffuse discharges. More needs to be done about this. Regarding consumers it is naturally important how consumption is controlled, and here charges and taxation are of prime importance. For that reason, it is a bit hard for me to understand how people can even begin to think that water could be a commodity paid for out of general taxes, as it is only through charges that consumption can be controlled really sensibly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the Spanish wish to pollute their water, they should do just that. But the tide of deregulation has turned. In 1996, the Commission proposed the ecological water directive, which did not amount to more than five pages, however. We now have a substantial legislative document of 60 pages, with 90 pages of appendix. This is thanks to cross-party cooperation, between the groups within the European Parliament. I would especially like to thank Mrs Lienemann, but also Chris Davies from the liberal group and Mrs Schleicher from the Christian-Democrats.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greens feel that 80% of this document has been a success. What was disappointing was the water price policy. What is successful is the fact that we have a new principle for chemical substances. Chemical substances are no longer banned because they are also harmful to human health, but in line with a new principle that harmful substances do not belong in the water. I think we can be proud of this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The fact that the result has turned out as well as it has is largely due to the tireless and committed work done by the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann, whom we wish to thank.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive could, of course, have been still better and beefed up even more, for example as far as the timetables are concerned. That would have been desirable. Yet, it is obvious that the European Parliament has gained most and that the Council has had to give most ground in the negociations that have taken place. The clearest proof of this is that the rules are binding, something which Parliament had demanded.</p>
<p class="contents">In certain respects the directive forms a framework whose contents are still unclear. This is especially true in the case of the phasing-out of dangerous substances. This is an issue upon which further work will be done in the daughter directives. Crucial to how the directive will operate is the question of how it will be implemented and monitored. All in all, the foundations have been laid for a coherent water policy and for long-term improvements in water quality. We shall therefore be happy to vote in favour of the proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Tomorrow's approval of this framework directive will represent a great step forward on the road to the cohesion and harmonisation of the legislation of the Member States with regard to the quantity and quality of their water. In this last stage of the long parliamentary process undergone by this directive, in particular during conciliation, the European Parliament has been able to present a united front in defending its arguments before the Council. The rapporteur's superb coordination and the will to reach an understanding shown by all the political groups have made this final text possible, and it has been improved in basic aspects such as the legally binding nature of the objectives without omitting to take account of the various problems in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also congratulate the Council on its flexibility in the face of the criticisms put forward by Parliament, and the Commission for its effective mediation. Tomorrow, a new and equally important stage in the directive’s development will begin, in which the European Parliament must continue to participate extremely actively in monitoring and controlling the fulfilment of objectives and deadlines and the drawing-up of reports or legislative acts derived from the directive. One of the weakest points to have become apparent during the drawing-up stage must be strengthened: the incontestable need for more and better means of technical advice for subjects which, like this, require highly specific knowledge, and in which the social and economic cost of a small calculation error can be great.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to emphasise what makes this directive a real tool for sustainable development: the balance achieved in the consideration of water as an extremely valuable economic resource and as an essential element in the conservation of European ecosystems. The development of this directive may provide an important meeting point in the much-reviled relationship between economy and ecology. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet the objectives are timid, vague and extremely long term. We cannot wait 30 years for the European Court of Justice to decide whether or not the environmental objectives are in fact legally binding. The Member States have been called upon to improve the quality of our water quickly in order to achieve the objectives in 15 years’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">Where groundwater protection is concerned, Parliament has unfortunately bowed to the interests of industrial agriculture and recognised its right to go on polluting the environment to the same degree. It is now also the responsibility of the Member States to ensure that existing standards are not undermined, the yardstick by which the success of the Water Framework Directive will be measured. Any more kow-towing to industrial agriculture would lead in the longer term to our most important drinking water resources being destroyed once and for all. We are pleased, however, that the Greens have achieved a great breakthrough when it comes to emissions of dangerous substances, which now have to be identified on the list of priority substances. In this area, we must make genuine efforts to meet the OSPAR objectives as well and to avoid what is an incalculably serious risk to health and the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This should be provided for by law. A simple, uniform and coordinated Community law on the protection of water and groundwater is to be welcomed. Important directives such as those on protecting the food we eat, on municipal sewage disposal, on plant protection and on nitrates are being revised and redefined on the basis both of ecological criteria and criteria of origin. The tasks are therefore broadly defined.</p>
<p class="contents">As a farmer, I advocate the closer involvement of those who represent the interests of professional groups and serious consideration of their criticisms. Farming, forestry, fisheries and, in particular, the horticultural industry should also be involved in the decision-making process so that the required combination of voluntary restraint and state regulation is achieved. The calls for zero limit values can hardly be met by means of legislation alone. Transposing the directive presents a genuine challenge for the Member States of the European Community. I agree with the rapporteur: it is only through cooperation that success can be achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament’s really quite significant victory consists in the fact that this directive is to be binding.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us remember, however, that until the very end a number of Member States vehemently resisted any requirement that they should manage their own water resources more carefully and in an environmentally more conscious way in future. However, it was splendid to see the way in which the Members of the European Parliament transcended all party differences and quite clearly agreed that there should be no common position without a legal requirement.</p>
<p class="contents">A further important victory for MEPs involved the protection of groundwater. Dangerous substances must completely have disappeared from groundwater within 20 years of the Directive’s publication. Will we achieve this objective? It now remains for whatever dangerous substances are meant here to be listed in an annex to the Directive, and it is already clear to me that there will certainly be further heated discussions on this matter. I believe, however, that the great objective of protecting Europe’s groundwater for future generations is not in dispute. The process of re-thinking has taken place: a considerable victory for the political process and a considerable victory on behalf of our children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">- second, we must ensure that the proposals of the directive are implemented and encourage them, not only at European Union level, but also in the aid that we give to third countries in the form of "water" projects, the impact of which lies in a hydrographic ecosystem affecting the countries of the European Union, but also those that are part of the MEDA agreements, for example, which must be taken account of in the MAP projects and even in others, like the Upper Nile basin or Switzerland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is a positive development that water management requirements are to be integrated into a single system – hydrological basin management, which is based more on geographical and hydrological areas than on administrative and national borders. This is a particularly important issue for Portugal, whose main rivers are shared with our neighbour, Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally positive is the statement that water is not a commodity that should be bought and sold like any other. This means, of course, that special measures must be put in place to protect a commodity that is publicly owned, whilst safeguarding the interests of the population, in particular, domestic water supply and agricultural activity, especially small farms and family-based holdings. The final text does state that Member States can attend to the social and economic effects on the affected area as well as the geographic and climatic conditions. This will enable Member States to deal with their different situations by means of established exceptions, which may nevertheless prove to be insufficient to cope with agricultural situations in the South, particularly where Portugal is concerned. We shall nevertheless pay close attention to the way this policy is implemented in practice in the years to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We will not have the entire picture until the relevant daughter directives are in place over the next few years.</p>
<p class="contents">Water pricing policies by the year 2010 will have to provide adequate incentives for users to use water resources efficiently. The new paragraph 4 of Article 9 will allow for the continuation of the established practice in Ireland of not applying water charges to the domestic water sector. You can only govern with the consent of the people and by 2010 domestic water charges could well be acceptable to the Irish electorate. At the moment, it is a hugely politically-charged issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank my colleagues for their understanding, particularly Mrs Schleicher, who represented our case with understanding through all stages, especially at conciliation. The principle of subsidiarity in relation to water pricing policy is jealously guarded in Ireland, but public opinion will probably change by 2010. If we do not apply household or domestic water charges by then we will have to explain our action to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">There is growing appreciation in Ireland that clean drinking water is a scarce resource and that all services, particularly the cost of distributing clean water to all households, have to be paid for. At the moment the central exchequer or the taxpayer, is paying for this, yet many do not benefit. Many have to pay to sink their own pump in Ireland and pay the electricity charges. Many are on group water schemes which are not part of the public water supply and have to pay dearly each year for the privilege of rather questionable quality water being distributed to their houses. So we are talking about a question of equity and changing public opinion and we appreciate the matter being left to the Irish Government to decide and to influence public opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are coming to the end of a long road on which there has been a long battle, long discussions, but in the end, some positive agreements and constructive positions on the part of the three institutions, the Council, Parliament and the Commission, which have made this agreement possible. As with any agreement, some will think it too little, others too much, but there is a middle point, a balance that is acceptable for the diverging points of view of those who have worked all this time.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, they have carried out serious work on a highly complex subject. On behalf of my colleague, Mrs Wallström, I would like thank Mrs Lienemann for her kind words. As rapporteur for all this work, she has played a leading part and carried out a colossal task, with the persistence and tenacity of her principles which, combined with a dose of realism, have enabled this agreement to be reached.</p>
<p class="contents">As she herself points out, and this is no minor issue, a subject such as water demonstrates the diversity of Europe, with its radically differing characteristics between countries. In some countries, vast expanses have under 400 millimetres per year, that is, semi-arid zones, while in others the average far exceeds 2 500 or 3 000 millimetres. The focal point of this directive, in which water is considered as a whole, a total flow, with no distinction between surface and groundwater, which is the mistake that was made for a long time, is the right focal point and implies a step forward. The effort to keep our aquifers in the European Union as clean as possible, or as unpolluted as possible, is a key effort if we want to guarantee balanced development, sustainable development and a habitable Europe for future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">On this subject, I have to say that a moment ago one of the Members referred to conversations between two European leaders. Yes, some may still pollute their aquifers, but some have been polluting them for some time, for example with huge pig farms. I do not want to go into detail, but people in glass houses should not throw stones.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to point out that monitoring and follow-up are essential to this directive. Monitoring and follow-up that, subsequent to the flexibility and realistic approach that abound in all the articles of the directive, will undoubtedly allow us to guarantee the cleanliness of our water. This is absolutely essential as, in short, there is no life without clean water. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would ask for this to be re-examined, for the terminology in each country is quite distinct. It is a problem which the translators could not solve because the text is so specialised.
