It is a great pleasure for me to appear in this House to inform you of two issues which are related for obvious reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, the Fifth Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference which took place in Valencia yesterday and the day before yesterday, and on the other, the current situation in the Middle East, the latest events and the efforts being made to put the peace process back on track.</p>
<p class="contents">If you will allow me, I will begin by describing the contribution I believe this ministerial meeting has made and then end with some comments on the situation in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">I would firstly like to say that we all had doubts about whether or not this Euro-Mediterranean ministerial meeting would be able to take place, for obvious reasons: the situation in the Middle East presented enormous uncertainties and serious risks and, at certain moments, many people doubted whether this meeting could even take place. I therefore believe that the fact that we have been able to hold it is a success in itself.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as holding the meeting, the fact that we have been able to achieve conclusions which enjoyed the consensus of all the parties present was also a success. You know that the delegations from Syria and Lebanon finally decided not to attend in order not to come into contact with the Israeli delegation, but the other countries of the Mediterranean did attend and the twenty-five of us reached a consensus on approving an action plan, a programme in such sensitive areas as justice and internal affairs as well as a programme to guide dialogue between cultures and civilisations. I believe that this – which has been the subject of much work both prior to and during the conference – is also a notable success in itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress that practically all the Member States of the Barcelona Process attended at ministerial level and there was therefore an extremely high level of attendance and decision-making capacity, for which I am grateful to the countries of the South and the East of the Mediterranean as well as all my colleagues in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said, there has been solid previous work. If this had not been the case, given the enormous difficulties and tensions in the Middle East, we would not have been able to hold this conference and nor would it have borne fruit. I am referring to documents such as the establishment of priorities by the Presidency, the Commission’s communication, the action lines, the guidelines of the recent General Affairs Council and all the documents and contributions of the countries of the South and the East of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, also like, in particular, to refer to the report by the European Parliament, which furthermore was produced by a Spanish Member, Mr Esteve. It is a wonderful report which I value very highly. We have accepted many of its proposals; we are going to try our best to incorporate more of them, since we believe they are all worthy of consideration. I would therefore like to say that everything we have achieved and approved in Valencia – I insist, by consensus – is not only the result of this desire for agreement, but also of everybody’s contributions. It is the first time – I will talk about this later – that, following the Barcelona Declaration of 1995, documents of this nature have been approved by everybody, and not only as mere Presidency declarations of conclusions following a series of debates.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I would also like to stress – and I will return to this later – that we have approved the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly. I believe that this is a great step forward: it is an idea of the European Parliament which we have accepted and which we believe to be enormously important.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, in the international situation resulting from 11 September and for a European Union on the point of the greatest enlargement in its history, which will practically double its current number of Members, I believe there is no doubt that the Mediterranean is becoming our strategic border, a region where we have to build an area of shared peace, stability, development and prosperity, an area in which the dialogue and cooperation between cultures and civilisations which the Barcelona Declaration calls for is possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Like all processes, the Barcelona Process is being built step by step. If we look back, we have travelled a long way since Barcelona, and proof of this lies in the fact that we have signed eleven of the twelve association agreements we intended to reach with the countries of the South. In Valencia we signed the agreement with Algeria. The agreement with Lebanon has been reached and it only remains for it to be signed. All the rest have been signed and many are in force.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite all of this, however, this progress, though important, is not sufficient. The Barcelona Process, the very approach and existence of which is of irreplaceable value, requires new political impetus, a kind of navigation chart which is able to take the Barcelona objectives from paper to reality. The Valencia action plan, the joint justice and internal affairs programme and the programme on dialogue between cultures and civilisations respond to this challenge, to this ambition to give the Barcelona Process new political impetus, which we all thought was languishing. I must insist that we have approved all of this by consensus at the Fifth Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">This means not only maintaining the process’s potential for transformation, but also providing innovations both in terms of form and basis. I have already spoken of the form: it is the first political document adopted jointly by the partners in the process at a ministerial conference. This endows the action plan and the other documents I have mentioned with the status of Euro-Mediterranean contracts, of shared projects and commitments. I would like to reiterate this message: the Barcelona Process, the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue is not something that is addressed by the Fifteen to the Twelve, but rather it belongs to the Twenty-seven, and we want it to increasingly become something experienced and accepted by the Twenty-seven. The basis of the documents has also had the potential for transformation, because they conform to a series of principles which we believe must inspire the transformation of the process and propose a series of important initiatives which, as a whole, have the potential to produce a qualitative improvement in the construction of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">What are these principles? I just referred to one of them: the principle of co-ownership. Also the principle of visibility: that the process is perceived as such by the governments but also by the respective civil societies. The principle of capillarity: that it be communicated to all the players present. And also other principles, such as that of structuring, that of credibility, that of efficiency or that of the realisation of the process. The realisation of the process requires initiatives. Obviously, to explain it completely would require a reading of the action plan, which is very exhaustive, but, while each and every one of these initiatives is very important, I would like to summarise by highlighting those which seem to me at the moment to be of the greatest political significance in the three chapters of the process: in the political and institutional chapter, in the economic and financial chapter and in the social, cultural and human chapter.</p>
<p class="contents">In the political and institutional chapter, I would like to highlight the greater democratisation of the process, by means of the proposal to create a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, which we must try to implement as soon as possible. Also by means of the implementation of new mechanisms for political dialogue and cooperation between the Twenty-seven, including issues such as security and defence policy, which I believe is very important, or terrorism – which I will refer to in a moment – or the promotion of human rights. Measures are also adopted for the creation of trust and partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said, terrorism is included for the first time on the Barcelona agenda, which I feel is absolutely essential at the moment for obvious reasons. And it is also envisaged that the plan will for the first time be subject – being a specific action plan approved by everybody – to monitoring and an assessment of compliance at the next Sixth Ministerial Conference in Barcelona, which I believe will make it more credible.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the economic and financial chapter, the Valencia action plan confirms the objective of creating a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area by 2010. To this end, we must conclude every one of the association agreements that I have already mentioned and also complete the South-South integration. It is extremely important that progress be made towards free trade areas in the South and we have therefore welcomed and given all our support – not only political but also technical, thanks to the Commission – to the Agadir Process initiated by Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan. We all know that, in order for the Euro-Mediterranean process to be a success, it is necessary to guarantee the economic and, therefore, social and political development of the countries of the South. This requires, amongst other things, but very importantly all the same, the appropriate channelling of investment flows, and therefore the plan takes up one of the main priorities of the Presidency, that is, to promote the creation of a new financial instrument, which begins to function as a strengthened facility within the European Investment Bank, in order to support infrastructure works and in order to fundamentally support the private sector. Then we have laid down that, within one year, if possible, the decision will be taken to convert this improved facility into a Bank, a subsidiary of the European Investment Bank, with capital potentially open to other countries or even institutions and which, in any event, will allow greater financial resources to be directed towards the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The plan also takes up the conclusions and decisions adopted at the Euro-Mediterranean trade and industry ministerial meetings in Toledo and Malaga respectively. In the commercial field it includes a series of measures to facilitate investments and implement the liberalisation of services. In the industrial field it includes provisions to promote legislative harmonisation in order to facilitate the integration of our partners, promote innovation and access to new technologies and increase the role of the private sector in the construction of the Euro-Mediterranean association.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to make a particular reference in this chapter to the measures intended to stimulate investment in infrastructures and the interconnection of the transport, telecommunications and energy networks of our Mediterranean partners with the trans-European networks, and, in this regard, I would like to thank the Commission once again for the enormous and very positive work it has done. In this field I would also like to stress the European Union’s will to facilitate the incorporation of the Mediterranean partners into the Galileo satellite navigation network.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the social, cultural and human chapter, the Presidency has tried to respond to the challenges posed by such important issues as immigration, dialogue between cultures and civilisations or the participation by the different players from civil society in Euro-Mediterranean construction, incorporating a series of measures into the action plan of which I would like to highlight the following: firstly, the adoption of a framework document, which I mentioned earlier, on justice and internal affairs, which deals, for example, with such important issues as the fight against drugs, the fight against organised crime, the fight against terrorism, treatment of migratory flows and the movement of persons, etc. This has also led us to adopt the decision in Valencia to convene a Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference on migration.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision has also been taken to create a foundation for dialogue between cultures and civilisations and to promote cultural, intellectual and social exchanges. It is a project shared by everybody and it must therefore be a response to the challenges in this field, a concrete response, also the adoption of an action plan, which can be channelled by means of the foundation or by some other method, so that the dialogue between cultures and civilisations focuses on three areas which we believe to be fundamental: youth, education and the media.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also decided to extend the Tempus programme to the Mediterranean partners, which would allow for the development of cooperation between universities on the two sides of the Mediterranean and, very importantly, the incorporation into the university world of the two sides of the Mediterranean as players in the creation of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership. There is also a call to develop decentralised cooperation between Mediterranean cities and regions and the adoption of conclusions which stem from those of the civil forum which took place in Valencia prior to the Ministerial Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, we are facing a new stage; if you like, a new phase in the Barcelona Process. We are facing a relaunch of the Barcelona Process despite the difficulties resulting from the Middle East conflict, which I believe demonstrates something essential: the Barcelona Process’s enormous capacity for resistance. The Barcelona Process has demonstrated that it is able to resist the Middle East conflict, and this brings me to a new conclusion: Barcelona was a wonderful idea in 1995, the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue was and still is a wonderful idea and, if we had not adopted it at that time, we would have had to adopt it now.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, Mr President, over these two days, with the presence of Arab countries, amongst them all those directly involved in the Middle East conflict, and Israel and the European Union, it was absolutely essential that we dedicated a good proportion of the sittings to the debate on the situation in the Middle East. Valencia has helped us to evaluate and debate this situation, and it has taken place – despite the enormous current tensions and emotions – within the framework of a debate which at times was genuinely constructive, which has demonstrated the parties’ desire for peace and I believe it can be of use to the whole process.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware of the situation on the ground. We are witnessing an unprecedented level of violence, with a horrendous number of victims. Despite the calm of recent hours and days, the events of recent weeks have been truly horrific. There have been terrible terrorist attacks, which we would like to condemn once again, without reservation or hesitation. There has been – and there still is – the Israeli occupation of cities controlled by the Palestinian Authority, and in this regard I would like to repeat our demand for an immediate withdrawal of Israeli troops. We all know that there can be no military solution to the conflict and that the only route is negotiation within the framework of a political perspective and that therefore a ceasefire is also urgently required.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the events of recent days, I believe that we are all very aware that there is a serious risk of the destruction and dismantling of the Palestinian National Authority, of its short- and medium-term capacity to be the seed for a future Palestinian State, and I would therefore call once again for an immediate end to the confinement of President Arafat. I would also like to say on behalf of the international community that we welcome the condemnation by the Palestinian leadership and by President Arafat himself of the terrorist acts. I would also like to express my serious concern about the humanitarian crisis. It is absolutely essential that medical and assistance organisations can carry out their tasks. A very important meeting is taking place today in Oslo which must specify what we must do to deal with the most urgent and immediate needs from a humanitarian point of view, and also what we can do for the reconstruction – not just physical, but also institutional – of the territories and of the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the coming days, when it appears that the withdrawal has begun – with all the issues this involves – we will clearly see the consequences of the military attacks. Jenin is undoubtedly a dramatic example. It is essential to know what has happened and its true extent, that the United Nations has the necessary support – of course I believe they can count on the full support of the European Union – to carry out an impartial international investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention that, given the events, there is a very serious risk of regional destabilisation. There is serious concern about the violence on the southern border of Lebanon. We have made direct representations – the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, the troika<span class="italic"> –</span> to the Lebanese authorities and the other countries so that they may make every possible effort to prevent attacks on Israel from their territory. I must point out that they share that concern and I am aware that they are taking measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention another very important point: it is very regrettable that the consular representations of our countries cannot carry out their duties owing to the constant obstacles presented by the Israeli army in the occupied territories. Certain new possibilities are beginning to emerge, certain controls are being relaxed, but the situation is still unsustainable and completely unacceptable. Our consular representatives must have complete freedom to access the territories, to attend to their respective nationals and to observe the humanitarian situation in those territories.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We have made representations both in Tel Aviv, as the troika,<span class="italic"> </span>and, as Presidency, to the Israeli Ambassador in Spain. Furthermore, the consuls in Jerusalem have held many contacts with the Israeli army authorities and, for the moment, some progress is being made, although I believe that it is clearly insufficient. We must send a very strong and clear message in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to refer very briefly to the efforts we have made over recent weeks. The European Union is always firmly committed to helping to resolve the problem in the region. At the Barcelona European Council we insisted on dealing with both the security and the political and economic aspects, as inseparable and interdependent elements of the same process. We cannot attach more importance to some than to others. They must run in parallel. And the foundations for a solution to the conflict were repeated in Barcelona: the resolutions of the Security Council, essentially Resolutions Nos 242, 338 and 1397; the principles of the Madrid Conference, and in particular the principle of land for peace; the principles of the Oslo Agreements and all subsequent agreements, which would allow the two States, Israel and Palestine, to live in peace and security.</p>
<p class="contents">We have therefore firmly supported the peace initiatives such as the Saudi plan, which was supported by the Summit of the Arab League in Beirut and which presented the possibility of normalising relations between Israel and its Arab neighbours in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 borders and a fair solution to the problem of refugees on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions. I believe that that support was demonstrated by the presence of the Spanish Prime Minister, in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council, and the High Representative at the inauguration of the Beirut Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">We also held an extraordinary General Affairs Council as a result of the seriousness of the crisis. We wanted to send a clear message of concern, but also of involvement by the European Union given the events. We decided to send the Presidency and the High Representative to the region to talk to the parties at the highest level in order to demand an immediate ceasefire, the application of United Nations Resolutions Nos 1397 and 1402 and a return to negotiations on a political agreement. I believe that we had to do so and we did, highlighting through action the essential need for an involvement on the ground by the international community. As is well known, that mission met with many difficulties, and it was impossible for us to visit President Arafat given the opposition of the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr Sharon. I must say that that attitude has changed. At this moment – and this is why Mr Solana is not here today – both Mr Solana and Mr Moratinos are visiting the region – and I did not go precisely so that I could be here – and they intend to visit President Arafat and if possible the other leaders in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to this will on the part of the international community to be involved, I would like to mention another event to which I attach great importance: the meeting in Madrid of the so-called Quartet, that is, the United States, the Russian Federation, the United Nations and the European Union at the highest diplomatic level: Secretary of State Powell, the Foreign Minister, Mr Ivanov, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Annan, and Mr Solana and myself, on behalf of the European Union. I believe this reflects something that we in the European Union have always advocated: the international community’s involvement must be based on the greatest possible degree of unity in its actions and positions, because we are all aware that there can be no solution without the United States, but that neither can there be a solution with the United States alone. And to maintain the unity of the whole international community on the basis of common positions seems to me extremely important. As you know, we issued a public declaration establishing a common position on the conflict and supporting Secretary of State Powell’s mission to the region. It also stated the desire for the Quartet to continue to monitor the situation in the Middle East by means of regular consultations at the highest level and for the special envoys to continue with their efforts on the ground. They are doing so and they are doing it very well. In this regard I would like to mention the representative of the Russian Federation, Mr Vdovin, the representative of the European Union, Mr Moratinos, the current representative of the United States, Mr Zinni, and – I would like to say this very clearly here today – the special representative of the United Nations, Mr Larsen, who are doing fantastic work. With regard to the continuation of meetings of the Quartet at the highest level, I believe we will be able to convene one in the coming days to review the situation once again and to continue with the progress on political initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">In that Madrid Declaration we expressly asked for immediate compliance with Resolution No 1402, as demanded by Resolution 1403, and therefore an immediate ceasefire, an immediate withdrawal from Palestinian cities, including Bethlehem and Ramallah and in particular the general headquarters of President Arafat. In this Declaration, Israel was urged to cease the military operations, to comply with international humanitarian principles, to allow full and unhindered access for humanitarian organisations and services, to refrain from the excessive use of force and to make every possible effort to guarantee the protection of civilians.</p>
<p class="contents">This declaration also urges President Arafat, however, as the recognised and elected leader of the Palestinians, to immediately make the greatest possible effort to stop the terrorist attacks against innocent Israelis, to use all the weight of his political authority to convince the Palestinian people that attacks against Israelis must end completely and immediately, to authorise his representatives to renew, immediately, the security coordination with Israel and he is also urged to act decisively and to take every measure he can to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure, including its funding, and to stop the incitement to violence or the justification of certain types of attack. This declaration does not say this, but I want to say it: the suicide bombers are terrorists, they are not martyrs, and this must be repeated constantly. Returning to the declaration, terrorism is immoral and illegal, it has seriously damaged the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians and it must be condemned, as Security Council Resolution 1373 clearly states.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we express our joint will to help the parties to apply their agreements, such as the Tenet Security Plan and the Mitchell recommendations, including the mediation of an impartial mechanism, as agreed by the parties.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the Union, various scenarios have been discussed in view of the current situation. We have lent all our political weight to diplomatic efforts, which range from Presidency declarations and contacts with all the parties involved, to supporting General Zinni’s mission a few weeks ago and of course supporting the mission to the region by the American Secretary of State, Mr Powell, and also our visits on the ground, such as the one that is taking place today.</p>
<p class="contents">The possibility has also been raised of implementing measures to put pressure on Israel, such as suspending the Association Agreement, and I am perfectly aware of the position expressed by this Parliament. Last week, at the last General Affairs Council, it was considered appropriate to await the results of the mission by Secretary of State Powell, which I will mention in a moment, and at the moment what I can say is that all options remain open.</p>
<p class="contents">The tour by Secretary of State Powell has yielded more positive and useful results than would appear at first sight, and I believe this will become evident over the coming days. A new perspective has been opened up by establishing a timetable for withdrawal, but it is clear that there are unacceptable exceptions. One is the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem and another is the general headquarters of President Arafat. On the first issue, a solution is still being sought. There is close contact between all the parties involved and, in particular, with the Vatican, which I hope will bear fruit. And on the second issue, we are continuing with all our efforts, and the visit by Mr Solana and Mr Moratinos today to a large extent has the objective of finding a solution which will lead to an end to the siege, which would allow for a ceasefire. We are all also awaiting the coming visit of the Director of the CIA, Mr Tenet, accompanied by General Zinni, which may also be extremely useful on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">If we manage to resolve these problems – and we are applying all our efforts to this – and achieve the withdrawal of troops, an effective ceasefire and, therefore, an end to terrorist activities, we can begin to create the conditions for progressing towards a peace conference. A peace conference cannot start from nothing. It must be a closing peace conference which takes account of everything that has been achieved until now, which does not once again reopen everything that was agreed in Madrid or in Oslo or what has been agreed over recent years. It cannot reopen the issue of international legality which is clearly defined by the Security Council Resolutions. It must be something which really leads to a definitive peace and which must therefore be as effective as possible. I believe that this effectiveness is only possible if it has the full support and participation of all the important players in the international community and, without doubt, the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that a meeting of the Quartet will take place very soon, in which we can analyse all these elements and continue to contribute new ideas and new efforts so that, in the end, Palestinians, Israelis, the Arab world in general, can offer themselves and future generations the prospect of peace, co-existence, stability and prosperity which for very many years has been denied them.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, some may find it unrealistic to speak about the Barcelona Process when the Middle East is in flames – and that view is not entirely unfounded. Yet as Minister Piqué said, it confirms, at once the need for the Barcelona enterprise, and its resilience. The fact that we were able to hold the meeting in Valencia in the present circumstances has been a tribute not only to the vision that took shape in Barcelona in 1995, but also to the remarkable work of the Spanish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us focus just for a moment on the achievements of Valencia: firstly, agreement on an excellent action plan to show the way forward for the coming months; secondly, the signing of the Association Agreement with Algeria bringing us very close to the completion of the grid of Agreements – we have now negotiated 11 out of 12. I hope Syria will be ready to return to real negotiations soon, and that the EU Member States will speed up the ratification of the Agreements that have been signed so far. Frankly it is slightly embarrassing when we express to our colleagues in the south of the Mediterranean, our enthusiasm for completing negotiation on these agreements and then it takes months or years to ratify them. I hope that we can have a little more parliamentary dynamism on behalf of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Much remains to be done. The prosperity gap between the north and south of the Mediterranean is not diminishing. 40 million new jobs need to be created in the coming decade just to keep employment levels where they are now. Economic reforms will help achieve the growth and investment needed for this purpose, and the gradual creation of a true EuroMed internal market will create many new opportunities. This is what the economic pillar of the Barcelona Process is all about. There is also a broader point. Failure to close the gap in living standards, failure to increase growth and to alleviate poverty to the south of the Mediterranean is bound to nurture extremism there. It will also nurture extremism in Europe: the sort of extremism of which we have only recently witnessed such a grubby and shameful manifestation.</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">To achieve these goals, we need to deepen the South-South relationship. There was good news at Valencia from the four countries involved in the Agadir Process that an agreement between them should be signed very soon. We also need to overcome non-tariff obstacles to trade and integration. The Valencia meeting endorsed decisions taken by Trade Ministers at Toledo on extending the pan-European origin system to the Mediterranean partners, on setting up a Working Group on regional integration, and on liberalising trade in services.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agreed to step up our financial cooperation. Some progress has already been made but I am anxious to make a good deal more. The ratio of payments to commitments in the MEDA programme improved from 26% for the 1995-1999 period, to 37.6 % in 2000 and to 53.1% in 2001. So, we have reached about twice the figure we had in the second half of the 1990's but we have to do better still. Last December we adopted new country and regional strategy programmes for the years 2002 to 2004 which provide a more focused and stable framework for our financial cooperation. In this context I also welcome the agreement to create a reinforced EIB lending facility for the region and congratulate the Council Presidency on the great leadership they have shown in that area, which should enable us to get more help to the private sector in the countries to the south of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">On the third chapter of Barcelona, we reached agreement on a programme of cooperation on justice, on the fight against drugs, on organised crime and terrorism, and on co-operation on issues relating to migration. That was a significant success because these are all difficult and sensitive issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in Valencia, we discussed the dialogue of cultures and civilisations. As you know the Commission has taken a number of initiatives in this area, including a proposal to create a Euro-Med Foundation. Unfortunately we met some reluctance among the Member States to make the EUR 1 million contributions we requested from each of them. I have heard huge enthusiasm from all quarters for deepening the dialogue between cultures, but apparently, for some people, EUR 1 million is too high a price to pay at the moment. There is agreement in principle on this issue, which I welcome, but the Member States must make this modest financial commitment if the Foundation is to get off the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to turn now to the situation in the Middle East, which overshadowed our meeting in Valencia. European public opinion has been profoundly shocked by the unfolding tragedy. I have utterly condemned suicide bombings and terrorist acts, and I do it here again without any qualification whatsoever. Encouraging children or young people to strap dynamite to themselves and to set out to kill others while killing themselves is deeply wicked. And failure to discourage this is quite simply inexcusable.</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">I have also been deeply disturbed, however, by the reports coming out of the West Bank of the behaviour of the Israeli Defence Forces. There are reports, which must be thoroughly investigated, that they have sometimes shown – I am picking my words extremely diplomatically – a disregard for civilian life, and they have certainly disregarded UN and International Committee of the Red Cross appeals to be allowed to carry out their humanitarian duties. Israel, as a democratic country, as a pluralist society which believes in the rule of law, should meet international standards of behaviour without equivocation and without 'ifs' or 'buts'. That is what it means to be a democratic society; that is what the rule of law means.</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">I want to make four points:</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, Full Withdrawal: We regret that the Powell mission did not yield immediate results in terms either of a ceasefire or of an immediate withdrawal. I recognise, however, the huge commitment that Secretary Powell put into the mission and that the mission was perhaps rather more successful than some critics have suggested. I continue to be concerned about reactions in the Arab world in the face of this stalled situation. I repeat my strong support for the UN-led fact-finding mission to Jenin. It would not be in Israel's interest to leave unanswered the allegations which have been made. We want to see the mission make effective and rapid progress and we call for active cooperation from all the parties involved.</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">Everybody who knows Mr Ahtisari and the other members of the mission, will know of their total integrity and I hope that there will not be any doubts cast on that, as doubts have been cast on the role performed by Mr Larsen who is a great international public servant.</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Full Access: With regard to the humanitarian situation there must be full and unhindered access to the affected areas, particularly refugee camps, to provide urgently-needed relief ... </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter and loud applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">When in Europe we occasionally give other people lectures about human rights and civil liberties, we should sometimes bear that in mind.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I want to repeat that I am choosing these words with considerable care. Our commitment to consolidate the Palestinian Authority and to reconstruction, will need to be integrated within a wider political process including sufficient guarantees from both parties in the conflict that our efforts will not be wasted or destroyed.<span class="bold"> </span>You cannot rebuild the Palestinian Authority in a political vacuum.</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Peres told us yesterday that he supported a flourishing and modern Palestinian Authority. Some may think that Israel has found a strange way to express that support in recent weeks. But I hope that Mr Peres speaks for the Israeli Government, and that we will see his expressed view reflected in Israel’s attitude towards the aspiration to create a Palestinian State, and Israel’s actions in the Palestinian territories.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if it is still too early to assess the full extent of damage that has been inflicted, it is clear that there is also going to be a need for major reconstruction and rehabilitation work. The assessment of the need, which has only just begun, is urgent. It is already clear, however, that even short term needs will run into hundreds of millions of dollars. I expect that tomorrow's meeting of the international donor community in Oslo, the so-called Ad Hoc Liaison Committee, will help us to quantify the damages and begin to prepare a co-ordinated response by donors. I would just like to repeat what I have said already. To those who talk about Marshall aid for the Middle East, Marshall aid for the Palestinian territories, I say 'fine'. The important point about Marshall aid, however, was that it began when the bombing had stopped.</p>
<p class="contents">In my last point I would like to refer to full rehabilitation of Palestinian structures: There is also the need to fill the administrative and security vacuum in the wake of the Israeli withdrawal. The alternative is chaos and anarchy, which is not in anyone’s interest.</p>
<p class="contents">I must repeat my grave concern about the destruction of the basic structures of the Palestinian Authority and military operations against Arafat. This weakens the powers of Palestinian Authority to enforce the rule of law, to rein in terrorists and to avert suicide bombings. It plays into the hands of, and increases support among the Palestinian population for extremist groups such as Hamas. The fight against terrorism cannot be used as a justification for the destruction of basic infrastructure of the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I am also very concerned at the breakdown of general law and order. We have seen horrible events such as lynchings in the last few days. This must stop. It is only likely to stop, however, when Palestinians regain control in their areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Israeli military actions have not just targeted the security apparatus of the Palestinian Authority, they have systematically inflicted damage on civil infrastructure which has no security role whatsoever. What is the security objective of destroying the Ministries of Education, Finance, Agriculture, the Land Registry?</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">Why destroy the Central Statistics Bureau, or the Palestinian Legislative Council? This must be of great concern to the members of this House<span class="bold">. </span>Palestinians will have to rebuild large parts of their administration without which daily life cannot function in an orderly fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is committed to supporting and rebuilding these structures. But our resources are already stretched to the limits. Once the needs assessment is done, we will come back to Parliament to inform you of the financial implications and to ask for your help in providing an appropriate response from the European Union. But, I repeat, you will have to ask us at that moment what the political context is in which we are seeking to rebuild what has been torn down.</p>
<p class="contents">I have lost count of the number of debates that I have taken part in on the Middle East over the last two and a half years. It is fair to say that in each debate the news has been grimmer then in the preceding debate. I just pray that one day I take part in a debate when things are getting better.</p>

For if we stop talking to each other, it is only the weapons that will be left to speak. That this debate on the Mediterranean dialogue should be held here today, is important, and I would like to express from the heart my gratitude to the Spanish Presidency of the Council for the commitment they have shown.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the shocking events in the Middle East, the Mediterranean dialogue has probably never been as necessary as it is today, for we face today the great danger of a real clash of civilisations breaking out. It will do that once our own heads become the places where we wall the cultures off from one another. That is why our task, in these days and in the future, must be to carry on this dialogue between cultures. That must be right at the top of our agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">What now shocks me is to hear, on the one hand, that it is proposed to establish a foundation for dialogue between cultures, which we welcome, but on the other that the million euro – obviously not a very substantial amount – may well not be made available. If we sign documents that then lose their value, then when we leave the conference, the conferences will have no value either! So I ask the Spanish Presidency and the Commission to ensure that the money required will also be made available, so that we can bring this dialogue about.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In these weeks and months, looking forward to the enlargement of the European Union, our gaze is directed principally towards the East, but it is important that we turn our eyes southwards, as the perils there are probably far greater than our problems in Eastern Europe. If it is the case that the distance from Algeria's capital Algiers to Paris is shorter than that from Paris to Warsaw, then this must make it clear to us in geographical terms that the Mediterranean, North Africa, and the Middle East are of great significance to Europeans like us.</p>
<p class="contents">We advocate a real partnership for us with the Mediterranean, with the countries of North Africa, and with the Middle East – both political and strategic, economic and financial, social and cultural. Of course it is important to combat terrorism, and that is a struggle we all support. We must not, though, reduce our dialogue with the Arab and Islamic world to simply fighting terrorism; it must, rather, be a dialogue that includes all the political, economic, financial and cultural issues. That is why we have so much more to do in those areas than we have done in the past.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Of course it is important that we should have a Euro-Mediterranean parliamentary assembly. That is what we have called for. We would, though, be failing in our responsibility as Europeans and as a Parliament if we believed that the creation of such an institution would mean that all our tasks had been completed. On the contrary, what matters is that we make a reality of our solemn declarations. After visiting Israel a number of times, I visited many states in the Arab world, and I have the impression that these countries will be able to live in security, freedom and democracy only if we really do manage to create jobs there. As the Commissioner said, 40 million jobs are needed around the Mediterranean. If they are not created, then the young people will carry on getting into boats, and – as is estimated – 7 000 people from Morocco alone will lose their lives in the attempt to reach Spain or Portugal across the Mediterranean. That is why development in these countries must be a success. Above all, we must help with the privatisation of their economy and help give private enterprises a chance to use that to create jobs. As education is one of the most important prerequisites for human development, and above all for the actualisation of human rights, illiteracy in the states of North Africa must be done away with.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the Middle East, the seriousness and complexity of this area of concern has meant that these issues have been the subject of in-depth discussions in our group as well, but we start by saying that the policy of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth must come to an end. If things carry on like that, there will never be peace in the Middle East. That is why it is so important that the Israeli troops should withdraw now. At the same time, though, we declare it to be criminal to talk young people into strapping self-detonating devices to themselves in order to kill both themselves and others as well. That is why we must make demands equally of both sides, of the Israelis as much as of the Palestinians.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also not lose sight of the fact that our American friends cannot be peacemakers on their own. The Americans will of course have to make a major contribution, but, for various reasons, the Palestinians trust us Europeans more than they do our American friends. This, then, is another reason – Israel is of course one, but this is another – why we have to take on important responsibilities in the region. Israel does, thank God, also have some very credible representatives. Yesterday in the Conference of Presidents, we had talks with Avraham Burg, the Speaker of the Knesset, and I have to tell you that this conversation gave me renewed hope, because Israel also has political figures who put reconciliation first rather than conflict and military action.</p>
<p class="contents">We urge the parties involved – the Palestinians, the Israelis, the world community – onward to redouble their efforts so that peace may at last reign in the Middle East, so that we Europeans may also have a good future with the countries around the Mediterranean, and so that Israel and Palestine may be able to live within secure borders. That alone will serve the cause of human rights in the Middle East.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE). – </span></span>  <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, at a time like this we Europeans who are working together here must remind ourselves of the fundamental elements that unite us, and we must remember that we are working for a united, democratic Europe which combats racism and xenophobia. Let us remember what President Mitterrand said in his last speech in this House: ‘<span class="italic">Le nacionalisme c'est la guerre</span>’. This is an essential principle of our co-existence which we must state loud and clear today.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, Mr President, I believe – and I address this to my respected friend, Shimon Peres, who said yesterday in Madrid that he was worried about the growth in anti-Semitism in Europe – that we also all have to be concerned about the demonstrations of intolerance we are seeing on our continent. All we European democrats, all we European citizens must combat this blight, this cancer which has caused so much misery throughout our history.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, Mr President, I would like to thank you for giving us the opportunity to speak with Mr Burg, President of the Knesset, today. We have held a frank and tough debate in our group with our Labour colleague, Mr Burg, and we hope that President Abu Alá can come here to speak to us very soon. Here we have to build bridges towards peace in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the report by the President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to say that, with regard to the Euromed Conference, you know that we share your objectives. You have said that it was a wonderful idea, but you failed to mention that the idea was not an orphan, but that the last Spanish Presidency started it. Perhaps you could convey a compliment to Mr Solana, who is not here, and thus treat him as you would like him to treat his successor.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, what the President-in-Office of the Council has said today contains one essential idea: a network of association agreements is being created little by little, the agreement with Algeria has just been signed, and that is very positive. The problem is – and I also address this to the President-in-Office of the Council – that no notice has been taken of what Parliament said in its last resolution, because we are everybody’s friend and we want to be partners and associates of all the countries of the Mediterranean. That is the fundamental principle and when we have two associates who are in conflict with each other, the least we can say to one associate is: ‘Do not keep them in such a stranglehold and let them breathe a bit’. It is an absolutely fundamental principle. That is why we are asking for the Association Council to be convened. The Secretary of State, Mr de Miguel, stated very enthusiastically in this House that the Spanish Presidency maintained this principle. I would like to know if he still maintains this principle.</p>
<p class="contents">We also said other things: we are in favour of an intervention force, we are in favour of blocking arms exports. These are ideas which I believe the Council should develop, because it makes no sense to come to Parliament to complain that our diplomats are being treated badly and then say that all options are open. We must be a bit more decisive.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the pertinent observations of the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Patten, when he states clearly that in Jenin there is a human and historic responsibility to shed light on what has happened, and that Mr Ahtisaari is a completely honourable person like the other Members and we cannot allow vetoes, not because they are European, but because we are all subject to the principles and under the aegis of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also willing to work on the reconstruction of the Palestinian infrastructure, but we do not understand why it has been destroyed. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that it will not be destroyed again. Our partners must give us guarantees. We believe that it is absolutely essential to obey and respect the authority of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude, Mr President, by saying that we are clearly in favour of the Quartet plus the Arab League – and Europe must play an important role here, Mr President-in-Office of the Council – carrying out their work on achieving a Madrid II, which is essential. And then, if we create a foundation that works, this could be very useful, but now the objectives should focus not on creating new foundations but on achieving a peace conference with European participation, with everybody’s participation, which may work.</p>

I wish to echo Mr Patten’s words: Israel is going far beyond the boundaries of what is legitimate in combating terrorism, and the Palestinians are not doing anything like enough to prevent the terrible suicide bombers. We must bring civilisation back to the area. We must have the rule of law and not the rule of power, with the former replacing the latter. That is the principle upon which EU cooperation is based, and something could be learned from this in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">The first step must be to give the UN group the opportunity to investigate the atrocities that have taken place there. It is shocking that Israel’s leaders have denied the three high-ranking people access to the area. We are talking here about a former Finnish president, the former president of the International Red Cross and the former High Commissioner for Refugees. Israel must not be given special treatment. It must accept that everyone should be treated equally and that there should be equality under the law. According to the Speaker of the Knesset, with whom I had the opportunity to speak yesterday, 65% of Israel’s population support Sharon but, at the same time, 80% support the Saudi Arabian peace proposal. That is paradoxical, in my view. We see peace agreements between Egypt and Israel and between Jordan and Israel. There is, then, the possibility of peace in the area and, here in Europe, we must therefore preserve optimism and hope.</p>
<p class="contents">What can we do? I believe that, as we called for in our resolution, we must have human rights representatives present to see to it that human rights are respected by both parties. Again, it is a question of ensuring that the rule of law replaces the rule of power. Human rights organisations must be there to monitor the situation. At the same time, we must have an international peace-keeping force put in place in the Palestinian region. It is immaterial whether it be the UN, NATO, the EU or the United States, but it must be there to create peace. A guarantee must be given to the international community and, at the same time, Israel must not see this as a hostile act. There is a need for a new peace conference, but there is also a need for new people to take part in this. As a very highly regarded Jew in Denmark said to me: ‘There are two idiots in the region at the moment. One is Sharon, and the other is Arafat’. The rule of law must return to the area.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the message from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party. It must be possible for those of us in Europe who are friends of Israel to criticise the Israeli Government, and it must be possible for citizens of Denmark, which is a true and genuine friend of Israel, to criticise without being attacked for being anti-Semitic. Finally, I wish to assure Commissioner Patten that the ELDR Group will come up with the money when it is asked to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cohn-Bendit (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do have the vague impression that, on the one hand, we are all right and that, on the other hand, we are all hypocrites.</p>
<p class="contents">We say either that Israel is not doing enough or that it is doing too much, which is true. We say the Palestinians are not doing enough, which is also true. What about us though? Are we doing enough? I am asking a very simple question. At Barcelona, we decided to grant development aid, not 0.7% of GDP, as is needed, nor 1%, which is closer to what is required… instead we decided to grant 0.39%! And now we are discussing the need to create 40 million jobs in North Africa, and more than 150 million throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Are we not hypocrites? Are we not people who make speeches, but, when it comes to adjusting our budgets, we think of ourselves first and only of others later? Is that not the truth? I would therefore like to ask this question: are we doing enough?</p>
<p class="contents">Let us now turn to the problem of Israel. The international community clearly agreed to the State of Israel in the wake of the barbaric events of the Holocaust. This was both fair and unfair. The international community spoke out for justice and injustice at the same time. The time has come to ensure justice is done and to make up for the injustice. In order to make up for the injustice, the UN must now declare the Palestinian State by formal vote, in the same way as it declared the State of Israel by formal vote.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This would make up for the injustice and ensure justice is done. We can do this immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, when considering peace, we must ask who can achieve peace? We say that the State of Israel is a democratic country. This is true. I think that the Palestinian Authority is a social structure in which the democratic process is underway, but there is still much for it to do. However, we are aware that, in democratic elections, it is not almost the most democratic candidates that receive the greatest number of votes. The elections in Europe have shown us this.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">On this basis, therefore, how can we reassure the Israeli people so that they can finally free themselves of Ariel Sharon? There is only one solution that will bring about peace and that is for Israel to finally have a government which, once again, desires peace, which is not the case of the current government, which, whilst claiming to provide greater security for Israel, is bringing more death and insecurity upon the Israeli people. To achieve peace, we must do more. Avraham Burg asked why we do not guarantee the integrity of Israeli territory by allowing Israel to join NATO, for example? And why not? This is one option. Another option is for NATO to guarantee the integrity of the Palestinian State declared by the UN as soon as possible. Given the situation, these two States currently are unable to guarantee the security of the other, to guarantee the hope of the other. It is up to us, the international community, to think how to guarantee the security of both. Two States, both have peace, both have security. Are we doing enough? Have we really finished with all our contradictions? Let us stop saying, on the one hand, that we are all Israelis, or, on the other hand, that we are all Palestinians. We are neither Israelis nor Palestinians. We are Europeans who wish to fight for the right to live in a State that belongs to the Israelis and to the Palestinians. We are all Israeli-Palestinians or Palestinian-Israelis. We must grasp this once and for all. And if we manage to think like that, well, in fact, we can think that if Mr Sharon has committed crimes against humanity, or war crimes – I cannot say and it is not up to me to decide – we now have an international tribunal in The Hague. From the events in Sabra and Chatila to what has just happened in Jenin, those responsible for the massacres must now be brought before the court of international justice.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Those who welcome this must also welcome the fact that those in Palestine who are responsible for sending young people to massacre Israelis will also be brought before the international tribunal in The Hague. This applies to both sides.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If we continue to debate the issue in this way, we will be credible.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by saying that I support a UN-led international fact-finding mission to investigate events in Jenin, and I ask all those who, today, are in favour of this, bearing in mind that the State of Israel is a democratic country, why then did they refuse an international fact-finding mission being sent to Algeria, when Algeria is not nearly as democratic as Israel is today. We have one set of rules but two ways of applying them. This is what I am saying. We are hypocrites, we are in favour of something when it suits us, and against it when it does not. When we have put our own house in order, this is when the world will believe that we are credible.</p>

Last night, as we were leaving Jerusalem, when we found out that Ariel Sharon was opposed to a fact-finding mission to the Jenin camp, despite the fact that this mission would be UN-led and made up of such figures as the former president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the former High Commissioner for Refugees, we immediately understood the reason behind the new challenge that the Israeli prime minister had placed before the international community. A third of the town of Jenin, which last month still had a population of 15 000 inhabitants, is in ruins. Buildings have been blown apart, families gather together in the parts of blocks of flats which are still standing, seeing what remains of their houses collapse around them. In one part of the camp, a huge area stretched before us, where, just last month, dozens of three- or four-storey blocks of flats stood. All that is left of these are the ends of the metal scaffolding sticking out of the ground. It is difficult to know exactly how many bodies are buried in the rubble beneath your feet. A total of 47 bodies have been recovered from the debris so far. This figure will, unfortunately, have to be revised when a proper search can be conducted.</p>
<p class="contents">The accounts given by inhabitants, backed up by shreds of evidence, are horrifying. Many of the soldiers, who surrounded the camp on 2 April, showed no pity for the civilian population, regardless of whether they were children, the elderly, the disabled or the injured.</p>
<p class="contents">We heard of some shocking examples of this totally unacceptable attitude when we met the medical staff of the camp hospital who gave detailed accounts of the awful events. They told us that at 3 p.m. on 4 April, the army surrounded the hospital with 22 tanks. They said that they were told to stay where they were. The Israeli army general, himself a doctor, said that if an ambulance moved, they would fire. They opened fire on the Red Cross, which was trying to gain entry to the camp. The doctors told us that they were not allowed to save the injured survivors. A doctor, who asked for news of his mother, was told that she was injured and could not be seen. She was later found riddled with bullets. On the same day, the tanks attacked the hospital and destroyed an oxygen reserve. A doctor told us that to stop an injured man bleeding, whose throat had been pierced by a bullet, the only thing they had to hand was wire. They begged the soldiers to allow them to treat him. The doctor shouted that he would lose his arm and the soldier replied that he might as well lose his life. They took away the injured man and two other people, having waited for six hours in the sun. We do not know what happened to them. A young man came to the hospital to collect medicine for his mother. When he entered the hospital, a tank fired, injuring him. A nurse tried to pull him inside and was told that if she touched him, she would be killed. Then a soldier killed the injured man before calling the nurse forward to come and recover his body.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a name for this sort of violence. It bears all the hallmarks of war crimes. This has nothing to do with the legitimate defence of the security of Israel. This is the reason why Ariel Sharon is now trying to do everything possible to prevent a UN-led committee from finding out the truth. On the front page of this morning’s Jerusalem Post, an Israeli official is reported to have said that ‘we are a sovereign country, we do not have to accept this type of command. It is better for us to suffer a few days of poor publicity than to live with the consequences of a biased report.’</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusion that we should reach, in my view, is that the international community must, first and foremost, remind these people of the difference between a sovereign country and an occupied territory. Then, we must make them understand beyond a shadow of a doubt that the age of impunity is over. There will no longer be just a few difficult days to get through.</p>
<p class="contents">Sooner or later, Mr Sharon will have to explain his actions. Yes, it is time to react much more firmly. We must react, because if we fail to do so, we risk collusion with the unacceptable. We must react, it is all the more important to do so because Jenin is not an isolated case. We must ascertain what happened in all the towns which were re-occupied, particularly Nablus where further atrocities cannot be ignored. We must react, because impunity encourages arrogance. Many of our counterparts – Palestinian but also Israeli – including a Deputy Speaker of the Knesset, Mrs Chazan – have told us that they fear a possible attack on Mr Arafat’s headquarters. Furthermore, what consequences will result from the arrest of Marwan Barghouti, the Palestinian commander and MP? The situation in Bethlehem is still unresolved, although discussions are underway. Ariel Sharon has also announced the stepping-up of military operations in Gaza. He also stated that he did not contemplate the evacuation of any settlements. Yes, we must react, without waiting for a response – which is, unfortunately, hardly likely – from the United States, whose President is insulting the Palestinians and is making himself look stupid by depicting Mr Sharon as a man of peace.</p>
<p class="contents">To respond and shoulder our responsibilities, must, I think, for us MEPs mean, apart from sending urgently needed relief, making an unwavering commitment to send the peacekeeping force, not to wage war but to contribute to peace. And this also means bringing to bear as much pressure as possible in the spirit of the resolution that we adopted two weeks ago on the members of the Council who are blocking the necessary revision of EU-Israel relations. And lastly, we must respond and shoulder our responsibilities, Mr President, as Europe's Parliament, something which directly depends on us. In this respect, I wish to repeat an appeal made to us by Abu Ala, the Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council. He said that it is in times of crisis that you find out who your friends are and that he will gladly receive an official delegation from Parliament as well as our President. In my view, the time has come to respond to this invitation and, at the same time, return the visit of Avraham Burg, the Speaker of the Knesset. We shall therefore clearly show that we are not criticising Israel but that we condemn Mr Sharon.</p>
<p class="contents">What we want is a lasting peace with justice and dignity, because, for the first time since 1948, this prospect is being held out by all the Arab countries. It is an historic opportunity which we must not allow to pass by. It would be to Europe’s credit if it made every effort to save this unique hope.</p>

The reality is, of course, that we must try and find solutions and work towards them. But let us remember, first and foremost, that we are dealing with human beings. Let us put into context the sanctity and the blessedness of each single, individual human life. When you look at the situation from that reality, finding a solution or a compromise is not difficult, because despite what some speakers have said, it is not love of one's country or nationalism that causes war violence; it is lack of respect, lack of tolerance of differing viewpoints and of diversity within our society. This is what causes violence and conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">The only real solution to the problems in Israel, Palestine and the whole Middle East region, is to bring the combatants together. You must make peace with your enemy, not with your friend. There is no point in us saying that we support Israel or Palestine. There is no point in the Americans saying "we support the Israelis in what they are doing" or "we are calling on them to be more moderate in their response." Unless the Israelis and the Palestinians sit down together and work out their problems, nothing we do or say can be more effective than what they can achieve themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The difficulty, however lies in bringing them together. Each side must give up something. Each side must reduce its own bargaining position or its own ultimate goal, by some degree, because, in a peace process, there can be no outright winners, nor outright losers either. As rightly as we condemn all forms of violence, as rightly as we condemn the episodes that have taken place in Jenin, in the Church of the Nativity around Bethlehem, and the suicide bombers in the cafes and restaurants in Israel, we must also be willing and aware in order to assist in bringing the people together. The only way that can be done is by taking them out of the area of conflict and bringing them into dialogue, giving them the support and the strength and the backbone that they need, not only to convince themselves that peace is achievable and that harmony can be achieved between the peoples of Israel and Palestine, but also that they will be given full support from the European Union and each of its Member States to achieve that.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us put our hands on our hearts and commit ourselves to peace, to justice, but, most importantly of all, to humanity.</p>

I can fully endorse this view.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, anti-Semitic statements simply do not belong in our European Community. The escalation of the conflict in the Middle East, however, has resulted in statements of precisely this kind and has led to an upsurge in completely reprehensible expressions of anti-Semitism. This is unworthy of Europe, which is, after all, the continent of the Holocaust.</p>
<p class="contents">Where in the EU Member States does political decency begin and end? This is not really a theoretical question in this day and age. In a recently published Spanish magazine, the name of the Israeli Prime Minister was adorned with a swastika and the face of this government leader was distorted into a pig’s head with yarmulke. I really imagined myself to be back in the days of the notorious Nazi poisoner, Julius Streicher. During the Euromed Conference in Valencia, the Israeli Foreign Affairs Minister, Shimon Peres, rightly condemned anti-Semitic excesses in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Prior to the Euromed Summit, the Association Agreement between Algeria and the European Union was signed. At this ceremony, the Algerian President, Mr Bouteflika, called the Palestinian suicide bombers 'martyrs' and justified their terrorist acts as 'legitimate resistance'. With this, he immediately undermined the objective of 'fighting terrorism', a prominent section of the Association Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union wants to be an acceptable interlocutor for the State of Israel too, then it should resolutely turn its back on all expressions of anti-Semitism and terrorism, now and in future.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank both Mr Pique I Camps and Mr Patten for their clear condemnation of terrorism in the Middle East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interruption by the President)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Thank you, Mr President, I should begin by thanking the Presidency for its support, which ensured that Parliament was represented in Valencia by an unusually large delegation in which there was room for representatives of Parliament’s five largest groups. I believe that the presence of Parliament’s delegation was justified insofar as it was able to witness <span class="italic">in situ</span> the efforts made by the Spanish Presidency to hold and manage, often against the odds but always with skill, a meeting which was very complicated given the very tense situation in the region in question.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe I can safely say that the presence of Parliament has been useful, that it will have contributed in some way to the success, within the Valencia action plan, of certain proposals which stem from resolutions and parliamentary debates in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the political context, the commitment to respect human rights and to cooperate in the fight against terrorism seem to me to be a very important advance, and these are issues which for the first time are clearly laid out in the conclusions of a meeting of this nature. Equally important are the decisions which imply an insistence on progress with liberalisation in the Mediterranean region and we hope that the Association Agreement with Lebanon will be signed during the current Presidency. In fact, Mr President, I believe that we should explicitly welcome the presence of the delegation from Libya, a country which clearly plays an important role in the region and throughout the whole continent.</p>
<p class="contents">This process of opening up markets must be accompanied by clear Community support through an increase in investments in the region, as Commissioner Patten pointed out, contributing in particular to the development of infrastructures. Furthermore, we should welcome the statement that there is a need to hold an open and in-depth debate on the organisation of migratory flows and their management on both sides of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Parliament must continue to insist on the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank and meanwhile, we must monitor and demand the support of the institutions involved – and in this regard I am sure we can count on the cooperation of the European Commission – in order to comply with the commitment to double the funds of the EIB in the region until 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">The support of the Conference for the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly seems to me very significant and I am sure that we will be able to dedicate our work in the next parliamentary forum in Bari in June to debating its launch, which must be a crucial element in the institutionalisation of the Barcelona Process. And in this same respect, we must applaud the creation of a foundation which promotes dialogue between cultures and civilisations, which my group has repeatedly called for.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, and in spite of the circumstances, I insist that in Valencia we have been able to confirm that the revitalisation of the Barcelona Process, six years after its launch, represents a strategic option for the future for the European Union and for each of its Member States and all of its democratic expressions, because I believe that the attempts at party politics, such as that made by the President of the Socialist Group, have no place here. It goes without saying that at the moment, the achievement of a stable and secure Mediterranean area is threatened by the situation in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">Without saying any more, I would like, Mr President, to end with a double appeal to this House. Firstly that, despite all the tragedy, we continue with our efforts towards peace, and secondly, increase the internal dialogue in this House in order to ensure that the positions of the European Parliament are the result of a broad consensus, because that is the only way, through unity, that Parliament’s voice can be heard and that it can contribute to the peace process we all want to see. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Imbeni (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT) </span>Mr President, I agree that Valencia was a success – and I agree with Mr Piqué that the very fact the meeting took place was an achievement. I had the honour of being the leader of the European Parliament delegation, and I have to say that the debate at the Conference was fierce and there were some very difficult moments, but the agreement on the action plan and – called for, of course, by the European Parliament – the endorsement of the idea of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly and the Foundation for intercultural dialogue are certainly achievements: on the basis of all this, we can say that, despite the tragic situation in the Middle East, it may well be possible for things to go a little better after Valencia. In any case, the foundations have been laid for reinvigoration of the cooperation process in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, Israel has many enemies to defeat before it can live in security and peace. As has already been said, the greatest of these enemies is certainly anti-Semitism, and we, the European Union and the European Parliament, are at the forefront of the battle against this terrible scourge that has been striking even just recently, here, in our Member States, with shameful attacks. Another enemy is terrorism, and here too we are right behind Israel in combating all forms of terrorism, including the – appalling – series of suicide attacks. There is a certain amount of ambiguity regarding this point in certain Arab parties and countries, with people saying that the fight against Nazi Fascism in Europe was a rebellion too. It is true that it was a rebellion but I would point out – apart from the fact that the comparison is inappropriate – that resistance to Nazi Fascism never involved attacks on civilians: killing civilians is not a form of martyrdom – as has been said – it is terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Israel’s third enemy is certainly the refusal hitherto of many countries to recognise its existence or to maintain appropriate relations with the country. The Saudi peace plan represents a considerable opportunity from this point of view. Israel’s fourth enemy – I would like to point out – is its – great – mistrust of the European Union. If ever there may have been some explanation for this mistrust in the past, it is now totally unacceptable; there is absolutely no reason for it. It is precisely in the European Union and its principles and policies that Israel has a friend and ally: in refusing to accept this friendship and support, the Israeli Government is making a huge mistake.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, another enemy of Israel – and this is my personal opinion – is the Sharon Government and its policies: both its symbolic and its practical actions. The Israeli people have a clear responsibility to assess the damage done by Mr Sharon’s transformation of the justified fight against terrorism into the disproportionate, excessive use of force, by his dissemination of the idea that it is possible to defeat terrorism and break out of the crisis using military force, by the way he has treated the representative of the Palestinian National Authority as if he were the leader of the terrorists, imprisoning him and then accusing him of doing nothing to stop the terrorism, by his failure to acknowledge the objective of two States and two peoples, by his failure to specify a clear date for withdrawal from all the occupied territories. These are all positions of the Sharon Government which have placed Israel in difficulties, and they certainly do nothing to further the advent of peace or – consequently – a secure future for Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Israel’s security does not depend on the number of tanks occupying the territory but on the undertaking of the international community, and Madrid – the quartet, as Mr Piqué said – is the most important development. This new opportunity now exists and must be used to initiate – as Javier Solana said – fresh, brief talks that will lead to a peace that is stable and lasting for both the Palestinian and the Israeli people and for the entire Mediterranean region as well. We must do something to give the young people of the region the hope, at last, of a future of peace and security.</p>

<p class="contents">As you know, I have often advocated that the Barcelona Process can and must aid the peace process as far as possible and that it is desirable for the Middle East conflict to slow down the Barcelona Process as little as possible. But it is clear today that the state of affairs is extremely difficult and painful.</p>
<p class="contents">The mere fact that the action plan has been adopted in this extremely difficult situation demonstrates the extent to which the justification for the relaunch of the Barcelona Process has become well-founded. I believe that the approval of the plan covers the objectives we had set. Firstly because it sets a priority which is repeatedly justified and secondly because it is based on the model action plan, in a concrete form.</p>
<p class="contents">The operative approaches taken, as has been said previously, promote the defence of human rights, development, work, dialogue, peace and democracy. Furthermore, we have done so by means of important instruments such as the Foundation, the decision not to give up on the Bank, an open Bank, a Bank which allows for co-ownership, the creation of a parliamentary assembly which as well as being useful combines two characteristics: firstly, that it is a proposal by Parliament and secondly, that it is a genuinely parliamentary proposal, and it is therefore of particular interest to us.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been said, I am very pleased that Parliament’s delegation was present: eight representatives, and I believe that this presence and the consideration that has been given to Parliament’s report in Valencia are positive but, Mr President, I will return to the beginning: the conflict and tragedy in the Middle East affect everybody and everything.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that at this point the structures of the Palestinian National Authority have been destroyed, Arafat is confined, there is an occupation, there are serious humanitarian problems, which, at the same time, the Israeli Government is doing absolutely nothing about, and is ignoring every law and every agreement, and that the European Union cannot impose any solution, is an extremely serious situation. I am naturally very pleased that Mr Solana is in Palestine today and that yesterday and the day before in Valencia both delegations sat down at least for a time at the same table and I believe that the action plan is a crucial contribution to peace but, I insist, the Security Council Resolutions have not been complied with, and this Parliament cannot see how the Council of the European Union can implement the measures that have been adopted. I am referring to the embargo, to the Association Agreement with Israel, but also to the importance of the United States in relation to this issue, and the extent to which Parliament, and the European Union, is pursuing its efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, all of this simply prevents us from expressing satisfaction, which for various reasons could be justified.</p>

I have been in Palestine dozens of times since 1968 and have seen countless bombed Palestinian houses. I thought I was immune, but Jenin was worse than I had imagined. Mr Larsson is entirely right. Jenin can be called Palestine’s ground zero.</p>
<p class="contents">Jenin can also be called a new Deir Yassin. It was of course there that Sharon’s political forefathers within Irgun murdered as many as 250 Palestinian civilians in April 1948, an act that was the signal for the mass flight of Palestinians that lies behind the whole problem. It was the intention on that occasion too to cause the Palestinians to flee, and there is a lot to be said for the view that that is also the intention on this occasion. The aim is to try to frighten the Palestinians into moving and to force them to flee. Those who still remain are to be put in prison.</p>
<p class="contents">Last Sunday, the New York Times reported that a Berlin Wall is to be built around the whole of the West Bank. This is not to be a wall between Israel and Palestine, but a wall around the whole of the West Bank so that the whole area becomes one large concentration camp. When we were there the other night, 12 Palestinians were evicted from 12 flats in the middle of the city. According to the newspaper <span class="italic">Ha’aretz</span>, this is a phase in the strategy of surrounding the Old Town with Jewish outposts. The Jerusalem Post says of Knesset member Ben Elon that ‘he promises Jewish continuity in Jerusalem’.</p>
<p class="contents">If we were to exchange the word ‘Jewish’ for ‘white’, ‘Swedish’, ‘Christian’ or any other ethnic or national designation, everyone would shout ‘racism!’.</p>
<p class="contents">Why are Mr Patten and Mr Pique I Camps so incredibly cautious? Certainly, they said a lot of good things, but why not look the truth in the eye and realise that the Israeli policy of occupation is the same kind of policy which eventually led to the boycotting of South Africa. It is the same kind of policy that finally led to the intervention in Kosovo to rescue the Kosovan Albanians.</p>
<p class="contents">Israel must therefore be treated in the same way as we treated Milosevic’s Serbia and apartheid in South Africa. The Sharon regime must be isolated.</p>
<p class="contents">Happily, there are many who realise this. One hundred and twenty researchers have published a letter in the <span class="italic">Guardian</span>, demanding that Israel be barred from cooperating on research with the EU. The Swedish and British Medical Associations have proposed that the Israeli Medical Association be excluded from the World Medical Association, and the football organisation FIFA is to adopt a position on Israel’s exclusion at the beginning of May.</p>
<p class="contents">In South Africa, the Jewish minister Mr Kasrils is demanding a boycott of Israel. It really is high time that we in the EU took a fairly tough line and at least fulfilled the pretty mild demand made by the European Parliament, namely that we suspend the Association Agreement with Israel. The least that can be asked is that the Council and the Commission ensure that the demand is carried out in practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would therefore like to use my time today to read you some of the things said by Palestinian and Israeli women who came to Parliament together to call for a European peace-keeping intervention. They are women from The Jerusalem Link, Israeli and Palestinian women. They are voices preserving a glimmer of hope for the future, the voices of people who really are counting on us to act upon our resolutions. I do thank both Mr Piqué and Mr Solana – who is not here – and Commissioner Patten for both their words and gestures, but I feel that we must implement what we stated in our Parliamentary resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what the women said: ‘The deliberate killing of innocent civilians, whether Palestinian or Israeli, cannot be condoned. Prolonging the suffering of the Palestinian people, destroying infrastructures and civilian houses and keeping President Arafat segregated will serve only to exacerbate the suffering and insecurity of both peoples and will destroy any possibility of peace. The two peoples cannot enjoy peace and security unless the root cause of this conflict, the true enemy of peace – military occupation – is eliminated. The two peoples are currently trapped in a climate of fear and of obsession with retaliation. We women refuse to be paralysed or divided by these fears. We cannot turn a blind eye to the policies and practices conceived with the aim of humiliating and oppressing the Palestinians and forcing them to submit to the strategic programme of expropriation, settlements and colonisation that Israel has been pursuing throughout 34 years of occupation.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that non-violent attempts by Palestinian movements to oppose the denial of their fundamental human rights have, in the past, always been met with violence and repressive measures from Israel and with silence on the part of the international community. If peace and security are to be achieved, we must put an end to the continued denial of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and do so in the context of fair, global negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, we call upon the international powers to provide an international presence in the Middle East to protect the civilian people. To this end, we call for the UN resolutions to be implemented. The rule of law, reciprocal recognition and reciprocal respect for individual and collective rights will pave the way to achieving peace.’</p>
<p class="contents">This is what those women said, and I feel that we cannot block our ears to these voices which are the voices of Israeli and Palestinian women but also of Palestinian and Israeli men uniting to say ‘That is enough! Stop the military occupation!’ Now we must turn words into tangible actions. The presence today of the European Union, which I hope will have been able to meet with President Arafat, is important, but we must make absolutely sure that Israel understands that we cannot allow it, in its unmitigated defence of its existence, its unmitigated defence against any potential threat to the Jewish people, to continue along its current path. We must use the instruments available to us too. We cannot be racist and suspend the agreement with Zimbabwe while treating Israel indulgently all the time. We must lose no time in taking action, for peace will benefit everybody. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I feel that Parliament must realise that the clauses making all the economic and institutional agreements concluded between the Union and third countries subject to respect for human, civil and political rights are destined to remain a dead letter. The Lebanon and Algeria will not abide by these commitments, although for different reasons, of course. This is a hypocritical action which undermines the Union’s internal and international credibility, for while, on paper, it is reassuring the European public of its commitment to freedom and to providing guarantees for the citizens of the contracting countries, in practice, it never dares to make a stand against the governments – of Tunisia and Laos – which take the money and then blatantly make no effort to honour their commitments. We need to reflect on this and to choose a more honourable way of abandoning the clauses rather than continuing to display our hypocrisy and impotence. Parliament must reflect on this matter: it has called and continues to call for sanctions against Israel, the only country in the Middle East which is, in spite of everything, committed to respecting democracy and human and civil rights, and yet it is not, in practice, making – and nor has it made in the past – any such forceful demands of the other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Europe has concentrated and is continuing to concentrate on the north-eastern border – with enlargement – but it is guilty of neglecting the southern, Mediterranean border. Many of Europe’s afflictions, in areas such as immigration and security, for instance, originate from Europe’s southern border, from its relations with the Islamic world.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the words and proposals regarding the reinvigoration of the Barcelona Process. Some speakers have hailed the Valencia Summit as a success. I would point out that the Barcelona Summit was also hailed as a success and now we are labelling it a failure. I fear that Valencia will suffer the same fate if we do not take practical action. One example will suffice: for how long will we continue to discuss Europe’s protectionist trade policies which are restricting the manufactured goods markets and the agricultural products market too? Are we going to continue to defend the CAP against what are, or ought to be, our own interests, namely that agricultural products should be imported from the Maghreb with the consequent generation of employment and maybe even a fall in immigration?</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, on the subject of the Israeli-Palestinian question, I understand the satisfaction expressed at the visit of our delegation to Palestine. We know what we are asking Israel. Yesterday, the Council urged Israel once again to end the siege on Yasser Arafat in Ramallah. That is all well and good, but what are we asking of President Arafat? Will we be content with his ‘No’ or will we call for an end to the constant suicide bomb attacks?</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, I would like to underline firmly how necessary and appropriate it would be for the European Union to display its willingness to bring about full integration of the Israeli democracy into the European Union. Yesterday, the Speaker of the Knesset, Avraham Burg, voiced disapproval of the stick approach of sanctions, advocating the carrot of full integration instead. This is an opportunity to be seized by a Europe for whom the peace and future of that region are very important, an opportunity for a Europe with a vision. And what a vision this is! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I regret that President Cox is no longer in the chair, if I may say so, as I would have liked to say to him directly – although I am sure that you will pass on my comments – that, in France, many sectors of public – and especially sovereignist – opinion believe that the positions we adopted on Monday on the outcome of the presidential elections in France are not only null and void and have no effect, but above all, they mark a very serious dereliction of the duty of impartiality that must be respected by any Parliament’s president, on the one hand, and even more so by an international rather than supranational Parliament, which has no place interfering in the political affairs of a Member State. I hope that he will come to his senses and that he will withdraw the utterly useless and scandalous remarks that he made on Monday.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Middle East, we are struck by one thing – from a European perspective at least – which is that Europe and its Member States, bound together as they are by a false sense of European solidarity, are once again absent from the Middle East stage where the tragic events we are witnessing have been going on not just for weeks and months but for years. We do not want to hear once again, Mr President, that Europe must have a foreign policy. We heard this in 1991 during the Gulf War; we heard this mentioned again two or three years later in the affair in the Great Lakes Region of Africa; we heard this once again in relation to Bosnia, and again in relation to Kosovo. Each time, it was a pious hope and, each time a new international crisis rears its head, Europe is mute, mute because European countries are incapable of agreeing on a common approach. Europe can only speak with a single voice when it has nothing to say, and it says nothing because it is held prisoner by an extreme and dangerous concept of its unity, it prevents the nations from expressing their views. This is a serious matter, particularly for France, which would have had, were it not bound by its European handcuffs, a voice of justice, a voice of peace and a voice heard by a large number of the world’s countries. It is time for France – and I myself have been convinced of this for some years – to throw off this yoke and I do not doubt that it will do this, which is what the great majority of French people desire, in the years to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Mediterranean region is important, enlargement is important, and all these things are in our common interest.</p>
<p class="contents">We can see that if there is no genuine and peaceful development in the Mediterranean region, it is to all our streets that the fire spreads. The attack carried out on Djerba, which was aimed at tourists, shows us how close the flames have already got to our front doors. It is important, for this reason, that this dialogue should be engaged in on the basis of equality of rights. The dialogue is also cultural and not capable of being brought about by politics alone. We attach great significance to the creation of economic, social and political prospects for people in North Africa, as these can bring the region stable development which will in future be democratic.</p>
<p class="contents">That, indeed, is another reason why it is so important that the region should get speedy and effective help unhindered by bureaucracy. I am aware of Commissioner Patten's great exertions in recent years towards achieving improvements in this field, but now as much as then we are in a position in which money is spent and formal resolutions adopted, the effectiveness of which, however, leaves something to be desired. That implementation is inadequate is due both to difficulties on our side and to bureaucracy in the countries in question, and that must change.</p>
<p class="contents">No success will be achieved across the Mediterranean region as a whole for as long as there is still no resolution to the Middle East conflict, which keeps bringing emotions to the boil and making the whole Mediterranean problem difficult to resolve. The shuttle diplomacy currently going on there sometimes strikes me as ridiculous. Mr Powell and Mr Solana keep travelling there – on alternate weeks. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, how about a Council resolution to the effect that the next delegation would be sent, not to Jerusalem, but to Washington, in order to enforce the sending of a joint delegation to Jerusalem and Ramallah, with the Russians and the United Nations joining in?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this would make a real difference. On this issue, what Commissioner Patten has said in this House about joint efforts is precisely what needs to be said loud and clear. I know that there are major diplomatic reservations on one side or the other, but I do think that we have to get the idea accepted that only a joint effort with those Arab states that are willing to try something can bring an end to the violence, giving the message that the end of the road has been reached. This is the only way to credibly guarantee security in the region, and it could also create the conditions for a measure such as a sort of Marshall Plan, for which we are prepared, to be effective.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a vital prerequisite for further development that we get both states – Israeli and Palestinian – recognised by all their neighbours. In particular, we also need a solution to the refugee problem, so that people there can have new prospects and so that the refugee camps cease to be the epicentres of incessant new terrorism. That must be stopped. It is not acceptable to send them to Israel and by this means to bring about change within Israel; rather, the Arabs must be prepared to offer the Palestinian refugees a future in their countries. I believe that it is not just Le Pen's people, but also ourselves when we express differing viewpoints, who need to be reminded of the quotation from Voltaire: ‘Your opinion is quite the opposite of my own, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.’</p>

<p class="contents">It was not obvious whether the Conference could take place, whether the Arab members of the Barcelona Process would agree to sit down with representatives of Israel, whether the representative of the Palestinian Authority could attend, etc. We should not simply express our satisfaction with the results, but we should also try to explain the reasons for them, which to me are clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the process has acquired its own logic, and there is an awareness of shared interests and a common destiny. Some years after Barcelona this seems absolutely clear. But I would like to stress the second reason, because the European Union’s external policy is so often criticised that we should sometimes stop and consider to what extent the success of the Ministerial Conference in Valencia is due mainly to the perception our Mediterranean partners have of that policy: their perception that our horror at the tragedy in the Middle East is sincere, their perception that we have not backed away in the face of this problem, their perception that our position is not unilateral but coordinated, and finally their perception that we are not indulging in empty posturing in the face of the current problems. As Commissioner Patten said in a comment to the Conference, which is not entirely original, but which is brilliant, the European Union wants to be tough on terrorism but also on the causes of terrorism. We have earned interest on this policy and I am perfectly happy to congratulate Mr Solana, Mr Patten and many others on these good results, although I am not in favour – naturally – of personality cults.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this satisfaction should not blind us to the great fragility of the Barcelona Process. Poor people – and there are many in the Mediterranean – always have enormous patience as long as two conditions are in place: the first is that they feel that next year is going to be a little better than this one or the last one, that the situation of their children is going to be better than that of their parents and that their grandchildren are going to go to university; the second condition is that they do not feel humiliated. These are the two basic challenges of the European Union’s Mediterranean policy. Barcelona, as Mr Piqué, President-in-Office of the Council, has said, has survived in Valencia, but it will not survive unless we meet this twin challenge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A man had been attempting for four days to locate his brother under the rubble with his bare hands, while Israel obstructed the bulldozers that were needed for this. A doctor was not allowed to attend to a bleeding man on the street until this man had bled to death. A Palestinian family had been living in East Jerusalem for fifty years and was evicted from their home on Monday night in order to make room for Israeli settlers. Computers of the Palestinian Ministry of Education were piled up by Israeli soldiers and subsequently blown up with grenades.</p>
<p class="contents">Can someone tell me what these acts have to do with the fight against terrorism? The Israeli Government is not only fighting terrorism. Sharon is maliciously destroying the Palestinian infrastructure and, with it, Palestine’s hope, and people without any hope are driven to acts of despair. Loathsome suicide attacks are then the end result. And this is how Sharon himself contributes to Israel’s lack of security, which he claims he wants to promote.</p>
<p class="contents">Israel’s security can only be guaranteed if we remove the causes of this despair: the colonisation and occupation. However, Sharon has indicated he would like to build new settlements. How is this supposed to guarantee Israel’s security?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are all shocked by the growth in anti-Semitism in Europe. We condemn this emphatically and call on governments to take vigorous action. However, it is unacceptable to do as Mr Perez does and instantly label everyone who levels criticism at Israel as anti-Semitic, and it is a very easy way out of addressing well-founded international criticism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The horror we witnessed has been described by previous speakers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not just a question of Jenin. The Palestinians we spoke to told us that the situation was the same in Nablus, in Ramallah and in all the cities of the West Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">The horror is also political. The Palestinian Authority is completely destroyed. They destroyed the ministries, the schools, the infrastructures, the archives; everything. Meanwhile, on the road from Jerusalem to Jenin – on which police vehicles, tanks and jeeps stopped us frequently – we saw colonies of foreigners who arrive on Palestinian land, which looked like residential areas of Paris, London or Madrid, or any European capital. Wealth next to misery. We saw that it is possible for a sovereign State to confine the President of the Authority of a territory which has absolutely nothing to do with it, or a leader such as Barghuti, or how helicopters and tanks carry out terrorism. In fact, there are terrorists who commit suicide out of desperation, but there are also terrorist helicopters. We witnessed this the day before yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, I can only express pessimism if there is no clear intervention by the international community and the UN, the European Union and the United States in particular. Nothing can be done if the UN resolutions are not truly applied. I am aware – like everybody – of the initial Arab opposition to Israel, but this is not the fundamental problem today. The problem is that Sharon, and practically all the others, believe in their historical, moral, cultural and technological superiority. A religious minister who recently entered the government said that all the Palestinians should be thrown into the sea and that those who stayed there would be like the Turks in Germany or the Algerians in France. The progressives themselves do not really want a Palestinian state. In the face of this situation, what can the <span class="italic">bantustans</span> do when they are divided by settlements of colonists, by roads which are only used by colonists and the army, and divided by the army itself, in an area which furthermore is small and would lack, for example, the gorgeous Jordan valley?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Palestinians are right – the President of the Palestinian Parliament, or the successor in Jerusalem to the late Hussein – when they express their desperation to us. For us the only solution is the intervention of the UN and the European Union in particular. They cannot sort things out amongst themselves because Israel does not want a Palestinian State, it does not conform to their ideology, that is the reality. I believe that we must be aware of this problem in order to resolve it.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that Europe can feel guilty in this situation. Many sources in the United States say that Europe must not get involved given their previous experience. We are European citizens of the present, we cannot feel guilty and we cannot fall prey to the blackmail of anti-Semitism: since we are in favour of a Palestinian State, we are anti-Semites. It is not a religious problem but a political problem: a State which is humiliating and destroying a population. The problem is the occupation and how to convince, how to impose a solution on Israel and how to help Palestine. That is the issue for the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a tragedy, it has nothing to do with security. To terrorise a population is pure State terrorism. And I would therefore like to thank Mr Piqué who, when he rightly condemns the terrorism of the Palestinian suicide bombers, also condemns just as roundly the terrorism of Israel, because if we do not have yardsticks, our credibility could be called into question.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that the cause of the failure of the peace process stems from the fact that it is not acceptable for one State to occupy another and establish colonies within it, as is happening at the moment. This reminds me of what happened when Germany invaded France and it is completely unacceptable; this situation leads to a logical reaction against the occupying army, against the occupiers. Anybody, any soul, would rebel on seeing the wealth of the colonies and the misery of the refugee camps. We must therefore immediately recognise the Palestinian State and the fact that Palestine, as a State, can put its claims to the international community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Bulldozers were sent in to raze houses to the ground and, to make certain that under no circumstances could anything living be found or a single body dug out, tanks were subsequently sent in so that there was little more than a broad road where the houses had been. If that is not a lack of respect for human life, I do not know what is. It is completely unknown how many dead there are under the rubble in Jenin. The fact that there are dead bodies there can be smelt, however. There is a disgusting smell when one walks around the area, and a start can therefore be made on digging where the smell is worst. If it is not known how many bodies there are down there, it is because men and women were separated from each other. The men have still not been handed back to Jenin, so it is not known how many are still prisoners of the Israelis and how many are lying dead beneath the rubble.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to condemn the suicide bombers, as of course we must, we must condemn what has happened in Jenin just as vigorously. We must not just demand that Israel withdraw its troops. We must condemn its action and we must demand that the guilty be held responsible, with Israel itself holding the soldiers who have committed these inhuman acts to account. There is no doubt at all as to how many civilians have been killed. We have the exact figures from human rights organisations. More than 2 000 civilians have been killed. We know how they have been killed: whether they have been killed in bombardments or whether they have been shot and, if so, where they have been shot. We know how many of them are children. We know how many of them are men and how many are women. We also know that a systematic destruction of the whole infrastructure is taking place in the Palestinian areas. We know that there is now no registration of births or deaths. Marriages are not being registered. There is no registration of criminals, yet at the same time it is said that President Arafat should imprison the criminals. However, there are no longer any registers, for everything has been systematically destroyed.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask Commissioner Patten to withdraw his statement about guarantees that this must not happen again. Following such completely systematic and very deliberate destruction, how in the world are we to expect to receive guarantees from Israel to the effect that nothing like this will happen again? If we do not receive guarantees from Israel, are we really to delay putting the whole of this structure in place, or not to put it in place at all? There is no doubt as to what is desired by Israel or, rather, Ariel Sharon. I decline now to distinguish between the two, for it is of course Ariel Sharon that we are talking about. Last week, he imprisoned a leader, Marwan Barghouti, who has been one of the main people behind the demand for peace. He is now being held in detention. In eight days, he has only spent one hour with his lawyer. He is being interrogated 21 hours at a time and is only allowed to sleep for three hours. He is my colleague. He is under the same immunity as myself. At the moment, however, he is being tortured in an Israeli jail. It is a phase in the complete destruction of Palestinian society, its infrastructure and leaders. Let us tell it like it is. Let us not make any assumptions. There is evidence enough. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And furthermore, you, quite rightly, did not agree, Mr President, to sending observers or a peacekeeping force without a negotiated political agreement. What sort of role could they perform in a situation which, quite clearly, does not involve two regular armies? Any lack of coordination in the European Union’s behaviour can only undermine the supply of confidence that we must have when dealing with each party, if we wish to provide an effective contribution, when the time comes, to finding a lasting peace. The ideological gesticulation and passionate blindness leave open the diplomatic terrain, in other words, that of the genuine search for peace which will benefit the United States alone.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what you said this afternoon goes more or less in the right direction, there having been many detours, such as the ambiguous positions adopted by Europe at the Durban conference, our shambolic performance at the meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Commission, and Parliament’s biased resolution which sent out the wrong signal at the wrong time. Your statement, Mr President, was balanced. The Council is asking for a withdrawal of Israeli troops from the territories as well as an end to the attacks in Israel. You have strongly condemned the suicide attacks, describing them as inexcusable and indicating that those who carried them out were not martyrs, but terrorists. The European Union must be totally unambiguous, unequivocal and show no complacency on this point. In the coming weeks, the European Union must also help to make the United Nations investigation into the events in Jenin impartial rather than a pretext for manipulations or excesses which will not help the cause of peace. With the prospect of establishing a Palestinian state on the horizon, we must also help to convince the Palestinian Authority to abandon its twin-track approach and to start behaving in a fully responsible way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We in Parliament naturally wish to keep abreast of developments, and my own group supports all balanced attempts to achieve a state of peace in the Middle East. Simply to discuss this issue from one month or one week to the next, however, seems almost grotesque. We in Parliament cannot influence the situation in any concrete way. We come here to speak to whoever happens to be listening, but do we then go away feeling pleased with ourselves, having done so? I hope we do not.</p>
<p class="contents">It would appear that, just as the rescue and clearance work at the World Trade Centre finally reached ‘ground zero’ level, relations between the Israelis and the Palestinians are also at ground zero. An optimist would say, and I am one, that from here on things can and must get better. Commissioner Patten also suggested he hoped this was the case.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems clear that only through the joint efforts of what has been called the ‘quartet’ – the United Nations, the European Union, the United States of America and Russia – can progress be made. Solo endeavours, whether those of Colin Powell or the High Representative for the CFSP, Javier Solana, who are both held in high regard, do not produce results. One of the parties in the dispute always suspects the other of being biased. When a mission that seems as clear as the one Secretary-General Kofi Annan sent President Martti Ahtisaari on to investigate the devastation at Jenin and the number of human casualties there meets with suspicion on the part of the other party, we really are at ground zero point. President Ahtisaari, who I know well, could hardly be accused of prejudice.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community must unite to achieve the only possible solution: the Palestinians must have their own unified state, whose entire area they have complete sovereignty over, and not just the whole of the land area but also the waters that surround it and the airspace above it. The Israelis must be given an unconditional assurance that their children, their old people, and mothers and fathers can travel in absolute safety within the territory of their own state without the threat of continued, devious, terrorist bomb attacks. Only this can be the basis of a constructive common existence built on mutual respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I do not believe in sanctions – pressure should suffice – but unless constructive, genuine and goal-conscious talks get under way soon and furthermore lead to a result there will definitely be a feeling of <span class="italic">déjà vu</span>. How long and how pointless were the talks in the former Yugoslavia before sanctions were imposed? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also congratulate Commissioner Chris Patten on the intelligence, impartiality and astuteness of his intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">My question is a simple one and is addressed to Mr Piqué: do you believe – having heard Commissioner Patten state that the Middle East is in flames, which is indeed the case – that the Barcelona Process can withstand the conflict in the Middle East? In implementing his reprehensible policy, Mr Sharon has demonstrated that he does not respect the resolutions of the European Union, those of the United Nations or even the recommendations of President Bush. He does not take them seriously! I wish to ask: are we going to continue to churn out the fine words, the stirring speeches and the impressive-sounding votes, which we know are not really having any effect, when we have within our grasp the means to force Mr Sharon to change policy? Why is the Resolution, which was approved by a large majority by the European Parliament, to suspend the Association Agreement between the European Union and Israel not being implemented? Why is no serious initiative being adopted under the auspices of the UN, to impose a peacekeeping force on Israel? As a long-standing friend of Israel, it pains me to have to say that Mr Sharon is irredeemably tainting Israel’s honour and is putting his country in a morally indefensible position and in a greater situation of international isolation than ever before.</p>

We must ceaselessly remind Mr Arafat that suicide bombings are not only morally repugnant but also that they stop us helping him to get a Palestinian State. They play into Ariel Sharon's hands.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority in this Parliament called two weeks ago for a suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement. I support an arms embargo but not sanctions, and I am even more convinced on my return that, while it may satisfy our desire to be seen to be doing something, this is a potential dead end. Presumably, they are meant to work through the Israeli public, feeling the painful bite of loss of exports and jobs, pressurising the Sharon Government to stop its crazy policies. But in Commissioner Patten's interview in Herat on Monday, it was indicated that Brussels was frustrated that the Israelis did not seem to appreciate the EU link. They regard us with distrust, rightly or wrongly.</p>
<p class="contents">While Palestinians see themselves in a struggle for national liberation from oppressive Israeli occupation, 75 percent of Israelis see themselves as the principal victims, struggling for national survival. I am not commenting on the justification for these two narratives, but how can it help to cut off, as two British professors have urged, academic and intellectual exchanges? These are channels through which we Europeans could convey our experience of using mutual respect to overcome hatreds, helping Israelis and Palestinians strengthen their dialogue. How would it help to stop funding human rights NGOs in Israel? If we suspend the Association Agreement, we will merely reinforce the Israeli perception of a perfidious Europe. What will our exit strategy from trade sanctions be? What conditions would need to be satisfied to restore the Association Agreement? I have not heard anyone explain how that will work.</p>
<p class="contents">It is much better, in my view, to focus on a different paragraph in our resolution: the need for an international force in Palestine. If our objective is to be effective in achieving a Palestinian State as soon as possible, and establishing peace and justice in the region, we should exert all our diplomatic efforts in that direction and not in suspending the chance for dialogue that we have.</p>

Like many other Members of the House, in the last few weeks I have met representatives from the Middle East who have come here to appeal for our help.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Mrs Morgantini last week, I had the privilege of meeting very brave and very inspirational Israeli and Palestinian women who are working together for peace – peace between equals as they see it. They explained to us very vividly way just how desperate the situation is. The work that the Palestinians have done in building up the very basics of a state over the past 10 years is systematically being destroyed. Most of the women worked for NGOs and their files, computers and property had been destroyed so they could no longer continue their work.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been many resolutions and conferences. They are all essential and there will be many more, but these women did not see the intervention needed to stop further bloodshed. They were calling for a peacekeeping force to protect the people and I believe that we should support that call. A policy of force can never get rid of the levels of desperation and despair that lead to further acts of violence. There must be a just and peaceful solution for the long term, as well as a swift response to stop any further killing now. We must ensure that we keep up the pressure at all levels, in every way we can, to get that lasting peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, it is not just our economic and social policies; it is also our policy in the Middle East that feeds this sort of extremism. We all know what ideas movements such as the National Front harbour.</p>
<p class="contents">They harbour ideas of national splendour. Which is only natural when our people see Europe as the lackey of the United States, blind, deaf and dumb to the genocide of the Palestinians, and turn their back on established political forces, charmed by the magic flute of past national splendours. They harbour anti-Semitic ideas. Which is only natural when Europe allows Jenin to become a latter-day Warsaw ghetto, when – in a Europe with the blood of the Jews on its hands – voices can again be heard saying ‘the Jews are to blame’ and forces have started fishing in the murky waters of anti-Semitism. They harbour xenophobic ideas. Which is only natural when, instead of letting these Islamic and Arab countries move towards secure regimes and enjoy social cohesion and birth control, we throw them into the conflagration of the Middle East. And what will the upshot be? Will it be less immigration, fewer Maghreb nationals and fewer opportunities for certain parties to talk of xenophobia?</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to close, Mr President, by saying that we have a duty to intervene at once in the Middle East in order to protect the Palestinians, in order to protect Israel from anti-Semitism and in order to protect the very future of democracy in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to preface them by saying that I feel a sense of obligation to Israel, both to its people and to the state itself. That being understood, I want to ask my Israeli friends this: What will you have achieved if, as you are expected to do shortly, you withdraw your tanks from the Palestinian territories after killing many Palestinians, suspected assassins, murderers and potential murderers, after having destroyed many homes and schools, and wrecked the structure of the Palestinian Authority? Has that brought you even one millimetre closer to peace and security? Or is it not rather to be feared that your actions have begotten new hatred a thousand times over, a hatred that will explode at the next opportunity, be it in the Middle East or perhaps even here in Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">I also want that question addressed to us ourselves, however. Have we really done enough to give us the right to make all the self-righteous demands of Israel that we hear in this House? Did those who went to Jenin also go to Jaffa, to meet the people who, at the feast of Passover, lost members of their families in the cruellest of ways when a bomb reduced everything to blood and broken bits? Is it not the case that Israel had already, and for many years, been a victim of Palestinian terrorism, long before Ariel Sharon had his crazy idea of marching onto Temple Mount as a provocation? Was what we did on such occasions enough? Is what we always do on such occasions enough? Adopting an urgent motion condemning terrorism whilst well aware that not one Palestinian would, even for a second, consider himself bound by it? Have we, then, done enough in this situation?</p>
<p class="contents">Is it not the case that Arafat was never willing – and was probably not even in a position – to put a stop to terrorism? How do we justify the way we make substantial amounts of money available to the Palestinian Authority on a monthly basis? Do you know what happens to this money, Commissioner Schreyer? Have you ever checked up on it? Can you give Parliament evidence of it? How has the Commission responded to the documents that provide evidence to justify the suspicion that Arafat himself is involved in the financing of terrorism?</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, a major German newspaper carried a report on a bloody terrorist attack in Jerusalem four years ago – long before the second intifada – which cost many innocent people their lives or their health. It describes how the pictures of the terrorists of that time are venerated in Palestinian schools as the images of heroes. Have we really done enough to contain the terrorism that is striking Israel now, as it has done for years? That is why I do not believe that it is enough to demand that the Israelis withdraw. There is no doubt that they have to do that, but that alone will not secure peace. It is not enough to condemn Palestinian terrorism while doing nothing more than deliver declarations on paper. There are many indications that the parties will not be in a position to free themselves from their mutual hatred, and that an international force will have to be deployed there. The European Union, too, must be an advocate for that.</p>

I am referring to the utterly despicable attacks on Jewish synagogues and citizens in Europe under the pretext of the Middle East conflict. The authorities should warn public opinion most emphatically and must take a tough stance against the perpetrators. However, this also applies to verbal, xenophobic attacks by the extreme right in Europe on migrant fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The exploitation of fear and turning others into scapegoats is, as we have seen in the previous century, a cancerous growth in our society. Only by building a future step-by-step and by joining forces, with due respect for everyone, irrespective of creed or race, can viable prospects emerge. This applies to Europe and the Middle East alike.</p>
<p class="contents">The announcement that Mr Solana and Mr Moretinos are on their way to meet Mr Sharon and Mr Arafat is hopefully a minor breakthrough. It is high time that Europe acted in a more united manner and more effectively than it has done so far. The European Parliament has asked for maximum pressure to be exerted, for a suspension of the Association Agreement and for a willingness, in the event of a ceasefire, to contribute immediately to the monitoring and intervention force which would help develop the Palestinian Authority and help separate the warring factions.</p>
<p class="contents">The pressing question is: at the level of the European Council, have the necessary preparations been made, as stipulated in the Association Agreement, to convene the Council to discuss the violations of that Agreement with Israel? Has the Council started the internal preparations for a contribution to the UN’s monitoring and intervention force, or have the words still not been backed up by action?</p>
<p class="contents">At the risk of labouring the obvious, this is not about Europe versus the US. We need each other, as well as Russia and the Arab countries, in order to reach a genuine prospect of peace. As Yossi Beilin, the architect of the Oslo agreements which now seem to have been destroyed by Sharon, told me this week: ‘A ceasefire and an international peace force only make sense if the parties are forced to actually work on a political solution and to negotiate.’ We are both of the opinion that all the necessary ingredients are there.</p>
<p class="contents">It may be true that in the darkest hour, when things are at their worst, mutual bloodshed seems to go on forever and extreme strategies appear to be never-ending, only serious negotiations can offer a true way out. The pressure exerted by a self-aware, strong and united Europe would serve this purpose. This is the best and most credible way of getting the United States on our side and making a contribution to an effective second Madrid Summit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The violence and the killing must stop. Together with the United States, the EU can play an important role in the process of achieving a ceasefire, together with peace and reconciliation. Europe’s decision-makers must be able to create a broadly based confidence in the EU as a partner in the Middle East. That is not the situation at present, my friends. Up until now, a balanced approach has been demanded, able to resolve conflicts and create a climate for coexistence, not a climate of isolation or exclusion for any party.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, more and more people, especially in this House, are talking about trade sanctions. Are trade sanctions against Israel, and thus indirectly against Palestine too, really the best way of preparing the way for peace? Is isolating Israel a fruitful path to go down if the EU is to be able to acquire a more significant role in the region? I do not think so.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to say that the comparison which Mr Gahrton has just made between Israel and the policy of apartheid in South Africa is appalling. Experience of previous international sanctions should give pause for reflection. Look at Cuba. Look at Iraq. Have Castro and Saddam Hussein been weakened? Hardly. Who is it who have to suffer? It is not Ariel Sharon. Instead, it is the farm workers and orchard labourers who cultivate fruit and wine.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a few direct questions for you, Minister. I have heard that, at the last Council meeting in Luxembourg, the Swedish Foreign Minister talked in terms of the EU’s needing to prepare itself for introducing trade sanctions against Israel. Is this information correct? Which countries can conceive of trade sanctions as a method? I have also received information to suggest that the Swedish Government is preparing to introduce trade sanctions. Is the same thing happening in other countries?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Minister, I want to ask what you personally think about trade sanctions and threats to isolate Israel. Is that a path which you personally believe the EU should go down? You said that all alternatives are open? What do you mean by that? Do you mean that you too are prepared to isolate Israel? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead, I shall focus on other aspects of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, which is of such great importance.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of the action plan between the European Union and the twelve States bordering the Mediterranean is a step forwards in the much-needed creation of a Mediterranean free trade area, which I would call a genuine form of discreet enlargement towards the South.</p>
<p class="contents">In formalising this project, we must ensure that criteria of sustainability and ecological, economic and social benefit for both sides of the Mediterranean are taken into account in sectors such as agriculture. In this process it is a matter of priority to foster mutual knowledge and cultural ties between peoples. We saw that the first action to be taken when the tanks entered the refugee camps was to ban the media. For this reason, we must promote joint projects such as a Euro-Mediterranean television service that would maintain stations in all the States bordering the Mediterranean, and which would broadcast in all of the region’s languages and provide live transparency for this action plan and others.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, let us learn the lesson of what happened in Jenin. We must prevent any repetition of these episodes and be prepared to address and resolve issues as explosive as this one – or as in the case of the Western Sahara, to which no one in this Chamber has referred – and which are extremely important to the creation of an Arab Maghreb union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At Valencia, we attempted, at last, to give a sign that the Union is present, to make it clear that it is now time for action, that the time has passed for argument and declarations.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe should be making increasing efforts to bring peace to the Middle East, but so far it has failed in its task. The Middle East crisis is in danger of sparking off localised crises throughout the Mediterranean area and of breeding further terrorism, not least by providing conditions conducive to the recruitment of terrorists. Therefore, Europe must certainly adopt a position which gives it a strong, an increasingly strong, presence but which is also a position of neutrality between the two parties in conflict. I did not support the outcome of Parliament’s vote on the resolution in Strasbourg, for it was weighted against Israel rather than adopting a position of neutrality between the parties. The Palestinians have the right to an independent State but Israel’s right to security must be recognised too. Mr Arafat must stop the suicide bombers, who are all too often children, and Mr Sharon must withdraw his troops from the occupied territories with due regard for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">What path, then, can we follow to give Europe a major role? First of all, we must set up a negotiating table involving the European Union, of course, the United States, Russia, the Arab League, the Palestinian Authority and Israel. Italy has declared its willingness to host a peace conference. Then, we must immediately set in motion a humanitarian aid programme and food aid for the Palestinian people and, clearly, even if Israel is against the idea, start to think seriously about sending an intervention force to separate the two parties in conflict until the situation has calmed down. Lastly, we must set in motion a Marshall Plan for the reconstruction of infrastructures in the tragically war-torn Palestinian territory.</p>
<p class="contents">We must prevent the Middle East crisis from sparking off a fresh wave of anti-Semitism in Europe. Our – quite legitimate – criticism of Israel must not – must never – cause us to overlook the attacks perpetrated in our Union on Jewish synagogues and cemeteries. In this context, we must remember what happened at the cemetery in Strasbourg. Woe betide us if we jeopardise the freedom of religious expression of our fellow citizens of the Jewish religion! That is why it is important not to leave room in politics for the extremist movements which raise their heads every now and again, as has happened in France and in Germany. That is why we must all genuinely strive to build a new Europe with a single foreign and security policy, an influential Europe which is the Europe of inclusiveness and subsidiarity. This Europe will win through, for the European citizens are on our side, on the side of peace and tolerance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Rossa (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I want to welcome Commissioner Patten´s statement today. It was a model statement which was at once calm and rational and strong and balanced, outlining the situation as it exists and the steps that are necessary on all sides to create a sustainable peace in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">I am puzzled by the Council's excessive caution. I say 'excessive' caution. I am not arguing against caution, but the Council expressed views today which were not balanced. I have also been to Jenin and seen the destruction there, the destruction of homes and of people's lives, the burying of people in the rubble of their own homes. I would like to suggest one practical thing here today. What we were asked for was heavy equipment to enable the people in Jenin to dig out the bodies that are still there. There was no heavy equipment when we were there yesterday. I appeal for urgent aid in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a responsibility as parliamentarians to avoid extreme language and extreme solutions. We need to demonstrate that the Sharon extremism will not bring security to the Israeli State, nor will Palestinian suicide bombers bring a Palestinian State into existence. Only through slow and painful negotiations with compromises can that occur, only then can the Israelis and Palestinians be secure in their own states.</p>
<p class="contents">I met with ambassadors in Tel Aviv, moved on to Jerusalem to meet Israeli peace groups and then on to Jenin to talk to the residents there. The objective of the Sharon Government at this point in time is the destruction of any possibility of a Palestinian State. I have no doubt about that at all. Europe, therefore, must bring pressure to bear on Sharon and his government to see that this is not a viable option for Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the most important and effective weapon we have is the Association Agreement. What we are calling for is the suspension of that agreement, not a suspension of all contact with Israel, but a suspension of the preferential arrangements that Europe has with Israel so that at least it will begin to recognise that we are prepared to take action. It is a moderate approach which can be stepped up or cancelled when progress is made by Israel in withdrawing her troops from the Palestinian area, giving free access to humanitarian aid and free access to the United Nations mission in Jenin and elsewhere. There are many other conditions we could perhaps apply. There is no problem about an exit strategy. We simply state what our conditions are and what is necessary in order to begin talks under the quartet based on Oslo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I do wish to reiterate what other Members of this House have said, however. I consider it to be a success that the summit took place in such difficult circumstances; it is a success that it was attended by twenty-five of the twenty-seven Members who were invited; it was a success that a joint action plan was agreed on by consensus and I consider it to have been a success that a conclusion was reached – explained better than I can by Commissioner Patten: in order to speed up the Barcelona Process, the peace process in the Middle East must be speeded up but there will be no stable peace in the Middle East unless it is achieved within a framework of stability, development and cooperation such as the framework put forward in Barcelona.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I am not going to repeat any of the solutions that have been put forward for the Middle East. There clearly needs to be an end to the killings that we have condemned here so rigorously and with such sadness, and political dialogue must be re-established on the basis of international law. The President-in-Office of the Council has referred to all the statements detailing how this needs to be undertaken, from the Madrid Conference or the Oslo process to the United Nations resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">What is hard to explain to our voters, to the media or to our visitors is how the European Union, which is Israel’s largest trading partner and the main donor to the Palestinian Authority, is unable to do any more than it is currently doing. I agree that it was very positive that our positions were reaffirmed in Valencia. I also agree that our mission to the Middle East is a success, particularly because it is repairing the damage suffered by the previous mission but, I repeat, we will have to explain to our voters what we are going to do, how we are going to do it and when we are going to do it, as long as it is soon.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Barcelona Process, the action plan starts by acknowledging that what is needed is literally ‘momentum’, which simply means accepting that the 1995 Barcelona Process has made slower progress than originally expected and, of course, much slower progress than the needs we have been discussing here require, when we talk about the Mediterranean as a strategic border, when we talk about the 45 million new jobs that must be created on the southern shore of the Mediterranean in order to maintain current levels of unemployment. I repeat that in Valencia it was acknowledged that there is a gap – actually an enormous distance – between what we want to achieve, that is, what is needed, and what we are going to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that the fight against terrorism and the fight against drugs were discussed. I welcome the fact that the idea of establishing a free trade area by 2010 was reaffirmed, but I wish to emphasise that in order for there to be a free trade area, there must be goods to trade. We therefore need to be more effective and more flexible in our approach to the MEDA Plan, in economic cooperation, and to be less hesitant about setting up the Euro-Mediterranean Bank. Does this Parliament want such a bank? Do our partners in the southern Mediterranean want this? Do certain members of the Council? The Spanish Presidency wants it, of course; let us also convince everyone else that it is much needed.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, I wish to emphasise that a foundation working for multicultural dialogue is absolutely crucial. It is impossible, however, to create a foundation without financial support. Without financial support there can be neither a foundation nor spiritual exercises, however modest they may be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this, I must congratulate Mr Piqué, who directed all the meetings and troikas with truly rare neutrality and balance, given the difficulties of the political situation.</p>
<p class="contents">What are we, as the European Union, going to propose? We must propose a path which we all unequivocally support; we must propose reinvigoration of the Barcelona Process, striving to bring about lasting change; we must propose a Parliamentary Assembly to monitor the initiatives undertaken; we must propose a new dialogue between the two shores of the Mediterranean and further consolidate it with regard to humanitarian issues, justice and combating terrorism. Moreover, there is a need for our proposals to be implemented practically without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of the Bank, relations of closer cooperation and association relations are all tangible projects which show the European Union to be the ideal partner for the other shore of the Mediterranean. The peace process and the current conflict between Israel and the Palestinian world are threats to these projects. However, if, as the European Union, we do not have the courage to dare to go further, using all the means available to us and taking advantage of the hopes that are placed in us, then we will in all probability waste an opportunity that is historic, not least in terms of the European project which is in the minds and hearts of many of us and which is taking shape in the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards practical action, I am taking up the call made again this morning by the Supreme Pontiff. I and Mr Mario Mauro are following the developments of the conflict in the holy places of Jesus’ birth through direct contact with Fr. Giacomo Bini, the Minister General of the Order of Friars Minor. Well then, the situation will soon be beyond humanitarian aid. The monks and sisters who live in the religious community of Bethlehem cannot be considered hostages. It is a symbolic fact of extreme importance: the attention of the whole world is focused on what is happening in the place where Jesus Christ, the bearer of peace to all men, was born. Millions of men and women are awaiting an intervention that will defeat the designs and actions of death. We call upon Parliament, upon you, Mr President, upon the Commission, upon the President-in-Office of the Council and upon Mr Piqué, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to take practical action to bring this affair nearer to a conclusion. I feel that it would be a genuine sign of hope and a promise of stability for the future of this tragically war-torn Holy Land.</p>

I am, however, somewhat concerned at the motivation underlying attempts by Israel to delay the investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">Israel claims that its invasion of Jenin and other areas was an attempt to destroy the Palestinian terrorist infrastructure. However, serious allegations have been made that the Israeli defence forces were involved in extra-judicial executions and the use of human shields. If these prove to be true, then Israel itself and its army are as guilty of acts of terrorism as those who plan, support and carry out suicide bombings.</p>
<p class="contents">When he was defence Minister, Ariel Sharon masterminded the “Operation Peace for Galilee” invasion in 1982. His objective then he claimed was: “to eradicate the Palestinian terrorist threat in Lebanon”. This resulted in the massacre of 800 Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. A subsequent Israeli commission of enquiry concluded that he bore responsibility, as they put it “ having disregarded the danger of acts of vengeance”</p>
<p class="contents">Are we seeing history repeat itself?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sharon must take personal responsibility for what has happened in Jenin and elsewhere on the West Bank. It is a consequence of his policies, his prejudices and his hatred of Yasser Arafat. If the UN team concludes that war crimes have indeed occurred, then the international community must take action including referring the matter to the International War Crimes Tribunal.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sharon does a grave disservice to the people of Israel. Single-handedly he has caused his country’s political isolation. Furthermore, he has fed the hatreds that have resulted in the escalation of anti-Semitic activity which I deplore.</p>
<p class="contents">He humiliated the US Government during Colin Powell’s recent visit to the Middle East. Perhaps, however, this will have a positive effect and lead to a reassessment of US policy in this area and encourage them to abandon their one sided approach of unequivocal support for Israel and instead to work with the EU and others for a balanced, peaceful resolution to this terrible conflict which has already cost too many lives.</p>

They wish to have a country with secure borders and normal diplomatic relations with all its Arab neighbours. How can we help extinguish the fire that has devastated Palestine and reduced the people to a life of humiliation, fear and deprivation of the basic amenities of life?</p>
<p class="contents">Jewish people, Muslims and Christian Palestinians worked and lived together for centuries before Israel was established. The Jewish people dreamt about their own country and they got it, and rightly so. The Palestinians, both Muslims and Christians, dream and wish to have their country as well and they will not rest until they have a secure and viable state based on a just and fair settlement. How can the EU help?</p>
<p class="contents">Let us stop being polite and politically correct. To my delight today is the first time in my two and a half years as an MEP that I have heard Members of this House address this topic with such confidence. We have been gagged for all this time. Let us spell out what is needed for such a fair and just settlement; things that we all believe in but are too afraid to say. Firstly, Israel must have the right to exist with a secure border and it must be fully recognised as a state by all its neighbours. Secondly, Israel must respect international law and its own national laws, as well UN Security Council resolutions. Thirdly, Israel must accept neutral international observers under UN sponsorship to facilitate a ceasefire.</p>
<p class="contents">Ordinary people, Jews, Muslims and Christians, are fed up with their politicians. They want peace now. Let us help them with courage and confidence and say clearly what most of us privately believe, that for Palestine to be a viable state, to allow that state to take back the millions of refugees, there is only one border and that is the border as it was before 1967. That is what Israel has to pull back to. Until that happens there will be no peace in the Middle East and that brings the terror, fear and difficulties that we now see in the European Union.</p>

We in the Christian Democratic Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats voted against. The truth is the only way to genuine peace, reconciliation and coexistence.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who tabled the resolution chose to criticise the State of Israel on twelve occasions, but the Palestinians and the Palestinian Authority on only three occasions. Neither Hamas nor Islamic Jihad, labelled as terrorist organisations by the United States and the EU, were mentioned or criticised in the European Parliament’s resolution. Nor was there any mention of the groups designated as terrorists by the United States, namely Hezbollah and the Al-Aqsa Brigades.</p>
<p class="contents">The last-named group constitutes the military wing of Yasser Arafat’s Fatah movement and is responsible for the suicide bombing in Jerusalem on 12 April in which six Israeli civilians were killed.</p>
<p class="contents">Only three speakers made any specific mention at all of these terrorist groups during the two-hour plenary debate in Strasbourg on 10 April. Nonetheless, everyone knows that these men associated with violence and suicide bombings – these people who are happy to see sons or daughters sent to kill other people and who receive money from Iraq for the purpose – are not at all prepared to recognise the State of Israel’s right to exist in the area. I say to the President and to the Spanish Presidency that these terrorist groups are a part of everyday life in the Middle East. How are we to deal with their existence?</p>
<p class="contents">The PPE-DE Group chose to vote against last time because we feel that the EU and the European Parliament are becoming less and less relevant to the parties. The debate in this House reveals a type of one-sidedness which means that we are not taken seriously by either party to this deeply tragic and bloody conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">The time should be past when the European Parliament adopts politically lightweight resolutions simply in order to achieve what, from an objective point of view, is an impossible consensus across the whole political spectrum, from left-wing socialists and communists by way of social democrats to green liberals and Christian democrats, Eurosceptics and members of the radical right. The time has come for the EU to become relevant to both parties in the Middle East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that it is a strong Europe, a Europe of the future, that is achieving this, and I believe that institutional cooperation and cooperation between other countries are aspects that should be highlighted.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Euro-Mediterranean Conference, I should like to furthermore offer my congratulations on the excellent idea of introducing – or of trying to introduce – solutions on a Mediterranean scale. One of the failings of the MEDA Plan, one of the causes of the delay in incorporating the countries of the Mediterranean into European policy, or into the offer that we are making, is the need for these to be accepted according to their own logic, to their own scale and with a new sensitivity and a new way of addressing problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Along the same lines, I should like to also express my satisfaction that culture, tourism, education, integration between peoples and dialogue were addressed as issues of the utmost priority. In my view, to culture, education, tourism and cultural dialogue we can add sustainable development and globalisation, the benefits of which also have an effect in the country that provides these and I think that this is an example of successful coexistence between a world that is in the process of modernising itself and a world that still needs to become part of the change, but which has a great history of its own.</p>
<p class="contents">As Vice-Chairman of the Delegation for Relations with Israel, I should also like to say something about the conflict in the Middle East: our position – my position – is quite clear and we have stated it in other forums. We have now reached a time when institutional positions must be adopted. It is true that we can all express our regret – and I do so now – at Palestinian terrorism, at the disproportionate response of Israel, and at the intolerable situation that currently exists. Furthermore we, with a European sensitivity and with our history of peace and democracy and our rules of the game, cannot accept that humanitarian assistance is not being provided and we must call for this loud and clear.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not the time, however, for the Members of this House or even the delegations or the groups, to make statements in isolation. This is the time to strengthen European cohesion, to help Europe to develop a single vision, an institutional position of the Presidency, the Council, the Commission and Parliament, because we are deciding on the future of an entire region and the problem does not just concern the present, but also the future. Therefore, I now clearly state my support for peace, but for a peace that must be accompanied with very clear and solid positions, on which we are all united, not at a personal or emotional level, but for the sake of reaching an objective, consistent and lasting solution, and in which we bear in mind that our obligation is to ensure that there is peace, but also to look after the future and to look after this Mediterranean area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The other major weapon which is, on the other hand, effective and non-violent – the weapon of the law of the economy, of aid to developing countries, of aid to the poorest communities – has certainly not been used enough, and this is because it has even, on some occasions, been rejected in the dialogue between the countries who were to receive assistance and the assisting countries. The response from this House must clearly, once again, be ‘No’ to weapons and ‘No’ to suicide bomb attacks, but also ‘No’ to tanks and ‘No’ to retaliation.</p>
<p class="contents">Well then, what is the formula on which peace in the region should be based? Once again, it is a formula as old as the hills. Governments acting cooperatively within the framework of shared institutions and governments acting individually. The Italian Government has developed a plan, a proposal for economic aid – a sort of Marshall plan as it has been called, with good reason in my opinion, although there has been criticism of this – to the poorest country, Palestine. This is an important weapon which has not been used at all in recent years, although many States set aside considerable sums to help the peoples of the Middle East who were in most need of such assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">What do I find most disturbing? I think it is the conditions of degradation in which countless young people live in the refugee camps in Palestine from the moment they are born to the age at which they can start work. These camps are extremely dangerous breeding grounds. In my opinion, certain Arab governments have failed to give their brothers sufficient help: on the contrary, they have done nothing but incite them and tolerated movements within these countries which have led to the consequences we have witnessed recently.</p>
<p class="contents">Mention must be made of the United Nations, which has certainly played a role which has been exhausting, not least, and important but inadequate and, in any case, ineffective; an intervention force was needed and it has been called for on many occasions. In my opinion, reasoning, experience and history teach us how an intervention force can be employed effectively in this modern age, and yet no such force has been deployed.</p>
<p class="contents">What initiative can Europe, the European Union, pursue? It can reinforce the thrust of the UN initiatives, particularly the initiative to establish what could be an intervention force separating the two opposing nations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The only possible solution is one based on UN Resolutions 242, 338, 1397 and 1402, involving the acceptance of a two-state solution which will give security to the State of Israel and dignity to the Palestinians. This will involve an eventual total withdrawal from the occupied territories and a dismantling of all the illegal settlements.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not, however, lose sight of the fact that there is a huge convergence of international opinion as violence increases, which we need to build on. It must also be made clear that the right of return for Palestinians can only apply to the new state of Palestine, as otherwise the Jewish State of Israel's, security would be compromised. Compensation, however, will need to be considered for those whose properties were expropriated as a necessary prelude to a resumption of meaningful negotiations over a final political settlement.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, tragically, we have suicide bombers engaged in indiscriminate attacks upon Israeli civilians and, on the other hand, there is a tragic civilian loss of life on the Palestinian side, when Israel sends in its troops to root out those responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">I did not support the call for an immediate suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement as I felt this move to be too punitive and selective at this juncture. I did, however, agree to call for an emergency EU-Israel Association Council meeting to discuss the crisis. In particular, I felt, along with many of my colleagues, that the Palestinian authority, which receives EUR 120 million a year from the EU, should have done more to restrain the suicide bombers and Islamic terrorists. I call upon Chairman Arafat to condemn, regularly and in Arabic, the terrorist attacks, and recognise Israel's right to exist in peace behind its 1967 borders.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I call upon the Likud Party to remove all references in its manifesto to its claims that the West Bank is an integral and perpetual part of the State of Israel. Nevertheless, I am concerned at the excessive use of force by the army, the disregard of the Fourth Geneva Convention on the application of collective punishments to civilians and the ban on ambulance passage into Israel proper which affected wounded civilians, as well as fighters and terrorists, and which, I was glad to see, was lifted the following day.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that with the Two-State Solution the international community has now established the basis for a lasting and durable peace. We must all now seize upon this opportunity from the international community to implement this before we have a major Middle-Eastern war on our hands.</p>

I am also a candid friend of Israel. Those are two words: 'candid' and 'friend'; so let me be a candid friend to Israel first of all. Yes, Israel must accept that there has to be a Palestinian state in secure borders. Yes, Israel must withdraw from the territories which it has occupied these past few weeks. Yes, Israel must allow the investigation of what happened in Jenin to take place, provided that investigation is fair and balanced and takes a view which is objective to all sides. Yes, I say to the State of Israel that I am not entirely convinced that the action which it has taken these past few weeks will succeed in the object which it sets itself, because I fear it may have created more people who want to engage in suicide missions. So there I am, the candid friend to the State of Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">But as a friend of Israel, I am also entitled in this Parliament to speak up for it. I say to this House that it has to understand that what Israel has suffered these past months, the murder of 418 innocent men, women and children, is almost too much for any democratic state to have to bear. What is Israel expected to do about that almost daily assault on its innocent citizens? What is Israel expected to do when it is surrounded by countries who do not even, to this day, accept its right to exist?</p>
<p class="contents">I support the Saudi peace plan, but it is a shocking comment that it has taken nearly 53 years for some Arab states to come forward with a plan which actually recognises the State of Israel. Israel, too, must face a situation with Yasser Arafat, where he not only does nothing to prevent the terrorist actions taking place, but there is the strongest possible evidence that he is actually complicit in what has happened. That is unacceptable in a partner with whom any state, any government is expected to negotiate.</p>
<p class="contents">I say to this Parliament that after the events of September 11, we took a view in the civilised world that terrorism was indivisible. Yes, people had rights, but terrorism was unacceptable, there was no such thing as a good terrorist. We must keep that proposal solid, because if we fail, if we say terrorism is OK if it is in the Middle East, but not if it is in the United States or Europe, then we are making a mistake for which we will suffer.</p>
<p class="contents">The way towards peace and the way for Europe to contribute towards peace is to use its influence in the area, particularly on the Palestinians, and to say to them, yes, there should be a Palestinian state, yes, there should be a State of Israel, but both must have security throughout the years to come.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Piqué i Camps,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I should like to thank all those who have spoken for their opinions and their contributions which mean that I do not now have to speak for too long myself, since all possible arguments from all points of view have been put forward, and I must say that many of them, furthermore, were made in a similar vein and in almost identical words. I repeat, then, that I wish to thank all the speakers and I should now like to focus my answer on two aspects:</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the potential relationship between the Barcelona Process and the situation in the Middle East. Despite the gravity of the current situation, peace will one day be achieved in the Middle East, and since this is the case – and we all hope that peace will be achieved sooner rather than later – the Barcelona Process will prove its full potential and effectiveness and at that moment, furthermore, it will prove that it is more necessary than ever. A stable peace can only be achieved on the basis of prosperity, cooperation, economic integration, mobility between the peoples concerned, the exchange of ideas, exchanges between educational systems, the exchange of peoples, and all that the Barcelona Process entails, in its political, economic, cultural and social aspects, is, therefore, of extreme importance in this regard. Consequently, I deduce from today’s debate that we all agree on the need to persevere with the will that we demonstrated in Valencia to revitalise the Barcelona Process.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the second issue I wish to address, which is specific to the situation in the Middle East, many of the honourable Members have mentioned the policy of Mr Sharon, the current Prime Minister of Israel. I should like to remind you that Mr Sharon has been Prime Minister for just over a year, not even two years, and that he was elected Prime Minister because he reflects the will of Israeli society. I should also like to remind you that the government of Mr Sharon is a government of national unity in which the Labour Party and various other parties are represented, and therefore, when we talk about the policy of Mr Sharon – these things should not be forgotten – we are actually talking about the policy of many others besides him. This is a policy accepted by all the members of his government, because, otherwise, they would have resigned or they would have been removed if they voiced different opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">We very often fall into the trap of excessively attributing the causes of the conflict to individuals. The conflict in the Middle East, in its most modern incarnation, started over fifty years ago, and Mr Sharon was not around at that time. I should like to remind you that the second intifada started before Mr Sharon became Prime Minister. Therefore, we must bear all of this in mind and get to the roots of the conflict. It is true, however, that there are specific policies that are especially worthy of criticism and that should be rejected, and as such have been roundly condemned by both Commissioner Patten and myself, not only today but also on many other occasions. The problem has not been caused solely by specific individuals, however, but by something much more profound, and when a conflict lasts for such a long time, with its various shifts of balance, it is because there is no majority will for peace on either side; because there is no sincerity or honesty in the desire for peace expressed by either side; because, when some express their desire for peace, but in their hearts are hoping for the destruction of the State of Israel, they do not want peace, and because when others say that they want peace, but in their hearts what they really want is to make the myth of a greater Israel a reality and, therefore, the consolidation of a State of Israel on the current occupied territories, they do not really want peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Since these two attitudes stem from the historical aspirations of both sides, and since these historical aspirations are not compatible with one another, until there is an explicit renunciation, which is sincere and honest, of these historical aspirations, there will be no peace however much we attempt to impose sanctions, and however much the international community does all that it can. It is, furthermore, in this context that we must place the actions of the international community, because our role is especially clear now, and consists of convincing both sides that Israel must issue a sincere and honest renunciation of increasing its territories on the basis of the occupation and the Palestinians and the entire Arab world must issue a sincere and honest renunciation of the destruction of Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">If this were achieved, we would then have a completely solid foundation on which to build effectively. Our task is one of persuasion. I am far from sure that this task should be carried out on the basis of sanctions. It must be a task of genuine persuasion, which reaches the political leaders and the general public of both sides. Because the Israeli public, which has now voted – just over a year ago – for Mr Sharon, previously voted for Mr Barak in order for him to achieve peace, and before that, for Mr Netanyahu, and before him, five or six years ago, for Mr Rabin.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, therefore, prospects for peace, and this is why we must pursue the approach of cooperation; this is why it is so important that we work together with the United States, with Russia and with the United Nations, and when the opportunity arises to act with a degree of <span class="italic">dilettantism,</span> for Europe to have an independent voice, which sets us apart from the United States, I think that we have to be extremely prudent. I am not implying that we should support every position adopted by the United States. What I am saying is that we should act together, because this is extremely important and, if you read the Madrid Declaration carefully, it states what the European Union has been saying for a long time, and it is other countries, including, to a large extent, the United States, that have come around to the positions of the European Union. I take great satisfaction from this, and we shall also pursue this policy because I believe it is absolutely crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this context of the international community, all working together, that it makes sense to talk about observers, that it makes sense to talk about peacekeeping forces, because, otherwise, these things would not be feasible; and that is when it makes sense for us to talk about Marshall plans and economic contributions – which will have to be considerable, of course – and that we also talk about the full import of the rapprochement of the two peoples on the basis, amongst other things, of their educational systems<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">The<span class="italic"> </span>presence of the historical aspirations which I referred to earlier is clearly reflected in the educational content provided by both sides; the young people on each side have been trained not in conciliation or in peaceful coexistence, but in hate. We have, therefore, a great deal of work ahead of us but the way forward has been mapped out. We know what the final outcome must be and what we need to do is continue working in this direction.</p>

Mr Solana's successive replies to the repeated questions put by the newspaper journalist, who stressed that this contradicted everything we know about the Helsinki resolution, leave no room for error or misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="contents">The position taken by Mr Solana confirms the reading of the Communist Party of Greece, especially after the Helsinki Summit, that the process for Cyprus to accede to the European Union will split the island, legitimise the Turkish occupation and justify the 1974 invasion. And furthermore, Mr Solana demonstrated total contempt of the United Nations resolutions on Cyprus and international law in general in his statement.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask you to speak to the High Representative, Mr President, given that the position which he has expressed completely contradicts the decisions and resolutions passed by the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Last week, the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr de Miguel told the House that Mr Solana would be visiting Greece in order to put pressure on the Greek Government to accept the Constantinople text, or rather the Ankara text, drafted by Great Britain, Turkey and the United States, a text which contests the territorial integrity of Greece so that the European army can use NATO infrastructures in order to promote the so-called common European defence and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">That Turkey's demands are dictated by the United States goes without saying; unfortunately, the European Union is going along with them. I should like, Mr President, to denounce this pressure being exerted on the Greek Government and warn the House that, if the Greek Government, which is digging in its heels and refusing to accept the text under pressure from the Greek people; if the Greek Government makes the concessions being asked of it by the Fourteen and Mr Solana, there will be serious problems in Greece where, as I have said, the Greek people are unwavering and united in their opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask you to take note of our objection, Mr President, and to do whatever you can to put a stop to this unacceptable pressure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
