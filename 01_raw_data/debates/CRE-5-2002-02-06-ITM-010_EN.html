<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Inhuman conditions in Egyptian prisons</span></p>
<p class="contents">Since 1989, Costas Kastanias has been serving a life sentence with hard labour in maximum security prisons in Egypt in connection with the case of the motor boat, the 'Thanasis'. He is the sole survivor after the other two Greeks convicted and imprisoned in the same case died under the harsh and inhuman conditions in Egyptian prisons. The last person involved in the case to die, Tasos Kontoyannis, did so under controversial circumstances. Questions concerning this case have already been put to the Council in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">There is intense public concern about this case in Greece owing to the inhuman conditions in Egyptian prisons ( 3 by 4 metre cells housing 20 people) and the fact that Costas Kastanias' health has been irreparably damaged. Will the Council therefore say whether it will exert its influence to enable Mr Kastanias to serve the remainder of his sentence in Greek prisons? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to Mr Alavanos’ oral question, I would like to state that the Council has not had the opportunity to study the matter to which the honourable Member refers. This is an issue which essentially falls within the competence of the Member States, and which Greece is dealing with directly with the Egyptian authorities. There also appears to be a bilateral agreement between Egypt and Greece on the exchange of prisoners, which aims to enable prisoners to complete their sentence in their country of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council knows that conditions in Egyptian prisons can be harsh. Spain also knows this to be true, for its own part and as a Member State of the European Union, because it also has problems with Spanish prisoners in Egyptian prisons.</p>
<p class="contents">Although financial cooperation under the Association Agreement between the EU and Egypt does not directly deal with the issue of the situation in prisons, these two instruments can serve to promote awareness of the conditions in detention centres and the treatment of prisoners. Other Member States have in fact used it to this end.</p>
<p class="contents">The Association Agreement, which was signed on 25 June 2001 in Luxembourg, and which has still not entered into force because some of the ratification instruments have yet to be put in place, establishes respect for human rights as one of its essential features.</p>
<p class="contents">The protection of detained or imprisoned persons features in the international human rights instruments and the National Indicative Programme for Egypt for 2000 to 2004, which comprises a financial package worth EUR 351 million and also provides support for the development of civil society, education and for increasing social protection and the rights of the most disadvantaged and marginalised groups in Egyptian society.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, in effect, the Council should use the instruments provided by this Association Agreement to put pressure on Egypt, to become more involved with the fate of EU prisoners in Egyptian prisons, but, naturally, we cannot rely on an instrument that will allow this to take place when it is not ratified and when the ratification instruments are not even in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I think that it is a good time to call upon Member States to ensure that this and other Mediterranean agreements that are awaiting ratification are ratified as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Twenty prisoners are kept in cells measuring 3 by 4 metres. I call on the Minister, on behalf of this prisoner suffering a living death and on behalf of any Spaniards or other Community citizens, to intervene politically with the Egyptian authorities so that they can serve out their sentences in prisons in the Member States of the European Union. Otherwise, Minister, if they get buried in bureaucracy or under the numerous other demands on our attention, we shall end up as accomplices.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Binding nature of Article 19(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in any agreement between the EU and the USA on extradition</span></p>
<p class="contents">According to media reports, Spain (which is to take over the Council Presidency on 1 January 2002) has proposed a comprehensive EU-USA pact on extradition.</p>
<p class="contents">The author of this question takes the view that the essential cooperation between the EU and the USA in the fight against terrorism must be based scrupulously on observation of the basic principles and values of a constitutional state. For the EU Member States, these values include abolition of the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason the author of this question – in line with the main human rights organisations – considers that any future agreement between the EU and the USA must observe the spirit and the letter of Article 19 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, since the death penalty remains in force in the USA and, furthermore, military tribunals are to be set up.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Council undertake to regard Article 19(2) of the Charter of Fundamental rights as fully binding in any agreement with the USA on extradition? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union supports the Indian proposal for drawing up, within the United Nations, a general convention against international terrorism, which should enhance the impact of the measures taken over the last 25 years under the auspices of the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the context of its own programme, the Presidency considered it vitally important to create a common area in which the fight against any form of crime, and its more serious forms in particular, such as terrorism, the trafficking in human beings, drug trafficking and money laundering, is undertaken with criteria for regulation and by means of common activities in which all Member States should participate. In this context, the Presidency proposes that objectives as important as the European arrest warrant and the abolition of formal extradition procedures should be defined.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency also thinks that strengthening relations between the European Union and the United States is highly important and a matter of priority, specifically within the framework of judicial cooperation in criminal matters within the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council would like to take this opportunity to state that the question of the status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union must be resolved within the framework of the debate on the future of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council, at its meeting in Laeken on 14 and 15 December 2001, entrusted a Convention with the task of responding to any issues that might arise during this debate, especially with regard to whether the Charter of Fundamental Rights should be integrated into the basic Treaty and to the issue of the European Community’s signing up to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Without prejudging the answer to this question, the Council would like, all the same, to remind you that Article 6(2) of the Treaty on European Union states that “the Union will respect fundamental freedoms in compliance with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, signed in Rome on 4 November 1950”.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Article 3 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as deduced from the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, allows it to be established that no-one can be removed, expelled or extradited to a State in which they could be subject to the death penalty, to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are all aware that the necessary cooperation between democracies, and therefore between the European Union and the United States, in the fight against terrorism, is taking place, but this cannot act as an obstacle to the European Union’s vigorously defending the application of its inherent values: in this case, its defence of the abolition of the death penalty. Regrettably, in the United States, as we all know, the death penalty is still in force.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also aware that the Convention will deal with the integration of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the future European Constitution, but the Charter was also proclaimed by the Nice European Council and I believe that a proclamation is politically binding on those who proclaim it. In these terms, Mr President-in-Office, and taking up the reference you made to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, I ask you: will the European Union extradite any person accused of serious crimes, including terrorism, if there is a possibility that they would be condemned to death or executed in the United States? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 4 by Miguel Angel Martínez Martínez (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0958_EN.html">H-0958/01</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Revision of the common position on Cuba</span></p>
<p class="contents">At its meeting in Brussels on 6 and 7 December 2001 the ACP Council of Ministers adopted a resolution which reads as follows: ‘The ACP Council of Ministers…2. Calls on the European Union to translate this spirit [the entente which emerged during the recent (30 November) visit by the Community troika, as acknowledged in the first paragraph of the resolution] into a substantive revision of its common position on Cuba so as to treat Cuba in a fair and impartial manner; 3. Expresses the firm expectation that such revision of the EU’s common position will lead to Cuba’s accession to the ACP-EC Cotonou Agreement without any special or inequitable conditions whatsoever;…’.</p>
<p class="contents">What action is the Council of the European Union going to take in response to the ACP countries’ repeated request for the common position on Cuba to be revised and for Cuba to be allowed to accede to the Cotonou Agreement on the same terms as the other ACP countries? Has the Council already replied (or is it intending to reply) in any way to this request from the ACP Council of Ministers? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">de Miguel,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>The European Parliament is well aware of the dialogue between the European Union and Cuba, which was interrupted by the Cuban authorities when they cancelled the meeting with the EU troika that was scheduled for April 2000. The dialogue resumed on 1 and 2 December 2001 with the visit of the troika to Havana.</p>
<p class="contents">The resumption of dialogue is the result of a great deal of hard work by the Presidency, and on which the Council fully informed this House, in its November and December part-sessions in particular. The Council also had the opportunity to broach this subject at the meeting of the Joint ACP-EU Assembly in Brussels between 29 October and 1 November 2001. On that occasion, the Council stated, amongst other things, that it had never vetoed the inclusion of Cuba in the Cotonou Agreement, but that it was Cuba itself that had withdrawn its request to join in May 2000. The Council announced that it was ready to look into the matter once Cuba had officially put forward its application in accordance with the provisions laid down in the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">On 10 and 11 December, the General Affairs Council carried out its tenth evaluation of the EU Common Position on Cuba and considered that it would continue to be valid, and was the basis for European Union policy on Cuba.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council also considered it essential to pursue the dialogue that had been started in order to achieve tangible results, particularly with regard to future cooperation based on the respect for the democratic principles of human rights, fundamental freedoms and the Rule of Law. In this regard, the Council stated that it was waiting for significant signs from the Cuban Government that it was meeting the objectives of the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council also reiterated that EU objectives with regard to Cuba would still consist of promoting the transition to democratic pluralism and the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, sustainable economic recovery and an improvement in the standard of living of the Cuban people.</p>
<p class="contents">After a detailed study and various exchanges of information, the Council also noted serious shortcomings in the recognition and implementation of civil and political liberties, as well as the Cuban authorities’ refusal to consider the possibility of introducing reforms that would result in a political system based on these values.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of this, the Council also noted some positive signs, such as greater religious freedom and the non-application of the death penalty for the last two years, which takes us back to the previous question, concerning EU policy matters. Where it is not possible to abolish the death penalty, we need to at least reach at a situation in which it is not applied, as well as a considerable reduction in the number of political prisoners and an increase in the number of ratifications of United Nations Human Rights instruments. These are the positive signs. The Council was also pleased with the Cuban Government’s decision to agree to sign up to all United Nations Conventions against terrorism, adopted at the sitting of 4 October.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council also noted the importance that the European Union attaches to Cuba’s acceptance of the principles included in the United Nations Pact on Civil and Political Liberties and also of the agreement on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and expresses its wish for Cuba to sign both Pacts as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think it is important to point out that in the context of the tenth evaluation of the EU Common Position on Cuba, the German delegation made a statement in which it approves the Council’s conclusions, but calls on the Commission to produce a framework for cooperation that will be effective in the short term. The Council intends to evaluate its common position on Cuba within the next six months in light of developments during this period. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We believe that the common position is a negative thing, that everybody in Cuba, from the authorities to the opposition and the church perceives it to be negative, and that practically all the ambassadors from EU States in Havana consider it to be ineffectual and even counterproductive.</p>
<p class="contents">I certainly believe that this ratification of the common position has acted as a major stumbling block for the reopened process of dialogue that we, like you, wanted and looked upon with a great deal of hope.</p>
<p class="contents">My question is this: How will the Council respond to the repeated requests from the ACP countries for Cuba to be treated like all of the other countries and for it to be offered a guaranteed place as a signatory to the Cotonou agreement?</p>
<p class="contents">This is the question, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, with no disrespect, that we will be asking once again in Cape Town, in the Joint Assembly, in the presence of all the speakers from ACP countries, who have unanimously asked on numerous occasions for Cuba to be included as a member of their community.</p>

<p class="contents">The EU’s position on this issue has always been positive. As I told you, Mr Martínez, during the negotiations on the Cotonou agreement now in force, which were held in February 2000, if my memory serves me correctly, there was already a formal proposal by the ACP committee for Cuba to join when the new Convention was signed, with the total agreement of the Council of the European Union. To the surprise of the Council and the ACP countries, the Cuban delegate – at the time the Minister for Industry – disappeared from the meeting, and there was no way this matter could be formalised because Cuba was not present to give its consent.</p>
<p class="contents">When Cuba is ready to take on not only the benefits but also the obligations inherent to the Cotonou Convention, I guarantee that the Presidency of the Union and the Council will agree to it unreservedly.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be no lack of opportunity for this to happen. You mentioned the Joint Assembly, and I am talking about the ministerial meeting that is planned under the Spanish Presidency, between the ACP countries and the Ministers of the Council of the European Union, which will take place in Santo Domingo. This could be as good an occasion as any.</p>
<p class="contents">We are always willing to give a positive response, if and when Cuba can commit itself to accepting not only the benefits, but also the obligations inherent to the Cotonou Agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, what Cuba wants – as the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Pérez Roque, stated to the parliamentary delegation – is for the European Union to guarantee that if Cuba applies for entry into the ACP there will be no opposition on their part. Before they make their request to join they want a formal guarantee it will not be opposed.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Mr Martínez and myself have different perceptions of Cuba. I met members of the opposition, dissidents, who literally told me that those who are not part of the regime simply do not exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there was an amicable debate on the ambassadors’ assessments – at least in the meeting I attended – but I would like to know how the opinion of all the governments, with the slight reservation of Germany, can be contrary to the opinion which, according to Mr Martínez, was expressed by the ambassadors: these are keen to establish unconditional dialogue, whilst the governments are keen to uphold the common position and have been since as far back as December.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council if he agrees with me in his assessment that the Cuban government has a long way to go before it can fulfil the obligations of the democratic clause, both for an Association Agreement and to establish other links with the European Union, and I would like him to expand on the subject of economic freedom, fundamental rights – which was previously called formal democracy, that we now all share – and above all political pluralism, which are the prerequisites of the common position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In its sitting of 10 December, the Council expressed its support for the Petersberg Agreement, which defined the provisional agreements applicable in Afghanistan and repeated its promise to play an important role in the international effort to contribute to the reconstruction of the Afghan society and economy. On that occasion, the Ministers also stressed the particular need to promote the role of women within Afghan society.</p>
<p class="contents">During the ministerial conference on the reconstruction of Afghanistan which took place recently in Tokyo – on 20 and 22 January – the Presidency of the European Commission, in its capacity as co-presidents of the Union in the steering group for the reconstruction of Afghanistan, set out the Union’s position to the other international donors and the provisional Afghan authority.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union’s delegation stated, amongst other things, that the European Union’s assistance would be conditional upon all the Afghan groups unreservedly applying the spirit and the letter of the Petersburg Agreement, the objective of which is the creation of a broad-based, multi-ethnic, fully-representative government committed to acting in favour of sex equality and improving the situation of women.</p>
<p class="contents">Also in Tokyo, the European Union stressed the importance of Afghanistan taking on the work of emergency aid, rehabilitation and development, and that people of all regions, ethnic groups, and in particular women should participate in it. The Council will continue to closely monitor compliance with these criteria over the coming months and years.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, the Council wishes to point out that the European Union’s special representative in Afghanistan, Ambassador Kleiber, has begun his work in Kabul, assisted by a special representative of the Presidency, Ambassador López Nadal. The Council will take special care to ensure that women may participate, and participate fully, in building the country’s future. In this same context, the Council would also cite the reply given to oral question <a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0897_EN.html">H-0897/2001</a>. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The federal, regional or decentralised structure in a number of Member States has led them to include representatives of those regions or Länder in their delegations for meetings of the Council of Ministers, as provided for by the Treaty of European Union since the Maastricht reform ten years ago. Regional representatives have sometimes led the Member State delegation and, during the Belgian Presidency, have even chaired Council meetings dealing with matters falling within the competence of their regions.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in the case of other Member States such as Spain, which also have regions or autonomous communities with wide legislative powers, the central government prevents the regions or autonomous communities from taking part in their delegations for the various Council meetings, even when competence rests exclusively with the regions rather than the central government.</p>
<p class="contents">How does the Council view this state of affairs? Which Member States with a federal or autonomous political structure similar to Spain's include representatives of their nationalities and regions in their delegations?

The regions may have their competences within a context of decentralisation and the concession of competences by the State to territorial regions. That concession of competences varies from one State to another and, furthermore, they vary greatly in many countries. Even in the case of countries which have made significant concessions of competences, such as Germany, Austria or Spain, the systems are completely different. You cannot compare the German federal system with the Spanish system of Autonomous Communities.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the representation of the State essentially takes place by means of internal cooperation and each State can, within this context, represent the interests of the territorial regions of its territory in the way that best suits the general interests of the whole country. Community policies are not external policy matters, but Community policy matters, but I would remind you that according to Community policy, the representatives in the Council are the Member States of the European Union and it falls to them to defend the positions which affect all of those countries according to their constitutional system.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore work on the principle that each State applies its constitution as it stands and that in no way means that the quality of the representation of the interests of the territorial communities depends on any particular system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the Laeken Council it was decided that the EU Member States would refuse to issue visas to representatives of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC-EP). This decision is a serious new violation of international law and democratic freedoms, since it is directed against a large popular movement in Colombia which has considerable support not only inside the country but also abroad, including in many EU Member States, because of its long-standing struggle for a political settlement to the conflict in Colombia, democratic agricultural reform, democratic and trade-union freedoms and an end to the death squads’ reign of terror.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the fact that the representatives of FARC-EP are participating alongside official Colombian Government representatives in the peace process, which enjoys the support of the EU, can the Council say whether this decision has anything to do with the recent ‘law to combat terrorism’ and whether it intends to reconsider this antidemocratic decision and to back the process to achieve peace based on a political solution in Colombia?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In it, the European Union indicates that, until further orders, the Member States of the Union will not issue new visas or residency permits to representatives of armed groups, not only of FARC, but all armed groups, without prejudice to the continuation of the efforts of the Member States of the Union which are participating in the dialogue between the Colombian parties.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has also expressed its support for the efforts of the Member States of the Union which, on the request of the Colombian Government and the parties in conflict, are taking part in the talks which the President, Andrés Pastrana, has entered into with the ELN and FARC in order to reach a negotiated solution to the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">This decision has nothing to do with the framework decision on the fight against terrorism which you refer to, but is a part of the strong condemnation from the whole international community of the practices of armed groups, which carry out activities such as kidnaps, extortion and other types of crime which are violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law, and endanger the peace process which is not yet secured in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union insists that its position in relation to the armed groups in Colombia will be studied and reviewed in accordance with respect for human rights, international humanitarian law and diplomatic immunity.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union unreservedly supports the efforts to encourage all the parties involved to respect human rights and international humanitarian law, and calls on all of them to condemn the violations of them. It also asks the armed groups to free all hostages, foreigners and Colombians, and to immediately renounce these practices.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has also urged FARC to return to the negotiating table in order, amongst other things, to deal with the issues agreed in San Francisco de la Sombra in October 2001. It is pleased at the resumption of the dialogue between the government and the ELN, and hopes that these two movements will show signs of their determination to seek concrete results aimed at a lasting and peaceful solution to the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">In its declaration, the European Union also insists that the Colombian Government continues and intensifies its efforts to disarm the paramilitaries and bring the people responsible for the crimes perpetrated, whoever they may be, fully to justice, so that they may pursue – both at a local and regional level, and respecting biodiversity and the environment – the efforts already started to combat illegal crops, the production and trafficking of drugs and that, independently of the peace process, a programme of decisive socio-economic reforms be created and applied urgently.</p>
<p class="contents">As this Parliament knows, the peace process in Colombia is at an uncertain stage. The European Union is still actively supporting the peace process and the laudable efforts of President Pastrana and considers that there is no alternative to a negotiated solution to the internal conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union will make an effort to apply the autonomous commitments adopted within the framework of the European support programme for the peace process in Colombia, provided that security problems do not prevent it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In other words, the two parties involved, the government and FARC, have pursued the negotiating process and FARC has made a considerable effort to find a solution to the problem. However, the solution clearly lies in disarming the paramilitary groups, the so-called ‘death squads’, which are still operating with impunity in Colombia. The solution also lies in guaranteeing the freedoms and the democratic rights of all citizens, in combating poverty, in moving ahead with agricultural reform and lastly, in guaranteeing the social rights of the Colombian people</p>
<p class="contents">Now that FARC is sitting at the negotiating table with the Colombian Government, why does it appear that the countries of the European Union are not making an effort to ensure that these negotiations are successfully concluded and provide members of FARC with the necessary visas so that they can, as they must, maintain contact with countries involved in the peace process, and we know<span class="italic"> </span>that some countries in the European Union are interested in seeing a positive outcome to this peace process.

<p class="contents">During the unprecedentedly large-scale demonstrations in Brussels on the occasion of the European Council Summit at Laeken, on 14 and 15 December, the police violently and provocatively charged peaceful demonstrators and even mere bystanders. Undercover secret police officers dressed as demonstrators mounted particularly brutal attacks. They beat demonstrators and bystanders savagely, apprehended dozens of citizens without any justification, tied them up and kept them lying on the ground for an hour – even those who were injured and bleeding – and humiliated women by stripping them in front of male police officers posing as interpreters. They rode roughshod over fundamental rights which the people had struggled for decades to win.</p>
<p class="contents">The Belgian Presidency and the media tried to cover up the events exposed by legal teams (teams of lawyers working to defend the demonstrators’ rights) and by victims of the attacks themselves.</p>

<p class="contents">Parliament's resolution<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on Papua (Irian Jaya) and Sulawesi in Indonesia adopted on 13 December 2001 points out that 'the fighters of the Islamic terror group Laskar Jihad, after leaving behind a trail of blood and destruction on the Moluccan islands from 1999 onwards, have now become active on Sulawesi'. The result of this situation is that 300 000 of the Moluccas' population of 10 million are now refugees, most of whom are Christians. On the island of Sulawesi, the largest Christian town of Tentana, with a population of 50 000, has been besieged by Laskar Jihad fighters. Jafar Umar Talib, the leader of Laskar Jihad who was trained in religious warfare in Pakistan, claims that he has 10 000 fighters under his command. Afghans and other foreigners form part of the Muslim militia against the Christians.</p>

<p class="contents">With regard to the broader issue of respect for fundamental rights and specifically women’s rights in Nigeria and the rest of Africa, the Council is determined to pursue the policy which it has long been implementing in this field and, in particular, by means of the following instruments: the Cotonou Agreement, Article 9(2) which lays down the parties’ obligations, their international commitments, in relation to the respect for human rights, and reaffirms the equality between men and women, the Cairo declaration and action plan approved at the Africa-Europe Summit held in Cairo in April 2000, which insists on respect for human rights, the Common Position relating to human rights, democratic principles, the Rule of Law and good government in Africa 98/350/PESC and Council Regulation (EC) 965/99, which establishes the requirements for the application of Community development cooperation actions which contribute to achieving the general objective of development and consolidating democracy under the Rule of Law, as well as respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms and specifically Common Position 01/373/PESC on Nigeria, which expressly mentions the respect for human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that in the case you have mentioned, the European Union must state that, although we respect the traditions and the religion of Afghanistan, we also demand that human rights be respected in that country.

Afghanistan is not the only country where these violations are committed. We have already heard what happens in some African countries.

<p class="contents">I believe that the European Union must be a pioneer in terms of defending these rights, but we must take the necessary precautions not to offend religious feelings since, as you know, there is currently a debate about the clash between the Islamic and Christian civilisations and we need to apply the necessary prudence.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Turkish ban on the foundation and operation of parties with the word 'communist' in their name</span></p>
<p class="contents">Human and democratic rights are systematically and persistently violated in Turkey, a country which is a candidate for membership of the EU. One such instance is the ban on the foundation and operation of parties with the word 'communist' in their name based on the antiquated provisions of Article 96 of the Law on political parties, which dates from 1920.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist Power Party of Turkey was founded in 1993 and operates legally. It has fought vigorously for democratic rights and takes part in elections. At its last congress, it decided to change its name to the Communist Party of Turkey but, because of the abovementioned undemocratic law, it is in danger of being banned.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, the Turkish Parliament is in fact debating amending the law on political parties, which may provide an opportunity to abolish the undemocratic ban.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the Council's view of the ban under Turkish law on the foundation and operation of communist parties? Does it consider that Turkey can become a member of the EU without first having lifted the ban? Will it raise the question of amending this undemocratic and reactionary law with the regime in Ankara so that the Communist Party can engage freely in political activity? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Council is not aware, even from these references, that the activities of the Turkish Communist Party are being hindered nor that there is any threat to ban it on the basis of an obsolete provision of the former law on political parties.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Turkey more generally, the Laeken European Council concluded that Turkey had made progress towards complying with the criteria set for accession, particular by recently amending its Constitution, and that there was therefore now more possibility of opening accession negotiations with that country. Turkey is being encouraged to make more progress towards compliance with the accession criteria – the famous Copenhagen criteria – particularly in relation to human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is closely monitoring the efforts for institutional political reform currently being made by Turkey and is especially focussing on whether those reforms will lead to real improvements in relation to human rights and fundamental freedoms in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">As we all know, this situation is still highly unsatisfactory in many respects.</p>

Is he aware that next year is going to be the European Year of Disabled People, and is he taking an interest in that? Is he aware that since 1996 we have had a rights approach to disability that would suggest that we should support such a Convention? In his answer he has given no evidence whatsoever that he is aware of those facts.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that he has admitted to this Chamber today that he and his colleagues have not even discussed this issue, at the very least will he respond to the request from this Parliament that he should table such a discussion? If the members of the high level group on disabilities convened by the Commission are all members of the Council, it is within his power to do that if he wishes.

<p class="contents">The year 2002 has just begun and Spain has taken over the rotating EU Presidency. The previous incumbent was Belgium and during its six-month term of office not only the country’s Prime Minister and other government ministers, but also the government leaders and ministers of the various Belgian regions, appeared before the European Parliament and chaired some of its meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">Since it is laid down in the Spanish Constitution that the Kingdom of Spain is a state comprising autonomous communities which have exclusive powers that in certain cases are similar to and even greater than those of Belgium’s regions, would the Spanish Presidency say why no plans have been made for representatives of any of Spain’s autonomous communities to appear before the European Parliament and to take part in its proceedings?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As you will have realised, the reply just given by the President-in-Office of the Council is the same as the one he gave to Question No 6. I would like to point out that Article 203 of the Treaty establishing the European Communities speaks of ‘ministerial rank’ and, both in the meetings of the Councils of Ministers and during the Presidency, there is quite naturally participation by representatives of the Belgian regions or autonomous communities, or whatever you want to call them, and also – as the MEP who spoke about this said earlier – the region or nation of Scotland, the German <span class="italic">Länder</span> or the Austrian States and other such examples within the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I would like to ask whether you consider the Spanish Government’s action in this respect to be appropriate. When talking about, for example, economic and financial affairs, or a plan for budgetary stability, it reaches agreements with the other governments of the Union, but when the same is to be raised on the level of the Spanish State, you impose it by law, instead of seeking agreement and consensus with the Communities which have exclusive competence in these areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is the invoking of the constitutional foundations of a State, which are constantly being called into question by Mr Ortuondo’s party, demonstrating its irresponsible and destabilising attitude.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is the curious analogy we have heard about other States of the Union, Belgium for example, when it is well known, except amongst those displaying ignorance or bad faith, that the territorial organisation of the Belgian State obeys a very complex and unique system, involving the interlinking of cultural and linguistic communities with political communities, and a system of compatibilities between federal responsibilities and regional responsibilities which is completely different to the situation of the Autonomous Communities in Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to know whether you agree with the view that this rich diversity in the territorial organisation of the States making up the Union is something which stimulates, enriches and strengthens European democracy, which prevents homogenising reductionism – despite what Mr Ortuondo seems to think – and that, of course, it must be fully respected by the Community institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As Mr Papayannakis no doubt knows, the European Union has been playing an active role in the negotiations with the ad hoc group of States which are parties to the Convention on Biological and Toxin Weapons and in the 5th review conference, held in Geneva from 19 November to 7 December 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">This activity was based on the common positions adopted in 1996, 1998 and 1999 and on the conclusions of the Council of 11 June 2001. The European Union therefore regrets that, after six years of negotiations on the basis of a unanimously agreed mandate, the 5th review conference of the Convention on Biological and Toxin Weapons has not managed to adopt either a final declaration or a document with concrete measures to strengthen that Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">To strengthen the Convention on Biological and Toxin Weapons is still one of the Council’s priorities in the field of health. In accordance with the conclusions of 10 December 2001, on the repercussions of the terrorist threat on the European Union’s non-proliferation, disarmament and arms control policies, the Union intends to actively promote the global and effective application of multilateral instruments in the field of non-proliferation, disarmament and arms control.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Convention on Biological and Toxin Weapons, the European Union confirms that the mandate of the ad hoc group of States which are parties to the Convention is still valid. The Union has decided to continue its work towards a successful conclusion of a 5th review conference of the Convention, newly convened for November of this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But that agreement will not naturally be complete if the United States does not participate, and this issue is therefore one of the issues included in the current dialogue with the United States, with a view to the preparation of the summit between the European Union and the United States which is expected to take place before the end of the Presidency – certainly in June, if not in April, since the date is yet to be decided.</p>
<p class="contents">Our argument with the United States is that, not only would the non-participation of the United States in this 5th review conference of the Convention and its new agreement damage the credibility of the whole international effort, but that to have a clear position on the Convention on Biological and Toxin Weapons is also one of the agreed actions which can be carried out jointly by the European Union and the United States in order to implement measures to combat the terrorist threat. Because it is well know that these biological and toxin weapons may be used for criminal purposes by international terrorist organisations.</p>
