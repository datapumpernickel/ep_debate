As you know, making people in every European state even more aware of this issue than they already are is a particular concern of the Austrian Presidency, the intention being that this should lay another vital foundation stone for a common European road safety policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It was this that led the Presidency to call the informal meeting in Bregenz in Austria on 2 and 3 March, the object being to devote two whole days, at European level, to road safety to the exclusion of all else. In the course of this meeting, and during numerous bilateral conversations, we succeeded in doing justice to the Austrian Presidency's slogan: ‘Crossing Borders in Road Safety – Creating a Trans-European Road Safety Culture’.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, then, very grateful to the Commission for its presentation of the mid-term review of the European Road Safety Action Programme, which was discussed during the informal meeting of transport ministers on 2 and 3 March, which I have already mentioned, and most recently at the Council of Transport Ministers on 27 March in Brussels. It is at this point that I would like to make an advance announcement to the effect that the Austrian Presidency also intends that the formal Council of Ministers in Luxembourg on 9 June should adopt final conclusions on road safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Road Safety Action Programme, which dates back to 2003 and aims to reduce by half the number of deaths in road traffic in the European Union by 2010, lays down EU-wide road safety targets for the period from 2003 to 2010, and includes 60 measures to be implemented across the EU, most of which are not legislative in character. This constitutes a consistent reiteration of the priority of road safety, which had already been laid down in the 2001 White Paper on Transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Underpinning all these efforts towards road safety is the long-term determination that in future no more citizens of the EU should be killed or seriously injured in road accidents. A great deal of joint effort is still required if we are to progress further towards this goal. It is abundantly clear from the mid-term review of the EU Road Safety Action Programme, which Vice-President Barrot presented to the meeting I have already mentioned, that Europe may well be on the right road, but is still proceeding at too low a speed.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me mention just two or three striking figures, which Mr Barrot has already put before us. The goal of having some 25 000 road traffic fatalities in 2010, lamentable though they would still be, might well be achieved if we were already making better progress. If we were to extrapolate from what we have achieved so far, we would end up with a figure of 32 500. We must step up all our efforts in order to achieve as far as possible the ambitious target we have set ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">A successful transport policy rests on three essential pillars – people, vehicles and infrastructure, and, in the course of the meeting to which I have referred, we were able to discuss all three of them in detail. What does give cause for concern – and this is something I particularly want to stress today – is the trend as regards the numbers of motorcycle and moped users killed. They constitute the only category of road users among whom the number of deaths is increasing rather than decreasing. If this trend is not stopped, there will, in 2010, be only half as many people killed on Europe’s roads, but one out of every three of them will be a motorcyclist, as against the present one in six.</p>
<p class="contents">Passing on to infrastructure, Europe must be aware of its responsibility for making suitable instruments available to infrastructure operators, for only if it does so will we succeed in minimising the risk to those who travel on our European road networks. Where vehicles are concerned, it should be emphasised that modern e-safety technology can make a quite essential contribution to improving road safety. E-safety technology is intended to ensure an intelligent link between man and machine and to enable drivers to free themselves from routine actions.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the things on which the informal Council in Bregenz (Austria) focussed was the subject of public awareness. In Bregenz we had a very brief and concentrated opportunity to study and compare our European colleagues’ activities in raising public awareness. The evaluation of the various campaign activities showed that targeted awareness campaigns can in fact achieve a great deal. We in Austria, too, have done a lot in this regard in the last few years, stirring people up, thinking or making people think and ultimately, and most importantly, getting people to change their behaviour in a way that makes for greater road safety and fewer road deaths, fewer people injured and seriously injured in road accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agreed that a joint European awareness campaign on the subject could bring synergy effects and greater effectiveness. On the basis of a poll, we found that the subjects of drunken driving and fatigue at the wheel should be tackled as a matter of priority. I am pleased to say that the Commission promised to provide assistance, chiefly of an organisational nature and of course within the rules that apply, and suggested that the High Level Group on Road Safety could be asked to develop a proposal to that effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s intention of also introducing a ‘European Road Safety Day’ is also fully in line with our common objectives for enhancing road safety. I am sure that an initiative of that kind will also help to create greater public awareness throughout Europe. My special thanks are due here to Vice-President and Commissioner Jacques Barrot for his particular commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">Significant efforts have been made since 2001 to make Europe’s roads safer. A number of legislative measures have been taken in both the technical and regulatory fields, for example provisions governing seat belts, the digital tachograph, driving and rest periods, the driving licence or rules for professional lorry drivers. Initiatives such as CARS 21 or the European Road Safety Charter, which create awareness in European local authorities, regions, undertakings, associations etc., should also be mentioned here. Vice-President Barrot’s activities and initiatives, which include proposals already announced for daytime running lights, blind-spot mirrors and in the field of infrastructure, will help to make our roads safer at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">May I say in conclusion that if the problems in some Member States with a high level of transit traffic are even greater than the European average, then we should start where the figures are not falling very much or where fatalities are in some cases still rising, for every death on Europe’s roads is one such death too many.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank Parliament for the opportunity of speaking on this important topic of road safety today and I would like to say that we must not flag in our efforts to make Europe’s roads as safe as possible and thereby prevent much misery and grief. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to echo what Mr Gorbach said in his excellent speech and to thank him straightaway for his personal commitment to this great cause that is road safety. Thank you, Mr Gorbach, for having placed this major problem of road safety at the heart of the Austrian Presidency’s priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as I, myself, had to do when I gave an account, after five years, of our assessment on the basis of the programme that the European Union had set itself in 2002, we must note that the countries comprising today’s European Union saw 50 000 people die on the roads in 2001. The common objective proposed in 2001 and updated today is not to exceed the figure of 25 000 deaths in 2010. To save 25 000 lives!</p>
<p class="contents">What stage are we at with this? In 2005, we still recorded 41 600 deaths. That corresponds to a reduction of 17.5% in four years. Considerable progress has been made in some Member States in particular, but it is not enough. As you said, Mr Gorbach, the number of deaths in the Union is in danger of increasing to 32 500 in the year 2010 if we do not take it upon ourselves to give new impetus to this road safety policy. Greater efforts are necessary, and the disparities between the Member States must be rectified.</p>
<p class="contents">The Austrian Presidency has enabled us to make progress with an agreement on the European driving licence, for which I should like to express my gratitude once again. I would point out that this driving licence is accompanied by a licence for mopeds and a progressive licence for the most powerful motorcycles. That should enable us to reduce the number of motorcycle deaths, which is increasing at an alarming rate.</p>
<p class="contents">Over and above this assessment and over and above the progress made during this Presidency, the Commission will present, in 2006, new initiatives to be included in the action plan that I will propose in the revised White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, a proposal for a directive on the management of road safety in the trans-European network. It is not a question of us explaining how a road should be made safer, but of the European Union confirming, in each of the Member States, that a great deal of attention is paid to safety when a new road is built or an existing one is improved.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a proposal for a directive that will enable cross-border legal action to be taken in the most serious cases of a violation of the highway code: speeding, drink driving and driving without wearing a seat belt. It is not right that the perpetrator of a serious offence should escape punishment simply by crossing the border.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as you said, Mr Gorbach, we are going to close a loophole in the current legislation regarding the blind-spot mirrors fitted to existing heavy goods vehicles. We are also endeavouring to make progress with the idea of a third ‘daytime’ running light. Some Member States already want the opportunity to request this extra equipment for cars. Together with my colleague, Mr Verheugen, we are now going to examine how this issue should be dealt with and what follow-up action should be taken in relation to the recommendations made by the CARS 21 group, which has listed a whole host of safety equipment that is likely to be very beneficial to the vehicles on Europe's roads.</p>
<p class="contents">In concluding this first point, I should like to confirm that our assessment of the progress made in the field of road safety will continue on an annual basis. Mr Gorbach also mentioned the idea of a European Road Safety Day, as well as the launch of awareness campaigns, events that will all need to be carried out at European level. I can confirm to Parliament that we are working in conjunction with the Presidency on all of these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">If you will allow me, I am now going to address the issue of the security of modes of transport, including the difficult subject of how they are financed. I know that this issue worries the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. Following the events of 11 September 2001, the Commission proposed a framework regulation designed to lay down common rules in the field of civil aviation security. The support of Parliament, together with that of the Council, was crucial to the successful conclusion of that legislative process. That regulation was accompanied by an interinstitutional declaration in which our three institutions reaffirmed their determination to enhance the quality of aviation security systems in the Community. Furthermore, it seemed necessary to prevent any distortion of internal and external competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the three institutions noted the Commission’s intention to commission a study concerning the way in which the financing of security is divided up between public authorities and operators. The Commission committed itself to submitting to the European Parliament and the Council the results and the proposals that would emerge from this study. A similar position was taken when the regulation on the improvement of ships and ports security was adopted in 2004. The regulation recognised that the actual, uniform application of security measures raised important questions, which were always linked to financing. In that respect, the Commission also had to embark upon a study with a view to sending information to the European Parliament and to examining any proposals that would be worth presenting.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission put in place, from 2004, an inspection system that has helped significantly to enhance aviation security. To date, the Commission has carried out 69 inspections in all of the Member States. In the light of these inspections, the Commission proposed, at the end of 2005, the revision of Regulation 2320/2002, which is currently being looked into by the Committee on Transport and Tourism and for which you, Mr Costa, are the rapporteur. Together with this proposal for a revision, the Commission presented the first annual report on the implementation of the regulation currently in force, as well as the main results of the inspections.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would highlight the fact that the regulatory committee created by the framework regulation of 2002 has worked hard and has made it possible for eight implementing regulations to be adopted. The Commission has also launched two crucial studies, which have confirmed the importance of the issue of financing.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards aviation, the study was brought to completion in 2004. The results were published on the Commission’s website. The study on the financing of maritime security will shortly be completed, and the results will be submitted to you as soon as they become available.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards civil aviation security, the study carried out shows that the costs incurred within the Union, which consisted at that time of 15 Member States, fluctuated between EUR 2.5 billion and EUR 3.6 billion in 2002. We can regard this amount as a large figure at the same time as emphasising the fact that, in the field of intra-Community transport, the combination of airport and security charges and taxes represented 1% to 2% of the average price of flight tickets.</p>
<p class="contents">This study also highlighted some differences in the methods of financing. There are major differences as regards the role of the State. The study also highlighted a certain lack of transparency as regards security taxes and charges. In that respect, I must explain to Parliament that I have decided to organise a meeting between all of the air traffic operators, which will be held tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. This meeting will mainly focus on airport taxes, but it will certainly reflect on these security problems and their associated cost.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of maritime security, the preliminary results from the study also confirm that the costs are substantial, even though expenditure in the maritime sector is rather limited in relation to the total costs. The European Union has more than 1 200 seaports and around 3 700 port facilities, for which, according to this report, the average investment in security amounts to more than EUR 400 000, with running costs exceeding EUR 200 000 per year. As regards the security of ships, the average investment stands at EUR 100 000, with running costs of around EUR 25 000 per year.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are the facts in relation to this complex problem. I recognise that it is a major problem, but I also have to admit that it is now difficult to say for certain that we can find a solution that can be imposed on everyone. That is why we must reflect together on these security problems and on the way in which they will be financed, and I am delighted to hear your contributions on this subject. This is a problem that will obviously have to be dealt with very rigorously in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">That, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is what I wanted to say, and I should like to thank you and to thank the Austrian Presidency for allowing us to hold this debate on the two issues of road safety and security problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It cannot be right for the Council and Commission together to speak for 25 minutes in a debate for which half an hour is allocated. When are they actually to debate with us? If the two institutions want to debate among themselves, surely they can do that in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to come back to the heart of the matter, however. Road safety is not the heart of the matter. Thank you for what you have said, Vice-Chancellor, I agree with you. The heart of the matter is the simple question: how can we pay for security measures in aviation? This problem was raised with the Costa report. It is high time we discussed it. May I remind you that we as the European Parliament agreed in 2002 that the aviation security measures occasioned by terrorism should be paid for by the Member States. Counter-terrorism is a public function and paying for it is therefore also a public function. Then, because we were unable to agree, in the legislative process for the basic regulation in 2002 we settled for at least an interinstitutional agreement that the Commission should present a proposal for the public financing of such aviation security measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Vice-President, you know how much I respect you, but I do not expect you to submit studies, I expect you to present a clear report with clear legislative proposals. After four years you ought to be in a position – you might at least perhaps be kind enough to deal with that – to say when you will be coming forward with a definite proposal. There were rumours it would be in April. Now they are saying the end of the year. After four years that is no longer tolerable.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I also want to have a clear statement from you: if we are agreed that the additional measures after 2001 were counter-terrorism measures, do you also believe that these measures should be financed by the State? Yes or no? We believe they should be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to confine myself to the issue of funding safety. Since the attacks of 9/11, safety in the transport sector has become an important area of concern, for Europe as much as for anyone else, and with good reason. The port sector has been looked at, European legislation has changed safety at airports beyond all recognition, and I am glad to see that other measures are under way.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to adopt sound safety policy, though, we should not only draft common safety guidelines which, needless to say, should apply everywhere in the same way, we must also be clear about who will be footing the bill for all of this. We need common European rules for this, along with a level playing field, therefore. We cannot have a situation where in one Member State, all of the costs are passed on to the passengers, while in another Member State, most of the costs are borne by the state. A regulation in this respect is all the more urgent, because the costs involved in new safety measures continue to spiral out of all proportion. Accordingly, since 2001, Brussels airport has doubled its safety supplement which it charges each of its passengers. We have now also started to draft fresh legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">As already stated, though, an interinstitutional declaration was drafted on this very topic as long ago as 2002. This was accompanied by the pledge that a solution for the problem of funding would be tabled shortly. The Commission promised to present a communication on a strategy to tackle this problem by the end of 2005. We are still waiting for this communication. A while ago, rumour had it that we could expect this by the end of April, which turned out incorrect. I would like to ask the Commissioner when we can expect this communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, under these circumstances, it is difficult for us, as co-legislators, to do our jobs properly. We may be discussing the change to Regulation 2320, but we have no idea where we are headed in respect of an important component in the dossier. I accept that it is difficult, Commissioner, but you should present a number of ideas at the earliest opportunity, allowing us to hold a thorough debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It seems to me, however, that today’s confusion cannot be ascribed purely to the linguistic factor.</p>
<p class="contents">These two subjects are too important to be tackled together. I must admit, however, that when it comes to the ‘safety’ aspect of the word, it is thanks to the contribution of Parliament that fundamental progress has been made with regard to driving time and driving licences.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make just one point: the greatest contribution we could probably make to road safety would be to make less people use the roads. If we worked harder and faster on the third railway package, therefore, we would perhaps succeed in making a more significant contribution to safety than any of the other proposals that have been illustrated today.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming, though, to the ‘security’ sense of the word, and to its financing – which is a problem that concerns me directly, as rapporteur of this measure – I ask myself the following question: ‘Can we proceed with amending the regulation in accordance with the standards that define security without answering the question our citizens are asking, namely who will pay for it?’ This strikes me as the key point. It is rather difficult to answer ‘yes’, partly because we have also come to realise that security is a single issue, that there are not 25 types of security and that it is not possible for each Member State to establish its own security.</p>
<p class="contents">If, however, a single security exists for all countries, then we cannot do anything other than define standard, potentially uniform, measures, and establish in a clear, transparent way how to pay for it. There could then also be additional measures, which are more stringent and apply only in particular countries. Even in this case, though, how can we guarantee that these independent measures do not interfere negatively with, and have repercussions on, the security of the other countries?</p>
<p class="contents">While we wait, reality moves on. What we have today is, in fact, a basic security financed through fares and extra ticket costs, and more or less cofinanced by the Member States according to the levels of security they wish to establish. This system must be regulated differently. I think that the Member States should at least pay for the surplus measures and that it is essential that there be clarity regarding the basic level of cofinance between operator or, better, user Member States. We must follow these principles at least in order to continue our work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is what I want to comment about. Transport security could also have been discussed with the Titley report.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is being discussed now, and we are talking primarily not only about the financing of additional measures in individual States, which are calling for more security at airports, but also – and this is serious – the overall system. We were promised a communication here that ought to have provided us with the basis for this debate. Now Parliament is being called upon to put forward proposals. I am sure we all agree that we want a good foundation on which to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not talking only about aviation. The tragic events in Madrid have given us cause to reflect that other traffic routes and modes of transport are faced with the same challenge. However, if we want fair competition between the different modes of transport, there must also be fair rules for the financing of security measures. Hence my question: when can we expect the study? Does it include this aspect, and can we count on being able to make good plans for further action on the basis of that study? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">More safety in the transport sector, especially on the roads, will benefit hundreds of millions of European citizens: more safety, fewer accidents, less human suffering. The mid-term review that has been mentioned several times shows that. But it also shows that we still have a great deal of work to do.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at it like that, it is important that renewed efforts are made. But it will also be particularly important that all projects and all measures are well organised. The proposed policy mix sounds sensible, but it will also cost money. In this connection, we must try to ensure that European money is used sensibly, appropriately and economically. It is of course also important that these scarce European resources ultimately end up with the people and do not drain away somewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">When I say that, I am not at all thinking of embezzlement, fraud and the like, but am thinking of the fact that, in aviation in particular, most European airports and airport operators make a great deal of money. It is four years since we agreed on public cofinancing in the interinstitutional agreement, and if we now make money available – which will take some time – I am almost certain that people will not benefit from that money, but that we will get a new charge that will then probably be offset by refunding other charges. So if we take this route and use public money, we should ensure that people and air passengers will actually gain something tangible from it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now I listen to the Vice-Chancellor and there is not a word on transport security. In my opinion, that is no way to deal with this House. At least part of your speech should have dealt with this subject. After all, that is what Parliament wanted. I cannot understand why that did not happen, because I do not believe that 11 September passed you by unnoticed. The only reason is perhaps that the Council is not interested in the subject. But that would be the wrong approach.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the content, I of course agree with my fellow Members that counter-terrorism is clearly a state responsibility and clear lines must be drawn here. It must be clarified that in some countries the taxpayer pays for it, in other countries the airlines, in others the airports and passengers.

The Austrian Presidency plans to deal with the question of the financing of security measures in the next Council working group, which takes place tomorrow, 6 April, and in particular to discuss the way forward with this dossier, especially as the Commission has now announced that it will not be presenting its study on the matter until the end of 2006. In any case, close contact between Council Presidency, Commission and Parliament is essential in this matter, especially since we want to reach agreement with Parliament quickly. I will gladly discuss in detail all questions of financing as the Council Presidency sees them, but there is no time for that today. I have tried to report on road safety, on which the Council has focussed in the last few weeks and months, and to do so in close contact with the Commission, which has concentrated more on the financing of security in aviation, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">How difficult this question of financing is is shown by the fact that there are also different views in the European Parliament, as is evident from the Costa report and also from what you said, Mr Jarzembowski. Of course I know as well as you do that we need clear rules, if only in order to have fair conditions of competition and for reasons of transparency. I also believe that this really is about fighting terrorism, and that must be a national function, because if it is passed on to the airlines, the responsibility will again lie with the passenger, and I do not believe that is where it belongs. The passenger has the right to adequate protection against threats, in one form or another. That is why my clear position is that all this is a national function, and we have to face up to that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are working on these issues, and I have listened very carefully to what has been said in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out that, in its communication on the repercussions of the 11 September attacks on the air transport sector, the Commission has already stressed that the public authorities should take responsibility for strengthening certain security measures put in place by the public authorities in the wake of those attacks, which were attacks on the whole of society and not solely on those involved in the transport sector. I believe I share Mr Costa’s view on this distinction, which will probably be one of the guiding principles of any future stance taken by the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, Madam President, air transport safety studies have been carried out, and the findings of maritime transport studies will soon be made known to Parliament. What these studies reveal – and I quoted some figures earlier – is that the costs of security measures can be high even if they may seem insignificant in relation to the overall cost of transport. In spite of everything, they are, in absolute terms, costs, and I said just before in this Chamber that we shall certainly be bringing up this issue tomorrow and the day after tomorrow in this meeting between European transport companies and the airports.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that different Member States have different approaches to funding, that there is a certain lack of transparency and that we must try to assess and rectify any distortion of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Jarzembowski, Mr El Khadhraoui and Mrs Lichtenberger, I note your impatience. I should like to point out that, while it awaits the findings of the maritime transport study, the Commission is drawing up a report, to be ready by the summer, which will respond to the interinstitutional statement on the regulation on implementing common rules in the field of civil aviation security, as well as to the regulation on enhancing ship and port facility security. Let me assure you that we will have completed this report by the beginning of the summer.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that I will be able to benefit from today’s debate, even though it has been too short to cover every aspect of the issue. I should like to thank Parliament for its commitment to this important matter and the Presidency for enabling us to raise this tricky but very important issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
