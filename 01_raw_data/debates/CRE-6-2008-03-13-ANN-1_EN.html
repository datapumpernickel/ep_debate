<p>The Council Presidency's answer, which is not binding on either the Council or Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time with questions to the Council at the European Parliament's March 2008 part-session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>On 10 December 2007 the Council praised Croatia for its overall progress in the past year which has enabled the country to move into the next, significantly more important and more demanding phase. The accession talks are continuing on schedule.</p>
<p>To date two chapters have been opened and provisionally closed again: Chapter 25 – Science and research – and Chapter 26 – Education and culture, whilst 14 other chapters have been opened for the first time: Chapter 3 – Right of establishment and freedom to provide services; Chapter 6 – Company law; Chapter 7 – Intellectual property law; Chapter 9 – Financial services; Chapter 10 – Information society and media; Chapter 17 – Economic and monetary policy; Chapter 18 – Statistics; Chapter 20 – Enterprise and industrial policy; Chapter 21 – Trans-European networks; Chapter 28 – Consumer and health protection; Chapter 29 – Customs union; Chapter 30 – External relations; Chapter 32 – Financial control, and Chapter 33 – Financial and budgetary provisions.</p>
<p>Accession talks with Croatia at permanent representative and ministerial level are also planned for the first half of 2008 with a view to opening further chapters.</p>
<p>There is much work still to be done. Greater attention must be paid to transposing and implementing the acquis communautaire efficiently, to ensure timely compliance with the obligations arising from membership. In the light of the Commission's 2007 progress report on Croatia the country needs to intensify its efforts on transposition and specifically to achieve further progress in the areas of justice and administrative reform, anti-corruption measures, economic reform, minority rights and the return of refugees. Full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) must continue, with further improvements to ensure that war criminals in Croatia can be tried and sentenced without national bias.</p>
<p>The issue of the ecological fishery zone (ZERP) must also be addressed. On 18 February 2008 the Council again urged Croatia to meet its obligations regarding this, referring to its decisions of December 2007 which called on Croatia to comply fully with the agreement of 4 June 2004 and on no account to enforce the ecological fishery zone, within which a fishing ban applied to EU Member States too, until such time as a common agreement had been reached within the spirit of the EU. The Council will raise this issue again at its next meeting and has thus asked the Commission to continue talking to the Croatian authorities and to brief the Council accordingly.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0146"></a>

<p>Unless the countries of south-east Europe join the EU it will not be possible for European integration to be described as a success. Slovenia has been a full member of the EU since 1 May 2004, whereas the Croatians are merely aiming for that status. Border relations between Slovenia and Croatia have been a familiar topic for a number of years. The declaration of an ecological fishing area at the beginning of this year has further complicated Croatia's accession negotiations with the EU.</p>
<p>What view does the Council take concerning the settlement of the dispute concerning the border between Slovenia (which currently holds the EU Presidency) and Croatia (which is striving for EU accession)? Does the Council think it appropriate for bilateral issues to become tangled up with the accession negotiating process?

<p>The accession talks with Croatia have not at any point been suspended and so do not need to be resumed. More specifically, they are continuing on schedule. During the first half of 2008 two accession conferences are planned, one at permanent representative level and another at ministerial level, to open new chapters. It should also be pointed out that on 10 December 2007 the Council praised Croatia for its overall progress, which had continued throughout the past year and enabled the country to move into the next, significantly more important and more demanding phase</p>

The Council will address this issue at its next meeting and has asked the Commission to continue talking to the Croatian authorities and to brief the Council accordingly.</p>
<p>On 12 February the Council also entered into a new Accession Partnership with Croatia. The chief aims of this revised accession partnership will be to intensify efforts to find a definitive solution to outstanding bilateral issues, in particular the question of Croatia's borders with Slovenia, Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and to resolve the issue of the ecological fishery zone. Conduct of the accession partnership is of crucial importance to the continuing accession process.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0101"></a>

<p>The Council Presidency's answer, which is not binding on either the Council or Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time with questions to the Council at the European Parliament's March 2008 part-session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The matter of conditions in prisons is the responsibility of Member States, not of the EU. Neither the EU Treaty nor the current Treaty or Reform Treaty confers any powers in this regard. Consequently no direct legislation can be enacted. But the Treaty does confer responsibilities for justice cooperation between Member States. The Council of the EU has already taken a number of measures on this basis, and two documents are of relevance here: the initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany and the French Republic with a view to adoption of a Council Framework Decision on the recognition and supervision of suspended sentences, alternative sanctions and conditional sentences, and the Framework Decision on the European supervision order. The Council has already reached agreement on the former decision, and the Slovenian Presidency of the Council will work to secure agreement on the latter.</p>
<p>Independently of this the honourable Member might like to familiarise himself with the European conditions of detention adopted by the Council of Europe, which lay down standards and rules for prison conditions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0103"></a>

<p>The Council Presidency's answer, which is not binding on either the Council or Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time with questions to the Council at the European Parliament's March 2008 part-session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The honourable Member will undoubtedly be aware that the Council sets great store by the proper and timely transposition and implementation of Community legislation in the Member States. This is also part of the extended agenda for improving legislation which is one of the Council's priorities.</p>
<p>At the meeting of 25 February 2008 the Commission briefed the Council on the latest edition of the Internal Market Scoreboard, which reports marked progress on transposition of the internal market directives into national law, demonstrating that in 22 Member States the transposition deficit is currently below the interim target of 1.5 per cent set by the European Council in 2001. At the same time the large number of proceedings for infringements of the Treaty, brought against Member States for inadequate or incorrect application of the internal market rules, is worrying. In view of this the Council, in its key issues paper for the spring European Council meeting, pointed to the importance of transposing and implementing the Services Directive in a comprehensive, coherent and timely manner. This was also emphasised in the relevant key issues paper adopted by the Council on 12 February 2008.</p>
<p>The Slovenian Presidency of the Council will continue to give priority in the months ahead to the agenda for improving the process of legislation and its various aspects. Improvements to the legislative process will be discussed at the Council meeting scheduled for 29 and 30 May 2008, when the Council and Commission will have another opportunity of addressing this important issue which the honourable Member has raised.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0108"></a>

<p>The European Union actively contributes to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). One of the MDGs is to eradicate hunger and poverty. Corn and other cereals, which provide food for large numbers of poor people, are very important for reducing hunger in developing countries. After the EU set the objective that biofuels should account for one tenth of all transport fuels by 2010, EU farmers began to invest actively in growing rape because they saw significant financial interest and potential in doing so. Some farmers have altered the mix of the crops they grow: instead of cereal crops, they are starting to grow rape. There is a danger that, if there is a significant reduction in cereal crops, the EU will no longer be able to meet the ever-growing needs of people going hungry in third countries.</p>
<p>What preventive measures does the Council intend to take to ensure that EU growers of these crops are not put at a financial disadvantage and that levels of food aid to third countries are not reduced? What will be done to ensure that efforts to realise one objective will not lead to other objectives being sacrificed?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council Presidency's answer, which is not binding on either the Council or Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time with questions to the Council at the European Parliament's March 2008 part-session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The honourable Member's question alludes to the undertaking given by the European Union to make an active contribution towards attainment of the Millennium Development Goals. In this context the Council's view is that the EU's commitment on development and humanitarian aid, including food aid, should be as effective as possible and consistent with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.</p>
<p>The honourable Member will undoubtedly be aware that the EU has for some time now been giving food aid without strings, not least to ensure that it is effective. In line with the recommendations of the OECD's Development Assistance Committee, the European Union believes that all forms of food aid should be given solely on the terms that also apply to subsidies, that is to say they should be entirely unconditional, based on a systematic assessment of need and paid in cash. The EU's implementing partners obtain food aid primarily from local and regional markets. The World Food Programme (WFP), for example, one of the EU's main implementing partners, sources about 80% of its aid in the developing countries. So the Council does not consider that extending rape cultivation in the EU diminishes the Union's ability to meet the requirements of those who need food aid.</p>
<p>Recent reforms of the common agricultural policy have sought to make European agriculture more sustainable and more market-oriented. The Council is aware that food prices are rising worldwide. There are many reasons for this rise, which cannot be attributed solely to changes in international crop cultivation. It should be noted that the exceedingly high level of fuel prices has serious repercussions on food production and transport costs. Increasing affluence in various regions of the world, such as Asia, is also a factor in the growing demand for foodstuffs.</p>
<p>Consequently the Council will work hard to ensure that Europe's agriculture meets this challenge, that is to say finds the right balance between growing crops for food and crops for biofuel production.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0110"></a>

<p>The Council Presidency's answer, which is not binding on either the Council or Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time with questions to the Council at the European Parliament's March 2008 part-session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Reducing the importation of illicit drugs into the European Union is a key priority of the EU Drugs Strategy for the period 2005-2012, which was approved by the European Council and taken forward under the EU Action Plan on Drugs 2005-2008 adopted by the Council. The EU has, therefore, concluded action and cooperation plans with the major producer countries.</p>
<p>In 1999 the EU Member States and the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) agreed under the Panama Action Plan to cooperate on halting the production and trafficking of drugs. A coordination and cooperation mechanism was subsequently set up which operates at several levels – from expert groups to political summits. As part of this, a high-level meeting (the tenth of its kind) was held in Vienna during the Slovenian Council Presidency of the EU, which adopted a joint text – the 'Hofburg Declaration'. In it the countries concerned repeated their undertaking to cooperate further on tackling the drugs problem. Amongst other things they welcomed the important analytical efforts being made against drug trafficking in the Atlantic by the Lisbon-based Maritime Analysis and Operational Centre (MAOC), which the honourable Member mentions in his question and which aims in particular to break the maritime cocaine routes to Europe via West Africa.</p>
<p>Numerous joint projects are also ongoing at present, including:</p>
<p>1. Partnership between European, Latin American and Caribbean cities;</p>
<p>2. Cooperation by police and intelligence services to combat the trafficking of cocaine from Latin America and the Caribbean via West Africa;</p>
<p>3. Exchange of intelligence by Latin American police forces and European liaison officials dealing with the drugs problem in the region;</p>
<p>4. Halting the production of precursors and trafficking in these chemicals in Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>An audit of the resources earmarked for the LAC shows that up to 2005 the EU countries had co-financed 76 projects to a total value of over EUR 230 million. Figures for funding since 2005 are still being assembled. The programmes are designed in such a way as to encourage sustainable development of the regions, poverty reduction and the growth of democratic institutions. At the same time measures to reduce drug production are also subsidised – for example the cultivation of alternative crops to provide a living for farmers who previously grew coca.</p>
<p>The European Commission and European Parliament have also discussed these programmes and ways of coordinating them. The Commission has published a separate document in the form of a communication, and the European Parliament has adopted a resolution on cooperation between the EU and Latin America.</p>
<p>A meeting of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs is being held at the moment in Vienna, at which the EU countries will propose the adoption of a resolution which could have major implications for the introduction of illicit drugs into the EU via West Africa. The resolution envisages joint and better coordinated action by international organisations and UN member states to counter illicit drug trafficking and the transportation of cocaine through these countries, and it pledges help and support to the governments of states in West Africa, the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in their introduction and implementation of measures to stem the illicit trade in cocaine.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0112"></a>

<p>The Council Presidency's answer, which is not binding on either the Council or Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time with questions to the Council at the European Parliament's March 2008 part-session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The political process in Darfur currently rests on the joint initiative by the AU and UN (mediation by their special envoys), which seeks to bring all parties together to participate in a credible political process. But these efforts are beset by a multiplicity of problems. The rebel movements are increasingly fragmented, and any real ceasefire is out of the question. So it seems unlikely that talks between the parties will continue within the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>The EU is also part of the international initiative through an EU Special Representative for Sudan, who ensures that the EU's involvement in managing the crisis in Darfur is consistent with the EU's overall political relations with Sudan. He visits the country regularly, talking to the Sudanese authorities and cooperating with representatives of the international community on the ground.</p>
<p>The Council is deeply concerned at the worsening security and humanitarian situation in Darfur. It regards it as most important that relief organisations should have constant, unimpeded and secure access to the population. Notwithstanding the recent extension of the moratorium on restrictions on and obstacles to humanitarian work in Darfur it has called on the Sudanese Government to respect the undertakings it gave under the moratorium and to allow humanitarian workers access to the region.</p>
<p>The latest attacks by Sudanese forces on villages in western Darfur have focused attention on the humanitarian tragedy of over ten thousand refugees and displaced persons. Increasing tensions between the Governments of Chad and Sudan have made it harder still to speed up the political process in Darfur.</p>
<p>The Council has again urged the Governments of Chad and Sudan to refrain from any action which might destabilise the region further and in particular to end their support to armed groups operating in eastern Chad and Darfur. Both Governments must fulfil the obligations they gave to prevent incursions by armed groups across their common frontier.</p>
<p>In the meantime all expectations are focused on deployment of the UNAMID mission in Darfur as an effective answer to these problems. But the Sudanese Government continues to place administrative and technical obstacles in the way of its effective deployment. This delay will affect the chances of re-launching a credible political process. Before negotiations can begin, fundamental security requirements must be met. Ultimately the UNAMID mission can only succeed if all sides in the Darfur conflict reach a comprehensive political consensus.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0114"></a>

<p>The Council Presidency's answer, which is not binding on either the Council or Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time with questions to the Council at the European Parliament's March 2008 part-session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Equitable and sustainable management of water resources is key to sustainable development and the eradication of poverty. No strategy for the reduction of poverty can ignore people’s vital requirements for water. In this context the EU Council remains fully committed to attaining the Millennium Development Goals, including Millennium Development Goal No 7 (to ensure environmental sustainability) and target 10 thereof (to reduce by 2015 half the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water).</p>
<p>In the European Consensus on Development<a href="#defann_8_1" name="refann_8_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which was signed by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on 20 December 2005, the protection of natural resources such as water is defined as a key dimension of poverty eradication. The document also states that the aim of the Community integrated water resources management policy framework is to ensure a supply of sufficient, good-quality drinking water, adequate sanitation and hygiene to every human being, in line with the Millennium Development Goals and targets laid down at the World Summit on Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg in 2002. This policy tool is further aimed at defining a framework for long-term protection of all water resources, preventing further deterioration of water quality and promoting sustainable water use.</p>
<p>The EU Water Initiative, which was launched at the World Summit on Sustainable Development, is an expression of the EU’s common desire for innovative approaches to water and sanitation. The initiative contributes to the policy goals described earlier by means of the following: reinforcing political commitment to action; focussing attention on water- and sanitation-related issues as part of efforts aimed at poverty reduction and sustainable development; encouraging improved water management; encouraging regional and sub-regional cooperation on water management issues; and catalysing additional funding. At the same time the initiative offers a framework for establishing strategic water- and sanitation-related partnerships with Africa, Latin America, the Mediterranean countries and the countries of Eastern Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia (EECCA). The initiative is supported by EUR 500 million from the 9th European Development Fund earmarked for the ACP-EU Water Fund.</p>
<p>The Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI)<a href="#defann_8_2" name="refann_8_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, which was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on 18 December 2006, includes support for sustainable integrated water resource management, with particular emphasis on universal access to safe drinking water and sanitation in line with the Millennium Development Goals and sustainable and efficient use of water resources, including for agricultural and industrial purposes.</p>
<p>Access to safe water, water scarcity and drought are and will remain the principal EU priorities both internally and externally. In its conclusions of 14 December 2007<a href="#defann_8_3" name="refann_8_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> the European Council welcomed the Council conclusions of 30 October 2007 and invited the Commission to present a report in 2008 and, on that basis, to review and further develop the EU strategy by 2012, taking into account the international dimension.</p>
<p>Finally, the Council is aware of the specific needs in Africa in terms of access to safe water. The Africa-EU Strategic Partnership<a href="#defann_8_4" name="refann_8_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, which was approved at the Lisbon Summit on 9 December 2007, states that water resource management and access to safe water and basic sanitation are crucial both for economic growth and poverty reduction and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Africa and the EU will therefore work together to develop further the existing EU-Africa Partnership on Water Affairs and Sanitation with the overall objective of meeting basic water and sanitation needs and contributing to improved water resource management at local, river basin and catchment, national and trans-boundary level.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council Presidency's answer, which is not binding on either the Council or Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time with questions to the Council at the European Parliament's March 2008 part-session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>As part of its implementation of the communication ‘Global Europe – Competing in the World’ the Commission decided in 2006 to launch a public consultation on the use of trade defence instruments (TDIs) in a changing global economy to establish whether it would be possible to bring about greater flexibility in the TDI system.</p>
<p>One of the conclusions of this public consultation is that the proper functioning of the TDI system is not necessary to defend industries in the Community from unfairly traded or subsidised imports and ensure public confidence in fair trade. At the same time it was established that it would be necessary to remodel certain elements of that system.</p>
<p>Following earlier discussions, which were held in the Council’s preparatory bodies in 2007, Commissioner Mandelson stated on 11 January 2008 that the Commission was not prepared to bring forward proposals for reform of the TDI rules ‘until greater consensus exists amongst the Member States about the sort of reform they are prepared to embrace’. Since there is no formal Commission proposal, no additional discussions are planned at this stage.</p>
<p>Discussion of amendments to the existing wording of the agreements on anti-dumping, subsidies and countervailing measures, including subsidies in fisheries, were also held in the world trade negotiations in Geneva as part of the Doha Development Agenda. One of the EU goals is to strengthen the rules-based international trading system and to bring about greater implementation of the agreed rules by all the trading partners.</p>
<p>The aim of reviewing the measures is to establish a consensus, but this will take longer, also having regard to the possible outcome of the discussions in Geneva, and therefore it is not yet possible to establish a time frame for presenting Commission proposals to the Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0123"></a>

<p>The Council Presidency's answer, which is not binding on either the Council or Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time with questions to the Council at the European Parliament's March 2008 part-session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>First of all, the Council would like to point out to the honourable Member that neither the EU, the Council nor the Council of Europe has an established definition for profiling. In his opinion on the Commission proposal for a European Passenger Name Record (PNR) system the European Data Protection Supervisor referred to the definition of profiling taken from a study by the Council of Europe and at the same time stated that he is aware of the ongoing discussions on the definition of profiling. Furthermore, the EDPS acknowledged that the main point is not about definitions but rather about the impact on individuals.</p>
<p>The proposal for a European PNR<a href="#defann_10_1" name="refann_10_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> system put forward by the Commission does not create profiling as defined by the Council of Europe study. According to that study, profiling is essentially a computer-assisted method which uses data analysis to enable individual measures to be taken in relation to a person identified in this manner.</p>
<p>The proposal enables data from the PNR to be used only in combating organised crime and terrorism, primarily in gathering information and intelligence on persons who may be involved in a criminal offence. It also provides for an analysis of data from the PNR. These data are examined for what are known as ‘risk indicators’, in order to assess the risk that a passenger may pose. These risk indicators are based on the evidence obtained from reports, for example intelligence reports, and from previous examples. Risk indicators will be determined at the level of the Member States since a crime may differ from Member State to Member State. The Commission proposal expressly rules out the possibility of basing risk indicators on sensitive data such as on ethnic origin and religious belief, where the PNR data contain such information. The Council would nevertheless like to stress that Article 3(5) of the Commission proposal expressly states that the passenger information units and the competent authorities must not take any enforcement action solely on the basis of the automated processing of PNR data. In other words, enforcement action on the basis of PNR data, including decisions on individuals, may not be taken without a human factor, that is to say by the law enforcement authorities.</p>
<p>On 13 February 2008 the Commission presented a communication on preparing the next steps in border management in the European Union.<a href="#defann_10_2" name="refann_10_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> This communication presents for discussion possible new border management instruments, including the possible setting up of a system of entry/exit registration for nationals of non-member countries and the possible setting up of an electronic system of travel authorisation.

<p>Unless the most elementary justice is done by the US authorities, it will be ten years this coming 12 September that António Guerrero, Fernando Gonzalez, Gerardo Hernández, Ramon Sabañino and René González have been held unfairly imprisoned in US jails; these men are Cuban patriots who acted to defend their country, seeking to prevent Cuba from continuing to be the victim of terrorist activity promoted and carried out by organisations with their headquarters in Miami. It should be stressed that the UN Working Party on these five Cuban citizens imprisoned in the USA was of the opinion, on 27 May 2005, that the sentence passed on them 'had not been reached in a climate of objectivity and impartiality', and that the Eleventh Circuit appeal court of Atlanta decided, on 9 August 2005, unanimously to annul the sentence handed down in Miami. For the last nine years, these five Cuban patriots have been the victims of countless illegal acts, unacceptable and inhuman punishment, pressures and blackmail, failure to comply with the most elementary human rights, and the application by the US Administration of intolerable and cruel obstacles and restrictions with regard to visits by members of their families, including their wives and daughters.</p>
<p>What does the Council intend to do to ensure that the most basic human rights of these five patriotic Cuban citizens imprisoned in US jails are respected, with specific reference to their right to receive visits from their families, the rescinding of their sentences, their right to a fair trial, and their release?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council Presidency's answer, which is not binding on either the Council or Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time with questions to the Council at the European Parliament's March 2008 part-session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council is aware that the authorities in the USA have in some cases not permitted family members and other persons, including Members of the European Parliament, to have contact with the five Cuban nationals whom the USA has imprisoned as spies. However, according to the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the great majority of family members have been granted visas to visit their relatives.</p>
<p>A judgment pronounced by a court in the USA is an internal matter within the competence of that country. Legal proceedings are under way in this case and the judgment is not yet final. The Council may not therefore comment on the matter. The decision on granting a visa to enter the territory of a country also falls within the internal competence of that country. Since the majority of visa applications have been approved and it cannot be established that relatives are regularly denied visits, the Council cannot argue that there has been a violation of the human rights of the prisoners or their families. Furthermore, the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations provides that the individual State is responsible for defending the rights and interests of its nationals abroad.</p>

<p>At a meeting on 30 November 2006 the Council welcomed the Commission’s Communication on an EU strategy to support Member States in reducing alcohol-related harm, which represents a major step forward towards a comprehensive and coordinated Community approach to resolving the problem of the harmful impact of excessive alcohol use on health and well-being in Europe. An Alcohol and Health Forum, whose overall objective is to establish a common starting point for all stakeholders at EU level who undertake to promote measures to reduce alcohol-related harm, was established in 2007 as a basis for implementing this strategy.</p>
<p>The Council has urged the Member States to lend their full support to the Commission’s strategy and to promote its implementation at national and Community level.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Council has stressed that it is necessary to provide comprehensive, consistent and coordinated means of preventing alcohol-related harm to public health and safety in all relevant policy areas, such as research, consumer protection, transport, advertising, marketing, sponsorship, excise duties and other internal market fields.</p>
<p>The Council has urged the Commission to continue to support the Member States in their efforts to maintain, strengthen and develop their national alcohol policies in order to reduce alcohol-related harm and, as from 2008, to report regularly on their progress in implementing the EU strategy and on the activities on which the Member States report in order to enable the Council to assess the results attained. The Council has also asked the Commission to develop measurable key indicators for monitoring progress in reducing alcohol-related harm at Community level.</p>

<p>On 21 December 2007 the Schengen legal area was expanded to include the Central and Eastern European countries. The new members have completely fulfilled the Schengen requirements and thus proved themselves worthy to be considered equal partners alongside the other European countries.</p>
<p>The Chairman of the Russian State Duma Foreign Affairs Committee, Konstantin Kossatšov, has publicly said that because several Russian citizens have been barred from entering Estonia, Russia could respond by restricting entry to its territory, the restrictions being aimed at citizens of those Schengen states which ‘blacklist’ Russian citizens on account of their beliefs.

<p>Recent statistics show that in 2004, at Union level, only 3.3% of students attended a doctoral course.

<p>In Europe we all know the important part played by doctoral studies for the creation of a knowledge-based economy. The promotion of tertiary education and doctoral studies will enable companies to create highly qualified and productive job positions.</p>
<p>I would like to ask the Commission what its strategy is in determining and supporting the Member States in increasing the attractiveness of doctoral curricula and thus enabling them to develop their innovation and research capacity and what is the Commission’s strategy in determining the increase in the number of the doctoral students in the engineering sciences?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The number of 3.3 %, to which the Honourable Member refers, concerns only doctoral students and other advanced research students. It does not include Master's level postgraduate students. Once they are included, the picture is much brighter with the number of postgraduate students growing rapidly.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the participation rates at doctoral level in the EU are growing steadily and are higher than those in the US or Japan. However, the percentages and absolute numbers of doctoral students vary considerably between EU countries. Some of the countries with a high percentage of doctoral students have relatively few students in higher education overall, so that the total number of doctoral students is not very high in relation to the population.</p>
<p>In order to boost the number of postgraduates in engineering, it is important, first, to increase the numbers of graduates in mathematics, science and technology (MST). That is why the Commission proposed a benchmark, adopted by the Education Council in May 2003, that aims to ‘increase by 15% the number of graduates in Maths, Science and Technology’ and ‘decrease gender imbalance’ by 2010. While the first target has already been achieved, there has been very little progress on the gender balance aspect, with the share of women rising slightly from 30.7% in 2000 to 31.2% in 2005.</p>
<p>The Commission coordinates the exchange of good practices and peer learning activities among countries in the field of MST education in the framework of the Education and Training 2010 Work Programme. In 2006, the Commission has set up a Cluster group, composed of 13 countries, to follow the European MST benchmark and to improve participation in MST studies and careers, especially regarding women. It shall also contribute to preparing scientific specialists for the Barcelona objective of reaching 3% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in research.</p>
<p>MST is also one of the eight key competences for lifelong learning (Recommendation from the Parliament and the Council, December 2006) and represents a priority topic of the 2008 calls for proposals within the Lifelong Learning Programme. Furthermore the Seventh Research Framework Programme (FP7) will publish in March 2008 a call for proposals addressing innovative methods in science education at school level on a large scale in Europe as follow-up of the Rocard report on science education.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0109"></a>

<p>The importance of lifelong learning is recognised in all EU countries. Adult education provides flexibility and employment in the labour market, leading to positive social and economic changes in EU countries. Significant progress has been made in education and training reforms, but some EU countries are still not developing innovative learning programmes or ensuring rapid, high-quality and effective implementation and funding of these programmes. Non-formal and informal learning are clearly not being implemented quickly enough.</p>

<p>To influence the situation in adult learning in Europe the Commission establishes benchmarks, applies the open method of coordination and develops reference tools and communications. In addition, the Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP) provides financial support.</p>
<p>The EU has already set up a benchmark in 2003 to improve and monitor progress as regards the participation of adults in education and training. The aim of this benchmark is to measure the participation of adults (25 to 64 year-old) in lifelong learning to 12.5% by 2010. Moreover, the same target of increasing participation of adults in lifelong learning has also been part of the European Employment Strategy since 2003.</p>
<p>On an EU level, participation in Education and Training increased from 7.1% in 2000 to 9.6% in 2006. In 2006 an average of 9.6% of Europeans aged 25 to 64 participated in education and training activities. Progress must be quicker in the future and additional efforts by many EU countries are needed to reach the benchmark of a 12.5% participation rate in 2010.</p>
<p>The best performing countries are Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom (UK) and Finland, followed by the Netherlands, Slovenia and Austria. All the remaining EU countries still have rates below the European average of 12.5%.</p>
<p>There are considerable differences between countries reaching from participation rates above nearly 30 % in some countries to just over 1% in others.</p>
<p>On average women participated in education more than men (in 2006: 10.4%, females: 8.8% males:) and adults with high education participated much more in lifelong learning than low skilled adults. Participation also decreases as age increases.</p>
<p>The Commission, in order to further promote adults' lifelong learning and reduce the gap between countries actively and passively implementing this initiative, has adopted two Communications on Adult learning. In the first one in 2006 "It is never too late to learn" the Commission sets out a general approach on developments and needs in the adult learning sector. The second Communication in September 2007 "It is always a good time to learn" is the European Action plan on adult learning.</p>
<p>In implementing the Action plan with the cooperation of the Member States the Commission will analyse the effects of national reforms on adult learning. As the adult learning sector touches all the other fields of education it is important to analyse the effects of developments in these areas and their interaction with the adult learning sector. Most Member States are developing a National Qualification Framework linked to the European Qualification Framework. These developments are focussed on how to facilitate access, progress and transfer and are thus potentially important for opening up qualification systems to adults. The Commission will also develop standards for adult learning professionals and quality assurance mechanisms, based on existing good practice. Member States will be encouraged to set targets for increasing the skills levels of adults and to speed up the process of assessing and recognising non-formal and informal learning for groups at risks. Last but not least the Commission will propose a set of core data to improve comparability in the adult learning sector.</p>
<p>In addition to this policy, the LLP and, in particular, its sectoral programme "Grundtvig" provides financial support to transnational projects in the area of adult education.</p>
<p>Recently the Commission has published a brochure with 20 outstanding Grundtvig projects - "Grundtvig Success Stories. This brochure presents examples of best practice and encourages other stakeholders to follow these good examples. The brochure can be downloaded from:</p>
<p>(http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/education_culture/publ/pdf/grundtvig/success-stories_en.pdf </p>
<p>Other sectoral programmes in the LLP may also cover adult education within their scope: the Leonardo da Vinci programme, for example, has set as one of its priorities for multilateral projects for the period 2008–2010 the "skills development of adults in the labour market".</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0150"></a>

<p>During the previous programme, however, a number of projects already highlighted different folk traditions in music and dance in particular. Such events bring various European cultures together and are, as the Honourable Member rightly mentions, in this sense transnational.</p>
<p>The Commission listens to cultural stakeholders closely and their views have been taken into account in the changes made to the calls for proposals under the new programme. The Commission hopes that an even wider range of projects will be successful in their applications for funding in future.</p>
<p>As to the support given under the Cohesion Policy to cultural investments etc., here the initiative lies with the Member States and not with the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0096"></a>

<p>It is clear that effectively tackling climate change is undoubtedly at the top of Europe's agenda at present, but could the Commission clarify how and to what extent Europe's particular concerns in relation to this matter form part of international trade negotiations?</p>
<p>Moreover, how can the Commission ensure that the global consensus on a comprehensive and fair post-2012 climate change framework, as outlined at the Bali Conference in December 2007, begins to form part of the global trade agenda?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Climate change is a global priority requiring urgent global action. The best way to achieve effective and collective action is through a global climate change agreement. This is why the main objective of the EU is to make sure that negotiations initiated in Bali in December 2007 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) towards a comprehensive and ambitious post 2012 climate agreement to be completed by the end of 2009 are successful.</p>
<p>This is not only necessary from an environmental point of view but equally so from a trade and competitiveness perspective since it is clear that the best way to avoid trade friction as well as competitiveness concerns is through an internationally agreed framework on climate change.</p>
<p>Trade policy should respond to the needs and indications of global climate change negotiations and deliver responses where relevant to maximize synergies and ensure the necessary mutual supportiveness between trade and environment. More particularly, it should further work on enhancing the positive contribution of trade towards addressing climate change, both regarding mitigation and adaptation needs. Tariff and non-tariff liberalisation of environmental goods and services should be strongly supported since it will contribute to the necessary deployment of and access to environmental technologies.</p>
<p>This is the focus of the recent EU-US proposal on liberalisation of environmental goods and services in the current multilateral trade round in the World Trade Organization (WTO). It invites other countries to come forward with specific suggestions for goods and services that should be tackled.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as also reflected in the Doha Ministerial Declaration of the current WTO round, environmental assessments of trade policies (such as the EU Sustainability Impact Assessments) can and should play a role in preventing or at least mitigating any negative impacts of enhanced trade.</p>
<p>It is also worth highlighting that the EU is pursuing a chapter on trade and sustainable development in the new generation of Free Trade Agreement negotiations. We are trying to facilitate trade in environmental goods, services and technology and to promote the implementation of internationally agreed environmental standards. We are also trying to set up a forum to discuss sustainable development issues, including with civil society.</p>
<p>More generally, in Bali, Indonesia launched an informal dialogue on Trade and Climate Change at Ministerial level in the margins of the UNFCCC conference. This should help to further build a common understanding on the link between trade policy and climate change efforts, taking due account of their development dimension.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0098"></a>

<p>The Commission is following the activities of sovereign wealth funds and is carefully monitoring recent developments in this area.</p>
<p>The Commission adopted a communication on this matter on 27 February 2008<a href="#defann_23_1" name="refann_23_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The communication identifies and clarifies the issues raised by sovereign wealth funds. In so doing, the Communication seeks to respond to concerns about sovereign wealth funds. It lays out elements for EU expectations as to the governance and transparency of sovereign wealth funds. These elements should contribute both to arriving at a common EU approach on this issue and to discussions taking place at international level, such as in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). This communication does not propose any legislative initiative.</p>
<p>At a general level, the Commission recalls that encouraging openness to investments and free movement of capital has been a long standing goal of the EU and is key to the EU's success in an increasingly globalised international system. Member States have legislative and regulatory instruments to monitor and intervene on grounds of national security considerations. Thus, any European response to the concerns raised by sovereign wealth fund investments should preserve this balance and avoid giving any signal that Europe is no longer open to legitimate investors.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As the Honourable Member knows, it was decided at the 2005 Hong Kong Ministerial to front load a deal on so-called modalities for trade and industrial products (or "NAMA" in WTO jargon), which would precede a final deal covering all issues under negotiations. The objective of a modalities deal is to agree on the main figures as regards tariff cuts and, in the case of agriculture also subsidy cuts. The deadline for such a deal has been pushed back several times. The stage has now been reached of trying to put in place the elements of such a modalities deal in the weeks to come, but there are still uncertainties as to whether this is achievable.</p>
<p>In mid February 2008, the Chairmen of the respective WTO negotiating groups on agriculture and NAMA issued revised versions of negotiating texts. These texts should ultimately form the basis for Ministerial negotiations leading towards a deal on modalities. However, a key concern as regards these two texts is that they do not yet provide sufficient certainty as to whether a sufficient balance could be achieved between agriculture and NAMA.</p>
<p>In the area of agriculture, we have engaged with 3<span class="sup">rd</span> countries, in a manner which responds to their ambitions but which remains within the framework of the 2003 reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. These objectives can be met on the basis of current proposals by the Chair of the agricultural negotiating group, even if further issues remain to be clarified and agreed.</p>
<p>This approach was however undertaken solely on the basis that this negotiation is a single undertaking and that concessions in one area should be balanced by gains in other areas. As regards industrial goods, the Chair has unfortunately chosen to issue a revised text which could lower the level of ambition which can be achieved. The EU could not accept an agreement which fails to fulfil the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) mandate, i.e. to create real new trade opportunities in industrial goods. This position has been made clear to other WTO Members. Whilst we can live with the fact that the vast majority of developing countries should only take very light commitments in this Round, we believe that emerging economies like China, Brazil or India should make a meaningful contribution, in the form of new market access, in line with their level of development.</p>
<p>It is the EU's view that a deal on modalities should be found in the course of this spring. It should be borne in mind that, a deal on modalities would not be a final deal yet. It would settle key issues on agriculture and trade, but on the other negotiating issues, a final stage of negotiations would still be required until we can reach a final deal. But we will try to ensure that the modalities deal also provides sufficient comfort as to the final stretch of negotiations on other issues such as services, rules (anti-dumping and subsidies), geographical indications, trade facilitation, environmental goods and development. If a final deal is not reached this year, the political situation in the US would make any conclusion before 2010 very unlikely.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0133"></a>

<p>Few economic studies dispute the view that trade openness is an important factor for growth and development. Arguments focus rather on the nature and the sequencing of that openness. Nevertheless, it is equally clear that trade openness cannot operate in a vacuum: a whole range of other policies, good governance and a stable economic environment, is necessary for this to occur. Trade openness is no panacea for development.</p>
<p>Many developing countries have used trade as a key component of their development policy mix and have, as a result, seen significant reductions in poverty and increases in welfare. The most impressive examples of trade-led growth are probably found in Asia. China is an obvious pioneer in this sense. But similar trends can be seen in smaller Asian countries, for example Viet Nam, or even amongst Least Developed Countries such as Bangladesh. At the same time China, as well as other emerging economies, pay increasing attention to accompanying socio-economic challenges such as increasing income and wealth inequalities and social cohesion and the effective implementation of labour law.</p>
<p>UNCTAD<a href="#defann_25_1" name="refann_25_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> has recently pointed out the positive impacts that growth in Asia has on other poor regions – particularly those dependent on commodity exports. South-South trade is an increasingly important element of world trade and provides new opportunities for development, but trade barriers remain high in the south: over 60% of the duties paid by developing countries are due to other developing countries, while only 40% of their exports are directed to this group of countries.</p>
<p>The ongoing multilateral trade negotiations in the WTO<a href="#defann_25_2" name="refann_25_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> offer an opportunity to further use trade to foster development, through increased market access opportunities for developing countries.</p>
<p>The current negotiating texts fully take into account the fact that not all developing countries have the same capacities to absorb trade liberalisation. Substantial parts of the DDA negotiations are about Special and Differential Treatment for developing countries so as to provide for a sliding scale of commitments to market opening (be it on industrial or agricultural products or services), effectively depending on the level of development of particular groups of countries. The vast majority of developing countries in the WTO will take only very light commitments, in many cases in particular for least developing countries, not requiring any new market opening.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is only normal that we expect the emerging economies, such as Brazil, India or China, to take responsibilities in line with their level of development, by creating new access to their markets, especially as regards industrial products. While the European market for industrial goods is open and tariffs are amongst the lowest in the world, emerging economies still have high average tariffs and often very high peak tariffs. In any event, even these countries will have to open their markets to a lesser extent than developed countries and they will maintain the right, to a certain extent, to shelter certain sensitive sectors.</p>
<p>It will be of critical importance to ensure that any final DDA Agreement is balanced in terms of the contributions made by countries of different levels of development in the various pillars of the negotiation; this will also be an essential element for the promotion of South-South trade.</p>
<p>The WTO Members have continuously emphasized the central importance of the development dimension in every aspect of the Doha Work Programme. The Commission further wants to remind the Honourable Member that agreement has already been reached on several measures to help the poorest developing country Members of the WTO to fully benefit from the opportunities that would be offered by a successful DDA outcome, such as increased Aid for Trade or duty free quota free imports for Least developed countries. Also, the EU will ensure that the issue of preference erosion is addressed in an equitable way.</p>
<p>The EU further supports the WTO-ILO<a href="#defann_25_3" name="refann_25_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> cooperation on the relationship between employment/social policy and trade, and the Commission provides active support on developing decent work indicators and assessing the link between trade, employment and decent work in the context of the thematic programme 2007-2013 on human and social development ("investing in people").</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The General Council of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) endorsed Ukraine's accession on 5 February 2008 following which negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Ukraine, as a core part of the New Enhanced Agreement were launched. Following the official opening on 18 February 2008 in Kiev by Commissioner Mandelson and Ukrainian President Yushchenko a short first round of negotiation between chief negotiators, concentrating on organisational matters, followed. We agreed with Ukraine to have negotiating rounds, if possible, every 8 weeks. The first full round of negotiation is foreseen for the week of 21 April 2008 in Brussels.</p>
<p>The European Union intends to negotiate a deep and comprehensive FTA with Ukraine, that will bring Ukraine as close as possible to the internal market. The agreement should go beyond the classical FTA provisions on market access for goods and services, and will also tackle obstacles to trade 'behind the border', for example Sanitary and Phytosanitary issues and technical norms and standards.</p>
<p>The Sustainable Impact Assessment that an independent consultant carried out confirmed that the FTA is expected to lead to significant gains for Ukraine. The study also concluded that the FTA would reinforce existing trends in Ukraine: sectors in Ukraine with a competitive advantage are to win and those with a competitive disadvantage risk losing, unless they can improve their competitiveness. However, an overall positive result is expected.</p>
<p>Concerning information of the public on the ongoing negotiations, a Civil Society Dialogue meeting on the EU-Ukraine FTA negotiations is planned to take place in the course of 2008.</p>

Owing to EU pressure the notorious Allofmp3.com site has recently been shut down, but similar sites are still operating in Russia and must be closed down in parallel with the commencement of criminal investigations against the site operators.</p>
<p>It is essential that the EU continue to make the effective protection and enforcement of IPR a condition for Russia’s accession to the WTO. Will the Commission oppose Russia’s accession to the WTO until such times as it proves to have an effective IPR regime by adequately implementing its TRIPS obligations, ratifying the WIPO Internet Treaties and fighting Internet piracy?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Russia has unilaterally increased its tariffs on unprocessed timber exports to a level which is gradually bringing to a halt the importation of Russian timber into EU Member States.

<p>Russia's accession to the World Trade organisation (WTO) is, first of all, in Russia's own interest. If Russia wants to continue its economic modernisation course, to further diversify its economy and to attract much needed international investment, it will do so best as a member of the WTO.</p>
<p>But Russia's accession is also in the interest of Russia's trading partners. The bottom line is that WTO membership will mean that Russia has to comply with international trade rules. The scope for arbitrary discretion of the state in trade will be reduced. The former President Putin has repeatedly said that he is committed to WTO membership and I am convinced that his successor, Dmitry Medvedev, will see it the same way.</p>
<p>What is still to be done in Russia's accession? In fact, we have only a few outstanding issues on the table. The reality is that on the very large majority of issues, we have already found an agreement or are confident that the Russian legislation is in compliance with WTO rules.</p>
<p>As regards Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), Russia still has many challenges in this area, most of them relating to the effective implementation of IPR. However, as far as the legislative framework is concerned, the Commission is confident that Russia's recent legislative changes and commitments ensure its compliance with the WTO requirements. For the Honourable Members' information, the new Chapter IV regarding IPR of the Civil Code entered into force on the 1 January 2008. We are working closely with Russia to further improve the situation. This could be done in the context of the IPR dialogue.</p>
<p>The other issue the Commission would like to highlight relates to the issue of the Russian export duties for timber. As the Honourable Members may be aware, this is currently the most important outstanding issue for the EU in Russia's accession process. The Commission's view is that the decision to significantly raise the export duties on wood was not justified. The Member of the Commission in charge of Trade met with Deputy Prime-Minister Kudrin recently to discuss this and is likely to meet again with him in the next few days. The Commission is convinced that a solution can be found, provided that both sides have the political will to reach such an agreement.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0078"></a>

<p>The latest development in the current talks on agriculture in the context of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Doha Round negotiations are the revised draft modalities circulated by Ambassador Crawford Falconer, chairperson of the agriculture negotiations, on 8 February 2008.</p>
<p>In pursuing the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations, the Commission continually monitors the EU position in relation to its mandate, including through an assessment of the proposed modalities especially in relation to market access concessions, notably cuts and treatment of sensitive products. In fact, compared to what was contemplated under the October 2005 EU offer, what is being discussed today remains in the same range and would have comparable macroeconomic effects.</p>
<p>Ensuring food safety, traceability and a sustainable environment are essential elements of the 2003 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform. Accordingly, for the agricultural negotiations it is absolutely clear that the 2003 CAP reform is Europe's important contribution to the DDA and constitutes the limits for its negotiating brief in the WTO round. The margin of manoeuvre provided by this reform can only be used on condition of equivalent concessions from our WTO partners in agriculture and elsewhere.

<p>The Commission strongly condemns any attempts of promoting economic development at the expense of workers' rights and human dignity, and defends that the respect of the International Labour Organization's (ILO) Core Labour Standards are fully supportive of sustainable development.</p>
<p>This policy is clearly established in the various initiatives taken by the Commission as regards the Promotion of the Social Dimension of Globalisation<a href="#defann_30_1" name="refann_30_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Social Agenda<a href="#defann_30_2" name="refann_30_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, and the promotion of Decent work<a href="#defann_30_3" name="refann_30_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. Furthermore, all EU Institutions have strongly supported this policy and adopted various Decisions and Resolutions that provide a general framework for the development of our bilateral cooperation with China on Employment and Social Affairs.</p>
<p>The EU cooperation with China on this particular issue has evolved very positively since 2005, when it signed the first Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Social and Employment issues with the Chinese Ministry of Labour and Social Security. The Commission fully supports every effort to improve labour conditions, encourage the implementation of existing labour laws and enhance corporate social responsibility in China.</p>
<p>Its dialogue with China has focused on aspects including the adequate provision of skills, the reform of the social security system, the adequate implementation and reform of Labour legislation, and health and safety of workers. Although important improvements are necessary, it has been conducting a very constructive dialogue with the Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>The Commission has followed the recent developments and will monitor closely the new Chinese “Labour Contract Law” that came into effect as of 1 January 2008. The new law is a major improvement to the Chinese labour contract system by defining the rights and the obligations of the parties. It welcomes the fact that the new labour law, if properly applied, could and should lead to a considerable improvement of employment conditions in China.</p>
<p>As a token of the importance that the Commission places on employment and social standards in its relations with China, the Member of the Commission in charge of Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities made his second visit to this country in January 2008.</p>
<p>As the result of this mission, important new initiatives have been agreed with the Chinese Ministry of Labour and Social Security, the Chinese Academy of Social Science and the State Administration of Work Safety. With the latter, an MoU on Occupational Health and Safety is scheduled to be signed in 2008, complementing the technical cooperation with the Chinese authorities in this important domain still absent from our bilateral dialogue. We are also currently discussing with the Chinese authorities the establishment of an ambitious training project to improve health and safety standards in the mining sector in China.</p>
<p>Beyond our bilateral cooperation with China in Employment and Social Affairs, we are also very committed to strengthening multilateral initiatives within the context of the ILO, and supporting all measures conducive to promoting the Decent Work Agenda in China.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission attaches great importance to the protection of European natural, architectural and cultural heritage. Regional policy, rural development and support for cultural actions are among the leverages that can be used to further heritage protection and promotion.</p>
<p>In the context of Cohesion Policy investment in the protection of architectural and cultural heritage is explicitly encouraged in the Community Strategic Guidelines (cf. Article 2.1 which calls for "measures that seek to … preserve and develop the historical and cultural heritage with potential spin-offs for tourism development") since it contributes to the sustainable development of Member States. Moreover, historic heritage is an asset in the context of Member States' policies to stimulate tourism. The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) Regulation for the period 2007-2013 provide, inter alia, support for the "Protection and development of natural heritage" and for the "Protection and preservation of the cultural heritage" as well as for the "Development of cultural infrastructure".</p>
<p>Furthermore, under the support for urban and rural regeneration, measures to support historic heritage are also eligible. However, in the context of the shared management model of regional policy, the initiative to include or not heritage protection measures in the actual programmes supported by the ERDF, belongs to each Member State.</p>
<p>Rural Development Programmes can also be used to support the protection of the European natural, architectural and cultural heritage in rural areas. Member States may in fact implement specific measures to conserve and upgrade rural heritage under certain circumstances<a href="#defann_31_1" name="refann_31_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. According to available data, Member States have planned to implement this measure in at least 70 Rural Development Programmes (out a maximum of 86 programmes), mobilising investments for a total budget of €1,280,000 EAFRD for the whole 2007-2013 programming period. In addition, other rural development measures make a positive contribution to the protection of the natural heritage, through well-known measures such as NATURA 2000 support, Agri-environment measures etc.</p>
<p>Within the framework of the new Culture programme 2007-2013, as was the case of its predecessor, the Culture 2000 programme, the Commission has supported initiatives related to the preservation of cultural heritage in the context of the European Cultural Heritage Prize, for which Europa Nostra has been selected as the organising body. The selection for the 2007 edition of the Prize included the Mihai Eminescu Trust for its integrated approach to heritage conservation. The Trust is based in London (UK), under the patronage of His Royal Highness (HRH), The Prince of Wales, and is dedicated to the conservation and regeneration of villages and communes in Transylvania and the Maramures (Romania). A top award was also given to the preservation project of the fortified village "Santo Stefano di Sessanio", situated in the heart of the Abruzzi highlands, near l'Aquila in Italy for its work on preserving a typical medieval urban landscape. The Culture Programme 2007-2013 is also able to fund cultural heritage networks (two were selected within the 2007 call for proposals).</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission also cooperates actively with the Council of Europe with regard to the organisation of European Heritage Days. This includes financial support for the organisation of events and for ensuring the visibility of the initiative.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Unaccompanied minors are in a very vulnerable situation and need constant support to meet their specific needs.</p>
<p>Whenever applicable, the EU immigration and asylum legislation has always taken into account this reality and insisted on "the best interest of the child" to be the primary consideration of Member States when carrying out any action that concerns minors, both accompanied and unaccompanied.</p>
<p>Other fundamental rights that must be ensured are the right to education and to family unity, which have been included in the immigration and asylum acquis and in the Commission's proposals.</p>
<p>Support to Member States in respect of minors is provided from the financial instruments, in particular by means of the newly created general programme "Solidarity and management of migratory flows 2007-2013".</p>
<p>This programme is constituted of four funds managed in a very similar way to structural funds: the External Borders Fund, the European Refugee Fund, the European Fund for the Integration of Third Country Nationals and the European Return Fund. The overall amount for the programme is of € 4020.37 million for the period 2007–2013, and actions aimed at minors are included.</p>
<p>The Strategic Guidelines of the European Fund for the Integration of Third Nationals foresee five specific priorities, one of these being actions aimed at specific target groups (women, children, etc). The co-financing by the EU for such actions is increased from 50% to 75%.</p>
<p>The new European Refugee Fund (ERF III) explicitly takes into account the specific situation of vulnerable persons such as unaccompanied minors. It has a budget of € 699.37 million for the period 2007-2013. On top of the annual allocation of resources for eligible action in Member States, this Fund will grant a flat rate of € 4 000 for each resettled unaccompanied minor (amongst other categories targeted).</p>
<p>The Return Fund, with a total budget of € 676 million over the period 2008-2013, will, amongst other things, support action providing specific assistance for vulnerable persons, such as unaccompanied minors, in cases of voluntary or forced return.</p>
<p>Finally, the Daphne Programme has the objective of preventing and combating violence against children, young people and women and protecting victims and groups at risk. Since 1997 Daphne has funded around 420 projects to provide protection from, and to prevent, various forms of violence against children, young people and women. Some were specifically targeted at unaccompanied minors.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0104"></a>

The Commission is actively working on the implementation of the actions announced in its Communication. A group of national experts has been convened by the Commission to discuss the Communication during the Portuguese Presidency. This is the forum that has been chosen by the Commission to take such discussion forward with Member States without excluding that the possibility that some issues identified in the Communication will be put on the agenda for a formation of a Council meeting in 2008. A meeting of this expert group was organised in December 2007, the next one is planned for June 2008 during the Slovenian Presidency.</p>
<p>Moreover, a general debate could take place in one or other formation of the Council on other occasions, such as the presentation of an annual report on the implementation of a programme or an action plan.</p>
<p>The Commission presented the results of the December 2007 Internal Market Scoreboard at the Competitiveness Council of 25 February 2008.</p>

<p>By 31 January 2008, Written Declaration 0088/2007 on investigating and remedying the abuse of power by large supermarkets operating in the European Union had been signed by 439 MEPs, making it an official position of the European Parliament. The declaration calls upon DG Competition to investigate the impact that concentration of the supermarket sector is having on small businesses, suppliers, workers and consumers and, in particular, to assess any abuses of buying power on the part of supermarkets.

<p>In May 2007, the Polish parliament adopted a law on the establishment and operation of large supermarkets which exactly meets these expectations, by requiring the authorities to maintain a balance between different forms of commerce, while also ensuring compliance with the rules on fair competition in the field of commercial activity. On 31 January 2008, the Commission challenged these measures and demanded that they be amended, threatening that otherwise the case would be referred to the Court of Justice.

<p>The Honourable Member makes reference to the Written Declaration No. 88/2007 of the Parliament adopted on the 19 February 2008, on investigating and remedying the abuse of power by large supermarkets operating in the European Union. The Written Declaration calls upon the Commission to investigate the impact that concentration of the supermarket sector may have on different market players and especially to assess any possible abuses of buying power on the part of supermarkets. It also calls on the Commission to propose suitable measures to protect consumers, workers and producers from any abuse of a dominant market position and from any other adverse effects should they be identified in the course of the requested investigation.</p>
<p>The Commission will inform the Parliament of its response to the Written Declaration, in accordance with the applicable rules governing the follow-up to be given by the Commission to the Parliament's non-legislative resolutions and more specifically those adopted during the February 2008 part-session.</p>
<p>As regards the letter sent by the Commission<a href="#defann_34_1" name="refann_34_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> concerning the Polish legislation on establishment and operation of retail facilities the Honourable Member is referring to, its aim is to raise the Polish authorities attention to the problems of compatibility of this new legislation with the freedom of establishment, a fundamental freedom enshrined in Article 43 of the EC Treaty and with Directive 2006/123/CE on Services in the Internal Market<a href="#defann_34_2" name="refann_34_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. The Commission has concerns about the possibly discriminatory nature and the restrictive effects of the Polish legislation which requires an authorisation procedure for the establishment of new retail facilities and the operation of existing retail facilities greater than 400 square metres. The Commission notably will examine whether the new procedure is potentially excessively lengthy and costly, based on criteria some of which are not precise enough, leave room to discretionary power for the authorities and/or consist of an economic test prohibited by the above mentioned Directive.</p>
<p>However, this procedure does not concern nor prevent the application of other articles of the Treaty or other Community legislation. The Commission is therefore of the opinion that there is no contradiction with the expectations of the Parliament.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>According to the Commission's information, no action has been taken recently in France to criminalize the illegal downloading of pay per view sporting matches from the Internet and to ensure that internet service providers (ISPs) when notified by police authorities of illegal sites will shut such sites down.</p>
<p>A Memorandum of Understanding<a href="#defann_36_1" name="refann_36_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> between music and film producers, Internet service providers and the French Government was signed on 23 November 2007. Following this agreement France is preparing to change its law and to set up a new Internet authority with powers, in extreme cases, to order the suspension of access provision to the web for subscribers who illegally file-share copyrighted material. This will apply, however, to copyright infringements in the film and music areas only where criminal sanctions already exist in France. It will not, as far as the Commission is aware, cover retransmission rights or sports image rights. In more detail, in the case the internet Authority is unable to mediate after sending via ISPs warning emails to the infringer, it can adopt sanctions. In addition, a judicial action can follow and the judge can apply sanctions pursuant to criminal law provisions. This mechanism establishes a graduation in the determination and in the severity of the sanction to apply according to the seriousness of the infringement. The agreement also aims at reinforcing cooperation among right holders, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) platforms and ISPs in order to improve the legal use of the protected content.</p>
<p>At European level, the European Commission stressed, in its July 2007 White Paper on Sport<a href="#defann_36_2" name="refann_36_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, that the economic viability of exploiting sports rights depends on the availability of effective means of protecting against the activities of infringers at national and international levels. However, it should be noted that sports image rights are subject to different legal regimes across the Member States. The Commission will be examining this issue this year when it launches a study to evaluate the financing of sports which will obviously include the sale of media and image rights.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of unauthorised internet streaming of live sporting events and P2P piracy is an example of the need to evaluate the existing arsenal of legal measures that allow rights owners to fight digital piracy.</p>
<p>The conditional access Directive<a href="#defann_36_3" name="refann_36_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> sought to create an internal market for all conditional access services (providers of conditional access services as well as services using conditional access to protect their remuneration, for example pay-TV services) through the extension of the protection against piracy across all Member States, therefore closing off the previously identified "safe harbours" for pirates within the EU. It played a key role in the development of pay TV services within the Internal Market. Its protection extends to television broadcasting as well as to on-demand audiovisual media services.</p>
<p>The Commission is preparing an evaluation report on this Directive which will assess its impact given the development of new subscription type services, for example, Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), and to evaluate whether it requires extension, clarification and/or simplification. It has launched a public consultation on this issue which includes a question as to whether its scope ought to be extended so that rights-holders (including sports rights owners) could more easily resort to it when seeking to defend their remuneration.</p>
<p>The Electronic Commerce Directive<a href="#defann_36_4" name="refann_36_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, adopted in 2000, sets down the liabilities of internet service providers depending on the nature of the service(s) they offer (mere conduit, caching or hosting). The Directive also ensures that, when they are made aware of an infringement, ISPs are obliged to assist in procedures to take down the relevant site. It was hoped at the time of the adoption of the Directive that the relevant parties would agree to develop so-called notice and take down procedures for illegal and harmful information by stake-holders. Article 16 and Recital 40 expressly encouraged self-regulation in this field. This approach has also been followed by all the Member States in their national laws transposing the Directive. For example, Finland and Hungary have opted for statutory notice and take down procedures but again these have focussed on copyright infringements. The Member States are monitoring developments in these fields through the E-commerce expert Group where they exchange best practice and consider options.</p>
<p>It should also be borne in mind that sites which are involved in unauthorised internet streaming of live sporting events are frequently hosted outside of the European Union. In these cases, the only option is for right holders to take action with the relevant national authorities to block access to these sites.</p>
<p>The strong response to the growing phenomenon of unauthorised internet streaming of live sporting events and P2P piracy should take into account both the need of rightholders to fight the piracy of their content over the Internet and the need to protect the fundamental rights of individuals - such as the right to privacy and personal data - in the digital environment. Indeed, the rationale of the recent judgment of the European Court of Justice in the "Promusicae" case (C-275/06) can be equally applied to a scenario involving the need to combat the illegal downloading of pay per view sport matches from the Internet.</p>
<p>In its Communication on Creative Content Online<a href="#defann_36_5" name="refann_36_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> adopted in January 2008, the Commission launched a public consultation on legal offers and piracy. This topic will also be dealt with in the "Content Online Platform", a framework for discussion at European level. A proposal for a Recommendation on Creative Content Online is scheduled to be adopted by the Commission during the second half of 2008.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is of the opinion that child labour must be tackled at its roots: the Commission systematically pursues the objective of the protection and promotion of all children’s rights in its relations with third countries, through both political dialogue and the external assistance. In particular, the Commission aims through its political dialogue to encourage countries to ratify and adequately implement the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, its Optional Protocols and the relevant International Labour Organisation Conventions on child labour. The primary intent, then, is not to improve children’s working conditions but to get them out of the workplace altogether under the minimum age of work. Moreover, social protection coverage and in particular child benefits to parents or to those in charge of the children (such as grand parents) that are either unconditional or conditional related to attending school should be promoted, as well as youth employment as an alternative to child labour.</p>
<p>Experience shows that the elimination of child labour calls for action with regard to the labour market, social dialogue and social protection, for example through benefits to discourage or remove the need for child labour and the promotion of education. Such a multi-dimensional approach is reflected in the Action Plan on Children’s Rights in EU External Action, which complements the Communication “A Special Place for Children in EU External Action”<a href="#defann_37_1" name="refann_37_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, adopted by the Commission last month. The Action Plan retains the issue of combating child labour as a priority for regional and global actions.</p>
<p>Safe and healthy conditions for children in a globalised world are of the greatest concern to us all. As you know, the Commission promotes the effective application of core labour standards, including the fight against child labour, globally; the Commission can and should make a difference in improving labour standards around the world.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Israeli authorities at Ben Gurion Airport, Tel Aviv, recently subjected Dr Karim Hilal, a Greek national of Palestinian origin and holder of a Schengen enhanced security passport, to a humiliating interrogation and subsequently banned him, unjustifiably, from entering the country. Given that other Greek passport holders living in Palestine face similar problems, will the Commission say whether it is aware of the difficulties and abusive treatment encountered by European Union citizens on their arrival in or departure from Israel?</p>

<p>EU Member States and the Commission asked the Israeli authorities on a number of occasions during 2006 and early 2007 to remedy these problems and to clarify the procedures to follow for the obtainment of a visa in order to live, visit or work in the West Bank or Gaza.

<p>It seems that the situation has improved since representations were made in early 2007. However, the Presidency, Commission, and Member States on the ground continue to monitor the situation closely. The Commission Delegation in Tel Aviv is in contact with the Greek Embassy to Israel on the specific case the Honourable Member is referring to.</p>

<p>Article 149 of the Treaty does not give a right to Member States to ban educational establishments operating on the basis of certification by educational establishments based in another Member State. Education provided by establishments operating on the basis of certification by educational establishments located in other Member States is not part of the education system of the Member State where the education is provided. This kind of education is part of the education system of the Member State in which the educational establishment certifying the education and delivering the higher education diploma is established.</p>
<p>The freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services are two of the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty, in particular in Article 43 and 49 of the Treaty. Any restriction on educational establishments has therefore to be examined in the light of these Articles of the Treaty and the jurisprudence of the Court. For example, the Court has stated in its judgment C-153/02, Neri, that the organisation of university courses against remuneration is an economic activity falling within the chapter of the Treaty dealing with the right of establishment when that activity is carried on by a national of one Member State in another Member State on a stable and continuous basis from a principal or secondary establishment in the latter Member State. According to the Court's case law, in order to justify a restriction of a fundamental freedom, a restrictive measure has to pursue a legitimate aim compatible with the Treaty and justified by reasons of public interest. Moreover, this measure must not go beyond what is necessary to attain the objective. A ban on educational establishments, being the most severe form of a restriction of the fundamental freedom, will have to be examined along those lines.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0125"></a>

<p>In an interview with the 'Metro' newspaper of 4 February 2008, Mr Gérard Deprez (a French speaking liberal MEP and Chairman of the European Parliament's Civil Liberties Committee indicated that European subsidies had not produced the hoped-for results in Wallonia compared with other regions.

<p>With regard to monies allocated to Wallonia for the period 2000-2006, the Commission confirms the figures cited by the honourable Member, but it would also direct your attention to the following table, showing the breakdown by programme for the region at the end of 2007.</p>
<p>2000-2006 period:</p>
<p>a) Phasing out Objective 1 Hainaut: EUR 671.15 million (of which ERDF 427.6 million, ESF 200.2 million, EAGGF 41.8 million and FIFG 1.55 million)</p>
<p>b) Objective 2 Meuse-Vesdre: EUR 164.44 million (of which ERDF 138.7 million and ESF 25.73 million)</p>
<p>c) Objective 2 Rural: EUR 60.48 million (of which ERDF 54.85 million and ESF 5.63 million)</p>
<p>d) Objective 3: EUR 297.87 million from the ESF</p>
<p>e) Leader+: EUR 10.33 million from the EAGGF</p>
<p>f) Urban II Sambreville: EUR 7.17 million from the ERDF</p>
<p>g) Equal: EUR 42.31 million from the ESF</p>
<p>h) Fisheries: EUR 23.57 million from the FIFG</p>
<p>It should be noted that the Objective 3 funding also includes the programme for the Brussels-Capital region.</p>
<p>Under the Fisheries programme, apart from Objective 1 funding, Wallonia’s allocation was 1.5%.</p>
<p>2007-2013 period:</p>
<p>a) Convergence: EUR 638.32 million (of which ERDF 449.22 million and ESF 189.10 million)</p>
<p>b) Competitiveness: EUR 665.35 million (of which ERDF 282.51 million and ESF 382.83 million<a href="#defann_40_1" name="refann_40_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>)</p>
<p>Total: EUR 1 303.67 million (of which ERDF 731.74 million and ESF 571.93 million)</p>
<p>Selecting operations for financing is the responsibility of the managing authorities appointed by the Member States in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. In Wallonia, a task force made up of academics, administrators and prominent business people establishes a list of types of project that will receive cofinancing, with reference to Structural Fund regulations, to European law and to other EU policies. The managing authority then uses the list to decide which projects to cofinance. Determining the eligibility of projects in the period 2007-2013 is also part of the remit of the managing authorities appointed by the Member States.</p>
<p>The task of supervising programmes is carried out in partnership by the Commission and the managing authority for each programme. Programmes may be amended throughout the period of implementation and there is provision for ongoing evaluation (either on a continuous basis or on specific dates). The Commission also carries out an annual review, with each managing authority, of progress in implementation of the programme for which that authority is responsible. On the basis of the most recent annual reports, the Commission has confirmed that the programmes implemented in Wallonia between 2000 and 2006 (the time limit for implementation being 31 December 2008) will collectively achieve their aims. Moreover, a mid-term review in 2004-2005 provided an opportunity to adjust activities under each programme as necessary.</p>
<p>With regard to the reported opinion of Mr Deprez, the Commission has no knowledge of the information on which Mr Deprez based his assessment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Neither the EC Treaty nor the Treaty on European Union stipulate a deadline for publication of texts that should be made available in relation to the accession of a country to the European Union. However, Article 58 of the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania stipulates that "The texts of the acts of the institutions ... adopted before accession and drawn up ... in the Bulgarian and Romanian languages shall, from the date of accession, be authentic under the same conditions as the texts drawn up in the present official languages. They shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union if the texts in the present languages were so published."</p>
<p>Interpreting the same provision in the Act of Accession Treaty for the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and the Slovak Republic, the Court of Justice in a recent case C-161/06, Skoma-Lux sro v Celní ředitelství Olomouc, held that the obligations contained in Community legislation which has not been published in the Official Journal of the European Union in the language of a new Member State, where that language is an official language of the European Union, could not be imposed on individuals in that State. This is consistent with previous case law which stated that obligations contained in legislation of general application cannot be imposed on individuals in a Member State where it has not been published in the language of that State.</p>
<p>It is worthwhile to mention that the Publications Office is not responsible for the translation of legislative acts in case of enlargement. The obligation to translate texts that had been adopted prior to accession lies rather with the country in question, while texts being adopted following accession are being translated by the Institutions, which have adopted the legislative act.

<p>The interception of drugs from North Africa to Europe is an operational law enforcement measure that does, as such, not fall under the competences of the European Community. However, the Commission is aware of the evolving drugs trafficking patterns in the Mediterranean basin and the related challenges for law enforcement.</p>
<p>In this context, seven EU Member States have signed an international agreement on 30 September 2007 in order to set up the Lisbon based Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre - Narcotics (MAOC-N). MAOC-N matches up-to-the-minute intelligence with military and law enforcement assets to provide a rapid response to drug traffickers attempting to supply the EU with cocaine. It establishes a coordination point to counter drug trafficking by sea and air in an operational area extending from the Cape of Good Hope in Southern Africa to as far north as the Norwegian Sea. Its core focus is on non commercial vessels and aircraft, primarily from the South American and West African regions. The agreement also provides for the possibility of extending the operational area into the Western Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>The Commission is following developments closely and supports parts of its initial capacity building measures financially and has an observer status since 1 January 2008. The European Police Office, Europol, plays a significant role in the fight against drugs trafficking by providing the national law enforcement authorities with an efficient support.</p>
<p>Moreover, its Organized Crime Threat Assessment (OCTA), to which the MAOC-N contributes, develops a threat assessment of current and expected new trends in organized crime across the EU, including of course that of drug trafficking.</p>
<p>In parallel, some similar regional initiatives are evolving in other regions, including the Mediterranean basin.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0135"></a>

<p>The Communication on a European strategy to support Member States in reducing alcohol related harm adopted in October 2006 sets out clearly the Commission's approach to alcohol and health. It addresses all these areas of concern in a balanced manner, focusing on alcohol misuse and harm – rather than demonising alcohol consumption in general.</p>
<p>Alcohol-related harm is a major public health, social and economic concern across the EU. It kills almost 200,000 people a year in the EU, mainly from diseases related to excessive alcohol consumption, but also due to alcohol-related road accidents and acts of homicide and violence perpetrated under the influence of alcohol, triggering massive costs to health care systems, economies and society in general.</p>
<p>Implementation of the strategy is now well underway, by taking action in the public health context and across EU policy fields, and by working in close partnership with Member States to help co-ordinate national alcohol policies and foster further policy development, with the relevant stakeholders.</p>
<p>Within the framework of the European Alcohol and Health Forum, the Commission aims to trigger concrete actions at all levels, targeted at protecting European citizens from the harmful use of alcohol. A first round of commitments of actors has been completed, and an impressive array of actions has now been pledged. Among these actions is the commitment of the wine sector to launch an awareness-raising campaign on alcohol-related harm.</p>
<p>In the last decade wine consumption has been decreasing in the EU while wine stocks have been increasing. This has created a serious imbalance on the wine market. For this reason, around 500 million € out of the 1.3 billion € annual budget have been spent simply to get rid of wine that has no market. A profound reform of the wine Common Market Organisation (CMO) was therefore necessary.</p>
<p>The recent wine CMO reform takes due account of health and consumer protection, mainly by envisaging the gradual removal of market measures that have led to the production of low quality wine. This aims at encouraging Europeans to "drink less but drink better" while discouraging the production of cheap and low quality wines, which will no longer be supported.</p>
<p>The new Regulation will also reduce the possibility to increase wine alcohol content through enrichment. The principle that high alcohol content is synonymous with the quality of wine is not supported anymore. Moreover, consumers are starting to ask for and enjoy low alcohol wines. This new attitude will be supported and does not justify an excessive enrichment of wines.</p>
<p>The new wine CMO also addresses promotion and information aspects. Wine is an agricultural product included in Annex I of the Treaty and the promotion of agricultural products, including wine, is regulated by Council Regulation (EC) No 3/2008 of 17 December 2007 on information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal market and in third countries. The new wine CMO gives the possibility to Member States to reinforce this kind of promotion actions in third countries and to encourage information campaigns on moderate and responsible consumption by co-financing them at 60%.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0143"></a>

<p>The EU has now reached the second stage in the development of the common asylum system. The purpose of this stage is to attain a higher common standard of protection and greater uniformity of Member States' asylum systems. Besides further judicial harmonisation in the field of asylum, the Hague Programme also has the aim of increasing practical cooperation between Member States. This includes cooperation with regard to information on asylum-seekers' countries of origin (referred to as 'country information').</p>
<p>Country information plays a central part in the asylum process. In order to be able to guarantee just and correct asylum procedures, it is necessary to have access to country information which is of a high standard and provides an accurate and balanced picture of the country of origin. Country information is a key tool not only for immigration authorities and judicial bodies but also for asylum-seekers and their representatives.</p>
<p>The involvement of non-State actors has played an important part in the development of and access to country information, as the general public does not have access to certain parts of the information held by Member States' authorities. In contrast with this, the Commission's most recent call for proposals for the European Refugee Fund limited applications for country information projects to national authorities.</p>
<p>Why were non-State actors denied the opportunity to seek funding from the European Refugee Fund for country information projects? And what plans does the Commission have for the next call for proposals in 2008?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The collection, examination and presentation of data on countries of origin are essential aspects of Member States’ decision-making on applications for asylum. Country information enables the competent national authorities to verify statements made by asylum seekers concerning their need for international protection. It is therefore essential to have an objective, transparent and accurate system for information on countries of origin, capable of supplying official, reliable data quickly. Greater convergence among national authorities’ systems for collecting and analysing country information would help to level the playing field across Europe.</p>
<p>That is why cooperation on country information is a key part of the Commission’s activities and central to the work of the EURASIL network of experts.<a href="#defann_47_1" name="refann_47_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> Since 2006, in cooperation with the competent national authorities in the Member States, the Commission has been working on the creation of a common portal, giving national authorities a single point of access to all official databases on countries of origin. The common portal would be a useful additional resource, particularly for those Member States where country-information systems are less developed.</p>
<p>A technical feasibility study was concluded in 2007 and a pilot project linking two national databases is to run in 2008. At the end of this test phase, the Commission will bring forward proposals to establish a portal linking all existing national databases. Questions about access to information will have to be addressed here, and specifically about access for non-governmental organisations (NGOs), given that the databases in question contain classified information.</p>
<p>The budget for transnational activities initiated by the Commission and financed from the European Refugee Fund is limited. For that reason, when programming the activities each year, the Commission takes a strategic approach, aiming for the most efficient outcomes in terms of development of the common asylum policy. In 2004, 2005 and 2006 a very large consortium of NGOs, working in a dozen Member States and coordinated by the Austrian Red Cross, obtained finance from the European Refugee Fund to develop a durable network of NGOs and bodies representing asylum seekers, addressing the matter of information on countries of origin. The implementation process gave rise to constructive dialogue between the voluntary sector and national authorities. The Commission also opened meetings of the EURASIL network, which it chairs, to the consortium so that the latter could present the results of its projects to the national bodies responsible for handling asylum applications.</p>
<p>The 2007 call for proposals focused firstly on consolidation of projects – and particularly projects run by NGOs – to tackle the problems of vulnerable groups and individuals and, secondly, on specifically encouraging Member States’ national authorities to develop transnational cooperation projects on the management of country information. This second strand of the call was therefore limited to national authorities.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently engaged in the consultations necessary for determining its priorities in the 2008 European Refugee Fund call for proposals for European activities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The possible extension of the export refunds to pigmeat to cover certain frozen cuts appears not to be justified. The Commission is not convinced about the need for such action, or about its possible impact on the volume shipped to Japan.</p>
<p>For many years, EU pigmeat exports have accounted for around 30% of the global trade. Most of those exports are made without the help of refunds. The provisional data indicates that the EU's share was maintained also in 2007 in spite of the unfavourable Euro/United States (US) Dollar exchange rate. The EU exporters were able to expand considerably on some Asian markets (Hong-Kong, China) in 2007.</p>
<p>EU exports of frozen pigmeat to the high-value Japanese market also remained relatively stable in recent years. The Commission expects this will continue to be so, without subsidizing. During the last pig market crisis, in 2004, exports to Japan increased even though the specific Japanese cuts were not eligible for refunds.</p>

<p>In Lithuania, when a private individual builds accommodation, the electricity company Rytų skirstomieji tinklai (Eastern Distribution Networks) refuses to connect the property to the existing electricity main, citing insufficient capacity. The individual has to cover 40% of the cost of constructing a new main from the substation to the property and, often, of building a new substation as well. The company has the right to connect more consumers to the newly constructed main.</p>
<p>Having financed the enlargement of the infrastructure of, and the acquisition of property by, a (state or private) energy company, the consumer has no rights of ownership over the property and receives no reductions on the energy supplied.</p>
<p>Can the Commission comment on this state of affairs? Is this not an infringement of consumer and property rights? Are energy companies not abusing their monopoly position? How can this consumer rights problem be resolved? What is the experience of the EU Member States?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Universal Service is a concept, developed by EU legislation, which states that all consumers should be guaranteed the right to connection and supply of energy at reasonable, easily and clearly comparable and transparent prices. This obliges a utility to provide electricity to any customer who is willing to pay the price set for that service.</p>
<p>The implementation of the Universal Service obligation is subject to subsidiarity and thus falls under the jurisdiction of Member States. There is nothing in EU legislation that prohibits reasonable and justified costs for connection being charged to the consumer.</p>
<p>The extent to which the connection company, the distribution company or the consumer share these costs or decide on ownership fully depends on the national connection policy, and in some instances this may result in considerable charges on individual consumers.</p>
<p>National energy regulators play a central role in determining that the attribution of the connection costs and the respective tariffs are transparent and non-discriminatory: neither on the individual consumers, nor on the companies.</p>
<p>In exceptional cases, competition law may apply and, in the present circumstances, national competition authorities may then be best placed to deal with the matter.</p>
<p>The Commission would like also to draw the Honourable Member's attention to the fact that EC consumer protection legislation is limited to certain aspects of business-to-consumers commercial relationships.</p>
<p>Issues related to the acquisition of property rights on electricity immovable infrastructure fall outside the scope of such legislation and should be investigated by national authorities and courts on the basis of the relevant national legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0151"></a>

<p>interpretation of the texts, particularly the regulation on driving time and rest periods;</p>
<p>implementation of new enforcement practices targeting the worst-offending companies, in accordance with the enforcement directive;</p>
<p>adaptation to technical advances, and the fight against fraud in use of the digital tachograph.</p>
<p>The difficulties were immediately referred to the Commission, with a view to resolving all the issues raised. The Commission has taken a number of initiatives and considerable progress has already been made.</p>
<p>In relation to the rules on driving time and rest periods, the committee of Member States’ representatives<a href="#defann_51_6" name="refann_51_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> which helps the Commission to implement the legislation, and to which representatives of the social partners are also invited as observers, set up a working group chaired by the Commission to consider questions about interpretation of the relevant regulation.</p>
<p>On the basis of the group’s work the Commission drafted five guidelines, which have been posted on its website.<a href="#defann_51_7" name="refann_51_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a> The guidelines were the subject of general consensus and they make for greater consistency in application of the legal provisions.</p>
<p>With regard to the directive on enforcement, a second working group within the same committee is helping the Commission to compile an exhaustive list of all relevant offences in order of seriousness, as the directive requires. This work will also assist with the introduction of a common system for targeting the companies that are the worst offenders. The aims are to make enforcement more efficient and to reduce the administrative burden both on national authorities – which will be able to direct their attention more effectively where the risk is greatest – and on transport companies, which will be subject to checks only if their situation demands it.</p>
<p>In relation to the digital tachograph, in April 2007 the Commission launched a project entitled SMART, which is to run for 24 months and to produce proposals for adapting the technical specifications on the digital tachograph in the light of technical advances (this will entail amendments to the technical annex of Regulation 3821/85), so that risks of fraud can be countered more effectively.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
