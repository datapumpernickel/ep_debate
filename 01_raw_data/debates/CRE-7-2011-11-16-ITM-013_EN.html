Parliament is well known for its resolutions on this subject. The European Commission set up a Roma Task Force and issued a Communication on the issue in April 2011, and the Council adopted a European Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies for each Member State at the end of June.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I feel that this text certainly has inherent weaknesses, attention to which was drawn at the time. This weakness concerned the goals that were set concerning the fight against anti-Gypsyism and discrimination. Consequently, now, with just one month to go before Member States must submit their strategies to the European Commission, we have grave doubts about the efforts governments have made to include stakeholders, local and regional authorities, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the Roma populations themselves in drawing up their national strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, however, I have the feeling that day after day, an extremely worrying situation is emerging from the press, from eye-witness accounts, from facts related by NGOs and from reports. They speak of violence and hateful anti-Roma demonstrations, attempts on their freedom of movement, segregation at school, forced expulsions, human trafficking, forced sterilisation of women, and of the way that anti-Roma rhetoric has become commonplace in political circles.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with this, I believe that our positive, inclusive agenda must categorically go hand in hand with the utmost vigilance and be rigorously enforced. I believe that the European Commission must use all the means at its disposal to be extremely strict towards Member States in its role as guardian of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> and of the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me quote you an example. The massive expulsions that took place in France have just been unambiguously condemned by the Council of Europe as ‘an aggravated violation of human rights’. In its defence, the French Government cited the decision of the European Commission, which, as the French Government saw it, found the evictions to be completely compatible with European law. I believe that Member States should no longer be able to resort to this type of argument and that the Commission must be extremely strict.</p>
<p class="contents">As for us, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we too must do more. In addition to our extremely important work, we should set up a monitoring group to include members of national parliaments, in association with NGOs, so that we can in any case fight much more effectively against the discrimination suffered by the Roma. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was said that freedom, justice and solidarity are pillars of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to ask you: how can that be reconciled with the fact that racist violence against the Roma is to a certain degree the order of the day in very many Member States and is a constant state of affairs in Bulgaria, Romania, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Slovakia and the Balkans? It is also the case that Roma, who are EU citizens, are being expelled not only from France, but also from Denmark, Italy, Germany and Finland. However, freedom, solidarity and justice, of which we speak so often here, should apply universally or not at all. It is scandalous – I cannot put it any better – if, despite an EU framework strategy, despite numerous promises by the Member States, the largest minority in Europe continues to be discriminated against.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Czech Republic, I spoke with Roma families that were utterly shocked and, above all, frightened because anti-Roma demonstrations had been taking place for months right outside their front door – and with banners containing the words: ‘gas the Roma’! That is shocking, not just as a neighbour of these Roma, but it also not worthy of our history when we simply tolerate such a thing or attempt to change it with the use a few more police officers.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Czech Republic, as in many other countries, Roma children still attend separate schools – and in the Czech Republic, for example, they go to schools with disabled children. As a left-leaning politician, I say to you that the Roma do not belong in separate schools, and neither do disabled children. That violates human rights and I believe that that needs to be said in this regard. The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that separate schools for Roma are illegal. Despite this, these schools merrily continue.</p>
<p class="contents">As we all know, the European Roma Rights Centre has examined 44 cases in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia and found that violent attacks on Roma were utterly inadequately prosecuted and that no convictions were brought at all. Many law enforcement agencies are totally blind when it comes to the Roma. Moreover, the Czech Senate unabashedly confirmed recently that it will not participate in a Roma strategy. That is apartheid in action at the heart of Europe. We have to do something about this.</p>
<p class="contents">There will also be a price to pay for the fact that the Roma framework strategy does not lay down any binding requirements and that the subject of anti-racism does not form part of this strategy. I can say to you quite honestly that enough is enough.; I would ask the Commission how long it intends to continue to sit back and watch. Where is the consistency in its actions when it comes, for example, to framework decisions for combating racism and the Anti-discrimination Directive being implemented – properly implemented – in the Member States?</p>
<p class="contents">Article 7 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides for the possibility of action being taken against Member States that have seriously breached the values of the EU. I therefore call on you most urgently to make use of this provision. After all, we must defend the rights and freedoms of the Roma as European citizens. Who will do that if we do not? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to point out that despite all our efforts – and these efforts have been all the greater since the new Member States joined the European Union – and despite the Commission framework of April 2011, fundamentally nothing has changed in resolving the Roma issue in the European Union. Quite simply, it always boils down to discrimination against the Roma minority and, paradoxically, increasing animosity towards Roma among the non-Roma majority. Clearly this situation is compounded by the economic crisis and its social repercussions in the European Union Member States. The majority of the population often feels – and not just those who openly demonstrate and protest against the Roma community, but also the majority population, where this is concealed – that the Roma community abuses the social system and has no desire or ambition to become an integrated part of mainstream society.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have frequently said in many of the debates we have had on solving the Roma issue, I believe that to solve it requires not just the involvement of national governments, but also of the regions and politicians at local level, which means mayors who are best aware of the situations in their towns and municipalities, and who have taken individual approaches which have sometimes had positive and sometimes not so positive results.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that if we are to be consistent, it would prove very problematic to implement the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union as regards the rights of children in Roma communities. If we really wanted to ensure that the Charter were properly implemented, we would have to remove children from their families, because often they live in poor hygienic and social conditions, and they are brought up in conditions which make their education impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to call on the Commission, despite Mrs Reding’s absence today, to treat the Roma issue not just as a formality, but in a way which would allow us to take decisions to make the funding more flexible so that it could, for example, be used to support Roma assistants in schools. This would mean that Roma children would not have to go to special schools but could stay in normal schools where they could not go without a Roma assistant. We should also use these resources for special recipients of social benefits.</p>

You will see that there are good reasons for me to mention this.</p>
<p class="contents">For quite some time we have been waiting for the European Commission to prove that Roma integration is not just a trendy word but a policy we are genuinely committed to. Providing money is one aspect; important but not enough. We have been waiting in vain for the Commission to demonstrate full respect for fundamental rights, as enshrined in the EU Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, in relation to Roma evictions and expulsions from France.</p>
<p class="contents">The beauty of being in Europe is that the Council of Europe also exists and its European Committee for Social Rights, in the decision taken in June this year, considered the French measures ‘incompatible with human dignity’ and ‘an aggravated violation of human rights’. It also stated that such violations represent a threat to the ‘shared fundamental standards of all the Council of Europe’s member states, namely those of human rights, democracy and the rule of law’.</p>
<p class="contents">How was it possible for the European Commission not to see this, since respect for human dignity represents the foundation of the European Union?</p>
<p class="contents">The French Constitutional Council saw it in its decision of March. The French <span class="italic">Conseil d’Etat</span> noted it in its judgment of April this year and stated that the French authorities did not have the right, in contravention of the principle of equality before the law, to implement the policy of evacuating unlawful settlements by designating their occupants on the basis of ethnic origin.</p>
<p class="contents">Our European Commission did not see the discriminatory behaviour of the French authorities, thus allowing the French Government to defend its actions invoking not the French Constitutional Council, nor the <span class="italic">Conseil d’Etat</span>, but the European Commission’s conclusions that the evictions and expulsions were compatible with European law.

Let me share with you the four most important tasks and areas that await us in the very near future and that are essential for this strategy to be a success in the end.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the institutional and coordination starting line is to be finalised. For this purpose, the Commission’s confirmation to Parliament at the end of October that, despite any political upheaval or budgetary hardship in Member States, it was expecting the national Roma inclusion strategies to be submitted by the end of this year was of great importance.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also confirmed that, after a thorough evaluation covering the professional substantiation, complexity and financial feasibility of the national strategies, the Commission would also present specific recommendations for their revision, and would report annually on the progress of the integration to Parliament and to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">On 8 April 2010 in Budapest, Vice-President Reding promised that the Commission would keep a close eye on the actions of all the Member States and would not tolerate any window-dressing regarding the national strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Parliament’s report called for the establishment of a so-called crisis map to identify and measure the under-developed areas which are struggling with serious structural disadvantages. This will enable complex and holistic development programmes for immediate intervention under the cross-sectoral integrated approach. I truly hope that the poverty mapping carried out by the Fundamental Rights Agency will fulfil these requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, last year Parliament proposed serious and important changes to the next Multiannual Financial Framework in order to ensure that EU and national funds can contribute to the substantial and enduring improvement of living conditions for the Roma.</p>
<p class="contents">Complex, flexible and sustainable programmes are necessary, with longer time coverage and greater territorial relevance, focusing on the most disadvantaged micro-regions. The scope of EU funding must be extended in the near future so that provision of quality public services can also become eligible.</p>
<p class="contents">The rules of cofinancing should be revised and possibly differentiated so that projects targeting the Roma could possibly be required to be funded with a lower proportion of national cofinancing and a higher share from the EU. The idea of performance, that Parliament stood so firmly behind last year, should remain on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth point that I would like to raise is also related to the European Parliament’s report last year, when we stated that the EU policy to improve the socio-economic status of the European Roma must not compromise, but complement, anti-discrimination legislation. Therefore, Directive 2000/43/EC on equal treatment must be finally implemented in the Member States and enforced by the Commission. The national equality bodies must be strengthened and all violations of these legal principles must be immediately reported and sanctioned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In short, for many years it has seemed that for Parliament and the Commission the Roma are the only minority worthy of attention and protection. Europe-wide strategies need to be drawn up for them, with pots of ad hoc funding for their social inclusion; European and national plans need to be promoted for Roma children to be integrated at school; and so on. To me, all this smacks of hypocrisy.</p>
<p class="contents">Nobody has the courage to raise the problem of crime due to the Roma community; nobody wants to mention how difficult it is for other European citizens to live next to Roma camps; nobody talks about the violence that Roma children suffer within their own communities; nobody mentions the exploitation of Roma children by their own parents, who use threats to force them to go and steal from houses or beg in the streets; and nobody speaks of the abuse of which Roma children are victims within their own ethnic community.</p>
<p class="contents">Like so many European citizens, I would like to understand why Europe has made the Roma a minority to be protected and supported at all costs, when there are countless groups of disadvantaged people to help, particularly during a crisis. I would like to understand why more is not done for the disabled in the labour market, for women, for mothers, for young people who want to start a family, for old people and for the unemployed. I would like to understand why, after throwing away hundreds of millions of euros on Roma integration schemes, Europe does not spend that kind of money on helping groups that are in real difficulties in our society.</p>
<p class="contents">I really want to hear from the Commission and the Council how much they plan to spend on implementing the umpteenth new European strategy for the integration of the Roma, given that the Roma are in any case an ethnic group and a people that does not want to integrate. By their very nature they are nomadic people who move around and do not want to settle in one country and, hence, do not want to integrate. We need to base our approach on this actual fact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am thinking mainly of the report that you – the Members of Parliament – adopted in March this year, and which was drafted by Ms Járóka, and I know that it has attracted a lot of response. Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two main facts that are important in this entire matter. Firstly, approximately 10 million of our fellow citizens in the European Union are Roma and Sinti. This is more than the population of several of the smaller Member States put together – 10 million men, women and children. Many of them live in conditions of extreme poverty, and the opportunities they have are very severely limited. Some of them do not have any opportunities at all and cannot hope to have a life that all of us here in this House today consider to be normal and a matter of course. We all think that this is unfair and that for us – European citizens – it is a reason to be ashamed. The resolutions which the European Parliament has adopted over the last few years describe the seriousness of the situation clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union states that the Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities, so the European Union is a community of values which are not only enshrined in law, but are also respected in life. The emphasis that the Treaty places on the rights of minorities is also a reflection of the fact that we share an awareness of our common history, which is several centuries old. There were those who not so long ago – several decades ago – survived the work of Nazism and the Roma holocaust, and their children and grandchildren are now watching in horror at what is happening in the countries of modern Europe. They are astonished at the level of discrimination, racism and violence against Roma and Sinti, and are asking the citizens of Europe for protection and assistance, including legal aid. We – the world and citizens of modern Europe – cannot make light of these problems. Our common commitments to respect human dignity, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities, cannot remain a dead law. That is why the Council has actively dealt with the transformation of this commitment into the tangible protection of our citizens who are of Roma origin. In May this year, the Council held a special meeting devoted exclusively to the issue of the integration of the Roma. In response to the appeals of the Commission and Parliament, the Council invited the Member States to achieve objectives in four key areas: education, employment, healthcare and housing.</p>
<p class="contents">Elimination of the differences which affect the marginalised Roma community and the general population of Europe is our common objective. We all have social problems in our countries, we all have social problems in Europe, but those who are most affected by them are those who are both marginalised and who are Roma. The main reason for this is poverty, and, as we know, this is a very complex problem which can be overcome only when action is taken on all possible fronts. After all, all citizens need good schools, decent jobs, good health care and, quite simply, a decent place to live. In Europe we consider these things to be a matter of course. We would be outraged if any of us were refused even one of these rights, while some of our fellow citizens, including many people of Roma origin, still do not have access to any of these four rights, and we can consider this as unacceptable in the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">Recognising the urgent need for action in May this year, the Council invited all Member States to develop national Roma integration strategies or integrated sets of policy measures for improving the situation of the Roma. The deadline for their preparation is the end of this year. The Council is giving its strong political support to this process. Please allow me to remind you that the European Council has approved the report drafted by the Hungarian Presidency, noted its high significance and appealed for swift implementation of the Council conclusions from May. The Commission is advising the Member States on this matter, and the Commission will also be assessing their progress in the coming months and years.</p>
<p class="contents">The political position of the Council is clear – and the Council is also a legislator and co-legislator – and we all know that over 10 years ago the Council adopted a directive prohibiting discrimination based on ethnic or racial origin. This directive covers the conditions for access to employment, vocational training, social protection, including social security and healthcare, education and access to and supply of goods and services, including housing. These provisions protect all ethnic groups, including the Roma. For many years this directive has been a pillar for anti-discrimination policies on which Member States can rely in the creation of their own national strategies for Roma inclusion. This directive also enables Member States actively to adopt measures to prevent or compensate for disadvantages linked to racial or ethnic origin.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, we also have a directive establishing the right of citizens to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States. Of course, it is the Member States that are required to implement the directives and apply their provisions in practice. The Commission is responsible for monitoring the transposition and implementation in practice of European legislation, and is authorised to institute proceedings in the case of misconduct, while the task of law enforcement belongs to the national courts and the relevant national and European authorities. The Council advocates an integrated approach, whereby problems relating to education, employment, health care and housing will be solved simultaneously. This also means integrated activities in all European countries simultaneously. These will be the main aspects of the national strategies and resources for Roma inclusion which are being prepared. The Council can only agree with you that we have to improve access to education – broadly-understood education – and we have to ensure that the Roma become the beneficiaries of employment policies. The Council advocates an integrating approach in these four key areas. In particular, the Council has invited the Member States to provide real equal access to high-quality services. One of the key conditions necessary for success, in particular at a local level and in relation to the planning and implementation of strategies, is of course the active participation of Roma communities themselves. The Council has stressed that a fundamental role here is played by civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">The segregation of Roma is not acceptable. In all policies we must therefore clearly promote desegregation. No place in Europe can accept that one ethnic group be channelled to special schools or receive a lower level of education. The same applies to ethnically-segregated housing, for example in slums. To summarise, segregation must be overcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the task of monitoring racist attacks in Europe, I would like to remind you that the Council has appointed a special authority, whose task it is to provide the appropriate institutions with support and knowledge relating to fundamental rights. The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, which was established in 2007, collects and analyses information. It has drawn attention to the problems being faced by minorities in Europe, and this also includes the Roma. It is through the work of this agency that we know very well that, unfortunately, we have no reason to be complacent.</p>
<p class="contents">Three years ago, the Council also adopted a framework decision on combating certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law. Article 6 of the Treaty states that the Union recognises the rights, freedoms and principles set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which shall have the same legal value as the Treaties. The rights recognised in Article 20, that is equality, in Article 21, that is non-discrimination and in Article 22, that is cultural, religious and linguistic diversity, are particularly significant for the inclusion of Roma. The Council has reaffirmed the importance of these fundamental rights in recent conclusions. Let me quote: ‘The protection of fundamental rights, notably by combating discrimination and segregation, in accordance with existing EU legislation and the international commitments of the Member States, is essential for improving the situation of marginalised communities including Roma’.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States are responsible for ensuring respect for the rule of law in their own countries. However, let us not dismiss the importance of our common legal framework, which provides real guarantees at European level. The Council and Parliament have been working together for many years to strengthen this framework. Here each institution has its own role to play, which has been set out in law. The Commission monitors each institution’s compliance with this law, and the Court of Justice of the European Union also plays a role here.</p>
<p class="contents">However, above all, it is the Member States that are responsible for respecting the values and principles which they themselves have adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">During the last two days – yesterday and the day before yesterday – the 5th Equality Summit took place in Poznań, Poland. We discussed how to translate these European and national policies into local and regional action. The local and regional areas are where we can effectively reach the individual citizen whose rights are being violated.</p>
<p class="contents">In each country we must show special sensitivity in our actions because we are dealing with diversities within the Roma community. In some countries, such as Poland, 0.1% of the community is Roma; however we do have countries in which this figure is almost 10%. We have to take into account the ethnic diversity among the Roma themselves and act so as to persuade them to cooperate with us, and not to alienate them. We need to remember that they have been living with us in Europe for 600 years, and we still have a lot to do, and that is why each country needs to prepare an action plan of its own.</p>
<p class="contents">Our fellow citizens of Roma origin have the same rights, the same hopes and the same expectations as we do. They are counting on our continued help. I wish to express my appreciation to Parliament for the fact that this issue has such an important place in Parliament’s work, and to thank you very much for today’s meeting and for this discussion on the situation of the Roma in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Androulla Vassiliou, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">−</span> I would like to start by expressing, on behalf of the Commission, our deepest concern over the difficult situation that Roma people in Europe still face today. This issue is of great concern, not only to Mrs Reding, but to the whole Commission, and I personally am a member of the task force that was set up especially for this purpose. You will hear that I have also taken some very positive steps towards alleviating the position of the Roma population.</p>
<p class="contents">The Roma are Europe’s largest ethnic minority – and perhaps the least understood. They are certainly European citizens and they have exactly the same rights as we all have. Wherever they live, the Roma are often surrounded by an atmosphere of isolation, sometimes by outright hostility. This is a community that is regularly denied equal access to education, housing and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept this situation in Europe. We will not accept it. It goes against everything that Europe stands for – our values and our vision of a fair and inclusive society, free of discrimination, where every citizen can play a full part in social and economic life. We have to really help the Roma people take a full part in our life and in our communities.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, this year we have witnessed unprecedented progress in the development of a common EU approach in tackling the exclusion of the Roma from our societies. I am confident that this will lead to tangible improvements in the lives of the Roma people.</p>
<p class="contents">This progress is the result of the joint efforts of all the European institutions to improve the social and economic integration of Roma people in our society. The ‘EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies’ reflects a strong political commitment by all key players. For the first time, the Council in its conclusions calls on Member States to adopt an effective approach on Roma integration through national strategies or a set of policy measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has managed to keep Roma integration high on the political agenda, including in the current economic and financial context. Many of my colleagues have been involved and have ensured an inter-disciplinary approach to tackle this complex matter.</p>
<p class="contents">On 7 September 2010, the Commission set up a Roma Task Force in which several Commissioners (Reding, Andor, Malmström, Hahn and myself) worked hand in hand to assess how effectively Member States were using the available funds. The report of the Task Force, in December 2010, showed that there was no evidence of strong and proportionate measures in place in Member States to tackle the social and economic problems of a large part of the EU’s Roma population. The Commission concluded that this situation was neither acceptable nor sustainable.</p>
<p class="contents">This House – with support from the whole political spectrum – called for an EU Strategy and the Commission responded. We all agreed that there was a need for effective policy planning and implementation and there was a need for a strategic approach. For this reason, the Commission decided to set out an ‘EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies’.</p>
<p class="contents">This EU Framework was welcomed by all Member States, who recognised it as an important step towards a more socially cohesive Europe and expressed their commitment to its implementation at the highest political level of Heads of State and Governments. We have now reached the moment of truth about these commitments from Member States, who are expected to present their strategies by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress that the EU Framework calls on all Member States to ensure first of all that Roma are treated like any other EU citizen, with equal access to all fundamental rights. It also calls for the social inclusion of the Roma on such crucial issues as education, employment, health and housing. The EU Framework expresses the idea that the social and economic aspects of integration are complementary to the existing EU legislation and policies in the areas of non-discrimination, fundamental rights and free movement of persons. The Commission will not forget this aspect when assessing the national Roma integration strategies and reporting to Parliament and Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to these policy developments, the Commission has redoubled its efforts to make sure Member States correctly transpose and implement the existing legislation protecting the rights of the Roma people.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Commission is strictly monitoring the implementation and application of the Racial Equality Directive across all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission has taken all necessary measures within its power to ensure that all Member States respect the safeguards for citizens in the Free Movement Directive, but please let us not mix up evictions with expulsions. The various media reports concern both evictions and expulsions. As regards expulsions from the territory of a Member State, the Commission has no information about expulsions having taken place after the entry into force of the new French law, which is now considered to be in line with the Free Movement Directive. The evictions are subject to national law.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Commission is closely monitoring the transposition and implementation of the Council Framework Decision on combating racism and xenophobia. This Decision obliges Member States to penalise the intentional public incitement to violence and hatred against groups or individuals by reference to their race, colour, religion, descent or national or ethnic origin.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, the Commission is following closely recent developments in the EU Member States and strongly condemns all forms of racism and xenophobia, as these phenomena violate the most basic values of the European Union. Public authorities must unequivocally distance themselves from, and actively fight against, racist and xenophobic behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I would like to stress that the involvement of civil society and the active participation of the Roma in the preparation, implementation and monitoring of policies are crucial to the success of Roma inclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier this year, I signed an agreement with the Council of Europe to train 1 000 Roma mediators. Up to now we have already trained 600 of them. These people will work with local communities across Europe, building trust and helping Roma families to enjoy their full economic and social rights.</p>
<p class="contents">When we assess the Member States’ national strategies, the Commission will pay special attention to how Roma civil society is involved in policy-making and implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me welcome the European Parliament’s support for the preparation of the National Roma Integration Strategies. I know that you hosted a conference on this theme last week, and I congratulate you for your work.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope you will agree that the challenges facing our Roma citizens demand a joint effort from all EU institutions. While Member States carry the heaviest responsibility to guarantee the Roma people’s fundamental rights, the EU will both support their work and continue to ensure that European laws are fully respected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The latest statistics show that only 40% of Roma children finish their primary education, while the figure for secondary education is barely 10%. This in my view is a fundamental point, because children who do not go to school are children who will never have a future. As adults they will be condemned to certain poverty, social exclusion and unemployment, and in the worst-case scenario they are likely to end up in a web of exploitation and crime. Education and training must therefore be the priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view the Member States must guarantee the right to education and at the same time force Roma parents to fulfil their duty of sending their children to school. Such a measure is also to prevent children from being exploited as beggars, which many of them are in fact forced to become. Unless we take vigorous and urgent action on this front, all our plans and investments will be in vain. Therefore I think that, alongside these children’s right to health and vaccinations, stopping them from dropping out of school must be an absolute priority in the new strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have heard some very good speeches. However, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we actually wanted to hear facts in relation to how you see the current situation. After all, how many national strategies are there? What are these national strategies like that you already have access to? What are their shortcomings, what are their positive points?</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I am grateful for you mentioning the conference that we held in the European Parliament. At this conference, the civil society organisations spoke quite differently about the national strategies. They were extremely critical of many of them. You say that you will invite them to get involved in monitoring, but how will you do this? Will you organise an event in every country where you also invite civil society and ask what they actually think of their national strategies?</p>
<p class="contents">This is not the first debate that we have had on this matter. It is as if we are sitting here for the first time and need to be informed of what the Roma problem is. We are aware of these problems. We want to see action and initiatives. I do not mean to criticise you personally, but please tell your members of staff who write your speeches that they should now indicate concrete measures and state where the mistakes are and which national strategies are failing and which ones are good. We also want to see good examples. It is not about trying to create outrage by only giving negative examples. We have looked at these matters ourselves and we have seen good examples as well. It is possible to do something, also with the support of the European Union. However, the relationship between the money spent and what has actually changed in recent years is unacceptable. The amount of money that has been spent and what it has actually achieved is something the citizens would not understand either – perhaps also because many NGOs have received money that has not actually reached the Roma.</p>
<p class="contents">My final request is: please give us tangible facts next time rather than generalisations that we are already familiar with. As I said before, I say this with all due respect to you both as individuals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also, unfortunately, on the rise on certain benches in this Chamber, where it is fed by xenophobic remarks from a certain number of politicians.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to come back, once more, to the French situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry that Ms Reding is absent. It is not part of your brief, Commissioner, but I should have liked her to reply to us in person. A few weeks ago, she took some satisfaction, in fact, from [the fact that] – and I quote – ‘France has fully addressed the Commission’s concerns and introduced the necessary changes in the law’, including, and I quote again, ‘with regard to the safeguards protecting EU citizens from arbitrary expulsions and discriminatory treatment’.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say that the Council of Europe has just quite clearly contradicted Ms Reding’s remarks. I am calling on you, if you have not done so already, and on Ms Reding and Ms Radziszewska, to read the report of the European Committee of Social Rights. Some of my fellow Members have already quoted from it. This report contains an exhaustive catalogue of aggravated violations of human rights committed by the French authorities during the summer of 2010 and which continue today in the same circumstances. It has been brought to the attention of the Commission; NGOs have systematically apprised the Commission of these facts. They can be found in their entirety in the report, but the Commission has refused to initiate infringement proceedings on the grounds of discrimination, as had been the intention last autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission going to wait for the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union? The Charter of Fundamental Rights is now legally binding The Commission is the guardian of the treaties, it would seem. Under circumstances such as these, what is the point of the Anti-Discrimination Directive? How, Commissioner, does the Commission hope that it will be possible for national strategies to be implemented under such circumstances in France? Your services have not even been able to identify an interlocutor, yet they have to submit their report by the end of the year. This is self-delusion, a way of deferring the problem …</p>

Unemployment, the often complete lack of education and skills required on the labour market, and the associated discrimination and social exclusion leaves its mark on the future of the Roma within Europe as well. We can only fight their discrimination if we eliminate all such adverse conditions in the EU as for example certain Member States denying the existence of minorities within their territories, or some Member States even having laws in force that are based on the collective culpability of minorities. This, however, is not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also finance programmes that contribute to the social inclusion of Roma communities. We could do so by facilitating their entry to the labour market. Although the responsibility lies mainly with Member States having large Roma populations, the problem is a common one. The way on which we now embark towards the integration of the Roma people will influence the future of the whole of Europe. I sincerely hope that one decade from now we will be able to report significant success in this area, and that the changes will not only be measurable in statistical indicators but also in the everyday lives of the local communities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When she does speak, it is much more about expressing her satisfaction than addressing the problems. Meanwhile, the forceful expulsion of Roma continues in France. This affected nearly 600 people between April and October 2011. In Slovakia, there is a legislative draft offering Roma women free contraception and sterilisation. In the Northern Czech Republic, protesters have attacked a settlement inhabited by Roma. In Bulgaria, there has been a series of anti-Roma protests involving threats and radical demands. In Italy, 26% of Roma women reported having experienced police violence and humiliating treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">In almost all of Europe segregation in education and housing, and violence and hate speech against the Roma are commonplace. The Commission remains silent and, as mentioned here, is awaiting our Roma strategies, with regard to which we know that several Member States have indicated that they do not see their preparation as necessary. No sanctions exist. The anti-discrimination aspect of the whole strategy is very weak, almost nonexistent, and will therefore not be enforceable either. Member States will have to come up with anti-poverty social measures, the monitoring of which the Commission foresees to be fulfilled by the Fundamental Rights Agency, which has neither the capacity nor the experience necessary for this task. We are stating this on time: we expect the Commission to take action against all expressions of discrimination and arrange for the effective implementation of the strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, support NGOs and churches, in particular, in their Roma projects, as they foster fewer prejudices and work hard for Roma successes. Secondly, help to provide good education in safe and secure schools within the Roma communities. You need to be aware that in some Bulgarian villages only 80 out of the 2 000 children may get the chance to take the bus to school in the local town. Thirdly, give Roma children the opportunity to grow accustomed to an ordinary primary education from their fourth or fifth year. Include in this, above all, their parents and education both in Roma and Bulgarian cultural practice. Fourthly, push the Bulgarian authorities to recognise and actively support the role of Roma churches as bridge-builders between the Roma and Bulgarians, as rays of light in Roma ghettos that provide reinvigoration and courage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must point out that the Romanian Government has made major progress in drafting its national Roma inclusion strategy. In the six sectoral areas, the competent ministries – Labour, Education, Regional Development, Economy, Agriculture, Health, Culture and Interior – along with the local authorities will adopt roughly 63 clearly defined measures. I should emphasise that funding will be provided from each ministry’s budget. The strategy will not have its own budget. Its implementation and monitoring will be coordinated by the deputy prime minister, the General Secretariat of the Government and the National Agency for the Roma.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware of the problems that the Roma face. However, Romania’s responsibility is especially great as it has the largest Roma minority population in Europe. However, the way in which they are represented matters. This is why I would perhaps recommend that, in future European Parliament elections, the political parties offer a place eligible for a citizen of Roma origin. Commissioner, I would like to believe that this strategy will be successful throughout the EU. However, after seeing the populist and extremely non-European response by some governments when the issue was raised about Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen area, allow me to have some reservations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Simply adopting a non-binding European strategy is not effective. This has been proven by the fact that most Member States have not yet produced a national Roma inclusion strategy. Some Member States are not even considering adopting a strategy. The European Commission urgently needs to make them do this and not wait until the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time for the Roma integration issue to feature on the European agenda again, at the highest level. This is why I think that all these European taskforces which the Commissioner mentioned here before us also need to deal with the Roma issue as a specific matter, and not as an additional task. At the same time, the presidents of the Commission, Parliament and the European Council should also be involved in these taskforces. These Roma taskforces should ensure proper coordination between the agencies involved at European and national level and the involvement of local authorities and Roma communities, as main decision-makers, in the strategy’s effective implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">We can no longer afford to resort to half measures for dealing with this deep-rooted, shameful issue concerning the Roma situation which the European Union is facing.

However, they are not Roma problems, but the problems of all families living on the verge of extreme poverty. These families have problems with house, employment, and proper nutrition. They have limited access to education, health care and justice. They have problems with social acceptance. And ultimately they give up any efforts to get out of their dire situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We will not resolve any of these issues if we divide those affected into groups and pay special attention to each group. By speaking only of the Roma we are ignoring the facts. The fact is that many Roma have managed to make their mark professionally, are respected in their communities and are responsible parents. It is also a fact that there are many non-Roma homeless who have been pushed to the fringes of society, or have been abusing the social systems for a long time. If we want every citizen of the European Union to have equal access to fundamental rights, we should look at their social status, not their ethnicity.

<p class="contents">In April, the European Commission chose the option of European guidelines and national strategies. In December, the Member States will provide a plan, all being well. I would ask the Commission how far planning has got, are you confident that this will succeed and how will you ensure this? I ask this because, while we wait, we are far too often hearing quite alarming reports of things like an attack on Roma at a bus stop in Bulgaria with knuckledusters and slogans like ‘filthy gypsies’. In some Member States, far right political parties and politicians are ratcheting up an anti-Roma rhetoric and actions. Discrimination and violent attacks against the Roma are still happening all too often. Forced evictions also remain a major problem.</p>
<p class="contents">It is sad that nowhere in the EU is the situation rosy for Europe’s biggest minority. The need for strategies was absolutely critical. Nevertheless, aims and intentions are not enough. Some Member States, for example, do not want a target group policy. The Netherlands is one such State.</p>
<p class="contents">How will the Commission guarantee, with 27 different strategies, that sound and efficient solutions to the Roma issue will emerge? How does the Commissioner plan to coordinate this? The Roma are EU citizens with the same rights as all other citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Once again, we are having to be reminded that neither Europe nor the Member States are doing enough to improve the conditions in which these marginalised people find themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The persistence of severe poverty, exclusion and discrimination is broadly accepted. However, the measures that have been taken so far remain inadequate to the challenges. To a great degree, we are familiar with the answers to these problems. In addition to the fight for equal treatment and against all forms of discrimination, through ensuring full application of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, we must promote quality of life, inclusion and access to rights (particularly for children), the fight against organised crime and human trafficking, the effectiveness of women’s rights, access to quality education for all children, the encouragement of economic activity through training and integration through employment, and the effective mobilisation of European funds for specific projects.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need realistic projects, clear commitments and targets backed up by figures on the part of Member States before we can really see what progress has been made.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should like to point out that it is no use blaming this or that authority or looking for scapegoats. We must all roll up our sleeves, work together, and give witness, by our specific actions, to our political determination to make progress, for not only is integration a right, but it also brings with it obligations. That means that all of us must play our full part as partners.</p>
<p class="contents">It is up to us to find pragmatic answers to essential questions. How are we to come up with real strategies? How are we to support project organisers effectively? What concrete measures can Europe offer? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That makes us wonder whether the European integration strategy launched by the Commission, which leaves Member States with a great deal of room for manoeuvre, will enable real progress to be made against discrimination and as regards the economic and social condition of the Roma.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Council of Europe recently held the collective expulsions of Roma in France that began in summer 2010 to be discriminatory and contrary to human dignity on the grounds that they were based on ethnic origin, the expulsions are still taking place. Now, we know that they are utterly pointless, since the camps are rebuilt a stone’s throw away, in even worse conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore forced to conclude that the European Commission’s shows of disapproval have not led to any tangible results. Given that this is the case, how can you assure us that the Commission will take appropriate measures to penalise a state that deviates from the European strategy and the goals set by the Member States themselves?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, because, in my view, it is somewhat easy to make the country of origin solely responsible for integrating the Roma, I am relying on the Commission to act forcefully towards the host country as well. All European states have a responsibility to bear. To be sure, this position is not really the flavour of the month at a time when European solidarity has been found wanting.</p>
<p class="contents">I accordingly insist, Commissioner, that Ms Reding have sufficient determination when this deadline falls due. Not only is it essential that Member States submit their strategies by 10 December but we must above all also ensure that there is a genuine follow-up of how these strategies are effectively put into practice. The fact is that we can no longer be satisfied with words alone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This poem is a hymn to what drives the members of the Roma ethnic group. It symbolises man who refuses to bow to anything, man who is constantly on the move, constantly looking for opportunities to create something new; it symbolises cosmopolitanism.</p>
<p class="contents">In 21<span class="sup">st-century Europe, the Roma are, unfortunately a minority – as all the previous speakers have said – which is often repressed and excluded from society and from the structures of the State in which they live and move. Our very society often ignores and overlooks their rights. They are very often denied the right to live with us, a denial which obviously causes problems and which is recognised in the strategy we approved here in Parliament a few months ago, for which we have Mr Járóka to thank. That strategy sets the integration of the Roma as the Union objective for 2020.</span></p>
<p class="contents">In light of the national programmes for Roma which we expect to come out of this framework this year, the Commission must look on their social integration as a huge challenge and we are expecting much of the Commission on this point, Commissioner. We need to find practical ways of eliminating discrimination against them and to learn from those aspects of their way of life that tend to go beyond national borders within the European Union.</p>

The European Commission sought with its strategy national concepts and plans for resolving these issues by the end of this calendar year.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, policy in this area is only on paper at the moment, and Commissioner Reding’s absence today is further proof that the Commission is distancing itself from this policy. The national strategies adopted fail to reflect the specific nature of the Roma’s problems in Member States. They only represent the formal transfer of the framework with four key areas – education, health care, employment and housing policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In actual fact, some governments in Europe are pursuing, instead of real integration, a policy of ever-growing isolation of the Roma population because they provide cheap votes during elections. There is no clear-cut stance taken against political groups which openly advocate xenophobia and discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">The inaction of the institutions generates ethnic hatred and tension, which has unpredictable consequences, as happened recently in Bulgaria. At the time, the European media were really outraged, but the Commission remained silent.</p>
<p class="contents">My question today is: will there be sufficient exact criteria and controls from the European Commission and Council, which can be used to evaluate Member States in spring 2012 in terms of their Roma strategy? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nor is it enough to spout anti-discrimination rhetoric, and indeed not even traditional minority policy will solve the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a side issue. It is a problem that affects millions of people from the Šluknov Hook in Northern Bohemia right down to Bulgaria – millions of citizens of the European Union! Therefore, it is a European problem, and a serious European problem at that.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Ms Băsescu that we need more representatives of the Roma in the political institutions. If I look at what Ms Járóka is doing, I would say that we need more people like her. If I look at what the Hungarian Government is doing under Secretary of State Zoltán Balogh then I would say that we need more governments that take the situation that seriously and do not simply talk about strategies. We urgently need to ensure that Roma children are given access to the education systems, including both vocational training and school education. The family must be supported. Jobs must be created.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this is only possible with systematic deliberations that take a cross-border view, and also with the necessary resources, but not with the kind of rhetoric that we have heard in some cases here today.

The adoption of this document is undoubtedly an important step toward ending discrimination against the Roma in Europe, which has gone on for many years. Nevertheless, this document lacks concrete objectives and measures which would help to counteract people’s aversion to the Roma. In certain Member States, this aversion is reaching worrying proportions, in the form of persecution of representatives of this ethnic group.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore call for the Agency for Fundamental Rights to be asked to prepare a new, up-to-date report on the situation of the Roma in the European Union, together with conclusions and proposals. There is quite an odd situation in our Parliament: every Thursday we debate human rights violations around the world. However, there is no standing forum where breaches of such rights in the Member States of the European Union would be put up for debate. An analysis of the functioning of the Agency for Fundamental Rights in Vienna should be carried out in this respect. The Agency should submit an analysis of violations of minority rights in the Member States as soon as possible.

They choose to live on the margins of society so that they can act freely according to their own rules, and conforming to our regulations is the last of their concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">In Tuscany, the region I come from, a number of agreed repatriations were carried out, paid for out of everyone’s pockets. After agreeing to these repatriations – with ample compensation – these Roma people returned to the very same sites that they had left, making fools of everyone and the region most of all.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides, one cannot expect much from a culture in which theft is tolerated, if not actually admired. I therefore think it is pointless to carry on with this misguided European do-goodism. Over the centuries, history has taught us the true nature of the Roma. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Structural Funds provide the main source for narrowing the economic and social disparities. I regard their use for Roma integration as highly significant. These funds can help improve the infrastructure in poor communities, most often inhabited by Roma.

<p class="contents">Let me remind you that the strategy that we have adopted asks Member States to submit their national strategies by the end of the year. We have to wait until the end of the year to evaluate these national strategies, and we shall report to this House at the beginning of 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">And this is just the beginning. I assure you that these strategies will not remain empty promises. To take the case of the Free Movement Directive, the majority of Member States, including France, have already modified their laws or announced amendments – or at least this is what we have been told.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is closely monitoring how these Member States are delivering on their commitments. For those Member States not yet there, the Commission has made full use of its powers under the Treaty, and between April and October of this year launched infringement proceedings against 12 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Framework Decision on racism and xenophobia obliging Member States to penalise public incitement to violence or hatred against groups obliges Member States to provide that racist or xenophobic motivation of any offence constitutes an aggravating circumstance, or obliges judges to take this element into account in determining penalties.</p>
<p class="contents">This is particularly pertinent for attacks against Roma people, such as those which have taken place recently in Member States, but let me remind you that it is the national courts which will determine whether these statements were inciting hatred – not the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States were obliged to transpose the framework decision into their national legislation by 28 November. 22 Member States have notified their implementing measures, which the Commission is analysing. The missing five are Belgium, Estonia, Greece, Spain and Poland.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the other 22 have notified does not, of course, mean that they have transposed the framework decision. What we have done is appoint a group of experts to follow closely its transposition and implementation. The implementation report will be presented to us in 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind you that under the Treaty of Lisbon there is a transition period, and we cannot currently enforce the framework decision. We can only do this after 2013. So we shall have the report of the expert group by 2013. In 2014, we can take infringement measures against those countries which have not duly transposed this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">So I want to assure you that we shall not be sitting idle, waiting for things to happen on their own. We shall follow and monitor the issues very closely. Once we have received the national strategies at the end of the year, we shall monitor the situation and we shall decide what other measures to take next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thus, as Mrs Járóka said before, this is just the beginning of the road, but it is important that we, all 27 countries together and at all levels of work within the framework of the European Union, have taken this first step, because what is really important is that these changes we are making, these measures we are implementing, yield results, so that the everyday life of each Roma child will improve; we will give support to every adult person – women and men – and we will improve the situation of Roma families. It is important, however, to carry out all this with a gentle touch and a great deal of sensitivity and to try not to generalise and to stigmatise, because there is no collective responsibility. As in any other community there are good and bad, noble and less noble people and there are those, who do not want to do anything, but there are also exceptional talents. By failing to work with this community, we lose all those who deserve to be supported and lose all these unique rough diamonds, which might someday become jewels. There is no large Roma community in Poland and we have a programme for the Roma community, which has been running for 10 years now, so we are managing quite well, although this does not mean that there is not a lot more to be done. In connection with the activities in the framework of the Presidency in October of this year, when we held a Convention of the European Platform Against Poverty and Social Exclusion, and just two days ago in Poznań, where the European Equality Summit took place, we talked about the effectiveness of measures targeting excluded groups, including among others the Roma community, in order to include this aspect of local and regional activities, together with checks on the effectiveness of these measures on the ground, in order to reach out to every single person and in order to utilise European funds more effectively at local and regional level, in order to ensure a long-lasting effect. It is important that in Brussels, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, we will also have a meeting of the European Platform for Roma Inclusion, which will be the sixth such meeting. I hope that these annual meetings and the two-day discussions will also contribute to more effective measures aimed at the integration of the Roma community in the broad sense.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to speak about one more thing: I am a member of the Polish Sejm, and this year we adopted a resolution which proclaimed 2 August to be a Day of Remembrance of the Holocaust of the Roma and Sinti. On 2 August 1944, the final liquidation of the Gipsy camp in the German concentration camp Auschwitz-Birkenau took place. This is a day which will commemorate the Holocaust of the Roma as a community, a community which was stigmatised throughout the Second World War and liquidated only on grounds of their ethnic origin. We as the Polish Presidency have submitted a request to the President of Parliament, Jerzy Buzek, for the European Parliament also to adopt this day as the Day of Remembrance of the Holocaust of Roma and Sinti. I would like to take this opportunity to ask all of you, ladies and gentlemen, to support this initiative, in order to value the existence of the Roma and the tragedy they have experienced just a couple of decades ago, here in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I thank you very much for placing this item – that is, the integration of the Roma – on the agenda of the European Parliament. I know that these are long-term challenges. We must not forget about such difficult problems even in the most difficult times, particularly because we are already facing a crisis in every European country on an everyday basis. Therefore, we need all the more to increase our efforts to utilise funds effectively so that we are indeed effective in our actions, so that our European Roma really feel at home in Europe, in our countries. I would like to express great appreciation for the role which the European Parliament plays in this respect. Thank you very much. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that this is the only way we will manage to coordinate efforts to combat the historical tendency to exclude this group. This strategy sets out a series of common principles and objectives which must be followed either at EU level, or at Member State level, identifying four fundamental areas: education, employment, health and housing. Taking into account the fact that primary responsibility falls to the Member States, they need to make the required efforts to align their national strategies with the objectives set out in the European strategy. It is regrettable that, in the intervening months, we have seen very few positive changes and that merely a small fraction of available EU funds have been put to use by the Member States in projects for Roma inclusion. On the contrary, there have been various registered cases in recent months of violence and discrimination against Roma and certain Member States, like France and Hungary, have adopted allegedly discriminatory measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unlike previous debates on this topic, I welcomed the openness with which some colleagues talked about matters which have so far been taboo. The search for a solution for the Roma minority, representing 10 million people in the EU, will not be an easy one. Due to the fact that the attitude of the inhabitants of each country towards the Roma differs also on the basis of historical experience, it will be very difficult to search for a uniform strategy that is applicable across all Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The main problem facing the Roma population is the low level of education and, by extension, the lack of professional qualifications. Education presents an opportunity to gain a qualification, a profession and a job, which are prerequisites for Roma social integration. I believe that this is the main issue which the national strategies need to resolve. A national approach to this issue is not enough. Education programmes also need to adopt a cross-border approach to influence the section of the Roma population which has remained faithful to their nomadic traditions. The Member States of origin must make the biggest contribution to the Roma integration process, but the EU also has an extremely important role to play. The framework programmes must be devised and implemented in a similar manner in all Member States. Coordination is vital between the national Roma contact points. Exchanging information is also of paramount importance. Projects and measures which have achieved positive results in one Member State must be adopted and replicated in the other Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Promotion graduation of Roma at university level is crucial to empower Roma. Roma youth will be in a much more effective position to achieve social inclusion if they have good education. The significant participation of Roma professionals in formulating an implementing Roma policy is essential to their success. The EPSCO Conclusions included this essential element, but inclusion is not possible without participation.</p>
<p class="contents">While robust monitoring is outlined in the Framework, the mechanisms to ensure it need to be further developed. Effective monitoring would be easier if the role of the National Contact Points on Roma were clearer. In the EU Framework, these Contact Points are given a coordination and development role but the EPSCO Conclusions only refer to a monitoring role. The solution would be for another independent commission to undertake the evaluation. Experience in some Eastern European countries has shown that if the same body implements, monitors and develops policy; poor policy implementation is likely to result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was finally adopted this year, but their situation remains critical in some Member States. Even today discrimination and social exclusion, poverty, unemployment and prejudice are typical aspects of the situation of the European Union’s largest ethnic minority. What is even more serious is that European citizens of Roma origin are being denied the freedoms and rights guaranteed to EU citizens by the Treaties. They continue to be expelled without any right of appeal and treated as second-class citizens. Unfortunately, even the press sometimes contributes to their stigmatisation and to increasing the prejudices which are already deep-rooted in the minds of many. Greater involvement is required from the European Commission, the authorities in Member States and Roma community leaders in order to make a real improvement to their situation. I would like to end by asking the Commission to ensure that the fundamental rights of European citizens are respected, regardless of their ethnic origin. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is extremely disheartening, and makes one wonder, that despite the fact that the deadline is fast approaching, so far only Hungary and Romania have completed their ten-year strategic programmes, with Sweden having prepared a legislative draft on the subject. This unfortunate situation rightly reminds us of the shameful failure of the European programme entitled ‘Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005–2015,’ which the EU framework for Roma inclusion was actually meant to rectify and replace. It would be time for the European Union and its Member States to finally take not only the Gipsy population of over ten million who have been forced to the peripheries of society and are living in abject poverty, but at least as much themselves and their own commitments seriously. It is disgraceful that we cannot, or perhaps do not really wish to, give effect to our own decisions and agreements. Both from a moral and from an economic and political standpoint it is in our common European interest, and in the national interest of each Member State, that we put an end to this situation and set to work to put a commonly adopted EU Roma strategy into practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
