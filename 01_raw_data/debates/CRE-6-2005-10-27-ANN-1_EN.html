<p>(EN)I am grateful to the Honourable Member for reminding us of the continuing horror of childhood poverty and disease in the developing world. The Council indeed shares this concern.</p>
<p>It is clear that children form an essential facet of the EU's development policy, and the Council intends that this should be adequately reflected in the follow-up to the Millennium Development Goals Summit of September 2005, in the formulation of future EC development policy and during examination of the future Commission Communication on this subject.</p>
<p>In the Conclusions of 24 May this year, the Council firmly supported the programme of action to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis through external actions presented by the Commission at the end of April 2005. This programme provides for specific attention to be focused on children's rights and on the needs of orphans and vulnerable children, as well as on school security, particularly with regard to girls. The Commission provides a significant level of support through the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria as a way of supporting and helping to finance country plans for services essential to child health. The Commission also support the Global Alliance for Vaccine Immunisation, which is focused on helping countries improve child immunisation against disease. We plan a joint action by the EC and the Member States, in collaboration with the main international organisations in the sector, and with teachers and parents' associations in the partner countries is planned.</p>
<p>The joint statement of November 2000 on EU development policy is under review. A new interinstitutional statement on future EU development policy should be adopted shortly by the three institutions. Child protection is among the many subjects identified as possible thematic priorities by the Council.</p>
<p>Lastly, at the request of the Council, the European Commission intends to submit in 2006 a Communication on children in the context of development policy, so that all questions relating to children in developing countries, including reduction of the mortality rate, are dealt with consistently.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0812"></a>

<p>(EN)The UK is working with the Council, the European Commission and this Parliament, to progress gender mainstreaming throughout its Presidency. The UK Minister for Women and Equality, Meg Munn, addressed the European Parliament Women's Affairs Committee on 13 July 2005, to outline Presidency plans on gender equality, including the following initiatives;</p>
<p>on 30 September, the Presidency hosted a meeting of the European Commission High Level Group on Gender Mainstreaming, comprising representatives from every Member State. The main discussion item was the preparation of the Third Annual Report on Gender Equality, that is to be presented to the Spring European Council in March 2006;</p>
<p>and on 8-9 November, the Presidency will host an Informal meeting of Equality Ministers in Birmingham. Ministers will focus discussions on the EU Lisbon Strategy, in the context of "what works for women". They will exchange models of good practice on issues from education and skills for women, to worklife balance and childcare, to entrepreneurship and business creation for women.</p>
<p>The UK Presidency will also present a statement on gender equality to the Employment and Social Council on 8-9 December. It will outline EU progress towards implementation in acknowledgement of the tenth anniversary of the Beijing Platform for Action.</p>
<p>The Presidency is pleased with the EU's achievements in the field of gender equality and believes that progress has gone beyond purely creating a legislative framework. For example, the integration of gender equality into the employment policies of the Member States under the EU Employment Guidelines for 2005-2008 is a positive step forward in calling for "resolute action to increase female participation and reduce gender gaps in employment, unemployment and pay" as well as "better reconciliation of work and private life and the provision of accessible and affordable childcare facilities and care for other dependants".</p>
<p>However, the Presidency recognises that much work remains to be done and will continue to strive, in cooperation with the European Parliament and the Commission, towards achieving more progress in this area.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0829"></a>

<p>(EN)The fight against HIV/AIDS is a top priority for the EU in general and for the Council in particular, both in the context of poverty reduction (which is the overarching objective of the EU Development Policy) and in the framework of the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. The European Council, in the framework of the Multi-Annual Strategic Programme adopted in December 2003, agreed to give priority to ensuring improvements in aid effectiveness, coherence, co-ordination and complementarity in support of the primary objective of poverty reduction. This includes the fight against diseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.</p>
<p>On the basis of the Commission communication on a new coherent European Policy Framework for External Action to Confront HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis, the Council adopted in May 2005 a comprehensive Plan of Action on different areas of intervention, including proposals for the future implementation, monitoring and co-ordination of the EU action to confront HIV/AIDS and the other major poverty-related diseases.</p>
<p>As regards the issue of funding, all EU Member States are contributing to the global EU effort in fighting poverty diseases. In May 2005<a href="#defann_7_1" name="refann_7_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Council decided on a new collective European Union target of an ODA<a href="#defann_7_2" name="refann_7_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>/GNI ratio of 0.56% by 2010. This implies an additional EUR 20 billion a year in Official Development Assistance, part of which will certainly be spent on HIV/AIDS prevention, care and research.</p>
<p>EU Member States and the European Commission were founding members of the Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria in 2001 and the European Union is currently the Fund’s largest donor. The EU has so far provided more than US$2 billion to the Fund. At the Global Fund Replenishment Conference held in London on 6 September 2005 and chaired by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, EU Member States and the European Commission pledged an additional US$2.3 billion for 2006 and 2007, which will see Europe provide 60% of contributions to the Fund for that period.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>This report refers to studies which show that active exhibition programmes and temporary exhibitions tend to increase visitor numbers. In view of this, and given that only 300 of the 30,000 museums in Europe hold major temporary exhibitions on a regular basis, it is clear that the mobility of works of art, art collections and exhibitions has become an important issue for the European Union.</p>

This culminates in the possible application by the Council of sanctions set out in Article 104, paragraph 11. Member States outside the Euro area do not face sanctions or fines.</p>
<p>While the Commission has the right to initiate any recommendations for sanctions to be applied, the Council has the final say on excessive deficit procedures. This balance between the discretion of the Council and a clear procedural framework has not been questioned by any Member State in the negotiations leading to the recent revision of the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p>Both the existing range of sanctions and the 3% budget reference value were confirmed in the recent review of the Stability and Growth Pact and the ECOFIN Council unanimously adopted their report in March of this year.</p>

<p>(EN)As the Honourable Member will recall, one of the three key challenges highlighted by Tony Blair, in his keynote speech to this Parliament in June [and again earlier today], was how to respond to the challenge of globalisation, particularly the need to modernise the European Social Model.</p>
<p>As the European Council stressed at its meeting in March 2005, five years after the launch of the Lisbon Strategy, the results are mixed. Alongside undeniable progress, there are serious shortcomings and delay in Europe’s delivery on its ambitious reform commitments. We only have to look at the figures on potential growth and productivity to recognise the scale of the challenge. EU Heads agreed the need for action in March and committed to reinvigorating the Lisbon Strategy, with a particular focus on “jobs and growth”. The submission of National Reform Programmes by each Member State is an important demonstration of this renewed commitment.</p>
<p>It’s vital to focus on delivering the results that matter to our citizens. With around 19 million people unemployed across Europe, and almost half of them long-term unemployed, its clear that much progress needs to be made. For that, we need concerted effort - between Member States, the European Commission and the European Parliament. We need to clearly identify where EU level action is needed and where national and indeed regional governments are best placed to deliver the necessary changes. As the Commission’s paper for the Informal Heads of Government Meeting tomorrow makes clear, “with growth, and more Europeans in more productive jobs, we can achieve the outcomes which meet Europeans’ expectations and values.”….“modernisation is essential to continue to keep Europe’s historically high levels of prosperity, social cohesion, environmental protection and quality of life.”</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0855"></a>

<p>(EN)The Council hopes that, by holding, for the first time ever, of a Euro-Mediterranean Summit of Heads of State and Government on 27-28 November, it will indeed increase the visibility of the Barcelona Process. The event will celebrate the 10th Anniversary of the Barcelona Declaration and give a strong signal in support of the Barcelona Process. The intention is to adopt a Declaration of commitments and a five year work programme with concrete medium term commitments on essential economic, educational, governance, counter-terrorism and migration reforms. This will contribute to making the Process more visible and meaningful and also more relevant to the citizens of the region. The upcoming Summit will also be an opportunity to underline the need to strengthen dialogue at all levels, including between regional and local administrations.</p>
<p>The Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference held in Luxembourg on 30-31 May 2005 recognised the need to bring the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership closer to citizens’ concerns and acknowledged the importance of cities and regions in the area: local and regional authorities need to be more closely involved in, take stock of their common challenges and exchange experiences and best practices.</p>
<p>The European Neighbourhood Policy should enhance the Barcelona Process by building on its achievements and by encompassing measures to develop its regional and national dimensions. With regard to the EU technical and financial support to the Euro-Mediterranean region, the Commission has submitted a proposal for a ENPI (European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument) draft Regulation.

<p>(EN)The retirement measures to which the Honourable Member refers were introduced in the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities, which entered into force on 1 May 2004.</p>
<p>They form part of an in-depth reform of retirement arrangements for officials which, in particular, raised the minimum pensionable age from 60 to 63 and the minimum age for early retirement from 50 to 55. These decisions affect not only new officials but also, with transitional measures, those in service before the reform's entry into force.</p>
<p>The only officials who would benefit from transitional measures permitting them to retire at 50 would be those who were at least 45 years of age as of 1 May 2004. Moreover, the transitional measures also include financial disincentives for those choosing to retire before the age of 65.</p>
<p>The reform of the Staff Regulations was the most significant part of the EU's work to modernise the institutions under the last Commission.

<p>(EN)Climate Change is happening. The overwhelming scientific consensus is that it is caused by emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities. This has been accepted and re-iterated by the European Union’s Heads of State and government, most recently at this year’s Spring Council meeting. The European Council acknowledged that climate change is likely to have major negative global environmental, economic and social implications. It confirmed that, with a view to achieving the ultimate objective of the United Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change, the global annual mean surface temperature increase should not exceed 2ºC above pre-industrial levels.</p>
<p>A first step to achieve this target is through the Kyoto Protocol. The EU is committed to meeting its Kyoto target through a series of cost-effective mitigation policies, such as the EU emissions trading scheme. The Commission has also recently put forward a Green Paper on Energy Efficiency which sets out a series of cost-effective options to significantly reduce the EU’s energy consumption. These policies will also have other important benefits, such as strengthening the security of the EU’s energy supply. Under the new phase of the European Climate Change Programme, the Commission will review progress and explore new actions to systematically exploit cost-effective emission reduction options.</p>
<p>The EU will maintain its leadership on climate change policy. However, in discussions on the future international climate change regime, the EU will call for broad international participation on the basis of common but differentiated responsibility, in order to ensure the efficiency of the regime.</p>
<p>The EU will also need to adapt to unavoidable climate change. Member States are already taking various initiatives. The Commission will explore the EU’s role in adaptation policies in view of the need to integrate adaptation fully into EU policy making under the new phase of the European Climate Change Programme, which started<a href="#defann_30_1" name="refann_30_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> with the ECCP stakeholder conference in Brussels.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The Commission can confirm that the Waste Incineration Directive<a href="#defann_31_2" name="refann_31_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> is not intended to discourage uses of waste as competitive and efficient alternative energy sources, and agrees that it is desirable that it does not have such an effect. Indeed, it favours all uses of waste that can contribute to sustainable development. In this respect, the aim of the Directive is to prevent or to limit as far as practicable negative effects on the environment, in particular pollution by emissions into air, soil, surface water and ground water, and the resulting risks to human health, when waste is incinerated or co-incinerated.</p>
<p>The Directive will only apply to the burning of tallow if it takes place in an incineration or co-incineration plant, and the tallow is considered “waste” as defined under the Waste Framework Directive<a href="#defann_31_3" name="refann_31_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. In practical cases, it is the competent authorities of the Member States that will assess on whether or not tallow is waste.</p>
<p>The Commission has recently received a number of representations suggesting that the costs of applying the Directive at rendering plants and slaughterhouses outweigh the benefits and will inhibit their use of tallow as a fuel. It is unfortunate that this issue has only been raised recently, and so close to the implementation deadline, even though the Directive was adopted by the Council and the Parliament five years ago, but nevertheless we must still deal with it. The Commission recognises that there is a problem in this respect, and that this issue needs to be further investigated. In this context, the Commission’s services have been instructed to undertake further analysis.</p>
<p>The Thematic Strategy on prevention and recycling of waste will contain measures to improve the implementation of the waste definition. This will address the issue of by-products and the specification of when particular wastes cease to be waste.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)Over the last 4 years, the EU has launched a broad strategy to improve the regulatory environment and thus provide a more effective, efficient and transparent regulatory system for the benefit of citizens and reinforce competitiveness, growth and sustainable development, contributing to the Lisbon’s objectives.</p>
<p>The Commission proposed in June 2002 a comprehensive Action Plan for ‘simplifying and improving the regulatory environment’<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and in February 2003 presented an ambitious simplification programme designed to simplify and up-date the existing EU legislation, and reduce its volume<a href="#defann_32_2" name="refann_32_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In March 2005, the Commission adopted a communication on “Better Regulation for Growth and Jobs<a href="#defann_32_3" name="refann_32_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> as a contribution to re-launch the Lisbon strategy, announcing its intention to launch a new phase of its simplification programme by October 2005 building on sectoral approach and with extensive stakeholder involvement.</p>
<p>The Commission attaches great importance to proper and better implementation of environmental legislation. It has engaged in a continuous codification and consolidation programme, which includes, inter alia, Community environmental legislation. As of October 2005, codification is ongoing in respect of acts in fields such as water protection and nature conservation.</p>
<p>But, far beyond codification and what could be seen a looking backward approach, the Commission has, as already said, committed itself to improve the lawmaking process by assessing the impacts of new proposals, holding public consultations and ensuring that policy options are suitable for effective implementation on the ground; the Commission intends to develop further this new approach. This commitment finds its demonstration in particular in the preparation of seven thematic strategies for the environment, which will greatly contribute to modernising environmental policy and legislation. The first thematic strategy was adopted by the Commission on 21 September 2005 and concerns air quality. It will lead, inter alia, to five pieces of existing legislation being merged into one comprehensive ambient air quality Directive. The forthcoming thematic strategy on waste prevention and recycling will also entail, as a follow-up measure, the recast and repeal of four waste Directives. A similar exercise should also be undertaken in the coming years in the field of emissions from industrial installations. These initiatives should be part, among others, of the simplification rolling programme the Commission will adopt in principle on 25 October 2005.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)Our environment is endangered by very important threats and pressures. The Commission remains firmly committed to tackling and pursuing all three dimensions of Sustainable Development, including its environment component, in an integrated and balanced manner and in full compliance with the subsidiarity and proportionality principles. This is reflected in this year’s work programme.</p>
<p>The review of the Sustainable Development Strategy is ongoing and the Thematic Strategies called for in the 6<span class="sup">th</span> Environment Action Programme were all foreseen for adoption in the 2005 Commission Legislative and Work Programme. There has been no decision to remove them from the Work Programme or to deliberately delay their adoption.</p>
<p>Rather, given that the review of the Sustainable Development Strategy and the Thematic Strategies are important initiatives that include actions to be taken in many sectors (e.g. agriculture, industry) and concern directly EU citizens, the Commission wants to give them very careful consideration. For instance, the Commission held an orientation debate on the Thematic Strategies in July which showed general support for maintaining ambitious but realistic objectives for the environment. The review of the Sustainable Development Strategy has involved a step-wise approach with extensive stakeholder consultations in 2004 and 2005, a first Commission Communication in February 2005 about the main orientations of the review and adoption of a declaration on guiding principles by the European Council in June.</p>
<p>We are now in a final phase. The Commission adopted the first Thematic Strategy on Air pollution, on 21 September. The Marine Strategy is scheduled for adoption this month and will contribute to addressing some of the issues the Honourable Member is specifically concerned about.</p>
<p>Four Strategies will be adopted in November and December 2005. The remaining Pesticides Strategy will come in 2006 given that two substantial measures to be referred to in the Strategy the revision of Directive 91/414/EEC on placing pesticides on the market and the Eurostat proposal on pesticide statistics will not be ready in 2005. It makes sense to wait until these proposals are ready and present one single package of measures.</p>
<p>The revised Sustainable Development Strategy is scheduled for adoption by the Commission in December.

<p>(EN)The Commission’s legislative and work programme foresees the adoption of all Thematic Strategies in 2005. There has been no decision to delay their adoption.</p>
<p>Rather, given that the Thematic Strategies are important initiatives that include actions to be taken in other sectors (e.g. agriculture, industry) the Commission held an orientation debate on them in July. This showed general support for maintaining ambitious objectives for the environment. The Commission therefore confirmed that it was necessary to bring forward the Thematic Strategies in 2005.</p>
<p>Current planning foresees the adoption of six of the seven Strategies in 2005. The Commission adopted the first, on Air pollution, on 21 September. The Marine Strategy is scheduled for adoption this month. The 5 remaining ones will be adopted in the last months of the year. The Pesticides Strategy will come in 2006 given that two substantial measures to be referred to in the Strategy the revision of Directive 91/414/EEC on placing pesticides on the market and the Eurostat proposal on pesticide statistics will not be ready this year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0840"></a>

<p>At the meeting of the Council's committee of experts on 19 September 2005, France placed on the agenda (document: ENV/05/11) a debate on the issue of how to interpret Article 25 of Directive 2001/18/EC concerning the confidentiality of data relating to a GMO dossier. Furthermore, on 8 April 2005, the French committee on access to administrative documents delivered an opinion stating that only information relating to the process for producing a GMO or the marketing thereof, the divulging of which might harm the competitive position of the company applying for authorisation, may be regarded as protected by the obligation laid down in Article 25. The decision by the Münster Court of Justice of 20 June 2005 to force Monsanto to publish its 'confidential' toxicological study on genetically modified maize MON 863 was along similar lines. We consider that toxicological and environmental studies drawn up within the context of the risk assessment for a GMO must be made available to the public, pursuant to Article 25(4) and Annex II (C.2) to Directive 2001/18/EC<a href="#defann_35_1" name="refann_35_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Does the Commission agree? If not, on what legal and political grounds?

<p>(EN)Directive 2001/18/EC, on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) into the environment, stipulates that it is the competent authority of the Member State, not the Commission, which decides, after consultation with the notifier of the GM product, which information in the notification should be kept confidential. The Directive also specifies certain information which can in no case be kept confidential. Apart from this, the Member State competent authority is required to respect national legislation in this domain as well as to protect the competitive position of the notifier in its decisions on confidentiality.</p>
<p>There are currently differing opinions among Member States on whether the disclosure of documents such as toxicological studies could be harmful to the competitive position of a notifier and should therefore be treated as confidential. This is why France raised this question at the meeting on 19 September. It is important that Member States and the Commission exchange information on this issue so as to ensure consistency in decision-making. As a general principle, the Commission considers that it is preferable to be as transparent as possible and to limit confidentiality to aspects of the notification which represent a real risk to the competitive position of the notifier. It also considers that documents required for the analysis of a risk assessment should be made available to the public.</p>
<p>The Commission has asked the Member States to submit, in writing, the principles applied in practice in the Member States regarding confidentiality under Directive 2001/18/EC. There will then be a fuller discussion at the next meeting of the competent authorities, provisionally scheduled for 8 November 2005.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The River Pinios is of vital importance for preserving and developing the ecosystem of Thessaly. According to recent measurements, it is one of the most polluted rivers in Europe, with all the adverse implications that has for the ecosystem. This state of affairs is attributable to the discharging of waste from industries, slaughterhouses, dye-works etc., the dumping of refuse from various municipalities and residues of pesticides and fertilizers.</p>
<p>Will the Commission support measures which prevent the further pollution of the river and help restore the ecosystem?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>(EN)The Honourable Member’s question about the pollution of the River Pinios raises the issue of implementation of EU environmental legislation. There are already a number of instruments in Community environmental legislation which Member States can use to reduce the pollution of rivers and to improve the quality of associated ecosystems. For example, the Water Framework Directive requires Member States to achieve good quality of all waters by 2015. This demands that Member States take a step-by-step approach, which consists, firstly, in the analysis of pressures and impacts, secondly, in the identification and elaboration of the necessary measures to reach the good quality of all waters, and, finally, in the implementation of these measures. Equally, the implementation of a number of other Directives is expected to be relevant in this context. This is for example the case of the Directive on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control, of the Nitrates Directive and of the Habitats Directive.</p>
<p>Appropriate EU legislative instruments, therefore, already exist in this area. The problems mentioned by the Honourable Member in his questions are due to a lack of correct implementation of the existing legislation.</p>
<p>In this context, the Commission is particularly worried that Greece is one of only two EU countries which have not yet delivered the crucial first step of the Water Framework Directive, the environmental assessment of pressures and impacts under this Directive.</p>
<p>Consequently, the Commission has commenced a legal procedure against Greece for not complying with the relevant provisions of the Directive. A few days ago, on 18 October 2005, the Commission has sent final warnings to Greece – as well as to Italy and Spain – for not complying with basic provisions under the EU Water Framework Directive. The timely designation of their river basin districts, which should have been done already in June 2004, is one of the important building blocs needed to achieve good quality of all water resources.</p>
<p>These legal steps are complementary to already ongoing scrutiny of the implementation of the Directive on Nitrates Pollution from Agricultural Sources and the Habitats Directive. In relation to this latter, the Commission refers for more detail to its response to written question <a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2005-1700_EN.html">E-1700/05</a> by Mr Dimitrios Papadimoulis.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Commission would like to recall the comprehensive funding instruments that are available for water protection and to assist in implementation of the Community acquis when the funding conditions are met. This is particularly the case for the Cohesion Fund Regulation and the Rural Development Regulation under the new Common Agricultural Policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0824"></a>

<p>This should become operational already by the end of this year. This is good – the Peacebuilding Commission fills a current gap in the UN system. It should allow the international community to respond to the needs of countries emerging from a conflict in a more effective and coordinated way, and ensure a better transition from immediate post-conflict assistance to the development of strategies for a peaceful and sustainable development in the longer term.</p>
<p>As Europeans we can bring leadership and expertise to the Peacebuilding Commission, based on our longstanding experience of peacebuilding all over the world.</p>

<p>Gender equality is a fundamental principle of the EU’s foreign and security policy and external relations. The EU is in this context fully committed to implementing UN Security Council Resolution 1325 of October 2000 concerning women, peace and security.

<p>(EN)The Commission attaches great importance to Parliament’s contribution to shaping the Union’s foreign policy. Together with other RELEX Commissioners, the Commissioner in charge of External Relations made this clear during the confirmation hearings of this Commission and the Commission values the constructive two-way exchanges with Parliament on this important policy area.</p>
<p>The Parliament’s formal role in the Common Foreign and Security Policy/European Security and Defence Policy is defined by the limits of the Treaties. But in practical terms the Parliament has made full use of its consultative and supervisory opportunities.</p>
<p>The Commission sees foreign policy in a broader sense covering the full range of external actions of the European Union including development policy and trade policy. Other first pillar policies, such as the environment, energy, research and transport, also all have an important external dimension, and the Parliament exercises important powers as co-legislator and as one arm of the budgetary authority. Besides this, the Commission is attentive to the need for Parliament’s assent to the accession of new Member States and the conclusion of certain international agreements. Indeed, in the revised Framework Agreement between our two institutions, the Commission has renewed and even heightened its commitment to keeping the Parliament informed about the negotiations for and conclusion of international agreements.</p>
<p>The Commission sees the Parliament as a valuable player in projecting European values around the world. This it does by means of its work in the Election Observation Missions, where this Commission has been happy to continue the tradition of appointing Members of Parliament as Chief Observers; by means of the continuing dialogue with parliaments around the world carried on in the inter-parliamentary delegations, and participation of Members of the Parliament as observers at international conferences such as the recent United Nations summit in New York where, as stated on an earlier occasion, the Commission very much appreciated the contribution of the Parliament delegation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Commission sees a very important role for the Parliament in foreign policy and external relations and it continues to consider a good working relationship with the Parliament and its committees as vital for the conduct of a strong and efficient European foreign policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0833"></a>

<p>Generally speaking, mechanisms of consultation and of political dialogue are set out in all these agreements with third countries.

For instance, in the Cotonou Partnership Agreement between the EU and ACP<a href="#defann_40_1" name="refann_40_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> countries, specific provisions under articles 9 and 97 are made for consultations between partners for serious corruption cases which can lead to appropriate measures, suspension of cooperation being the last resort. The fight against corruption is an issue considered in the preparation and the implementation of all EC development cooperation programmes. A standard clause for the fight against fraud and corruption is included in all the models of the financing agreements concluded by the Commission with beneficiary countries.</p>
<p>In accordance with the EC Development policy, good governance (and hence the protection of Human Rights) is considered as a cross cutting theme and is therefore systematically taken into account while designing and implementing the Commission's cooperation programmes.</p>
<p>Support to Human Rights and Democratisation is a priority area of EU cooperation with third countries. For the period 2000 to 2005, more than € 1 billion has been allocated by the Commission for programmes in developing countries and countries in transition providing technical and financial assistance in the following fields: Democratisation, Human Rights, Rule of Law, Elections, Support to Parliaments, Support to the Judiciary and good Governance.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In relation to the Barcelona process, which celebrates its 10th anniversary next month, I should like to ask about the new European neighbourhood and partnership instrument. This is one of the six future instruments of EU external relations which will be implemented as from 2007. While it was undoubtedly necessary to rationalise the existing instruments, I nonetheless wonder whether instrument proposed by the Commission, which covers a heterogeneous group of countries and members of different partnerships, can really be effective. How does the Commission plan to meet the specific needs of Mediterranean partner countries which face real economic problems and demographic challenges? How will it manage to maintain adequate funding for combating poverty through this instrument, given that some of the countries covered by the neighbourhood instrument are also developing countries which will therefore no longer be eligible for funding from the new European development cooperation and economic cooperation instrument. More specifically, will this instrument refer to the aid required by these countries to achieve the Millennium Goals?

<p>(EN)Through the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) the EU aims at promoting an area of stability, prosperity and friendly neighbourhood involving both our Eastern and Southern Neighbours.</p>
<p>The ENP works on the basis of bilateral Action Plans that identify priorities for action. Action Plans are jointly agreed with each partner, and keyed to its particular needs and capacities.</p>
<p>The European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), which should be operational from 2007 and replace both Co-operation Instrument financing assistance to Southern Mediterranean Countries (MEDA) and Technical Assistance to the Community of Independent States (Tacis), is a policy driven instrument, specifically conceived to support the ENP and the implementation of the ENP Action Plans.</p>
<p>Experience shows that linking more closely assistance and policy increases ownership and impact.</p>
<p>Many neighbouring countries are developing countries (not only across the Mediterranean). Thus ENPI has sustainable development and poverty reduction among its explicit objectives.</p>
<p>“Poverty reduction” and other Millennium Development Goals (MDG) objectives are Action Plan priorities. They will be part of our policy dialogue and supported with community assistance.</p>
<p>The specific needs and circumstances of each country, already reflected in ENP Action Plans where these have been adopted, will also be fully taken into account in our country programming.</p>

Kaliningrad is making good use of the economic opportunities created by the EU enlargement.</p>
<p>Kaliningrad is a unique region, which deserves and gets exceptional attention from the EU. It is easy to agree that Kaliningrad should become an example of successful EU-Russia cooperation. But, it is difficult to see how it could become a ‘pilot project’ of EU-Russia cooperation. Development of regional legislation must be in line with the legislation of the Russian Federation. Tax benefits granted to Kaliningrad can hardly be made a general practice in Russia. And extension of similar amounts of EU-assistance to other regions of Russia would be financially impossible.</p>
<p>With regard to movement of people, the recently initialled Agreement on visa facilitation will ensure easier travel and contacts of people between the EU and Russia through a number of simplified procedures for issuing short-term visas.

<p>(EN)Issues of human rights and democratisation are regularly raised under our political dialogue on the occasion of the annual meetings of the EU-Kazakhstan Co-operation Council in the framework of the Partnership and</p>
<p>Co-operation Agreement and, in the Sub-committee on Justice and Home Affairs.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan’s progress in democratisation and protection of human rights is significantly slower than its progress in establishing a market economy.</p>
<p>Particularly worrisome issues are the excessive accumulation of powers in the person of the President and the institutional system of the country, the strong dependence of the judiciary on the executive, excessive control over the civil society by the security services and systemic corruption.</p>
<p>However, some positive aspects should be also mentioned, notably the introduction of an open-ended moratorium on the death penalty and the establishment of an Ombudsman. The Commission, amongst other things, is urging the complete abolition of the death penalty and the strengthening of the Ombudsman.</p>
<p>The Commission is monitoring with concern recent developments during the election campaign through the Commission Delegation in Almaty and is aware of a number of developments currently taking place in Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>The media situation is worsening with the closure of several newspapers following doubtful Court decisions, forcible removal from circulation of regularly registered newspapers, and pressure on private dealers and media distributors.</p>
<p>Political freedom is deteriorating with repeated detentions of representatives of the democratic opposition, dispersals of peaceful demonstrations, a case of arson attack against a local office of Mr Tuyakbai, the opposition candidate for President, and use of official resources to obstruct opposition parties in disseminating their campaign materials and ideas.</p>
<p>A number of control visits to non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and opposition movements’ premises by law-enforcement bodies have been reported. Wide-ranging pressures on State employees and students to induce them to vote for the President in office have been independently confirmed.</p>
<p>The Commission has on several occasions underlined that only free and fair elections in line with the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) commitments would give a real chance to Kazakhstan for its bid to chair the OSCE in 2009. It is only this basis that the EU should consider its support for the Kazakhstan’s bid for the OSCE Chairmanship in 2009.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to draw the attention of the Parliament, and specifically of the Honourable Members who will monitor the elections, to the key issue concerning Kazakhstan Presidential elections. An electronic voting system is expected to be introduced in up to 20% of polling stations around the country which could involve up to 35% of voters. The system lacks manual audit capabilities, does not provide a paper trail, and provides widespread opportunities for abuse. Moreover, the prevalent opinion is that the system violates the secrecy of the vote. There is a need to tackle the question of acceptable international election control/verification standards and to satisfactory agreed norms in this respect.</p>
<p>The Commission is very well aware of the Law on Political Parties adopted in Kazakhstan in July 2002. This law, amongst other things, raised the threshold for minimum party membership from 3.000 to 50.000. It should be noted that the population in Kazakhstan is about 15 million people. This law still represents a threat to political pluralism and is still a hindrance to the full development of political parties.</p>
<p>The Commission supported the OSCE/ODIHR (Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights), that gave its expert opinion of the new Law On Political Parties concluding that the new registration procedures impose a “substantial restriction on the freedom of association and on the rights of citizens to establish political parties” and consequently “restrict the participation of citizens in political and democratic processes”.</p>
<p>However it should also be noted that it is exactly this Law that obliged the opposition to gather its forces. The unified opposition block “For a Just Kazakhstan” put forward a single presidential candidate as a result of this Law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0765"></a>

<p>On Tuesday September 13, 2005 the Guardian newspaper reported that a Chinese cosmetics company is using skin harvested from the corpses of executed convicts to develop beauty products for sale in Europe. Agents for the firm have told would-be customers it is developing collagen for lip and wrinkle treatments from skin taken from prisoners after they have been shot. The agents say some of the company's products have been exported to the UK (and most likely to other EU states), and that the use of skin from condemned convicts is 'traditional' and nothing to 'make such a big fuss about'. Doctors and politicians say the discovery highlights the dangers faced by the increasing numbers seeking to improve their looks.

<p>(EN)The Commission is appalled by the information put forward by the Honourable Member, concerning the fact that skin harvested from the corpses of executed convicts may be used to develop beauty products for sale in Europe.</p>
<p>First of all human collagen for lip and wrinkle treatment is not considered as a cosmetic product under Community legislation. The Commission would like to note also that in any case, because of the risk of transmission of communicable diseases, the EU law prohibits the use of human cells, tissues and products of human origin in cosmetic products.</p>
<p>Therefore, those products fall under the scope of the Tissues and Cells Directive.</p>
<p>This directive was adopted by the European Union in March last year and establishes the quality and safety requirements for human tissues and cells. This Directive does not allow practices such as those described in the media in relation to obtaining collagen for beauty products.</p>
<p>The Directive (2004/23/EC) ensures that the increasing number of patients in Europe, who are treated with human tissues and cells, can trust that these substances are safe and also of good quality.</p>
<p>The Tissues and Cells Directive includes provisions on standards, among other things, for the donation of human tissues and cells. It also deals with the requirements for the authorisation of their procurement and the authorisation of the tissue establishments that undertake activities covered by the Directive.</p>
<p>The Directive also incorporates a provision to regulate import of tissues and cells from third countries. The Directive states clearly that Member States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that all imports of tissues and cells from third countries are undertaken by tissue establishments authorised for that purpose. Member States and tissue establishments, which receive such imports, shall ensure that they meet standards of quality and safety equivalent to the ones laid down in the Directive.</p>
<p>The Directive also states as a matter of principle that tissue and cell application programmes should be founded on the philosophy of voluntary and unpaid donation, altruism of the donor and solidarity between donor and recipient. Article 13 states that “The procurement of human tissues or cells shall be authorised only after all mandatory consent or authorisation requirements in force in the Member State concerned have been met”.</p>
<p>The Directive has to be transposed into national law by no later than 7<span class="sup">th</span> April 2006.</p>
<p>Once in force, the Directive will explicitly respond to the concerns expressed in the Parliamentary question.</p>
<p>However, Member States cannot escape their responsibility that the key elements, in particular those of the ethical nature, of the Directive are enforced already today.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to assure the Honourable Member that it will examine further the information provided.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0778"></a>

<p>Goods are often traded today with a percentage mark-up, which puts goods within the same product group with a high cost price at a competitive disadvantage, making it difficult to compete with high-quality goods. A mark-up in 'kronor, euro etc.' would improve the situation and make for a more level playing field. For example:</p>
<p>Last week, the cost price of conventionally grown tomatoes was SEK 8; the cost price of organic tomatoes was SEK 14. A percentage mark-up of 100% produces a trading price of SEK 16 and SEK 28. The difference in price between the tomatoes increases from SEK 6 to SEK 12 per kilo. The handling cost is approximately the same and, therefore, does not justify a bigger mark-up; only VAT should have such an effect.</p>
<p>Is it possible for organic growers to claim that this is restraint of competition and contrary to legislation since they are disadvantaged compared with conventional growers?</p>

<p>(EN)The Honourable Member is concerned about the allegedly fixed mark-ups that retail stores practice on agricultural products. He cites cases where the retail stores practice results in higher mark-ups (in absolute terms, e.g. in Euros) on organic products. He asks if such higher mark-ups are against competition rules and if the agricultural producers and retailers of a country could under competition rules enter agreements to fix mark-ups in Euros/crowns per product group.</p>
<p>Community competition rules do not prevent individual retail stores to set their mark-ups as they wish.</p>
<p>In the case at hand higher mark-ups for organic products may reflect the high demand for such products rather than an attempt to discriminate against them.</p>
<p>There are no Community provisions imposing same mark-ups for conventional and organic products, neither in per cent nor in certain amounts of money.</p>
<p>Article 81 (1) (a) of the Treaty prohibits fixing directly or indirectly purchase or selling prices or any other trading condition. Therefore any price fixing between private parties may constitute a violation of Community law, if such price fixing affects the trade between the Member States.</p>
<p>Without knowing the details of the case and the products involved it is impossible to say whether certain agreements between private parties on prices constitute price fixing prohibited by Article 81 (1) or a violation of the applicable Common Market Organisation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0781"></a>

<p>Rising oil prices, the fight against atmospheric pollution, the fire in the Frejus tunnel, road safety, the cost of infrastructure deteriorating under the impact of road freight – everything today points to the absolute priority that must be given to developing rail transport in order to counteract the saturation of our roads.</p>
<p>The review of the 2001 Transport White Paper is getting off to an inauspicious start. Not only are the major rail infrastructure projects at a standstill from lack of funding, but also, on 12 July, the Transport Commissioner Jacques Barrot attended a meeting of the road transport employers’ association which was clearly intended, in the run-up to the review of the White Paper, to promote the roads at the cost of the railways.</p>
<p>Mr Barrot is alleged to have said at the meeting, for example, that he would ‘pay more attention to the relevance of investment in the railways’, and that he would not be opposed to the new Member States’ investing in motorways, while indicating that road tolls for lorries weighing over 3.5 tonnes should be very reasonable.</p>

<p>(FR)The Commission is currently working on a review of the White Paper scheduled for early 2006, which entails a wide-ranging consultation process with all of the sectors and the stakeholders concerned.</p>
<p>This consultation process does not in any way undermine the objectives of the White Paper and the Commission’s political commitment to helping develop rail transport. The adoption of the first and second rail packages are evidence of the progress that has been made. The Commission remains committed to the adoption of the third package. Without wishing to pre-empt the outcome of the mid-term review, we see the issue in terms of two key axes:</p>
<p>The first is the improvement of the infrastructure, especially that of rail transport. It should be remembered that, of the 30 Trans-European network priority projects, 22 are rail projects; in other words, 80% of investment. The Commission has demonstrated the proactive nature of its policy by proposing in the financial perspective 2007-2013 a Community budget that allows for sufficient leveraging. The decision rests with the Council and Parliament. The Vice-President of the Commission in charge of transport wasted no time in appointing coordinators, as long ago as July, to oversee five particularly complex projects and to promote interoperability through the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS). In this context, the Vice-President attended the inauguration of the first cross-border ERTMS, Vienna/Budapest, following the communication of 4 July, which clarified the issues involved in interoperability for the development of rail transport;</p>
<p>The second axis centres on more efficient use of existing infrastructure. In this regard, it should be borne in mind that there is already effective competition in a number of countries. For example, in the United Kingdom and Germany, where the market has been open since 1995, rail freight rose by 60% and 40% respectively between 1995 and 2004.</p>
<p>The new Member States have specific needs that the Commission must not overlook, and it is important to improve the rail infrastructure whilst keeping an eye on improving road transport, especially from a safety point of view. After all, the protection of the citizens and workers should not be limited to one single means of transport.</p>
<p>Irrespective of the review of the White Paper, boosting the development of rail freight in Europe will remain a priority for the Commission, which has scheduled for 2006 a communication on the development of corridors dedicated to rail freight.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0782"></a>

<p>(FR)By virtue of the attraction it has for large sections of the population, the financial interests at stake in professional sport are becoming ever more significant, in particular in connection with the advertising surrounding sporting events and television broadcasting rights. This trend is particularly marked in the case of football, where more and more leading clubs are becoming fully-fledged companies quoted on the stock market. In addition, some matches are the subject of betting, which merely adds to the financial stakes involved. In the light of these developments, sport can in no way regard itself as immune from the threat posed by organised crime in the form of money laundering.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of any measures to combat money laundering, whether in the European Union or at international level, depends on the involvement of the bodies and individuals concerned (financial institutions and certain persons active in business and the professions), who, as a result of their particular exposure to this type of crime, have a duty to apply more stringent measures designed to prevent and detect money laundering.</p>
<p>The anti-money-laundering provisions developed by the Commission represent a response to the need to establish firm barriers against the infiltration of all sectors of the economy by organised crime. It is for the Member States, therefore, to implement the rules as laid down in the relevant Community texts. The first EU anti-money-laundering directive (1991), as modified by the second directive (2001), was adopted precisely with the aim of protecting the legal economy against criminal abuses. When the FATF agreed on a revision of its standards in June 2003, the existing directive needed to be updated in order to continue to reflect best international practices, as embodied in the revised Forty Recommendations, as well as the European Community's commitment to combating money laundering and terrorist financing. In accordance with the provisions of the third anti-money-laundering directive recently adopted by Parliament and the Council, financial institutions and designated non-financial businesses and professions have a duty to show vigilance by reliably identifying their clients and the final beneficiaries of financial transactions. Moreover, the role of such institutions and designated professions consists of identifying at an early stage, in the sports sector, as in all other sectors, transactions which may be used for money-laundering purposes so that they can alert the competent national authorities responsible for the fight against money laundering.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to state that it has no information suggesting that certain European football clubs are being used for money-laundering purposes. It would like to point out once again that it has no investigatory powers in this area and that it is a matter for the European Union Member States to carry out appropriate checks, in particular when a sports club is purchased by individuals or with capital of unknown origin.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0791"></a>

<p>(EN)A comprehensive study on the total economic impact of the Internal Market was carried out in 1996 and published in 1998. It concluded that in 1994, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was between 1.1% and 1.5% higher than it would have been if the Internal Market did not exist. For the same year, the employment gain was estimated to have accounted for over 300.000 jobs.</p>
<p>Since then, there have been partial assessments. Among the latest are:</p>
<p>The Communication on the occasion of the 10<span class="sup">th</span> anniversary of the Internal Market included a new round of macroeconomic estimates of the impact of the 1992 programme. According to these estimates, EU GDP in 2002 was 1.8 percentage points, or €164.5 billion, higher thanks to the Internal Market. In addition, about 2.5 million jobs had been created in the EU since 1992 as a result of the opening up of frontiers between Member States;<a href="#defann_54_1" name="refann_54_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p>A study by Commission services based on accounting data of EU firms, has found evidence of a significant impact of the Internal Market programme on productivity. Efficiency, as measured by the productivity of assets, increased by approximately 25% between 1993 and 2001;<a href="#defann_54_2" name="refann_54_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a></p>
<p>In the field of Public Procurement, a study for the Commission estimated the economic benefits from the application of EU Directives. Results show that the application of the transparency procedures required by the Directives could reduce prices of goods, services and works contracts by approximately 30%. The study also showed that the success rates of foreign firms operating in other Member States to win contracts are actually comparable to those of domestic firms bidding in their home countries.<a href="#defann_54_3" name="refann_54_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a></p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Under Regulation (EC) No 639/2003<a href="#defann_56_1" name="refann_56_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> the age of cows and heifers for which export refunds can be claimed was reduced from 36 to 30 months.

<p>This makes things more difficult for cattle breeders in mountain areas. Mountain breeders are tied to autumn calving in the alpine cycle.

<p>(EN)The decision to reduce from 36 to 30 months the age for eligibility for export refunds for female pure-bred animals was taken on the basis of statistics on our exports of pure-bred bovine animals which showed that mainly young pure-bred female animals were exported. Today the request is still predominant for the category of animals under 30 months.</p>
<p>From a technical point of view, the Commission believes that with an average mating age at 24 months, young heifers and even in some cases young cows of alpine mountain cattle breeds can still benefit from refunds when exported.</p>
<p>In addition from an administrative point of view, it appears difficult to set up a specific regime for alpine mountain cattle breed as requested given the fact that the export nomenclature used to define eligible categories of animals does not allow such specificity. Moreover, some of those breeds are also kept and raised by breeders outside mountain area, where the conditions of production are different.</p>
<p>Finally, public concern in relation to exports of live animals with refunds has been continuously rising. The Commission agrees that mainly exports of cattle for slaughter have been subject to heavy criticism in the past. But pure-bred animals, because of long distance transport, have also been criticised.</p>
<p>In view of all these elements, the Commission is not in a position to proceed to the requested adjustment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission would like to recall that in its Communication to the spring 2005 European Council it has stressed with regard to the proposed REACH regulation, the need to arrive at a decision which will be consistent with the Lisbon goals as regards the competitiveness of the European industries and encouraging innovation, and which will achieve a marked improvement in health and environment to the benefit of Europe’s citizens. The Commission further signalled its willingness to cooperate fully with Parliament and with Council in search for pragmatic solutions to key issues which have emerged in the examination of REACH in order to improve its workability. This approach has been broadly welcomed.</p>

<p>(EN)The Commission is aware of the Greek authorities’ intention of securitising claims, notably in relation to tax arrears.</p>
<p>From the accounting viewpoint, Eurostat is currently in contact with the Greek statistical authorities on the treatment of that operation. While the Greek authorities have already provided some general description of their intention, Eurostat has not received yet full documentation.</p>
<p>According to the accounting rules, the impact of securitisations on the government deficit depends notably on the transfer of risks to the private sector. To be recorded as deficit reducing, the government must have shifted most risks and rewards to the private sector; otherwise, the securitisation is recorded as borrowing. The assessment of all relevant elements (possible substitution of assets, guarantees, existence of a deferred purchase price, management of the assets, etc.) for each specific transaction is only possible after a careful analysis of the contract.</p>
<p>More generally, Eurostat intends, as soon as possible, to clarify for all Member States the rules on securitisation operations in the ESA 95 Manual on government deficit and debt. This is due to the fact that problems of interpretation of existing rules have recently appeared, especially as regards the provision of guarantees and the transfer of risks and benefits by government.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0802"></a>

<p>On 22 July 2005 the Commission (Directorate-General for Justice, Freedom and Security) drew up a 'Draft Recommendation to Member States regarding a code of conduct for non-profit organisations (NPOs)'. The document goes so far as to claim 'there is (....) evidence that non-profit organisations have been exploited for the financing of terrorism and for other kinds of criminal abuse'. Although it recognises their role as of fundamental importance in carrying out 'vital humanitarian and other much-needed public work', the draft lists a series of proposed 'oversight mechanisms' that would upset their activities and even make them meaningless. At no point does the document mention the reasons why NPOs are 'vulnerable to criminal abuse'. It is obviously desirable to ensure the transparency and validity of their operations, but to propose setting up a body to oversee them that would be answerable to governments would jeopardise any kind of autonomy and freedom of action for the NPOs.</p>
<p>Does not the Commission consider that it should withdraw the proposal, which would in practice subject NPOs to supervision that would deny their democratic legitimacy, and instead of this promote a structured form of dialogue with the NPOs on quite different bases, and not draw up rules unilaterally, but in agreement with the NPOs themselves?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The Honourable Member is surely aware of the Financial Action Task Force (“FATF”) “Special Recommendations” on terrorist financing. The task of the FATF is to coordinate and spearhead the international campaign against criminal money laundering and terrorist financing. Special Recommendation VIII requests that countries should address the vulnerabilities of the non profit sector to terrorist financing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Conclusions of the European Council of 16-17 December 2004 invited the Commission to come up with proposals to prevent the misuse of non-profit organisations to terrorist financing by the end of 2005. Additionally, the Council Declaration on the EU response to the London bombings of 13<span class="sup">th</span> July 2005 calls on setting up “a Code of Conduct to prevent the misuse of charities by terrorists”.</p>
<p>In this context, the Commission is planning to issue this year a Communication on Terrorist Financing, which will contain a Recommendation to Member States to encourage compliance with the first principles of a Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>The draft Commission Communication has been significantly revised on the basis of comments received during the public consultation. Through the Communication the Commission will promote a structured form of dialogue with the non-profit sector. The Communication will represent a start of a new phase in the debate with the non-profit sector on the issue. The Commission foresees to organise a conference in 2006 with the participation of the non-profit sector and public bodies to find a common understanding of the problem of prevention and fight against misuse of non-profit organisations to terrorist financing and other criminal ends.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission would like to emphasise that the aim of the Recommendation and Framework for a Code of Conduct is not in any way to undermine the vital humanitarian and other important activities carried out by non-profit organisations of the European Union. The purpose of the planned Commission proposal is to encourage non-profit organisations to take reasonable measures to protect themselves from vulnerabilities to terrorist financing and other forms of criminal abuse.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0806"></a>

<p>(EN)The Parliament and Council Decision on the Transeuropean network in the field of Energy specifies the priority projects “EL.3 France-Spain Portugal”, which have in particular the objective to increase electricity interconnection capacities between these countries.</p>
<p>France and Spain have agreed to add some 1 200 MW of additional capacity by 2006 to the current 1400 MW with the objective of reaching 4 000 MW in the future. Towards that end, a number of feasibility studies are exploring various alternatives for transporting extra wattage across the Eastern, Central and Western Pyrenees. Under the Transeuropean Network budget line, studies of various interconnections between Spain and France were supported for a total of € 2.5 million.</p>
<p>The current 1400 MW interconnection capacity between Spain and France is only 2.3 % of the capacity installed in Spain. In consequence, the line in the Eastern Pyrenees is used at the limit of its capacity, which leads to frequent congestion, and most of the time even exceeds the available limit. Even the envisaged target of 4000 MW transmission capacity is still well below the 10% target.</p>
<p>The Spanish and Portuguese Governments signed an agreement in 2001 to develop a common Iberian power market. A new east-west interconnection between Sines (PT) and Balboa (ES) is under construction as well as an upgrade for the connection between Aldeadavilla (ES) and Recarei (PT). In addition, the north-south connection in Portugal will also be strengthened (Valdigem–Viseu–Anadia). The present transmission capacity between Portugal and Spain is above the 10% target, which makes it feasible that up to 10% of Portugal's power demand can be imported from and/or through Spain.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that although already in 2003 9% of Portuguese demand were imported from Spain, the average congestion levels from Spain to Portugal in the first half of 2004 were 25%, and reached 66% in July 2004 and 47% in August 2004 (see COMP.M. 3440 EDP/ENI/GDP – recitals 80-83).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0807"></a>

<p>(EN)As the Honourable Member is aware, the Commission is devoted to developing high quality statistics on crime and criminal justice. In the medium term, the project aims at collecting available indicators and statistics in different areas and enhancing the quality of those; in the longer term, harmonised statistics on crime and criminal justice will be developed. The work follows several different but coordinated strands. The harmonisation of statistics on crime and criminal justice will require great economic and human resources, both in the Member States and in the Commission, and will have to be done step by step and on the basis of knowledge, so that all Member States agree the usefulness of the harmonised definitions and rules, and the validity of the produced statistics.</p>
<p>As regards organised crime in general, Europol has decided not to take part in the work to develop long-term harmonised quantitative measures, but to devote their energy to develop qualitative information for the Organised Crime Threat Assessment, which will be published for the first time in 2006. This will assess the threat that organised crime poses, as a basis for adequate measures.</p>
<p>The formidable methodological problems posed by differing national statistical systems were examined by a task force of experts from twelve Member States convened by Eurostat in May-June 2005. Based on the task force’s evaluation of data already available in the Member States, data collection will begin late 2005 with information based upon police reports and prison populations. The Commission is in the process of engaging independent experts to complement that collection.</p>
<p>The task force confirmed that quantitative information on organised crime does not at present exist in the Member States in any systematic form, but the Commission has initiated a number of studies which it is hoped will provide some useful guidelines to enable organised crime to be included in the data collection. By 2007 Eurostat will propose a common module on victimisation for inclusion in national surveys in order that this information may be more easily comparable.</p>
<p>To be able to provide for a continuous and overall evaluation of the Action Plan on Drugs 2005-2008, the Commission has created a set of assessment tools/indicators, in collaboration with the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) and Europol, for each action of the Plan. Data on this field is collected regularly by the EMCDDA as well as Europol, allowing an overview of the situation in the EU in this field.</p>
<p>In the particular field of racist crime, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC) is also a very active player. The EUMC produces reports on racism, and, in particular, made public last spring a specific report on racist violence. In order to overcome the stumbling blocks to data collection identified in that report, and in order to improve the quantity and quality of the data available on racist violence, the EUMC will undertake in 2006 a pilot survey on victims on racism. The Commission supports these efforts.</p>
<p>A Communication that is planned for late 2005 will outline the development for the coming years, and set up an expert group to advise the Commission, in addition to the Task Force.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0811"></a>

<p>(FR)From the year 2005 the Commission has resolved to adopt a concerted approach to the major challenges resulting from the three principal transmissible diseases, HIV/Aids, malaria and tuberculosis within a coherent and coordinated political and strategic framework. Accordingly, on 26 October 2004, it adopted a second report on progress made by the European Community programme of action for HIV/Aids, malaria and tuberculosis<a href="#defann_65_1" name="refann_65_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which has in the meantime been forwarded to the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p>The principle objective of the report was to provide a comprehensive picture of progress and/or results obtained in each of the following areas: impact of the measures, accessibility to medication and assistance for research and development regarding new therapeutic resources to combat these illnesses.</p>
<p>While the Commission is allocating appropriations to health programmes in partner countries, the amounts specifically earmarked for HIV/Aids are not quantifiable. Funding for the health sector of individual countries under various programmes has correspondingly diminished (from an annual amount of €393 million between 1998 and 2002 to €246.6 million between 2003 and 2006). Aside from budgetary and sectoral aid, appropriations specifically earmarked for combating the three diseases have increased considerably from € 59.3 million annually between 1994 and 2002 to €235 million annually between 2003 and 2006 from all sources (European Development Fund, specific budget items, Research Fund). In particular, between 2003 and 2006 there has been a steady increase in budget entries for Community assistance to developing countries in combating these three diseases, the regional fund appropriations for the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries (ACP) and appropriations allocated under the Sixth Framework Programme of Research into these three illnesses (four times under the Fifth Framework Programme).</p>
<p>For the period 2003-2006, the Commission has earmarked an amount of €200 million to the EDCTP under the Sixth Framework Programme of Research<a href="#defann_65_2" name="refann_65_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. This pilot project, known as the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership, received an equivalent contribution (€200 million) from the European countries participating and concentrates on developing new medicines, vaccines and microbicides effective against the three diseases in question and stepping up clinic research capacity in the sub-Saharan African countries. An additional €220 million has been earmarked for the implementation of numerous basic and preclinical research projects for the duration of the Sixth Framework Programme.</p>
<p>The Commission has made a substantial contribution to the Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and other partnership programmes such as the International Aids Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) and the International Partnership for Microbicides (IPM). The Commission's total contribution to the Global Fund between 2001 and 2005 amounted to €432,5 million. In 2006, the Commission's contribution to the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria amounted to almost €90 million, of which €62 million was drawn from the European Development Fund.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)With the 2003 reform of the Common Agricultural Policy farmers may now grow any biomass for energy purpose without loosing decoupled income support.</p>
<p>Under the decoupled income support, farmers do not have to declare how they use their agricultural areas. Therefore the Commission information on energy crops cultivated on land eligible for decoupled support is limited. More precise information is available for farmers’ applications to the set-aside and energy crops regimes.</p>
<p>Under the set-aside regime which allows growing non-food crops on obligatory set-aside land an area of about 900 000 hectares is used for energy crop production.</p>
<p>In addition, the 2003 reform introduced a specific energy crop premium of € 45 per hectare for a maximum guaranteed area of 1.5 million hectares. In 2004, the first year of application, the energy crop premium was granted for about 300 000 hectares.</p>
<p>The Commission expects that the number of hectares which apply for the energy crop premium will increase in 2005 and the following years.</p>
<p>The current production of energy crops is not sufficient to achieve the EU targets on renewable energy for 2010.</p>
<p>A report on the implementation of the energy crop premium is scheduled for the end of 2006 and, where appropriate, will be accompanied by proposals for amendment. For biofuels, a market share of 2% should be reached this year, increasing to 5.75% by 2010. Member States had to report to the Commission on the development in this area in 2004 and 2005, and the Commission will present a report to the European Council and Parliament in 2006, based on this information. Further actions may be proposed by the Commission if appearing necessary to achieve the envisaged objective.</p>
<p>Biofuels result in different life cycle greenhouse gas savings depending on how they are produced. It is desirable for policy to take account of this and encourage the introduction of more desirable biofuel technologies.</p>
<p>The European Union has provided significant financial support over the years to research and development in the field of biofuels. In the fifth framework programme, biofuels were supported in the Quality of life and Energy thematic programmes. In the current sixth framework programme, a number of Integrated Projects in the field of biofuels are being financed.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently preparing a Biomass Action Plan to further promote the debate on encouraging biomass, including biofuels. Moreover, a specific Communication on biofuels will take up this debate and complement the strategies outlined, in particular concerning the supply of biofuels feedstock and the global context for the EU biofuels policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0817"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission can confirm that there have been ongoing discussions with the Football Association Premier League (FAPL) over their collective sale of media rights in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. In December 2003, the FAPL proposed a set of commitments, which contained a rule that no one buyer would win all live TV rights in the United Kingdom from 2007 onwards. This set of commitments was subject to a public consultation in 2004 and discussions on the outcome of that consultation continued in 2004 and 2005.</p>
<p>In June 2005, the FAPL submitted a revised proposal, which the Commission indicated was insufficient. In a meeting between the Commissioner in charge of Competition and the FAPL on Tuesday 18 October 2005, the FAPL submitted significantly revised proposal which moved the two sides closer to an amicable result in this case. In particular, the FAPL have agreed that the rights will be sold to the highest bidder on a standalone basis, subject to a rule that no one buyer can buy all of the packages of live TV rights. The Commission has considered this proposal and replied to the FAPL on Friday 21 October 2005, requesting FAPL to take a clear position regarding a number of clarifications. The Commission can further confirm that it received a reply from FAPL in the evening of Monday 24 October, and that it is currently giving this reply its full consideration.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0826"></a>

<p>(EN)Most of the provisions in Directives 2003/54 and 2003/55 should have been transposed by Member States by 1 July 2004. The most important requirements were the opening of competition to all non-household customers, the establishment of ex-ante regulation for access to electricity and gas networks, and the separation of transmission and distribution system operators from the other parts of vertically integrated businesses.</p>
<p>Most Member States have now fulfilled these requirements. However there were several where implementation was up to one year behind schedule. There remain seven Member States which have not yet notified the measures taken to transpose the Directives and infringement cases are underway.<a href="#defann_68_3" name="refann_68_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a></p>
<p>The Commission is currently preparing a comprehensive report on the implementation of the Directives, as envisaged in the texts (Article 28 – electricity, and Article 31 – gas). Work is still ongoing on the report but, aside from the above delays in implementation, the important obstacles to real competition relate – amongst others - to the levels of concentration in many markets concerned, to the lack of available interconnection capacity between Member States, to different levels of powers and independence of regulators, to insufficient transparency in certain markets, to the lack of liquidity in certain wholesale markets and possibly inadequate unbundling provisions. It is anticipated that some of these issues will be progressively resolved both the Directives, the Regulation for Cross Border Electricity Exchanges (1228/03), and the forthcoming Regulation on Gas Transmission.</p>
<p>In order to clarify the competitive conditions in european gas and electricity markets the Commission launched an inquiry into the european gas and electricity sectors on 13 June 2005. The sector inquiry, which is an enforcement tool under european Competition law, was triggered following complaints about price increases and lack of customer’s choice. First results of the inquiry can be expected at the end of 2005. The final report is foreseen for 2006.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The Commission does not have reliable data available on the extent of honour killings in Europe. Given the lack of good quality statistics on crime at the EU-level, the Commission is committed to developing a system of EU comparable statistics on crime and criminal justice, in cooperation between Directorate-General for Justice, Freedom and Security and Eurostat.</p>
<p>The Commission will shortly issue a Communication on the establishment of a system for comparable statistics on crime and criminal justice, which will present a long-term action plan to develop comparable statistics. Moreover, in order to contribute to better statistical surveying of violence against women, young people and children in particular, and to harmonized and comparable data collection, the Commission has identified as one of its priority areas under the Daphne Programme the development of indicators and related data collection on violence.</p>
<p>The Commission supports efforts to prevent and eliminate crimes against women committed in the name of honour by encouraging Member States in particular to:</p>
<p>address the root causes of patriarchal violence with the aim of changing the attitudes in societies and communities that encourage, accept or at least tolerate violent behaviour in the name of honour;</p>
<p>collect data on honour-related violence and create statistics;</p>
<p>enact and implement appropriate legislation based on international resolutions to combat patriarchal violence;</p>
<p>adopt gender equality policies;</p>
<p>cooperate with, support and learn from civil society and grassroots organizations.</p>
<p>The Commission can in particular through the Daphne II Programme provide assistance to local-level organisations that provide, inter alia, long-term and short term education and training of all groups of society to prevent the occurrence of honour-related violence. The Daphne Programme can also support social services, in collaboration with non-governmental organisations, to ensure protective and supportive measures for victims through shelters/alternative housing and counselling.</p>
<p>During the accession negotiations, political reforms in Turkey and their implementation will continue to be closely monitored by the Commission and women’s rights will remain a priority. The negotiating framework agreed on 3 October, which will form the basis for negotiations, requires Turkey to “consolidate and broaden legislation and implementation measures” in the area of women’s rights.</p>
<p>In Turkey steps have already been taken towards ensuring greater protection of women’s rights. A new Parliamentary Committee on Violence against Women and Children began its work this month. Among other things, it will conduct research on the causes of honour killings in Turkey and propose measures aimed at preventing such crimes.</p>
<p>The Law N° 5251 on the organization and duties of the Directorate General for Women's Status from October 2004 provides for this government department to "conduct work for the prevention and elimination of all forms of violence against women". Violence against women had also been highlighted in the conference held on 26 and 27 June 2005 in Elazig, organised by the Turkish Government and the Commission und funded within the gender equality framework strategy programme.</p>
<p>The new Turkish Penal Code, which entered into force in June 2005, envisages life imprisonment for crimes against life that are motivated by “tradition and customs”. The Commission is aware of two recent court decisions where, in accordance with the new code, the perpetrators of honour killings have been sentenced to life imprisonment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0834"></a>

<p>(EN)The trans-European energy networks (TEN-E) guidelines<a href="#defann_74_1" name="refann_74_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> define a number of priority projects for increasing the EU’s security of energy supplies, amongst which is a new additional gas supply route from Russian sources to Northern Europe. Given the expected significant increase in EU gas demand over the coming years, it is clearly in the EU’s interest to promote the development of new gas transport infrastructure.</p>
<p>Two potential routes have been under discussion for some time, namely:</p>
<p>An off-shore pipeline from Russia directly to Germany via the Baltic Sea (“North European Pipeline ” – possibly with branches to the Scandinavian and Baltic states),</p>
<p>From Russia via Belarus and Poland to Germany along the existing Yamal Pipeline (“Yamal II”), including its variant from Russia via the Baltic States to Poland, Germany (“Amber”).</p>
<p>The final route of the Yamal Europe Gaspipeline is clearly the decision of the commercial actors involved, in consultation with the interested national authorities.</p>
<p>Financial assistance from the Community budget for infrastructure projects can be provided only in the framework of the TEN-Energy annual work programme if there is an application submitted following the call for proposals and it is selected for funding.</p>
<p>Under the call for proposals of the TEN-Energy 2003 an application was made by a consortium of European and Russian companies to investigate technical feasibility of the North European Pipeline including environmental, safety and health matters. The project was selected for funding. However, the applicant did not sign the grant agreement offered by the Commission and the feasibility study did not start. There was no application under the 2004 call for proposals for this project. Thus, the North European Pipeline project has not received so far any funding from the Community budget.</p>
<p>Regarding other routes, under the Call for Proposal TEN Energy 2004, a study proposed by Poland has been selected for funding to investigate the feasibility of the two alternative projects “Amber” and “Yamal II”. For both routes, it includes investigations of technical, economic, financial, legal and market issues and the impact on the environment. The aim is to provide the basis for a decision as to which of the two on-shore alternatives is more advantageous taking all relevant aspects into account. The final Commission Decision on the funding is expected to be made shortly.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Whether the disclosure of EU customers’ personal information from various American based companies to US law enforcement agencies constitute a violation of the EU citizens’ fundamental rights to privacy and data protection notably as recognized by the data protection Directives must be examined on a case by case basis. The disclosure of EU citizens’ personal information to US enforcement agencies does not necessarily mean that the personal right to data protection of these individuals has been violated. To reach a conclusion therein, it is necessary to know the facts and circumstances by virtue of which each US based company collected the personal information of EU citizens in the first place.</p>
<p>In this context the Commission would like to recall that, in accordance with the data protection Directives, the analysis of the lawfulness of the reported disclosures must be carried out primarily by national data protection authorities, which are the bodies competent, among others, for the application of the national provisions that implement the data protection Directive, including the monitoring of international transfers. To engage in such activity, national data protection authorities are endowed with investigative, effective powers of intervention and the power to engage in legal proceedings.</p>

Is the Commission in possession of information on the deficiencies of that vessel, in particular those identified when it was inspected in December 2004? Given that most marine pollution results from small-scale leaks of this kind, does the Commission intend to take new initiatives in order to tighten the legal safety requirements for smaller vessels?</p>

<p>(EN)With regards to the spill caused by the vessel “Eileen”, the Commission, on the basis of the information available, has found no apparent relation between the deficiencies reported in the inspection of December 2004 and the recent pollution off the coast of Cadiz. The deficiencies were mainly related with the personal equipment.</p>
<p>The Commission shares the concerns raised by the Honourable Member about the global impact of a high number of relatively small spills, often linked to the ships’ operations. In this context, Article 10 of the Directive 2005/35/CE on ship-source pollution and on the introduction of penalties for infringements provides for "accompanying measures" which will help enforce the system of dissuasive sanctions to better prevent ship-source pollution. Such "accompanying measures" will notably focus on the tracing of pollution and the early identification of ships discharging polluting substances in violation of the Directive. The Commission has already started to work on the development of such "accompanying measures" in the perspective of the entry into force of the Directive in April 2007.</p>
<p>According to the information published by the classification society Lloyd’s Register, the “Moskovsky Festival” is a double hull oil tanker. The conditions of operation of this vessel into the Bay of Algeciras is a matter of national competence.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0849"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission monitors the application by Member States of the rules on the recognition of professional qualifications in the teaching sector on a constant basis. And it believes that the European citizens are its greatest ally in this task the most reliable source of information on how these rules are applied in practice. They contact the Commission regularly and report the difficulties they are confronted with when applying for the recognition of their qualifications in other Member States.</p>
<p>The Commission’s actions aimed at dismantling existing barriers to labour mobility vary according to the circumstances. The Commission works closely with national administrations, for instance via SOLVIT, or other informal contacts. However, where such contacts fail to produce a satisfactory outcome, the Commission opens infringement proceedings against those Member States who repeatedly breach Community rules.</p>
<p>There are no infringement procedures currently pending against either France or Italy concerning the recognition of qualifications for the purposes of the right to exercise a teaching profession. If the Honourable Member has any specific information about cases of maladministration by the Italian or French authorities with regard to the recognition of teachers’ diplomas, the Commission will of course investigate.</p>
<p>However, in relation to other questions of cross-border mobility of teaching staff the Commission can provide the following additional information:</p>
<p>In relation to the recruitment of teachers, the Commission would like to draw the attention to the latest developments in this area. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) clarified in the Burbaud case that the organisation of competitions as a means of recruitment is not as such contrary to EU law. Fully qualified professionals may however not be required to undergo recruitment procedures designed to select candidates who are not fully qualified for a training course which will lead to a final qualification which is a precondition for access to a post in the public sector. The Commission services are currently holding discussions with the French authorities to assist them in setting up of a legal framework that could be applied for such competitions across all professions in the public sector;</p>
<p>The Commission has opened a number of infringement cases against Italy concerning entry barriers that language lecturers face when they present themselves for competitions.;</p>
<p>Another issue concerns the taking into account of qualifications in the recruitment procedure (e.g. by granting points for qualifications in the recruitment procedure in order to place persons on a higher place on the reserve list). An infringement procedure is pending against Italy on this issue.</p>
<p>Finally the issue of taking into account professional experience for the purposes of access to the public sector and for determining professional advantages (e.g. salary; grade) is an important issue. In view of the ECJ's case law the Commission considers that migrant workers' previous periods of comparable employment acquired in another Member State must be taken into account by Member States' administrations for the purposes of access to their own public sector and for determining professional advantages in the same way as applies to experience acquired in their own system. The Commission has opened numerous infringement procedures against a number of Member States including Italy and France. France has adopted a set of new rules on the issue of taking into account of professional experience for the purpose of determining the salary; the Commission continues to monitor the way in which the new rules are applied in practice. In relation to Italy the ECJ recently concluded that the Italian authorities had infringed the principle of free movement of workers because they did not appropriately take into account the professional teaching experience acquired by migrant teachers who entered a competition for a teaching vacancy at an Italian state school (decision of the ECJ of 12 May 2005). In relation to the question of taking into account of professional experience for the purpose of determining professional advantages another infringement procedure is pending against Italy (C-371/04).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0854"></a>

Despite their situation, they are unjustly rewarded as they are not paid during the summer months when the schools are closed, nor do they receive additional pay at Christmas or Easter (which all their colleagues with permanent posts do), while they exist in a particularly soul-destroying state of uncertainty because they are never sure if they will be called upon to work.</p>

<p>Greece has notified the Commission that the Directive in the respects mentioned above has been transposed by Decree 81/2003 and subsequently for the public sector by Presidential Decree 164/2004.

<p>(EN)There is no timetable for accession negotiations with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia or with any of the other countries of South East Europe mentioned by the Honourable Member (Serbia and Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania).</p>
<p>The Honourable Member will recall that accession negotiations take place once the Council has decided so, following an application for accession by the aspiring country, in accordance with Article 49 of the Treaty on the European Union. The Council decides on the basis of an Opinion emitted by the Commission.</p>
<p>The countries of the Western Balkans are all potential candidates for membership and the European Union has repeatedly stated that their future lies within the EU. However, at this stage, only Croatia is a candidate negotiating its accession.</p>
<p>The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia tabled its application for membership in March 2004 and the Council requested the Commission to prepare an Opinion in May of the same year. The Commission will adopt its Opinion on 9 November. The Commission is in no position today to pre-empt its recommendation, notably on the possible opening of accession negotiations with that country.</p>
<p>In the case of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro, no application for membership has been filed by these countries, which indeed have not yet concluded Stabilisation and Association Agreements (SAA) with the European Union. A recommendation on possible conclusion of negotiations for a SAA with Albania could be presented by the Commission in the near future; similar negotiations have just started with Serbia and Montenegro, and will also probably start in the next few months with Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
<p>Relations with south-eastern Europe are a high priority for the EU, regardless of the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey. The European perspective of this region is particularly significant in the context of forthcoming developments in the area, such as the opening of status talks on Kosovo. Important progress on the road towards the EU has been achieved throughout the region, reflecting both the reform efforts of the countries in question and the political will on our side. However, in most cases there is still a long way to go. The pace of advancement of each country and, hence, the timetable for steps ahead, depends on its own progress in fulfilling the established criteria for coming closer and eventually joining the Union.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0858"></a>

<p>(FR)The Commission welcomes this fresh expression of support from MEPs towards those imprisoned in Cuba on account of their political convictions. It shares the deep concern over the fate of political prisoners in Cuba. </p>
<p>On a visit to Cuba last month, the Development Commissioner met a number of relatives of political prisoners, including Mrs Gisela Sanchez Verdecia, the wife of Antonio Diaz Sanchez, and several prominent peaceful dissidents. During the visit, the Commissioner brought up the issue of political prisoners with all of the representatives from the authorities with whom he spoke, including President Castro. The Commission delegation in Havana is in regular, close contact with political prisoners’ families and human rights organisations in Cuba, including the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation. </p>
<p>Since March 2003, the EU has firmly and repeatedly called on the Cuban authorities to release all political prisoners and to ensure in the meantime that those prisoners are treated humanely. In its press release of 24 July 2005, the Commission expressed its concern over the political situation in Cuba and condemned the fresh arrests of dissidents in Havana. The Presidency, acting on the Union’s behalf, expressed the same concern in two statements, on 15 and 25 July 2005, and repeated its demands that all political prisoners be released. </p>
<p>On 29 September 2005, the EU released a further statement calling on the Cuban authorities to ‘take immediate action to improve the conditions of detention of all political prisoners who are being held in circumstances that fall below the UN minimum standards for the treatment of prisoners’. Improving conditions of detention naturally includes access to adequate healthcare for political prisoners.</p>
<p>The Commission remains in favour of constructive political engagement through political dialogue with the Cuban authorities, in tandem with stronger ties with the dissident movement and representatives from civil society. The Council decision of 13 June 2005 reinforced the need to use this dialogue to support practical advances in the area of human rights. The Commission feels that this policy of constructive political engagement has the best chance of leading to the release of all political prisoners in Cuba. </p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0864"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission has launched twinning projects in the framework of the CARDS since 2001, i.e. before the adoption of the European strategy for the Western Balkans at the Thessaloniki European Council in June 2003.</p>
<p>Between 2001 and 2005 the Commission has initiated 54 CARDS twinning projects and called on the public administrations of the Member States to propose public sector expertise to that effect. According to the presently available data, Greece has submitted 25 twinning proposals for these projects and the Greek administration has been selected to implement two projects.</p>
<p>More generally it has been recognised that twinning, as a tested institution building instrument for targeted administrative co-operation, should be more widely used to follow up on the Thessaloniki European Council conclusions in order to strengthen the process of democratisation and stabilisation in the Western Balkans.

<p>(EN)The proposal for a New Legal Framework (NLF) for payments has been fully considered by the Commission services from the angle of ensuring that it is pro-competitive in its effects. Directorate General (DG) Internal Market and DG Competition closely co-operated in the preparation of the proposal. It has also undergone a proper impact assessment.</p>
<p>The NLF proposal focuses on the relationship between payment service providers and their users and addresses relevant competition aspects in this respect, including harmonization of market access conditions of national payment markets and improved market transparency for users. The sector inquiry into retail banking is a distinct exercise, based on the competition rules. Payment services are one part of the inquiry.</p>
<p>The Commission will, of course, share the results of its sector inquiry with the Parliament once available. However, the Commission does not expect that the findings of the sector inquiry will change the justification and impact assessment on which the current proposal for the New Legal Framework (NLF) for payments is based.

<p>The Swedish government apparently now plans to introduce import restrictions on liqueurs purchased by its nationals outside Sweden, primarily in neighbouring countries. The reason for this is that in recent years alcohol consumption has again risen alarmingly. However, this seems to me to be in breach of the principle of the internal market and the free movement of goods. It is mainly neighbouring countries and European liqueur producers that will bear the brunt of this measure. In taking this action, is the Swedish government not trying to solve a domestic problem at the expense of other EU Member States? Will the Commission permit this and, if so, under what conditions?

<p>(EN)The question of the Honourable Member seems to concern a possible proposal by the Swedish Government to restrict the import of the alcoholic beverage of the type “liqueur” into Sweden on the basis of the protection of public health. The Commission was not aware of the existence of such a proposal, which has not yet been notified under Directive 98/34/EC.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to inform the Honourable Member that the Commission decided on 7 July 2004 within the infringement procedure of Article 226 of the EC Treaty to bring Sweden before the European Court of Justice for maintaining a ban on Swedish consumers using independent intermediaries to import alcoholic beverages for their private use into Sweden from other Member States. Having regard to the public health objective that it is supposed to achieve, the Commission believes that the ban represents a disproportionate obstacle to the free movement of goods in contravention of Articles 28 and 30 of the EC Treaty. In the Commission’s view, the protection of public health can be achieved by other means that are less restrictive for trade between Member States, such as public information campaigns and introducing procedures which check the age of those buying alcoholic drinks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission would like to bring the Honourable Member’s attention to the judgment of the European Court of Justice in the Franzén case (Case C-189/95, Harry Franzén, judgment of 23 October 1997). The European Court of Justice confirmed in that judgment that for public health reasons, the existence and the operation of a domestic monopoly on retail of alcohol beverages, such as “Systembolaget”, was compatible with the EC Treaty, more particularly with Article 31 concerning national monopolies. Article 31 of the EC Treaty does indeed not require national monopolies having a commercial character to be abolished, but requires them to be adjusted in such a way as to ensure that no discrimination regarding the conditions under which goods are procured and marketed exists.</p>
<p>The Commission will follow the developments regarding possible intentions to restrict the import of alcoholic beverages into Sweden with utmost attention.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0874"></a>

<p>(EN)Any industry operating in the European Community, or any producers representing such industry, has the legal right to lodge an anti-dumping complaint containing evidence that it suffers from an injury caused by dumping practices. If this complaint contains sufficient elements showing evidence of injurious dumping, the Commission has no choice but to initiate an investigation.</p>
<p>In this specific case, a complaint was received from more than 800 footwear producers in the Community, representing around 60,000 employees. Those companies represent a major proportion of the European footwear industry, i.e. in this case more than 40% of the overall Community production of footwear with uppers of leather. Those producers are deemed to legally represent the Community footwear industry.</p>
<p>It should be underlined that the opening of an investigation is obviously without prejudice to its outcome. The on-going investigation will determine whether there is dumping, injury and a causal link between them.</p>
<p>In the event that the investigation confirms the allegations of injurious dumping then the Commission will be faced with the task of balancing the various interests of all parties concerned including those of EU producers, importers, distributors and consumers and to determine whether it, on balance, is in the Interest of the Community to impose measures.</p>
<p>Like in any other anti-dumping investigation, the Commission has given the opportunity to all economic operators, directly concerned by any imposition of measures, to come forward and to co-operate to the investigation by providing their views and any relevant information necessary to analyse to what extent they would be affected by any measures. Association of consumers have also been contacted in that respect.</p>
<p>The investigation will entail a thorough analysis of those comments, in order to ensure that any measures would only be imposed if it is determined that, on balance, the economic interest of retailers and consumers, does not carry more weight than those of the Community industry and the effect of the remedial action.

<p>(EN)The projects for the Ebro transfer were submitted for Community financing by the Spanish authorities in December 2003 and January 2004, as a set of four large projects with a total cost of € 2,728 Million and requested Community financing of € 1,262 Million. The situation concerning the possible Community financing of works included in the Spanish National Hydrological Plan (SNHP) was the subject of intense discussion between all parties concerned, in particular as regards to the proposed transfer of 1050 Hm³ of water per year from the Ebro river to the Spanish Mediterranean coastal regions of Cataluña, Valencia, Murcia and the province of Almería in Andalucía. There was no unanimity between the different Spanish regions regarding this transfer. After the change of government in Spain as a result of the general elections of March 2004, the new Spanish authorities declared that the “Ebro transfer” would be withdrawn and substituted by alternative projects. These requests for co-financing were officially withdrawn by letter from the Spanish Permanent Representation of 29 June 2004.</p>
<p>Therefore, the “Ebro transfer” projects have never been approved by the Commission and no funds were ever committed to co-finance these projects.</p>
<p>Through Royal Decree 2/2004 of 18 June 2004, the new Spanish government modified the articles and projects in the NHP law related to the Ebro river transfer and proposed, for the watersheds affected, a set of alternative priority and urgent measures.</p>
<p>These measures have been presented by the Ministry of Environment on the 2<span class="sup">nd</span> of September 2004 under the new name of Programme A.G.U.A. (Actuaciones para la Gestión y la Utilización del Agua – Interventions for the Management and the Use of Water).</p>
<p>A series of urgent interventions in the Mediterranean watersheds in the framework of the A.G.U.A. programme is intended to deliver to the same regions plus the province of Málaga, in Andalucía, a total of 1.063 Hm³ of water per year (practically equivalent to the proposed 1.050 Hm³/year proposed to be transferred from the Ebro, though affecting a larger area) through a mixture of measures including water savings and management improvement, the reuse of treated wastewaters and the construction of desalination plants.</p>
<p>On October 1<span class="sup">st</span>, 2005, the estimated investment for the more than one hundred AGUA interventions was € 4,360 Million. In declarations to the press at the presentation of the A.G.U.A. programme, the Spanish Minister for the Environment stated that Spain counts on € 1,362 Million of Community funds.</p>
<p>Following the latest information received from the Spanish Ministry of Environment, from the investment envisaged of € 4,360 Million, € 432 Million correspond to 11 projects in implementation phase, € 26 Million to projects completed, € 71 Million to projects for which a call for tenders has been published, € 3,350Million to projects being in project definition phase and € 481 Million for projects for which feasibility studies are ongoing.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0886"></a>

<p>(EN)Directive 2004/40/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risk arising from physical agents (electromagnetic fields) is designed to protect workers against excessive exposure to MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and electromagnetic fields which scientific experts agree is dangerous for health as well as other radiations. It was drafted by the Commission based on the results and recommendations issued by ICNIRP (International Commission for Non Ionizing Radiation Protection), an independent world wide recognized organisation using the expertise of technicians, scientists and doctors working in the field.</p>
<p>The Parliament and the Council (unanimously) agreed in April 2004 that it is essential to have the same standards for the health and safety of workers regarding electromagnetic fields since the risk is the same for nurses and doctors throughout Europe. The Directive was adopted unanimously and has to be implemented by April 2008.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of the concern expressed by some doctors and scientists about the coming into force of this Directive. To this effect, the Commission would like to recall that the risk of MRI is a real one for everybody who is exposed to it regularly and that this directive will give a solid protection to doctors and nurses exposed to MRI and should have no negative impact on the quality of health care.</p>
<p>In any case, the Directive foresees a review mechanism every five years based on the implementation reports received from the Member States. Any unintended effect on the quality of health care will be addressed in this context-</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Road transport is one of the biggest users of energy and is, in addition, responsible for more than a fifth of all CO2 emissions in the European Union. One way of making road transport more environmentally friendly is to use biological fuels. One particularly interesting possibility would appear to be the use of rape methyl ester, known as biodiesel, which is made from rape, a sustainable raw material. Use of biodiesel would help to reduce soot emissions. When burnt, rape methyl ester would give off approximately the same amount of CO2 as is absorbed by the plants during growth. Rape can be produced in the EU, so that use of biodiesel would mean no longer being dependent on petroleum imports. Furthermore, greater demand for biodiesel, and hence for rape, would give a positive impetus to agriculture.</p>
<p>Does the Commission know of studies on the use of rape oil as an alternative fuel which show its environmental usefulness? If so, could biodiesel not help achieve the Kyoto targets?</p>
<p>What conditions would be needed for biodiesel to be competitive? Could the Commission envisage using consumption taxes to make rape oil competitive?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The Commission agrees completely. The Union has committed itself to use more transport biofuels. It is true that biofuels are expensive (biodiesel would need an oil price of about €75/barrel to become as cheap as conventional fuel, bioethanol €95). But they are one of the few measures we have that can significantly reducing transport’s dependence on oil and its ever-growing emissions of greenhouse gases. In addition, they offer important benefits for economic activity in rural areas.</p>
<p>The Union has already done several things to promote biofuels. In 2003, it adopted Directives setting targets for their use<a href="#defann_92_1" name="refann_92_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and making it easier to adjust consumption taxes to support them.<a href="#defann_92_2" name="refann_92_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> The reform of the common agricultural policy will help biofuels by permitting farmers to choose the markets they grow crops for. Biofuels also receive support from Community financial instruments like the European Regional Development Fund, the Rural Development Programme and the Energy Crops Credit. The Research and Technological Development (RTD) framework programmes are supporting research into “2<span class="sup">nd</span>-generation” biofuels that can be made from wood and wastes. If the remaining technical obstacles can be overcome, it is hoped that these will offer greater greenhouse gas savings.</p>
<p>The biofuels directive set the objective of a 2% market share for biofuels at the end of 2005. It is becoming clear that this will not be achieved. At best, if all Member States achieve the targets they have set, the share will be 1.4%. In the light of this, and the added importance given to biofuels by high oil prices, the Commission will look closely, in its forthcoming Biomass Action Plan, at what more needs to be done. And it will bring forward a more detailed communication on aspects of biofuels policy in early 2006.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In 2003 the European Commission launched a major anti-discrimination campaign. A great many national and EU organisations, such as employers organisations, trade unions and NGOs have been actively involved in the campaign. Most of the campaign activities were not organised centrally from Brussels, but separately on a national and regional basis in each Member State.</p>
<p>On 13 October 2005 I tried to obtain information from the relevant website about the national partners and the national campaign in Belgium. I found, sure enough, that this information is available only in French. A version in Dutch, the language spoken by the majority of Belgium's population, the Flemings, is simply not available.</p>
<p>Is the European Commission aware of the fact that Flemings make up the majority of the population of Belgium and that Dutch is also an official language of the Kingdom of Belgium, along with French? Does the European Commission not consider that this is totally unacceptable in a campaign whose official aim is to promote diversity and respect for other people? Who is responsible for this? Did Belgium produce only a French version or is it the case that the services of the European Commission only considered it necessary to put the French version of the relevant text on the Commission's official website?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
