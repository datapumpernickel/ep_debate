<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Trakatellis (PPE-DE),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Madam President, today's debate is on the joint draft decision adopting the programme of Community action in the field of public health from 2003 to 2008, as unanimously approved on 8 May by the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee with the Council. This draft is the happy outcome of long-term efforts which started two years ago and I must say that it was most constructive, both from the point of view of cooperation between the three institutions and as regards the final format of the programme itself. The adoption of the programme of Community action in the field of public health is the first integrated endeavour by the European Union in the field of public health protection. Public health protection is currently one of the main concerns of the citizens of the Union. Health has to take priority over political or economic compromises. Τhe programme to replace sectoral and fragmentary Community action on health with an integrated programme on 1 January 2003 is based mainly on preventing disease and helping to establish quality standards in the public health sector.</p>
<p class="contents">This programme builds on the existing eight programmes and on the work of the network for epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases in the Community and seeks to pursue a more integrated and global health strategy. The three general objectives are: first, improving information and knowledge for the development of public health, secondly, reacting rapidly and in a coordinated manner to health threats and, thirdly, health promotion and disease prevention by tackling health determinants in all political activities.</p>
<p class="contents">These determinants, which are lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol, nutrition and major socio-economic and environmental factors are, together with genetic factors, the main causes of disease. Τhe programme, which will complement national policies, aims to achieve a high level of physical and mental health and well-being, as well as greater equality on health issues throughout the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like at this point to summarise briefly the work done in the Conciliation Committee, which basically improves on the text and the Council's common position. The budget of EUR 312 million is substantially higher than the 280 million proposed by the Council and even the EUR 300 million proposed by the European Commission. This increase will cover the ambitious objectives of the programme and the requirements of a number of additional projects.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a remarkable achievement because, according to Parliament's records, it is only the second time since codecision began that the engagement finally agreed has been higher than that proposed by the European Commission. In addition, a Commission declaration on article 7 – related to the funding – foresees that the financial framework will be reviewed in the context both of the accession of new Member States and preparations for the revision of the financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to ensure the effective implementation and coordination of the programme, a second Commission declaration was made on the structural arrangements, to ensure the programme will function better. Finally, most of the European Parliament's amendments, 37 of the 50 proposed at second reading, were accepted by the Council, either in full or in a reworked form, and are included in the joint draft. They relate to dealing with health threats from natural, chemical and biological sources, emergency situations, vaccination and immunisation strategies, mental health and resistance to antibiotics, all of which are very real public health problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that reinforcing the foundations of the European structure requires convergence not just at economic policy level but in individual sectors such as health. It is possible to achieve new convergences which widen European integration while fully respecting the principle of subsidiarity and I think that the new programme marks the start of this sort of process in the vitally important health sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to close by thanking all the members of the delegation who helped bring about a satisfactory outcome at conciliation, the Commission and Commissioner Byrne personally and the Spanish Presidency for working constructively with the European Parliament delegation in a bid to reach an agreement which will allow this programme to be put into practice quickly. I therefore recommend that the European Parliament approve the text of the programme so that this very important and pioneering programme can get started. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Remarkably he actually succeeded at conciliation in increasing the funding allowed beyond the initial proposals of the Commission to EUR 380 million over five years, which contrasts with the initial Council proposal of only EUR 280 million.</p>
<p class="contents">EU action in public health is still in the minds of some controversial, as not only is there a risk of duplication with the World Health Organisation's European activities, but also potentially a conflict with the fact that delivery and funding of health provision is exclusively the competence of the Member States. If EU initiatives highlight best practice or stimulate demand for expensive treatments or disease prevention measures, then this may cause budgetary problems for Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the focus on lifestyle changes as health determinants, with a focus particularly on information dissemination on smoking, excess alcohol consumption, nutrition and exercise, go a long way to reducing this risk. The hypocrisy of the EU, which still subsidises the tobacco growers to the tune of about EUR 1 billion per year, needs urgent reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Some claim that the amounts involved at EU level, compared to national health expenditures, are so tiny that it is arguable whether we can achieve anything meaningful at EU level. Nevertheless, in spite of what I have said, I engaged constructively at the first reading, along with a number of my colleagues in the Conservative Party, in highlighting the issue of mental health as a priority need and the need to set up formal structures which will coordinate the disparate funded activities and bring together the whole programme at the centre with direction and leadership. The need to develop consensus statements on best practice is important and it is vital to engage the candidate countries who are often so far behind in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, a rapid reaction system to respond to impending health threats, as we have seen with the dioxin scandal in Belgium or the BSE crisis, is highly appropriate. It is the sort of thing which will bring the EU closer to the peoples of Europe who probably care much more about health policy than almost anything else on the political agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This programme has three objectives: improving information and knowledge, reacting rapidly to health threats and tackling health determinants through health promotion and disease prevention. Obviously, if these objectives are to be achieved, we need to create a mechanism which guarantees permanent surveillance and coordination, which enhances efficiency and which provides information to the Member States on best practices and the overall evaluation of the programme. I think that, on this point, we have achieved a compromise which guarantees that the programme will be implemented properly, in line with the approach taken by Parliament in its amendments. Another important point concerns the European Parliament's proposals on tackling emergency situations, including acts of terrorism, and a satisfactory compromise has been reached with the Council on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should like to comment on the budget for the programme. I think that, if we want to respond to the needs and objectives of this particular programme, we need to ensure that it has the necessary resources. The European Parliament proposed the sum of EUR 380 million and I think the Council should have accepted this, given that much of this money has already been spent on programmes already running until the end of 2002. Similarly, the new programme will apply not just to the fifteen Member States, but to the ten new Member States as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, biological terrorism was added to the original objectives after the events of 11 September. The final sum of EUR 312 may be more than the sum proposed by the Commission or the Council, but it does not satisfy me. However, I do welcome the fact that the Commissioner responsible, Mr Byrne, has promised to review the financial framework once the new Member States have acceded. This had a catalytic effect on the final vote during the conciliation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally, may I thank the rapporteur for his overall cooperation and his efforts in helping to bring about a good compromise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The result obtained at the conciliation stage, and I must emphasise this, would not have been possible without the perseverance of Professor Trakatellis, or without the constructive cooperation between the delegation of our Parliament, the Spanish Presidency and the staff of Commissioner Byrne.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the bitter negotiations concerned, essentially, with budgetary aspects, the three institutions wanted, above all, to send a joint message to the citizens of Europe. Health is now one of our main priorities, and we should be proud of this, because it was essential that Europe should, as it were ‘look after its health’ and should at last put in place a comprehensive and integrated strategy on this subject. The lack of food safety, and the increase in the consumption of alcohol and tobacco, particularly among young people, mean that we need, more than ever before, this type of coordinated action at Community level in order to prevent diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the resurgence of scourges such as Aids or tuberculosis, or the emergence – as has been mentioned – of acts of bio-terrorism, they have made it necessary for the Union to have this rapid reaction capacity. So many reasons and concerns justify an appropriate budget for the next six years. The verdict has been given: EUR 312 million will be paid out, in addition to a Commission declaration making provision for a review of the financial framework in the light of enlargement and the new financial perspective. Admittedly this is less than the EUR 380 million that we were hoping for, but nevertheless it is much more than the EUR 280 million initially granted by the Council. We can therefore say that this compromise is a victory for our Parliament and that, in this House, political will, rather than budgetary dogmatism, has won the day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We believed that the eight previous programmes endeavoured to prevent some of these diseases – and contributed to doing so – but we think that the aim of this action programme – which will begin immediately – is not only to supplement national policies, but also to approach the three objectives laid down in the document itself from a global perspective. These objectives are improving information and knowledge, reacting rapidly to health threats and health promotion and disease prevention. We believe that this will contribute to reducing inequality and assessing the impact of social, environmental and economic factors on health. We think that society, non-governmental organisations and trade unions, as the document clearly states, need to be involved if this plan is to be successful. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Throughout the course of the codecision process, you have put in an enormous amount of work – by analysing the various issues and by putting forward new ideas and approaches.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that as a result the programme has been significantly strengthened and that it will provide a firm basis for the development of the Community’s health strategy, including new areas of work, such as developing a vaccination strategy and responding to the threat of bio-terrorism. Your efforts have further reinforced the three objectives that the Commission set out from the very beginning in its proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">These are: improving health information; responding rapidly to health threats; and tackling the determinants of health.</p>
<p class="contents">These three areas of action respond to the priorities and concerns of European citizens, and will enable the programme to be of direct relevance to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to your perseverance, and not least to the personal contributions of Professor Trakatellis and of Vice-President Imbeni, a realistic agreement was reached in the conciliation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">From my standpoint, the outcome strikes a fair and workable balance between the extent of the activities to be undertaken, the measures to be taken to implement the programme – the so-called structural arrangements – and the overall budget for the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw attention to the two declarations made by the Commission to help reach an agreement on these issues. The first one concerns the budget. It was made to take account of concerns expressed by your delegation about whether the budget of EUR 312 million was adequate for the programme, particularly in view of the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission declared that: “The financial framework of the programme shall be reviewed in the context both of accession of new Member States and the preparation for the revision of the financial perspective, taking account of the establishment of the structural arrangements, and of developments concerning key priorities – financial proposals will be made, if appropriate”.</p>
<p class="contents">We also made a declaration on the implementation of the programme. This underlines our full agreement with Parliament about the need to ensure that this important programme operates as effectively as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In the declaration, we clarified a series of steps we intend to take. These will involve the early setting up of the programme committee; the appropriate organisation of the Commission’s own departments; making use of scientific and technical experts to reinforce our capacity; and pursuing the possibilities of externalisation – notably that of creating an executive agency.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now for the Commission to ensure that the programme starts in earnest at the beginning of next year. We will of course keep you informed of progress in conformity with the applicable rules.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, let me again thank the rapporteur, Professor Trakatellis, the Environment Committee, and indeed the whole Parliament for their excellent work on this programme. I am confident that the final version that has emerged will enable us to make a real contribution to improving the health of European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
