Why am I saying this, Mr President? Because this House has often made commitments on specific issues and has had successes, alongside defeats, as regards the commutation or stays of executions. </p>
<p class="contents">The important thing is to mark the end of the twentieth century by means of action by Europe – Europe as the home of human rights – involving the abolition of the death penalty. All over the world, there is a vitally important campaign which Europe should be leading.

<p class="contents">At the very moment we are debating in this Chamber, Thomas Ridge, the Governor of Pennsylvania, is probably issuing and signing the order for his execution. There are very few legal avenues left open to Moumia to escape the gallows.</p>

This Parliament has a long tradition on this issue, and I would like to pay tribute here to the work of Adelaide Aglietta, who was the first rapporteur in this Parliament to deal with the issue of the death penalty in the world. </p>
<p class="contents">The Council is doing a good job and we hope that the Commission will do likewise. However, we must now make sure that the resolution which will be put to the House will not end up as just a piece of paper, but will constitute another stage in the continuation of this fight. The Council must not stop. It needs to establish further deadlines and mechanisms to monitor the implementation of the resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think he deserves a big thank-you for enabling this discussion to take place. </p>
<p class="contents">I also think that, at the moment, things look very promising indeed in the UN General Assembly. There has been a lot of support from every country, and it has been easy to reach agreement within the Council on this point. Now that the fight is being carried on within the UN, we must beware of cunning counter-proposals which perhaps look innocent enough but which will come from various directions for the purpose of watering down any strong position adopted by the UN General Assembly. We therefore need to keep track of what is happening in the UN. </p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we need to ensure that there is strong support from Parliament for this action and that in the future, and in Geneva too, whenever questions affecting human rights come up, we get binding decisions adopted. We also need to ensure that we can follow up the present resolution, which I hope will be approved in New York this autumn. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the purpose of our resolution directed at the General Assembly of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">Like my colleague, I would like to devote a few words to the urgency with which we must intervene to save Moumia Abou Jamal. Moumia is the black American journalist who was sentenced to death in 1982 after a police set-up and a rigged trial. The Supreme Court has just rejected his appeal. Having spent 17 years on death row, Moumia is now at the mercy of an execution order which the Governor of Pennsylvania can legally sign at any time.</p>

I think that we are very close to achieving the first great result from the UN General Assembly and that it is important that we make an effort to ensure that the final text is a genuine text, a text which allows us to continue this battle which, as other speakers have said, is particularly close to this Parliament’s heart.</p>
<p class="contents">We risk – as is the case after debates within the Council – having a weak text, which will simply reproduce those which have been adopted over the last three years in Geneva and which will not allow us to continue this battle, set new deadlines, or create mechanisms which allow us to verify the steps taken or the progress made to date. I therefore ask the Council not to get bogged down in philosophical debates, but to see to it that the mechanisms allowing us to continue this battle are included in the text and that the drafting may soon be completed, so that the Council and the Commission – and we have Mr Patten’s assurance on this – may begin the work of convincing the 180 Member States of the United Nations. It is urgent. The House has already begun its task. The days and weeks to come must be used to give solid form to this great text in favour of the abolition of the death penalty by the General Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also ensure that this text is not anti-American. The initiatives of recent years have shown the Americans that this is not the case, but I believe that this point should continue to be stressed. The American administration is aware that there is now progress in this direction on the part of the whole of humanity and it is really a matter of widening the sphere of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is all the more significant that in the last few hours, Mr Öçalan has been sentenced to death. This is therefore another manifestation of the need to definitively legislate, at United Nations level, for the abolition of the death penalty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would ask the House to take an urgent stand against the execution of the black American journalist, Moumia Abou Jamal. Moumia Abou Jamal fought against racism and for the dignity of Blacks by denouncing in his articles the violence and corruption of the Philadelphia police and institutional racism in general. After being arrested by that same police force, which accused him, without proof, of the murder of one of his own people, he was sentenced to death following a rigged trial, as a result of falsified evidence and bribed witnesses. He has now spent seventeen years languishing on death row, seventeen years claiming innocence and fighting for a review of his case.</p>
<p class="contents">Moumia Abou Jamal may be executed at any moment, since his appeal in the United States Supreme Court has just been rejected. The United States is a signatory to the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention against Racial Discrimination, as well as the Convention against Torture, which is applicable in Moumia’s case since the racial factor weighed heavily in his trial and he has spent seventeen years on death row which constitutes, according to those Treaties, an unjust form of punishment which is equivalent to torture.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I call on the House to vote not only for the resolution against the death penalty, but also for the amendment which adds that the European Parliament is appealing to the Governor of Pennsylvania to refrain from signing any new execution order against Moumia Abou Jamal and is renewing its demand for a review of his case.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the case with all these areas that we must not labour under the misapprehension that the international community is in a position to solve the problems. The international and European Community can only play a modest role. We must also avoid giving the local population the impression that when international institutions start getting involved everything will come right again. We must spare the local population the disappointment that this expectation could lead to. Of course this does not alter the fact that the situation in Ambon is serious. Our first priority is to remain vigilant and endeavour to find a solution, but we must not add fuel to the fire. In my view, the resolution produced contains all the necessary ingredients. We might consider modifying the religious aspect slightly but, even without such a shift of emphasis, this resolution makes it adequately clear that the European Parliament attaches great importance to preventing a similar situation from arising in Ambon as arose in East Timor. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, there is every reason to say something about the Moluccas. The pictures and, still more, the reports that we are receiving are, after all, very reminiscent of what happened in East Timor. But I must say that I have my doubts about this round.</p>
<p class="contents">Last time, we talked about East Timor and today, we are talking about the Moluccas. We might talk about yet another part of Indonesia tomorrow, for the problem is not confined to the Moluccas. I have a problem with the way in which we are handling this subject; that is to say, I do not think Parliament should discuss individual incidents, for I fear that this great island kingdom will be the scene of many more such incidents where national and religious factors are intertwined.</p>
<p class="contents">What actually needs to happen is for Parliament to ask itself how, in any event, it should deal with the big problem of Indonesia. The Moluccan situation is not an isolated case. The Moluccas form part of a great State comprising many nationalities and religious groupings. It is a State that is at risk of falling apart and where tensions are running high. I would be very much in favour of having a big debate of the kind I have just described at some stage in the future, rather than going from incident to incident all the time.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Moluccan island group is one of the areas that has suffered terribly under the violation of human rights going all the way back to November 1998. Since November of last year, hundreds of people have been killed, many have been badly injured and tens of thousands of people have been uprooted or are fleeing their homes. In August alone, there were 65 deaths and 242 people were injured. In September, a further 40 people died and many people were injured. Thirty-five thousand people in the Moluccas are in camps or other reception centres and even larger numbers of people have fled.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, many villages and houses have been burnt out and stocks of food and medicines are diminishing. The area is becoming more and more unsettled. The increasing violence between the Muslim and the Christian populations, among others, is responsible for this disastrous situation. The Indonesian army units stationed there do not offer enough protection in the face of such violence; they even instigate violence themselves sometimes, a consequence being that armed civilian groups are coming to play an increasingly provocative role. In the Moluccas too, militias are forming which appear to be in collaboration with the army. The situation is a little like that in Timor. One of the causes of the tragedy is the fact that people have been forced to migrate from other islands to the Moluccas. As a result, the traditional relationship between the population groups has been disrupted.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the economic crisis has a role to play here, too. Then there is the attitude of the army units stationed there, for they support some groups more than others and have little understanding of human rights and the rights of minorities. All this means that armed civilians can just run amok. I will give you an example of a recent atrocity: on 20 August, twenty-one Moluccans died having sought sanctuary in the Jabor church in Galala just outside Ambon city. According to eyewitness accounts, the perpetrators were dressed in the uniforms of the elite Kostrad unit of the Indonesian army. Mr President, surely it is necessary to get to the bottom of something like this.</p>
<p class="contents">What needs to happen? Democracy, respect for human rights and respect for religious and ethnic population groups must be established in Indonesia as soon as possible. UN and NGO reporters must be able to compile objective reports so that the situation on the ground is reflected as accurately as possible. Militias and other armed groups must be stripped of their arms because they are an out and out threat to security. Those individuals, and that includes military militias, who are guilty of provocation and acts of violence, must be tried. If necessary, a tribunal should be set up for this purpose, now that as many as 500 people have died. Action must be taken to enable the various groups to live in peace side by side. There is good will on both sides but this does mean that an end must be brought to the enforced migrations.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also look carefully at the presidential elections because there are plans to replace the army units that are in the region now with army units from Sulawesi. The people say that may create a dangerous situation. In that case, Mr President, there is a need for help. Tens of thousands of people have been uprooted. There is a lack of food and medicines and countless houses and villages have been burnt down. Help is also needed to rebuild those. I would like to ask the Commissioner if it would be possible to involve ECHO in this; the NGOs can also help here, as can the churches.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I will close by saying that Timor was a tragedy that shocked the entire world. It has overshadowed the situation in the Moluccas. But in view of the fact that hundreds have died, thousands have been injured and tens of thousands of people have been uprooted, we need to turn our attention to this region as well. This kind of solidarity is a big support to the Dutch-Moluccan delegation sitting here on the platform. I am banking on the Commission’s giving serious thought to this point, on action being taken and on the points contained in the resolution being implemented.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think we would all agree that we need to ask for attention to be focussed on the situation in the Moluccas as well. There are many people from the Moluccan islands living in the Netherlands and they also believe it is important for the European Parliament to speak out about the situation in that part of Indonesia. I welcome the fact that we are all able to do so this morning and that we have also produced a joint motion for a resolution containing those principles we consider to be fundamental.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that the violence in Indonesia has not been confined to East Timor, although, as is perfectly right and proper, this region has received most of the attention of late. We are also very much in favour of talking about the Moluccas. The violence being meted out there has cost many people their lives and the Indonesian authorities have failed to take adequate action against this. By disturbing the balance of Moluccan society Jakarta has, in fact, contributed to the increase in violence. The authorities do not appear to want to get a grip on the continuing polarisation between Christians and Muslims. There too, as we see, armed militias run amok without let or hindrance.</p>
<p class="contents">We want this situation to change and we demand that the Indonesian Government put an end to the violence. We also demand that it create a situation in which we too are able, from within the European Union, to lend appropriate assistance with repairing the damage and providing the people with the humanitarian aid they need.</p>
<p class="contents">Indonesia will not survive if it does not find a solution to the violence that is spreading across a number of islands, if there is no respect for minorities within a democratic structure and if there is no scope for regional autonomy. Indonesia must be given a push in this direction. We want the United Nations to play an active part in this, particularly in the interests of the people who live on the Moluccan Islands.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You see, we are closely involved in the ups and downs of the Moluccas, one reason for this being that many Moluccans have lived in the Netherlands for a long time now.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the disturbances that took place at the beginning of this year, there was a short period of calm in and around the Moluccan islands, but at the end of July, the violence flared up again in all its ferocity. It is striking how little interest the media show in these disturbances. The Moluccas have been completely overshadowed by East Timor.</p>
<p class="contents">The current irregularities are much more organised in character than the disturbances that took place in January. This gives me great cause for concern. Various army units in the Indonesian army have been transferred to Ambon, not to maintain public order but to participate in the conflicts themselves. Civil-military relations are not very democratic, which is why pressure must also be brought to bear on the Indonesian Government to take independent action.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I would just like to make reference, in this connection, to the disadvantages of delivering aid via international channels. In the case of the Moluccas, there is a historic bond with the Netherlands. The Netherlands has recently started delivering ever more multilateral rather than bilateral aid, which has led to the aid no longer being recognisable. Consequently, the Moluccans feel they have been left in the lurch. We must not allow the joining of forces to be to the detriment of historic bonds.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have already briefly discussed the alarming situation in this country. We would like to ask Parliament to give some of its attention today to recent developments there, whereby Belarus, that is the Government of Belarus and President Lukashenko in particular, are at risk of isolating themselves still further from the international community, and in so doing from the European Union too, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">The internal situation in Belarus gives great cause for concern. Democratic structures are not functioning and we are on the sidelines to some extent because the international community is disregarded by the authorities in Minsk. Our willingness to help to find a solution to the internal political problems and the deadlock that exists there is not being satisfactorily addressed by President Lukashenko.</p>
<p class="contents">We also want to help to promote dialogue between the opposition and the government. We support the OSCE, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, in its efforts to achieve this. Our Parliament is also involved in activities undertaken by the Assembly of the OSCE which are designed to bring about an improvement in the situation in Belarus. But where is the gesture from the President? What positive reaction has there been on the part of the government in Minsk to the efforts being made to bring about a dialogue? What we see is quite the reverse. Instead of positive gestures we see arrests, intimidation and disappearances. A climate of fear is being created.</p>
<p class="contents">It gets very difficult to find a compromise in a situation of this kind. We are in fact prepared to stretch our standards a little in the interests of the people of Belarus. We are prepared to talk to a President who is actually there illegally. If he fails to offer us a gesture, then things will certainly become very difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">If, as I said, the opposition wants to talk then we will support this, but there will have to be a prospect of fair elections which will put an end to what is currently an extremely odd constitutional situation in Belarus in which there are two parliaments and a President reappointed by “referendum”. There are, of course, limits to our realism and that is why we want to take the opportunity today to register our protest about the situation in Belarus. We also want to make an urgent appeal to its government to do something about those who have disappeared and to ensure that they reappear so that that in itself may lead to really getting a dialogue going which will move towards free and fair elections, hopefully next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know that we are faced with a very, very difficult situation on account of the fact that in this country, such dubious Stalinist values are enjoying a renaissance and it appears that nothing has really changed. On the other hand, Belarus is important for the entire European security structure and it is – and we should not forget this – one of the countries bordering the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we are naturally clutching at any semblance of hope that we can again support a democratic movement in this country. But the situation is unimaginably poor. The work of the OSCE is marking time, in spite of the enormous motivation of the working group and despite the fact that it is really looking into every opportunity in detail. All attempts at dialogue with the opposition are counteracted in practice by human rights’ violations on the streets and in the prisons and by violations against the free press. Lukashenko has to be told in no uncertain terms that he cannot speak with a forked tongue.</p>
<p class="contents">The drama attached to important people, rivals of Lukashenko, suddenly disappearing, shows that the opposition is to be rooted out. As soon as a critical article is written, the newspapers are threatened with closure. We really have to strive to speak a clear language in this regard, even if we naturally want to promote the process of dialogue and not obstruct it. In this connection, Lukashenko, however, must be the first one to set an example. Such an example would amount to him approving the 5 Million programme for civilian society in the event that the Commission were to travel to Minsk tomorrow. A second example would be releasing his opponents from prison. That would be a sign to begin a dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">I would question the sense behind this resolution when Lukashenko will not listen to us in any case. But it does have a point, because we would like to show the people that we will never lose hope for a change in Belarus, and that we will do all we can to ensure that democracy is restored to this country.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Developments in close proximity to the European Union, namely in Belarus, are therefore deeply worrying. An old communist system lives on there.

Other people too have disappeared, as has been pointed out here in previous interventions. </p>
<p class="contents">Democracy is founded upon people being free to express their opinions, even if this is uncomfortable and is not appreciated by everyone. Let us, together as a Parliament, view supporting the developments towards democracy in Belarus as one of our most crucially urgent tasks. </p>

Though one of the few advocates in her fatherland, she dares to defend the political opponents of the Lukashenko regime. In so doing, she does in fact already have one foot in prison, figuratively speaking. The judicial authorities in Minsk judge that her personal commitment to human rights is irreconcilable with her legal work. The confederation of German lawyers has an entirely different view of the matter. It recently awarded Stremkovskaya its prize for human rights. Her speech of thanks tells us a lot. Those who champion a democratic constitutional state in Belarus long for western support and for interest to be shown in their extremely difficult position. This is the ultimate significance of the prize awarded to her for her selflessness. Belarus must not remain a “black hole” on the European map.</p>
<p class="contents">The present joint resolution fulfils this fondest wish of ours. Hence, we are able to give it our full support. The resolution serves to underline Stremkovskaya’s criticism of Lukashenko’s repressive presidential rule: “people are disappearing in Belarus and that is causing great public unrest.” We want this topical debate to give a boost to the opposition in Belarus. There is certainly a need for this, now that such bitter, almost desperate words are reaching us of the kind uttered by the exile Siaretski, the former President of the Belorussian Parliament that was dissolved by Lukashenko: “Belarus is currently under the leadership of a man who says of himself that he admires Hitler.” A man who can only survive politically on account of support from Moscow which, in turn, is itself being financed by the West.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A week ago, I was involved in a live television debate with the OSCE's representative for the Roma population, who is monitoring the situation. I regret to have to say that his appeal to the effect that the EU should do something about the Roma’s situation, such as arrange a special meeting, has fallen on deaf ears. We know that people are being thrown out of hospitals and exposed to various forms of violence if they belong to the Roma population. The profound appeal I am making to the Commission and the Council is therefore as follows: help arrange a special meeting where the Roma’s situation can be discussed. Try to obtain a proper monitoring of the situation and demonstrate that all the international organisations which are on the scene in Pristina want to do something about the issue, for example by calling a meeting of the kind that the OSCE’s special rapporteur has been seeking (but without receiving any support). This could be extremely significant in showing the path we are to go down.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the present Commissioner, Mr Nielson, will present this message to Mr Hombach and his colleagues in Pristina and Thessaloniki. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all agree, and this is also apparent from the joint motion for a resolution, that the Roma in Kosovo are not receiving adequate protection at the present time. There may be all kinds of reasons for the fact that they are being treated in a very unfriendly manner, particularly by the Albanians, but that does not alter the fact that they have a right to protection and that this is inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">KFOR is doing its best but there is too much happening all at once. Nevertheless, we urge that a more active approach be taken to protecting the rights of the Roma, for they have just as much right to this as the other inhabitants of Kosovo. After all, that is what the Kosovo conflict was all about. Were those not the values we were fighting for? It is on account of these selfsame values that we must now also fight for the interests of the Gypsies in Kosovo. If the Albanian leaders expect us to support them in rebuilding Kosovo, then it is right that we should not hesitate to remind them of their responsibilities with regard to the Roma. Their situation demonstrates yet again that it is taking far too long to build up the police force. One of the big complaints we have at the moment about the situation in Kosovo itself is that the military police have to carry out extra duties when they have so much other work to do and they are not actually trained for the duties. We would also make an urgent appeal to the UN to ensure that the police force is built up more rapidly than is the case at present. For the situation in Kosovo – I was there myself only last week – is one of chaos, and this must not be allowed to continue for too long.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution rightly points to the problems endured by the Roma in other European countries, some of which are applicant countries. Only this week, I was confronted with one example of this in the form of a Czech local authority that wants to build a wall somewhere in the city in order to separate the Gypsies from the rest of the population. It seems to me that actions of this kind are not in keeping with the Copenhagen criteria. I just wanted to point out that the Roma problem is not one that crops up in Kosovo alone. The Council of Europe is very active in this area, for every day there are in fact reports of problems somewhere in the world. I would also urge this Parliament to endeavour to develop a coherent approach and to help to find solutions to the problem on account of the sense of responsibility we all share. Just shaking a fist does not always solve problems.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As recently as the last part-session, we talked about reconstruction and we also discussed the situation facing Albanian Kosovars in Serbian jails in the debate on urgent subjects. I would like to point again to the fact that this situation gives a great deal of cause for concern. We did adopt this resolution last time but reports have reached me in the meantime to the effect that there has been no improvement whatsoever in the situation. We really are going to have to keep an eye on this.</p>
<p class="contents">It is right and proper that we should be discussing the situation facing the Gypsies in Kosovo today. I think it is completely unacceptable for any section of the population whatsoever to be disadvantaged and persecuted. We must take very decisive action against this and I believe that the compromise resolution articulates this in a very balanced and effective manner and also places responsibility where it needs to be placed. There is no need for me to read it out. Everyone can read it for themselves and we will see that it is indeed worded very effectively. Indeed, I have visited Kosovo myself and have spoken to most of the Albanian political leaders there from across the political spectrum including Rugova, Bukoshi and Thaçi. These people are well aware that they do not always have control of the situation. I believe this resolution shows our support for them; it is a recommendation and we must help them to put it into practice.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has certainly been successful in certain parts of former Yugoslavia. Radicalisation is underway in Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, everywhere, in reaction to his ethno-racist policy. The Albanians in Kosovo have already been subject to this pressure for a very long time but they have continued to resist it. They have succeeded in this for some time now due in particular to Mr Rugova’s leadership. But if the oppression continues to increase in its severity and shows no signs of abating and ethnic cleansing takes place, then it is to be expected that radicalisation will be the response met with there too. In reality this would mean success for Milosevic in terms of his policy, for he would actually like to spread this ethno-racist ideology throughout the region. We must bring pressure to bear on the Albanians as a matter of urgency and appeal to them not to grant him this success.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament has always rejected ethnically-based lines of reasoning. We are on the side of the oppressed in principle and even if the victims of yesterday are the ones holding power today, we will still be on the side of the victims of today. Everyone knows that this tends to be the Serbs. Indeed, there are many instances of the Serbs being violently oppressed at the present time, but there is very little attention being given to the Roma. They easily fall prey to ethnic hatred for no one likes them anywhere. That is all the more reason to keep this very vulnerable population group within our sights, specifically with the use of this resolution. KFOR must be afforded the scope and resources it needs to protect the Roma.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an urgent need for a fully fledged Kosovan political power that will truly be in a position to guarantee public order, and not by choosing the easy route, that is to say, the division or cantonisation of Kosovo, but by choosing a route that leads to reconciliation. Kosovo must take the route leading to a constitutional state if it is to achieve this. Effective public administration must be established. I know that in that respect Western Europe is doing everything that can be done and this deserves our full support. This will have to include support and a role for the Yugoslav Tribunal, since justice for all concerned is an essential prerequisite to reconciliation between the various population groups.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was fought in the cause of upholding European values. The fact that it was to protect a largely Muslim people – the Kosovo Albanians against oppression and genocide by the Christian Serbs showed that such values are independent of, if certainly influenced by, religious belief.</p>
<p class="contents">The core of the values we fought for was the right to be different – the right to live in peaceful enjoyment of one’s own culture and identity and to enjoy full civil and political rights and not to be segregated or ghettoised. It would be a betrayal of those who believed in the morality of the war in Kosovo for us now to tolerate discrimination against any minorities there – whether Serb, the subject of my Group’s amendment, or Roma. Of course, we can understand bitter grievances and resentments, but we cannot condone summary justice. We stress here again the need for proper investigation into war crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">The success of the Austrian Freedom Party last week threatens to contribute to making dangerously populist and xenophobic views respectable in Europe. This resolution signals, not least to the Kosovo Albanians, that Europe does not accept xenophobia in any guise. Europe does not choose to defend certain communities or minorities. It insists on defending everyone’s human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Serbs, Gypsies, Egyptians and Muslims are also victims of the ethnic cleansing operation which the KLA forces have been systematically carrying out for some months now, turning the presence of NATO and KFOR forces to their advantage. The responsibilities of the European Union and of the so-called international community are great. Despite our being well aware of the atrocities committed by the KLA, we still nominated its forces to act as a protective body for Kosovo and, at the same time, we purported to be interested in the plight of the Gypsies. In view of this, we consider the resolution under debate today to be hypocritical. Not only does it omit to outline the responsibilities, but it essentially makes the European Parliament jointly responsible for the terror facing the Serbs and Gypsies in Kosovo. If Parliament wishes to play its role, it needs to put an end to KLA action, under all its guises, both policing and military.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – On capital punishment: during the last three years, a resolution on the death penalty has been passed in the UN Commission on Human Rights with a growing number of co-sponsors. To take the policy against capital punishment one step further, to consolidate the achievements of the Human Rights Committee and to establish the question of the death penalty on the agenda of the UN General Assembly, the EU Member States have decided to introduce a resolution in the Third Committee during the 54th session of the General Assembly. It is the objective of the EU to keep the text focused and concise to win as broad a support as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU will seek collaboration with other regions and states that share the same vision to arrive at the best possible result. I noted, and I agreed with, what Mr Dupuis said, that this initiative is not anti-American. It is pro-human.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Moluccas: the Commission follows closely domestic events in Indonesia and shares with honourable Members, the serious concerns about the dramatic inter-religious conflict in the Moluccas and the ensuing injury and loss of life. The European Union has made it clear to the Indonesian government, on numerous occasions, with particular reference to the Moluccas, that it holds it responsible for law and order throughout Indonesia. The government is well aware of the Union’s view and acknowledges its responsibilities. ECHO has been running a project worth EUR 1 m for humanitarian aid to the population in need. The project covered the supply of drinking water, food and medication. A renewal is under consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">At this moment, Indonesia is undergoing significant political, economic and social changes. It is hoped that this process will contribute to improving the social climate in particular as regards inter-ethnic and inter-religious tensions.</p>
<p class="contents">I heard the debate today and I interpret it as a very mature and very sober contribution to furthering these hopes that what I would call a soft landing for Indonesia and for all the peoples of Indonesia can be obtained.</p>
<p class="contents">On Belarus: the Commission is closely following developments in Belarus. We appreciate the efforts of the Belarus government and opposition to initiate a constructive dialogue in order to agree on acceptable conditions for fair and free elections, and thereby restore the rule of law in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission remains concerned about Belarus’s human rights record and in particular about the disappearances of political personalities, most recently Mr Gonchar. The EU presidency has officially asked the Belorussian authorities to make all efforts to find Mr Gonchar and secure his safety. This took place on 24 September.</p>
<p class="contents">Such developments may well put at risk an agreement between the government and the opposition in the framework of their recently established dialogue. In a few days the Commission will adopt the TACIS civil society development programme in the slightly amended form agreed informally last June with the Belorussian authorities. The document will then be formally submitted to the Belorussian authorities for approval. We trust that the Belorussian authorities will remain committed to the endorsement of the programme. This will represent the fulfilment of an important political benchmark set by the EU last April. Only the fulfilment of the EU’s political benchmarks will allow the EU to gradually normalise relations with Belarus. Among these, human rights have a significant weight alongside free access to the media, an end to harassment of the opposition, constructive dialogue between opposition and government and endorsement of the TACIS civil society development programme.</p>
<p class="contents">On the resolutions on abuses of Roma and Serbs in Kosovo I have the following remarks. The Commission fully shares the concerns expressed in these resolutions. The Commission and the EU have been clear from the outset in our condemnation of all ethnic violence whoever the perpetrator and whoever the victim. It is as unacceptable now against the Serb and Roma minorities as it was when carried out against the Kosovars until some months ago.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission continues through its assistance programmes in the field of democratisation and human rights to support confidence-building measures and dialogue between the different communities. We already did so, though unfortunately without enough success, before the conflict and now in the changed circumstances this continues to be one of the priorities in selecting projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore the Commission, through ECHO, provides humanitarian assistance in favour of the victims of the Kosovo crisis, including the Serb and Roma minorities. We fully support the efforts of KFOR to maintain law and order in Kosovo and to protect all citizens. We fully support the efforts of UNMIK to establish a functioning civil administration which would take over policing functions from KFOR, and to create a peaceful multi-ethnic society which would set about the task of rebuilding Kosovo and its society.</p>
<p class="contents">UNMIK has approached the Commission for support for the Kosovo protection corps. Member States will decide in the coming weeks on the Commission’s proposed programme in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on all others within and outside Kosovo to also support these aims and to support UNMIK and KFOR in their work to achieve them. We too oppose any cantonisation of Kosovo. Kosovo must become a multi-ethnic society without distinction or discrimination on ethnic or any other grounds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
