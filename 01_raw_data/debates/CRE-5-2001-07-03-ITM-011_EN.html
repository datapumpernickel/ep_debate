<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ettl (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission has presented two proposals for directives with a view to changing the legislation governing life and non-life insurance companies. I would like to comment on both proposals at the same time, as the two have a great deal in common. By means of these two proposals, which are part of the Action Plan for Financial Services adopted in Lisbon and to be implemented by 2005, the existing legislation on non-life insurance dating from 1973 and on life assurance dating from 1979 are to be strengthened and improved.</p>
<p class="contents">The solvency margin is the additional capital reserve that insurance companies have to create as a buffer against unforeseen events. The general aim of the proposals is to provide improved protection for policyholders by increasing the capital resources of insurance companies and by ensuring more efficient state supervision of insurance companies. Higher solvency margins or risk buffers not only increase confidence in the performance of insurance companies, they also generally reduce system-related risks on the financial markets. Efficient, viable insurance companies do much to enable the opportunities of the single market to be perfected and exploited to the full.</p>
<p class="contents">These directives establish a basic framework of binding stipulations and checks and allow national legislators to adopt provisions going beyond that degree of regulation. This approach is understandable, bearing in mind subsidiarity and the considerable cultural differences reflected in the laws governing supervision in the Member States, and from a consumer policy standpoint is to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">One point especially worthy of note is that national insurance supervisory authorities will be empowered to intervene as soon as danger looms, even if this is not a classic early warning system. The same preventive supervision is likewise set out in "Basel II". This document was put forward by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision of the Bank for International Settlements.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposals relating to smaller mutual associations should be endorsed. Although the upper limit for exemption from these directives, expressed in terms of annual contribution income in the last three years, is to be raised from the present EUR 500 000 to EUR 5 million, the provisions will not result in these associations being forced out of the market. These mutual associations in many cases operate purely at local or regional level, and they will be able to continue these activities. However, if these associations require a pan-European concession to become active at international level, it will be sufficient to send a simple communication to the national supervisory authority to the effect that they are willing to subject themselves to the provisions of the solvency directive on a voluntary basis. This will absolutely guarantee that these associations are able to survive, and it will be for individual associations to extend their area of business or otherwise.</p>
<p class="contents">Both proposals for directives are to some extent interim measures chiefly involving changes of a technical nature. The Commission will be submitting a further "Solvency II" package in which it will revise overall regulation of this sector in the longer term. Things will no doubt hot up then! The "Solvency I" package before us today should therefore be endorsed, particularly as this is in the interest of the public and of policyholders. The sooner we can implement these interim measures the better. For that reason I have endeavoured as rapporteur to give a high profile to informal explanations of the views of the Council and of the Commission under the fast-track procedure, and to work towards a compromise between the Council, the Commission and Parliament. The reports before us therefore already reflect the common position so that it would be possible to adopt both directives at first reading. I hope that will be possible – it depends on your steadfastness and your capacity for raising objections, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">Permit me to make one final observation on the procedure itself. This particularly applies to fast-track codecision procedures. This procedure requires flexibility, something that has largely been absent, chiefly at Council level. This is not the first time I have had to say that. Codecision means more than just one side having to be flexible. This criticism applies not only to the Council, but also to you, Commissioner, although somewhat less so in this case, and somewhat more in the previous one. This kind of attitude towards codecision in this sector can only impair the deepening of the European Union or integration. We also need to reflect upon the ability of our decision-making processes to function properly. Certainly we need to do some thinking in the wake of the Irish referendum. With those concluding remarks, I urge you to vote for both reports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their rapporteur, Mr Ripoll y Martínez de Bedoya, unfortunately cannot be with us this evening. The Legal Affairs Committee approved the proposal and had no comment to make on it.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, speaking on behalf of my Group about Mr Ettl's report, I would like to congratulate him on the work he has done. He has done a good job and clearly worked very hard on this.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Ettl has said, these are largely technical updates, but still important. We have not had a revision of these directives for nearly 20 years, so we are engaging in a bit of a fine-tuning exercise to modernise and update them. Like Mr Ettl, I will address the two simultaneously as they raise similar issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome these proposals as part of the wider financial services action plan which is so important for the future of the economy of the European Union Member States and could potentially deliver such great benefits to ordinary people across the European Union. There will be increased competition, increased consumer choice and lower prices in financial products which the financial services action plan can deliver, if we manage to get it right.</p>
<p class="contents">Like most of that action plan, and based on ordinary single market principles, these directives too are based on the single passport system to enable insurance companies to sell across Europe, so long as they comply with their own home regulations. That is a principle which is, and should remain, at the heart of the legislation we adopt in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome this effort to update solvency margin requirements: the rules relating to the capital buffer that insurance companies are required to hold against unforeseen contingencies, particularly high claims and poor investment performance. What we are doing here is essentially a warm-up for Solvency II. The more wide-ranging reform in this area will come with Solvency II. Nonetheless we need to ensure that we get the minor amendments properly sorted out before embarking on the more wide-ranging reform which we will see in the Solvency II regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Particularly welcome are the efforts to match regulatory capital more closely with risk profile. This is a principle we have also seen operating in the proposals on capital adequacy and solvency margins in relation to bank and investment companies. The same arguments can equally well apply here in that we are encouraging prudent risk management and rewarding those that manage and reduce risk.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to see a reference to the use of external ratings removed – it was initially proposed by the rapporteur. We do not necessarily want to rule this out forever, but it is premature to introduce it in this context. It is something we should consider in relation to Solvency II, but it needs more thought and discussion before we can introduce external ratings in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased also that a sensible compromise was reached on early intervention powers, which could be a useful addition to the armoury of the regulators in securing proper prudential supervision. The similar compromise on future profits was also very sensible. We are going to see the use of future profits phased out over an eight- or nine-year period, which will give the industry time to adapt to the new conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important overall to make the general point that in these proposals, as well as all others we deal with on industrial and financial services, we should make every effort to ensure that they are not overly bureaucratic and that the framework is as easy as possible for firms, both large and small, to operate in. That is the only way we will get healthy competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to comment on the timing. It is clear that there is general agreement that we should get on with these reforms as quickly as possible. Mr Ettl did a very good job in coordinating with the other two institutions. Like him, I very much hope that we can sort this out at first reading. It seems to me that we may have been doing some of the Council's homework for it, and tidying up some of those aspects which will contribute to a sensible regulatory framework.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank Mr Ettl for the work he has done on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to congratulate both the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs on their rapid and thorough analysis of the Commission's proposals to amend the solvency margin rules for life and non-life insurance undertakings.</p>
<p class="contents">The solvency margin is perhaps a somewhat more complicated – a technical, even dry – subject, but it is of very practical and real importance. It is to protect insurance policy holders by requiring insurance companies to hold extra regulatory capital to act as a buffer against unfortunate circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposals are to strengthen and update existing rules which, as has been mentioned tonight, have been in force for almost 25 years. I am pleased to note that the amendments before Parliament are entirely in line with the thrust of the Commission's proposals. While many are of a technical nature, some represent very practical measures which will provide clarity and improve transparency, such as the requirement for competent national authorities to establish guidelines that govern the acceptance of supplementary contributions by the members of a non-life mutual. The same goes for the requirement for the Commission's report to examine how national supervisory authorities have made use of their enhanced powers of supervision. Those amendments are very useful improvements to the original Commission proposal. In this regard I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ettl, and the shadow rapporteur, Mrs Villiers, for their efforts and contributions to the preparations of the two reports. I am happy to be able to inform Parliament that all Parliament's proposed amendments are acceptable to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst it is always hazardous to count one's chickens before they are hatched, I understand that there is a shared political consensus to seek adoption of these proposals within a single reading. It is my own personal hope that their efforts will be rewarded and that this proposed legislation will indeed be adopted with a single reading.</p>
<p class="contents">It is fair to say that this report has been a good example of successful cooperation between our two institutions. The Commission has an ambitious financial services programme which can bring many real and tangible benefits to our citizens and to industry. It is my hope that the excellent cooperation which we have enjoyed on this report may be carried forward, not just for the wider Commission review of the overall financial position of an insurance undertaking, called Solvency II, but also for the whole financial services action plan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
