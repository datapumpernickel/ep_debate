<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Smet (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite all the judicial instruments at European level and in the Member States banning wage discrimination, there are still considerable and persistent wage differences between men and women. The figures that are available to us from – indeed very interesting – European studies, show that there is a wage gap of 25 to 28% and in some countries as high as 30%. For example, the wage gap is greater in the private sector than in the public sector, the industrial and agricultural sectors have greater wage differentials than the service sector, and the gap seems to be widest in those sectors where women are underrepresented.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not always easy to interpret these statistics correctly. But it is generally accepted that the different career patterns of men and women account for about half of the wage gap – for example, women interrupt their careers more easily than men, with slower career progress as a result – the lower qualifications especially of older working women, the fact that working women are on average younger than working men – in other words, the objective, structural differences.</p>
<p class="contents">The other half of the wage gap, however, cannot be explained objectively and seems to suggest that there are hidden mechanisms of discrimination at play which lead to the undervaluing of female-dominated jobs and professions. The key mechanism is the job evaluation system, by means of which different jobs are ranked according to importance, and according to that job ranking, are allocated their salary scales. In most cases, this job evaluation is done by the social partners, whether or not based on a system set up by an advisory office.</p>
<p class="contents">Discrimination in job evaluation is evident from the fact that too low a value is placed on characteristics associated with traditionally feminine jobs, including social skills, women’s greater capacity to concentrate and greater dexterity. As they are awarded lower scores, valued less, these jobs are thus given too low a place in task hierarchies and payrolls, which means that the wage level for women is lower. At the same time, the characteristics associated with traditionally masculine jobs, for example technical insight, physically demanding work or financial responsibility, are correspondingly over-valued.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, workers do not know how their job is classified. It is even open to question how much insight the social partners have into how jobs are classified within businesses. Moreover, women are generally not involved in job evaluation since they are not the negotiators with the social partners.</p>
<p class="contents">The question then arises as to what Europe can do about this. Commissioner, I believe that first of all, the gathering of statistical data on wages of men and women, and on wage differentials, must drastically improve. At present, the gathering of statistical data both at European level and in most Member States leaves something to be desired. This should therefore be addressed first. I know that the Commission has appointed a group of experts to set this in motion, but I would also urge them to look for an explanation of the wage differentials.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European Union would do well to delve deeper into the issue of discrimination in job evaluation. For this purpose, an initiative could be launched, for example to supplement the Directive of 1975 which deals with equal pay, with an annexe in which a number of rules and criteria are laid down which guarantee a gender-neutral evaluation system.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States need a guide. So do the social partners. In my opinion, Europe could provide the perfect solution. Moreover, the social partners must be committed to ensuring transparency concerning the value scales used in the wage formation process. How can people find out if their wage is or is not the product of discrimination if there is no transparency whatsoever in the way in which their wage is determined? The social partners should commit in the same way to involving more women in wage negotiations, particularly to removing discrimination and at long last making wage discrimination No 1 on their agenda, for that never happens.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the guidelines for employment must be tightened up with quantitative objectives, target dates and goals in mind. They are not included, not even in the new guidelines, even though they are much better than the previous ones. This must be followed much more closely. I have never heard the Commission complain about the fact that the national action plans devote too little attention to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, there is a need for a global policy strategy. All these elements would form part of this and of the campaign which the Commission intends to launch and which could, in fact, be a useful tool in highlighting a number of these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I would therefore urge you to make this item for once a priority for the benefit of women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Three things are clear: one, women's wages are on average lower than men's across all occupations; two, women are predominantly employed in areas where the work has traditionally been regarded as of less value; three, women comprise a significantly higher proportion of part-time workers than men. The problem is therefore, clearly a deeply rooted one and cannot be solved without concerted action by all parties. This must include the introduction of job evaluation schemes based on objective, gender-neutral criteria, so that the current undervaluing of women's skills is brought to an end. However, we need also, as Mrs Smet has said, a much wider range of initiatives designed to tackle the structural disadvantages suffered by women on the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is appreciative of the extent to which the Commission is already addressing the issue through its proposals for the employment guidelines in 2002. The emphasis on gender mainstreaming and the strengthening of guideline 17 are particularly welcome. We also look forward to the proposals the Commission may have for a revision and updating of the 1975 equal pay directive. In the meantime, we call on both the Member States and the social partners to involve themselves actively in developing measures of the kind urgently needed to eliminate the gender pay gap. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">But despite the fact that it is a very good report which attempts to study each of the points relating to inequality of pay between men and women, today we are facing a deep-seated problem to which we see no solution. It is more difficult for women to find work than it is for men, they have more difficulties in terms of training and professional promotion and they have lower salaries than men. But this does not only affect women who have been in the labour market for some time, but it also affects young women who are very well prepared, in many cases better prepared than men, who do brilliant work and who receive lower salaries than their male colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no justification for it whatsoever, there is no legislation which allows it in any of the countries of the European Union but, despite all this, it is a reality which we are facing and which we have no idea how to solve. Social partners, both company organisations and unions, probably have a large role to play in resolving this problem. I am sure that, if there were more women in the leadership of these organisations, the issue would probably have been dealt with a long time ago. It is very regrettable that, while we are combating many other types of discrimination which are sometimes difficult to demonstrate, we have still not been able to resolve this one which is so obvious, which is reflected in the figures which appear on everybody’s payslips every month.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the fact that women’s work is undervalued, that their work has always been considered subordinate to men’s work, that it has always been thought that they are not capable of holding top positions, are prejudices which are still present in society’s mentality, which hinder equality, professional access and greater promotion for women.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Commissioner, Mrs Diamantopoulou, to seek some initiative which will contribute to resolving this problem. If in a Member State of the European Union somebody suffering discrimination presents a case and wins it, if they work in the public sector, their greatest problem will be confronting the dirty looks of their colleagues, but if they work in the private sector, sooner or later it will lead to them leaving their job. This means that many women do not even use the legal resources available to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We therefore welcome this report as its findings are indeed serious. It shows, as the rapporteur said, that there is a 20-25% difference between male and female earnings on average in the European Union and that in some Member States the situation is much worse. This report is a very practical one, putting forward measures which actually suggest very concrete things which can be done to address this very difficult issue. So we support the measures set out in the report and call for this action to be taken sooner rather than later, because this is discrimination that women have faced for a very long time. We have hundreds of years of discrimination to address and we need to get on with doing that. I certainly support all calls for this to become a priority for the EU and for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I would particularly like to draw attention to the fact that there are three Member States mentioned in the report in which the situation is significantly worse, worse enough for them to be singled out in the report. Those Member States therefore have a special responsibility to take action and to ensure that they get themselves up to the EU average as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two other things in the report I would like to highlight. First of all awareness campaigns: these are something that Member States could actually do without too much difficulty. They will not address the actual issues in the workplace, but it is something which governments can do relatively easily. The other thing which the report mentions, which I would like to draw attention to, is that governments themselves can provide a model, and I therefore call on Member State governments to look at their own employment policies and identify how they might become better employers themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I cannot omit to say that I find it disgraceful that, in the year 2001, we are still discussing these problems, and we know into the bargain that enlargement is not going to make matters any better, to put it mildly. The conclusion is that not only do women have lower paid jobs but, as a result, they do not get the plum management positions either, their having access to which is one of the prerequisites for our being able to change the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">If, however, I wanted to take the floor here this evening, it is because I want to draw your attention to a study which has just been published in Denmark and which shows that ‘unequal pay’ has its origins in childhood. The study shows that girls receive far less pocket money than boys. They are given far fewer consumer goods than boys and they earn less than boys, which means that boys begin saving up while they are still children. Inequality has thus already been established. This applies to all age groups, except for the 16 to 18 group. In all other age groups, girls are given less pocket money than boys. It is parents themselves, indeed women themselves, who give their girls less pocket money than their boys. It might also be added that boys have much better jobs and so earn more, too. The situation is the same regarding consumer goods. It turns out, of course, that boys have more TV sets, more PCs in their rooms etc. Perhaps we should begin with ourselves. Parents must give some thought to how they treat their children and prevent their being treated unequally from the cradle onwards. I recommend obtaining this Danish report. I thought it was very interesting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to point to three difficulties but first of all I want to make one thing clear: when we refer to a 25% wage gap, this covers all occupations taken together. In general the figure is 15% in the case of equal work. The reason I want to remind you of these two figures and these two concepts is because it is most important to highlight the difficulties we find ourselves in today, as my colleagues have done. The situation is extremely difficult and the solutions are not very visible or effective.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me draw attention to three points. Firstly, in France, for example, women only occupy 10% of all jobs. Of every 300 jobs, only 30 are filled by women. Women therefore have access to 10% of all the jobs on offer. So there certainly is a need for a change of approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in this report we refer to atypical work. It is also known as part-time work. Some countries think it is good for women. Personally, I do not think so at all. That is not the way to achieve equal pay and economic equality. For there cannot be equal pay without economic equality.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we need equal representation in the social partners' decision-making bodies. I would certainly be the first to fight for parity between men and women in the social partners' decision-making. But there are many jobs where no social partners exist, that is, all service jobs. So what can we do there? We have laid down a law on night work in France, which says that the social partners must address the matter. But there are no social partners in the case of these jobs, which poses serious problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to ask the Commissioner for one thing in face of all these immense difficulties: that we lay emphasis on the question of equal pay at the second reading of the 1976 directive we are currently revising together with you and with the Council. This issue does not seem to be welcome in the discussions with the Council. I think it is quite essential if there is to be any point to this revision of the 1976 directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, we must in future transfer more of the responsibility to the individual Member States. It is in individual workplaces that experience is gained. To be quite specific, it must be up to the individual countries, via the two sides of industry, to incorporate the principle of equal pay into national collective agreements. We must take account of the fact that there are differences between collective agreements and wage agreement systems in the Member States. Instead of direct EU legislation in this area, the EU must provide guidelines and recommendations, and the principle must be incorporated, more than it has been so far, into national action plans for employment and non-discrimination. In the years to come, the labour market will have a need for a larger workforce, and it is therefore important for us to expend more energy on creating better conditions for women. All in all, I am able to support all the initiatives put forward in the Smet report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In 1957, this was enshrined in the Treaty of Rome as a guiding principle and in 1975 in a directive. Despite the legal ban on wage discrimination, there is, as has been said on several occasions today, still a wage gap in the EU at the moment. That is unacceptable. I appreciate that in some cases, it is difficult to establish an objective wage formation process or job evaluation procedure, but that does not take away from the need for more transparency and gender-neutrality. The report rightly mentions value discrimination. That is where the government could step in, but so could the social partners. As stated before, they too play a significant role.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to involve women more in wage negotiations and in the decision-making process in general, and to recruit more women in decision-making bodies. It is embarrassing that the statistics available at European level on male and female wage differentials are out of date and incomplete. I therefore welcome the initiative to collect new data and I support the idea of carrying out further studies into the factors which affect salary scales, as well as the causes of unequal pay for work of equal value. A wage difference of 15% remaining after taking into consideration aspects such as age, training and career level is, as already mentioned, not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The topic we are discussing at the moment cannot be seen in isolation from other aspects related to women and the participation of women in work. It is closely related to aspects such as access to work, chances of promotion, a combination of work and care, etc. Equal pay for work of equal value can help break the vicious circle of lifelong inequality: lower pay leads to a smaller pension or to more work in order to obtain the same pension; more work often entails a greater need for child care, less time to develop other talents or abilities or to relax outside work, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the Belgian Presidency prioritises this issue and hope that the Member States will take this appeal seriously this time. I am also expecting the campaign on this topic in the year 2002 to provide a boost for it.</p>
<p class="contents">The report we are discussing is an initiative report. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Smet, on her work. It is mainly thanks to her commitment that this initiative report is now before us. It outlines once more a number of aspects very clearly and offers specific directions for solutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Torres Marques (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has played a decisive role in condemning and in attempting to resolve the problem of pay inequalities between men and women that exist in our fifteen countries. Both the Treaties and now national laws uphold the principle of equal pay for men and women. No country, however, complies with its own laws in this field. The differences vary from country to country, but the outcome is the same. When employment in a given sector is dominated by women, the outcome is lower pay. It is the jobs mainly held by women that society accepts should be the least well paid. Even in Scandinavian countries, where women have achieved equality, even in political life, it is proving difficult for them to enter decision-making positions in privately owned companies, where salaries are higher.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore have a situation that is out of kilter, in that the laws impose equality but society continues to accept a model that fails to value work undertaken by women. In order to ensure that real democracy is practised and that a new social model that accepts equality is created, we need to give men greater rights in the field of their private lives. The laws that have been adopted and the proposals in this area are quite telling. In Portugal, for example, the government recently presented Parliament with a proposal for a law making parental leave mandatory for a period of at least five days. No European country currently has such a law. This type of leave is granted at the employer’s discretion and the aim of this law is to attempt to change people’s way of thinking.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that society continues to accept men’s abdication of duties in their home lives constitutes a genuine form of unfair competition to which women are subjected in their professional lives. If we want to change the situation of disadvantage that women continue to experience in the workplace, we need to change people's attitudes and the practices of the social partners. And here, the European Union must continue to play a key role. At the Lisbon Summit, Europe acknowledged that only by increasing the rate of employment for women will it be able to achieve, within ten years, the economic and social development that it wants to see. Europe must now acknowledge that it needs not only more working women but also the jobs that women do.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, the Commission proposed and the Council accepted equal pay as one of the priorities for 2001 in its programme for equality. The European Trade Union Confederation has also decided to make this issue its priority for this year. In drafting this own-initiative report, the European Parliament...</p>

But it is not enough simply to make this statement; if Parliament really wanted to put an end to this injustice it would take binding measures and force all employers without exception to respect the principle of equal treatment for men and women on pain of heavy penalties. There are areas in which Parliament is able to adopt binding measures. But judging by the woolly proposals in the report, there is no question of adopting coercive measures towards employers. Under these circumstances, even if the European Parliament votes in favour this will be a complete waste of time. It will be up to working women to impose equality themselves, joining forces with the workers to demand a living wage for all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It deals with a general practice, which is common to all the social and economic systems of Europe, a harsh reality which will cancel out all legislative progress, be it at national or European level. Women have difficulty not just in accessing work but in advancing their careers and levels of pay. The last report on employment tell us that most of the Member States have given up trying to right this wrong and that this issue is missing from the social dialogue agenda in most countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We urge the Commission to call on the Member States to conduct a serious assessment, as the rapporteur suggests. And to avoid repeating what has been said by my fellow Members, with whom I fully concur, I should like to suggest to you, Commissioner, that we take a global approach to this issue both in your policy and in that of the Member States. The political practices which apply in numerous countries in the European Union in the area of women's employment, social protection and pensions marginalise them professionally, marginalise their ambitions, efforts, competitiveness and claims and hence their pay. Our role, your role is a difficult one; we must convince public opinion and women themselves that all these issues are interlinked. We must convince them that their so-called vested rights run counter to their interests and to the quality and viability of and pay for their work.

The wage gap between men and women is a well-known phenomenon which is present in all the States of the Union, although in different proportions, and the issue has been on our agendas for a long time now. Previous speakers have mentioned the World Labour Organisation Convention of 1951, the provisions of the Treaty of Rome, the 1995 directive and the Treaty of Amsterdam. A great deal has been done, including in terms of the measures to be taken. The Commission has been presenting recommendations for over 10 years now, sometimes at Parliament’s request; I also remember the code of conduct prepared by the Commission which sought to raise awareness in the Member States and the two sides of industry in order to take practical action in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the information is still not complete, analysis of the phenomenon allows us to understand the reasons for the existence of the differentials. There are structural reasons, which have been recorded, such as age, training, seniority, and precarious and part-time work, in which mainly women are employed. However, there is also genuine discrimination, direct discrimination – in some cases there is unequal pay for equal work – but, above all, value discrimination: women’s work is still considered to be of less value than men’s, even when they have the same qualifications and responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Here is an example from my country: it was only in the mid-1980’s, after 15 years of campaigning, that a pay rise was at last obtained in the textile workers’ pay agreement<span class="bold"> </span>for the category of workers ‘packing supervisor’, which exists in the textiles sector. This only happened, that is, when women lost their jobs during restructuring in this profession, which had been a typically female profession, and men began to be employed as well. I feel that this is a tangible example of an issue which was only resolved in Italy in the mid-80s and which still remains unresolved today in a great many other situations.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has made numerous proposals and, in my opinion, we should follow her recommendations. The Commissioner and the Commission are very open to such proposals and the employment guidelines for 2002 make this a priority too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Looking at this report, we all have to acknowledge a sad fact today. In spite of the many initiatives taken over the years and in spite of the positive action taken by the Commission, the pay gap between the women and men of the European Union remains. Not only do women on average earn 28% less than men for a job of equal value, often their jobs are also more precarious and unpleasant, an issue that is not raised often enough. More women than men are unemployed and more of them are long-term unemployed; finally, most of the time it is they who look after the children and sometimes other dependents too.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we have to take action, and in several directions. That is why I agree with the spirit and the proposals in this report: we need to set up a group of experts to improve the collection of statistical data; it is a good idea to launch a major Europe-wide campaign in 2002; and it would no doubt be useful to take that opportunity to publish a comparative report on the various Member States. Similarly, as the rapporteur proposes, we must review the 1975 directive and do something about training, to ensure that women really have the right to lifelong training, encourage the social partners to increase the participation of women in collective bargaining and, finally, take measures to help reconcile working and family life.</p>
<p class="contents">To ensure, however, that this goes beyond statements of intent, all the political leaders of the Union really must get down to work and clearly state their resolve to do so. Indeed, at a time when we are entering a new world and facing terrible challenges, those who govern us must realise that this situation is not just discriminatory and unjust, it is not just counterproductive; it is a daily contradiction of the values we believe in and the model of society that Europe must uphold. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The pay differential is the clearest and plainest expression of inequality between the sexes. We have heard data and analyses of the causes of the present inequality and I do not intend to repeat them. I intend to talk about what is being done today in terms of policy and planning. As you know, the fourth line of action in the strategy on employment, which relates to equal opportunities, has dealt with the issue of unequal pay since the strategy on employment was first implemented back in 1999. Over the years, from 1999 onwards, the Commission has evaluated the policies of each Member State on the question of equal pay. What we have found over the last three years is that several, not all of the Member States, have noticed the differential, have noticed the problem and have proposed policies and measures to combat it. The Commission refers specifically to this issue every year in its joint report on the basis of the data at its disposal and makes suggestions to the Member States as regards their policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The question which arises here is what tools does the Commission have at hand to make this assessment. And this, of course, is where we come up against the problem of indicators and statistics to which Mrs Smet referred. We need new subjects and new statistical analyses of them so that we can formulate the problem in absolute terms. The Commission is already working on this and I should like to give you one example. We need a statistical analysis of the ratio between men and women as regards the hourly wage for paid employees working longer than 15 hours. We need to analyse gross and net salaries in the public and private sectors and that means a breakdown by age, education, profession, economic activity, type of work and employment status. Very few countries have statistics in the form which I have referred to. And apart from the problem of the subject of the statistical analysis, we also have the problem of how to carry out statistical research. In some Member States, there is a huge gap between the date on which data is collected and the date on which the final results are published. And this does not just apply to the Member States, it also applies to some of the statistics published by the European Union itself. So improving statistics, which are a very important tool for improving policies, is our number one priority. You will see that this year's suggestions to several Member States refer specifically to the need to improve statistics systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The second basic point concerns the guidelines for 2002. I appreciate that this is a very clear strategy which calls on the Member States to set specific targets to reduce the wage differential between men and women. And, of course, our objective is to work with all the Member States and to exchange best practices so that some countries can imitate changes which are already under way.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point I wish to raise is that in the fifth programme, which is starting up now – the evaluation of the proposals submitted is being completed – the first priority when selecting proposals is the question of equal pay. We have divided the priorities which need to be set by the programme into five individual areas so that we can study the question of equal pay and move on to the question highlighted by several lady Members, that is, the need for an integrated strategy. A few days ago, on 13 September, the Belgian Presidency and the Commission held a major conference on the question of equal pay.</p>
