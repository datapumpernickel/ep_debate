<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lisi (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the tragic accidents which have recently affected the chemical industry and, above all, the people living in the vicinity of the sites and the environment, could not escape the European Union’s notice. Baia Mare, Aznalcóllar and, in particular, Toulouse and Enschede, have become synonymous with human and environmental tragedies to which we have a responsibility to provide a clear response. It is against this sensitive backdrop that the Commission presented to Parliament and the Council its proposal for a directive amending Directive 96/82 of 9 December 1996 on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances, better known as the Seveso II Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal is the product of in-depth scientific analysis. We must therefore acknowledge the Commission’s intention to tackle the shortcomings of Directive 96/82 in a constructive spirit, which means that we can now send a clear message to both the chemical industry and the people. We will do everything possible to ensure that adequate control measures are adopted and observed.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I have tried to favour a methodological approach based both on the scientific basis of the proposed amendments and an evaluation of the impact that they will have on the European economic system. It is certainly not an easy matter to introduce or strengthen precautionary rules so it is absolutely essential that we find a fair balance between the need to lay down changes that are sustainable for the chemical industry and the need to send the public a clear message of safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The method for identifying the necessary changes is clear: taking the conclusions of the two accidents as a basis to ensure that such accidents are not repeated. In practice, the proposal modifies two fundamental criteria: the minimum thresholds for the presence of substances in sites and the inclusion or reclassification of new activities or dangerous substances, in order to strengthen controls and reinforce accident prevention. All this will, of course, increase the number of sites affected by the new directive considerably, but we must not forget that what is at stake here are public safety and environmental protection against substances which could cause irreparable damage. I will therefore avail myself of this methodology to give you a brief account of the substantial changes proposed by the Commission and the amendments tabled by this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The accidents that occurred at Baia Mare in Romania and Aznalcóllar in Spain have led the Commission to bring mining operations and landfill sites within the scope of the directive too. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has, at the proposal of the rapporteur, specified the conditions for inclusion of sites and mining operations, specifying that all sites in which preparation or processing of hazardous substances takes place, irrespective of the type of processing, fall within the scope of the Seveso II directive. Moreover, we have stipulated that this applies solely to plant, mines and quarries which are in operation and not to mere storage areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the disaster in Enschede has led the Commission to draw up new provisions on explosives. Despite the various proposals made by Members, the Commission’s proposal has been deemed the most suitable for the intended purpose. Lastly, the accident in Toulouse, which occurred at a time of growing insecurity, has left a lasting impression in the minds of us all. For technical reasons and because of lack of time, the issue of ammonium nitrate, the substance responsible for the explosion, has not been addressed by the Commission. With the full support of the Commission, Parliament and the Council are currently endeavouring to fill this gap.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of ammonium nitrate is extremely complex and it has required a great deal of debate to establish the appropriate subdivision and thresholds for the different types of ammonium nitrate to limit the risks of accident to a minimum. What we have to work out is whether we should adopt the more rigid position at European level as regards thresholds or whether, on the basis of Article 176 of the Treaty, we should allow any States which consider it necessary to adopt additional, more restrictive measures, as, moreover, they are already able to do.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I am again tabling in plenary an amendment which provides for a higher threshold for the fourth category of ammonium nitrate products, to ensure without a shadow of doubt that agricultural holdings are excluded from the directive’s scope. Then there is one last thing we must do, which I will mention briefly and which we included in our report: we must call upon the Commission to send us a proposal within a reasonable timeframe defining criteria and methodologies to be used for land use planning – another serious problem which has emerged – in other words, deciding where plant should be located. Lastly, and this is my very last point, I would remind you that the Commission has endeavoured to strengthen provision for public information, which is something I feel will be especially beneficial and, above all, which we have a duty to our fellow citizens to provide.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by thanking all my colleagues who have taken part in and contributed to this process and the committee’s secretariat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately this is all too true, but we must guard this stable door effectively now. Seveso and Bhopal are places where serious accidents have taken place. These accidents have led to measures which have, however, proved insufficient each time. And each time an enormous tragedy has ensued.</p>
<p class="contents">In Enschede, it transpired that current Seveso legislation is inadequate. A fireworks factory that did not fall within the scope of the directive destroyed an entire housing estate. The human suffering was enormous, and the grief for the victims remains. Residents of this estate were unaware of the presence of the fireworks factory. Authorities were only aware to a very limited extent. It is therefore obvious that rules need to be tightened up.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I should like to call for four amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the threshold values must be lowered. This applies particularly to ammonium nitrate and pyrotechnic substances.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the duty to inform must be improved. Information should not be kept back on account of industrial secrets or the threat of terrorism. This is all too ridiculous.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, cooperation and coordination in Brussels must be improved, because we need to draw as many lessons as possible from near disasters. This is possible if we organise this through the European Commission and through Community institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and this is an important point which Mr Lisi broached as well, we need to be given an accurate definition of a safe distance. It is evident that dangerous undertakings do not belong in housing estates. A pro-active policy must be adopted in order to remove such enterprises from these estates, if possible with the help of European funds. And clarity should finally be reached about what exactly constitutes a safe distance. The European Commission is to lay down guidelines in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">To tighten up the rules is one thing, but to comply with them quite another. We could draft as many as rules we like, but if they are not implemented in common practice, then they will ultimately have little effect. The duty to communicate applies just as much to ourselves, the Commission and national authorities. Safety is not only a question of rules but indeed also of culture. It is a public task to promote this safety culture actively. Where safety is concerned, we should never take the soft option. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These accidents have taken place in spite of the legislation currently in force. We must, therefore, have even stronger requirements and do as much as possible to prevent accidents by concentrating our action on three areas as a matter of priority. First of all there are the products themselves, then there are the sites, their structure and their geographical location, and finally there are the people, and that means all the employees themselves and also the people living or working close to industrial sites.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the products are concerned – and this has already been mentioned – the Commission has revised the list and the thresholds in order to take into account not only the various accidents which have happened but also developments in scientific data. However, we believed that it was also necessary to amend the thresholds for ammonium nitrate so as to take into account the accident in Toulouse.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the sites, legislation already makes provision for hazard studies. However, the competent authorities must also be able to request that these studies, which are carried out by the undertaking, be verified by a third party in cases where any doubt exists.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the employees, efforts to improve training are needed, because training is the best method of preventing accidents. Such training must also be targeted at the employees of subcontractors working on site, since the number of subcontractors is increasing.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential to mobilise not only the employees within undertakings but also the people outside, because when there is an accident the people living close to industrial sites are also affected. It is therefore necessary to involve them in implementing external emergency plans, by allowing representatives of the local population to take part in consultative committees and also to inform the population as a whole about the risks and about what they should do if there is a problem.</p>
<p class="contents">One of our objectives is to get citizens to become fully involved in ensuring their own safety. That does not mean simply making documents available. That is why information campaigns targeted at the people concerned must be carried out regularly. Measures to protect neighbouring populations must take into account the difficult coexistence between dangerous installations and residential areas. Amendments along these lines were adopted by the Committee on the Environment. The Group of the Greens and my group proposed two amendments requiring the executive committee to develop a methodology for defining safe distances with regard to future businesses and residential areas, but also to take into account other criteria in current evaluations. We believe that these proposals are essential, but if they are to be given their full potential they must also be accompanied by legal responsibility on the part of the authorities which are responsible for urban affairs. That is why our group tabled an amendment along these lines.</p>
<p class="contents">Too many major accidents have continued to occur since the adoption of the first directive in 1976. It is now high time that this legislation was applied. We owe that to all the victims of accidents of this kind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Originally, Seveso III was supposed to be no more than what I would call an improved version of Seveso II. Following the tragedies of Baia Mare and Enschede, the revision of this directive was chiefly intended to broaden its scope to cover mining activities, and to reduce the thresholds for pyrotechnical substances.</p>
<p class="contents">On 21 September last year, the position changed following the catastrophe at the AZF factory in Toulouse, a very cruel reminder of the reality of the situation. In order to be effective, a law must, above all, be correctly applied. That was obviously not the case in Toulouse. No hazard study had been carried out in the building in which the explosion occurred. Nor had any reassessment been made – since 1995 – of the ammonium nitrates produced and stored, which is why, without calling into question the excellent provisions regarding risk assessment already laid down in Seveso II, I am in favour of making the obligations to be met by the operator more stringent. Article 9 is the backbone of this directive. We therefore need to take action, as it were, ‘upstream’, so that the safety report is drawn up with the greatest transparency and is updated as soon as any significant change occurs on the industrial site.</p>
<p class="contents">On this subject, the Liberal Group welcomes the adoption, at the committee stage, of Amendments Nos 17 to 19.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the safety report, and, more broadly, to another crucial aspect of this revision, the control of urban sprawl around industrial sites, I see that Member States have methods of calculating hazard limits which are very different, and in some cases contradictory, and that is why we welcome the vote in committee to adopt Amendment No 20, which seeks to implement, eventually, a single European method of calculation. As a Commission representative said to members of the French Parliament after the Toulouse disaster, a process which seeks to harmonise approaches without harmonising basic philosophies will never succeed.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, and also for the sake of consistency, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is also in favour of Amendment No 55 on this subject. Also for safety reasons, we believe it is essential, as stipulated in Amendment No 39, to lower the thresholds for the fourth category of ammonium nitrates, those consisting of rejects, similar to the substances that exploded in the warehouse at the AZF factory.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Madam President, the competent national authorities must ensure compliance with the on-site obligations, which are to be reinforced here, by means of Seveso III.</p>
<p class="contents">We must never relax our campaign against the trivialisation of risks in certain industries. That must be our priority, in memory of the 52 victims of Toulouse and Enschede, as well as all the other victims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Since we do not have a Toulouse I, we shall have to make do with Seveso II and its revised version. However, we do not want to throw out the baby with the bath water either. According to the results of the inquiry, the AZF factory did not comply with the regulations required under Seveso II. It is therefore difficult to come to any decision as to its effectiveness, and it is because the Greens are willing to ensure maximum safety on high-risk sites that we support Mr Lisi’s report and congratulate him on it. It actually improves upon the revision proposed by the Commission, and amongst other things it will give us a better grasp of the issue of ammonium nitrates. One very positive point is that the new classification will increase the number of sites falling within the scope of the Seveso Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also seeking support for Amendments Nos 49 to 55, and particularly the last two. Amendment No 54 will make it possible to extend the safety margins around new high-risk installations, to include, amongst other things, apartment blocks, transport routes, industrial buildings and recreation areas. Thus amended, the revised Seveso II Directive could be a valuable tool in the management of the territory of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The second amendment which I should like to defend concerns the calculation of appropriate minimum safety distances between future buildings covered by the Directive and the sensitive areas listed in Paragraph 1. We believe, in fact, that it is essential that the Commission should, within three years, submit a methodology designed in conjunction with the Member States, in order to establish this minimum safety distance.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to remind you that the French Government decided, yesterday, to re-open part of the AZF factory in Toulouse, despite the fact that the public is campaigning to have it moved away from residential areas.</p>
<p class="contents">When the amended Seveso II Directive becomes applicable, AZF would be closed on the grounds that it had not applied European legislation. The European Union would then be in line with the public and its safety demands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An important aspect that has exacerbated the subsequent accident in Enschede, and also in Toulouse, is the location of the enterprises in question in the immediate vicinity of residential areas. This illustrates that physical planning is of crucial importance to avoid future accidents or to minimise the effects of an accident.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore agreed in principle on the proposed amendments in this directive with regard to the physical planning aspect. It is of great importance that dangerous operations, should, in due course, be separated from residential areas or other areas frequently visited by the public.</p>
<p class="contents">I should, however, like to emphasise that, in my view, the individual Member States have an important role to play here. Physical planning is an issue in respect of which each country can, and should, take up its own responsibility, certainly where the protection of its own people is concerned. We are therefore also pleased with the pledge by the European Commission, with regard to the further detailing of the physical planning article, to step up cooperation with the Member States. I should also like to thank Mrs Wallström for the fact that she has honoured the pledge which she had made at the time to a delegation from the Netherlands with such promptness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know also that they are very interested in this important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">On 3 October last year I made a declaration here in Parliament on the Toulouse accident. I proposed that we should move forward with this amendment. In the meantime we have been able to incorporate some conclusions from the Toulouse accident into the amendment proposal. However, I remain convinced that it is not because of deficiencies in the Seveso II directive that the Toulouse accident happened. Nor am I of the opinion that legislation is the only means to ensure industrial safety. Safety consists of a mosaic of factors, but the responsibility lies first and foremost with the operators of hazardous facilities. Thereafter it is the task of the public authorities to control the operators and to inspect the sites.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion – and I do not seem to be the only one to have this opinion – Toulouse was much more a problem of practical application of the legislation than a problem of legislation being deficient. As long as we face problems of enforcement, we should rather concentrate our efforts on good cooperation, both within industry and public authorities, in order to improve safety in practice and not by the letter of the law.</p>
<p class="contents">So the Commission proposal did not aim at a major overhaul of the Seveso II directive. As you are aware, the Seveso II directive has replaced the original Seveso directive of 1982 that had been in force for more than 15 years. Seveso II itself represented a major revision of the European major hazards legislation and has only been applicable for three years. I therefore stress that the Commission does not intend to move from Seveso II to Seveso III at this point in time.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I regret to say that only a few of the 55 amendments proposed actually address issues raised in the Commission proposal itself. The majority of the other amendments seem to have been developed under the cloud of the tragic accident in Toulouse and address issues unrelated to the scope of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the AZF site in Toulouse was fully covered by the Seveso II directive unlike Baia Mare and Enschede. It has been repeatedly stated, including in the report of the inquiry commission set up by the French Assemblée Nationale, that the Seveso II directive contributes significantly to improving safety. Moreover, some of the suggested changes will actually increase red tape with no direct impact on safety. I will give you some examples. Nevertheless, the Commission has had a careful look at all amendments proposed with a view to accepting as many as possible. So we have taken a very positive approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make some detailed comments on some of the proposed amendments. Firstly as regards mining, the Commission cannot agree to deleting the words "chemical and thermal" as proposed in Amendment No 6. In this context we also reject Amendment No 43 proposing to make references to the water framework and hazardous waste directives. In our opinion the Seveso II directive should only apply when chemical processes are involved and chemical substances are stored. It is not meant to be mining legislation or waste legislation and the future directive on mining waste management should cover safety aspects of disposal facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as regards explosives, the definition of the two new categories for explosives are the result of a multi-stakeholder consultation aimed at reinforcing the directive while not placing undue burdens on industry. The Commission therefore rejects Amendment No 49. Member States have the possibility to make use of Article 176 of the EC Treaty to introduce lower threshold levels at national level as the Netherlands has done.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding ammonium nitrate, the Commission can accept Amendment No 39, in principle Amendment No 48, and in part Amendment No 53. I can also inform you that the Council's position on ammonium nitrate is almost identical to the amendments proposed and this is a sign of good cooperation between Council, Parliament and the Commission and will greatly facilitate an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards land-use planning, I acknowledge Parliament's strong wish to reinforce Article 12 of the Seveso II directive. The Commission will therefore accept Amendment No 13, and Amendment No 54 in part, but reject Amendments Nos 51 and 55. Furthermore, the Commission is of the opinion that the development of schemes of incentives and/or funding for the relocation of establishments is a task to be performed by Member States and cannot therefore accept Amendment No 31 either.</p>
<p class="contents">There are more things to be said about land use and I understand how important Parliament thinks this is. We will definitely follow up this matter and we have also had European workshops on land-use planning. As a result, it was decided to re-establish a European working group on land-use planning involving stakeholders from all interested parties and at all levels in order to develop harmonised guidance on technical advice, taking into account industrial risks in land use planning. This is what Parliament is asking for in Amendment No 30.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other amendments that the Commission cannot accept. I shall give you a couple of examples. Amendment No 35 suggests introducing a new article on training of staff, which would compel industrial operators to provide competent authorities with a training report every two years. However, the issue of training is appropriately addressed in Annex III and Annex IV. Moreover, as the safety report has to demonstrate that the aspect of safety management has been put into effect it must necessarily contain the information on training of staff. We do not advocate the duplication of effort that would be involved in producing a separate report on training.</p>
<p class="contents">Last, but not least, several amendments even aim at regulating how the public should be informed – newspapers, mail, Internet – and go as far as imposing certain obligations on the mayors of municipalities. This raises not only the issue of subsidiarity, but also the following question: should the provision of information be a one-way street or do we believe that responsible citizens should also actively exercise their right to know by requesting information? One of the core novelties of the Seveso II Directive is that it gives more rights to the public, but it also strikes a fine balance between active and passive information, thus imposing equal responsibilities on industrial operators, public authorities and citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me confirm the Commission's position on the amendments. The Commission is able to accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 8, 27, 32, 37, 39, 40, 42 and 45. The Commission can accept in principle Amendments Nos 9, 13, 16, 18, 23, 24, 46 and 48 and in part Amendments Nos 7, 17, 25, 26, 30, 50, 53 and 54. The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 3 to 6, 10 to 12, 14, 15, 19 to 22, 28, 29, 31, 33 to 36, 38, 41, 43, 44, 47, 49, 51, 52 and 55.</p>
<p class="contents">So by way of conclusion, and excuse me for speaking for so long, I would like to emphasise that it is in our common interest – the interest of European citizens – to have this proposal adopted and enforced rapidly. I would therefore ask you to accept the Commission's view – which is largely shared by the Council – not to consider the present proposal as an opportunity for a major revision of the Seveso II Treaty. As you can see, I have already made an effort to accept as many amendments as possible, thus already going beyond our initial intention. I promise that within the timespan of the sixth environmental action programme the Commission will undertake to gather all the experience gained with the application of the present directive and present a new proposal for a more comprehensive review of Seveso II as necessary. Thank you for the debate.</p>
