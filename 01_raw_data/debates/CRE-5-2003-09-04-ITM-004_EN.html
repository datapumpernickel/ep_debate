<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Zorba (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">Rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, the Constitutional Treaty reformulates in one of its articles the cultural dimension of Europe and this constitutional foundation expresses a clear political position. Namely that European culture is a fundamental component of the European economic and social model which is needed if the political venture of the European Union is to be completed. It is the duty of us, as Members of the European Parliament, to convert this constitutional formulation to an active, effective policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider that, with the report on cultural industries, we are making such a step. We have expanded our policy horizontally with certain important admissions which have to do with the conditions of production and consumption of cultural products and services by European citizens. We demonstrated during the preparation of this report and in the dialogue held in the Committee on Culture with all the honourable Members, and I must thank them for that, the central importance of creation and of creators as a basic source of the added value of cultural products. We took account of the important economic dimension of culture nowadays, its role in the economic development of regions and towns and its contribution to GDP and to the employment sector. We noted the revolutionary changes brought about by new technologies in many of the sectors of the cultural industries, such as in music, in publications and in the audiovisual sector. We discussed in detail the importance of the competitiveness of European products, compared with those from other countries of the world, the inequalities of the international trade and the close link between cultural heritage and tourism. European citizens consume millions of copies of disks and books and buy millions of tickets to the cinema and concerts every year. All this constitutes their cultural diet, thereby shaping their profile and their cultural identity.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens also watch television programmes. They receive information and influence on the Internet from a massive quantity of material which we refer to as content. In these ways they select, cultivate and promote one form or another of art and culture, different aesthetics and quality, in close dependency on education and their personal development. It is a complex cultural process which characterises the daily life of citizens and we should not ignore the broad political importance and weight which it has.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, enlargement gives Europe an even greater cultural dimension, together with diversity. The internal market is growing. Creators’ works must overcome a number of obstacles, such as problems in connection with distribution and promotion and extensive piracy, in order to find a way of reaching the European public. What we are looking for is European added value and that also applies to the thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises working in the various sectors. In order to address all this, we have made a series of proposals to the Commission. They are numerous, but I shall comment on just three.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the need for a definition of cultural industries and the sectors they include. We need here to analyse the cultural, commercial and economic dimension in order to include the sectors in the definition of cultural or creative industries, as they are called in certain countries. I think this will give us a better statistical picture, which we do not have at present.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second call on the Commission is to map the cultural industries at European level. We are calling for it to concentrate on cultural, economic, legal, technological and educational aspects, to include employment, intellectual property, the competitiveness network, new products and exports.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we consider that it is very important to have a Green Paper in order to promote the coordination of the Member States and the regions in the sector of the cultural industries, so that obstacles can be analysed, solutions suggested and a way found for the public and private sectors to cooperate, to promote competitiveness and to improve European citizens’ access to culture.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to believe that this report is just the beginning and that the Commission will respond not only to this specific report but also to the signs of the times, by taking the necessary initiatives with which, it should be added, the Council has also been preoccupied recently. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has come at just the right time to highlight the importance of the phenomenon of European cultural industries not only from an economic point of view – to which reference has been made – but also in terms of the potential they offer for cultural diversity in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unfortunate, but we are not always aware of the economic significance of European cultural industries. I am referring to audiovisual, music and publishing services. A study carried out in 2001 on the employment potential of this sector estimated that 4.8 million people were employed by creative industries in the broadest sense, which accounts for 3.1% of employees in the European Union. The European audiovisual sector alone directly employs more than 1 million people. Therefore, in addition to their contribution to diversity, cultural industries contribute significantly to the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">They of course differ from other industries in that they have an obvious social and cultural role. They have to do with creation. They involve producing and selling not products, like other industries, but cultural goods. These goods are the expression of an identity; they are reference points. Therefore, as far as cultural industries are concerned, normal industrial policy cannot play the same role, not being adapted to these industries. We need to look beyond it.</p>
<p class="contents">Cultural diversity presupposes a solid and varied industrial fabric that guarantees pluralism in the cultural supply within a global market. This phenomenon alone shows the importance that needs to be attached to this sector of activities that relates to our identities. I would like to mention some key actions to demonstrate to you that Europe is paying attention to this sector, not only within the framework of cultural programmes, but far beyond them.</p>
<p class="contents">You are all aware of the MEDIA programme and the work we do for film, but did you know, for example, that in the Culture 2000 programme, the support provided for publishing houses to encourage literary translations has benefited 1 300 translations in the past years? Did you know that a large proportion of the Structural Funds is used to develop the cultural industry? For example, in the Swedish town of Hultsfred, the ERDF cofinanced projects aimed at developing the music industry. Since then, the town has become the rock capital of Sweden! As you can see, European aid can result in genuine, concerted and concentrated development of cultural industries. Indeed, in your report, you call for a communication on the Structural Funds and culture, a communication that will highlight these types of actions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that since 2002 we have also been developing experimental measures designed to support the music and book industries. For instance, we have the project to increase exports of European music outside our continent. You can therefore see, ladies and gentlemen, that these cultural industries are being supported only by EU programmes and actions. I must add that we will soon have a unique opportunity to strengthen this action when we discuss the extension of the MEDIA and CULTURE programmes and the new generation of programmes. To this end, with Parliament’s help, we will have to envisage very systematic action so that the creativity of this sector can encourage economic and cultural diversity and, thus, our European roots. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased that the final report, as adopted in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, incorporated the more important elements of my Committee's contribution. I refer in particular to the emphasis on the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a long involvement with cultural industries in Ireland, in particular local industries which promote the Irish language, traditional music and culture of my own region in the West of Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">SMEs in the field of culture are clearly more vulnerable compared with similar sized companies in other spheres. These SMEs frequently produce, what are in effect, public goods. In other words, their products offer benefits to society as a whole above and beyond any commercial value. Such SMEs frequently face difficulties in assessing finance, particularly in the start-up phase.</p>
<p class="contents">If you combine the uniqueness of the cultural sector with the fact that such industries are often located in peripheral and rural regions, it is clear that the question of providing adequate finance must be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy would like Member States to look at what policy instruments could be used to promote cultural industries. Parliament has previously stressed the need to reduce the legislative and administrative burden on SMEs, simplifying the collection of data for tax collection and reducing unnecessary red tape, especially for the self-employed and small businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">One point of Mrs Zorba's report that I particularly welcome is the call for a revision of the 'De Minimis' rules on State Aid. Such a review would take into account the unique situation pertaining to SMEs in the cultural sector, particularly those in peripheral regions.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to make one particular plea in relation to the policy on the information society. Priority must be given to the development of broadband Internet access to rural and peripheral regions. This, would help create a more level playing field for the many cultural related SMEs based in these regions</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In fact, today we are seeing the emergence of cultural industries with an ever-increasing economic dimension, which also play a vital role in Europe’s cultural diversity and identity.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the problems raised by this report is the total absence of a precise definition of cultural industries and of any European industrial strategy in this area. The Commission must look at these issues and put forward proposals to us, perhaps by way of the Green Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">In future, we will have to increase aid for cultural industries in projects for the economic development of regions and towns, through the Structural Funds, and also by encouraging private and public partnerships. Similarly, the European Union will have to establish support measures for SMEs and independent enterprises, which play an important role in the area of artistic creation and production.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to emphasise here the importance of the printed word, and in particular of the regional daily press. That is what best guarantees linguistic and cultural diversity and is the most overlooked of the Union’s cultural policies. It is vital that when the Commission is drawing up its Green Paper it should at long last put forward proposals to actively support this sector, which is also essential for pluralism. In the same vein, the Commission will have to propose specific measures to combat media concentration.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I feel that it is now time to mobilise our efforts to ensure that the proposed UNESCO convention on cultural diversity can soon see the light of day. More than ever, we must promote a European cultural spirit in order to encourage creation and bolster cultural diversity, without which Europe would not exist nor have any influence abroad. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This deficiency is due, in my opinion, to fundamental causes.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Council’s fear of denationalising these policies, which some consider as signs of national identity. The other reason is the governments’, and also the Commission’s, fear of using Community resources for subsidies which are not directed towards farmers or large public works.</p>
<p class="contents">People avoid talking about culture or art in economic terms when, on the contrary, it should be argued that the cultural industries create employment and generate wealth for Europe. If we include the audiovisual field and cultural tourism in the culture sector, it is by far the most important sector for the European economy. I address this, without much hope that they read the Minutes, it is true, to the Finance Ministers and also our colleagues in the Committee on Budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">As requested by Mrs Zorba, the Commission must quantify these aspects and consider them when drawing up its policies, not only the directly cultural ones but also the economic, social and territorial ones. Furthermore, Commissioner, you should demand that your colleagues take this approach to territorial policies.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it is also becoming necessary to restrict the commercialisation of culture. You will perhaps remember that a few years ago one of the best museums in the world, the property of one of our Member States, was renting out its rooms when the museum was closed – rooms exhibiting humanity’s greatest works – for weddings and other social events. This was a depressing and alarming example. Within the European Union, the economic exploitation of cultural resources must be compatible with their historical and artistic dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, these aspects and many others are dealt with in this report, and I warmly congratulate its author on its timeliness and quality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We worked well together and managed, via a poll, to gain more insight into the finer points of the cultural industries. It is clear that there is much room for improvement, certainly at European level. The cultural industries are, after all, of great economic significance, and offer much scope for employment. On this basis, I should like to call for culture to figure more prominently in the Structural Funds; SMEs in particular might benefit from this. Culture is also, however, an expression of our national identity. In a united and, soon, enlarged Europe, it is important for us to be aware of this cultural diversity. Museums in all manner of areas are trying to accommodate this, but unfortunately, they are hindered in most European countries by the sometimes exorbitant premiums they have to pay for the exhibits on display. This gives museums in countries where this is not the case a major advantage in the organisation of outstanding exhibitions. This is, in my view, a clear form of distortion of competition, and it must be stopped; it prompts me to urge the Commission to map out the differences in indemnity regulations in the present and future Member States, and subsequently to table a proposal for more streamlined regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unacceptable for a united Europe to have an elitist group of citizens who are well-informed on what Europe has to offer in terms of culture, while others have to remain deprived of all the fine things that the cultural industries in other European countries have produced and are producing. Thank you. I should therefore like attention to be given to these indemnity regulations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In a society in which everything can be bought and sold, culture is in immediate danger of commercialisation, which changes its nature. Cultural creation is no longer the art created either collectively by society or by gifted people. It is becoming a product which is produced and sold, so that it can be converted to business profit, as well as a means of ideological guidance of the peoples, by promoting a specific way of life.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these conditions, approaching culture in terms of the industry, the market and added value, as if we were talking about cars or oranges, is very dangerous. Of course, the report expresses a number of concerns about cultural diversity. However, it is not these that determine its content, it is concerns that the European art markets have lost an important share of the global market, that the European Union has not yet developed its potential as regards the trade in cultural commodities. Company mergers are considered dangerous not because they result in monopoly control, but because they jeopardise market transparency. Even piracy is condemned not as theft of intellectual work, but because it deprives these industries of vast revenues, impacting on future investment.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals are in keeping with the concerns expressed. The report calls for the intervention of the Commission and the Member States not in order to strengthen artistic creation and protect it from commercialisation, but in order to strengthen companies and promote the competitiveness of the European industries. This sort of intervention will further institutionalise culture and put it under even greater control by the monopolies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to draw your attention to the amendments proposed by our political group, in a bid to mitigate somewhat the consequences of the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I appreciated the principles, the values that are the basis for the report itself, in other words the need to recognise culture as having a principal role in the European Constitution. Indeed, the motto ‘united in diversity’ only makes sense when interpreted in light of the wealth and diversity of identities and of cultural and historical roots which are the heart of our European identity.</p>
<p class="contents">All too often, however, European cultural heritage is neither appreciated nor exploited sufficiently, even though there is no doubt that it represents an area of great potential, not least from an economic point of view. I fully agree that it is necessary to begin by detailing a comprehensive study seeking to fix a European plan of industries and of cultural productions and activities and subsequently to implement a genuine inventory of European artistic and cultural heritage. It would be a step on from the past, even the recent past, when the Commission declared that it had neither instruments nor competence, thus relegating culture to an exclusively national responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by drawing attention to some important points in the report: firstly the reduction of VAT on music goods to boost sales and, in the meantime, to reduce trading of pirate products; secondly, greater focus on young artists, in terms of both training and promotion; thirdly and finally, greater investment at European level and more regulations, not least to facilitate European cultural enterprise financially, for example through the option of deducting the reinvested profits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their contribution to the Lisbon objectives is undisputed. Apart from creating wealth and jobs, the cultural industries, by their very nature, promote initiative and innovation, which are valuable factors for the competitiveness of the European economy. Their development can also help in particular in reversing isolation, by developing local societies, because it makes use of their comparative advantages and can easily be linked to tourist development and promotion.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out that the cultural industries have sectors which can create employment opportunities, especially for people affected by unemployment, such as young creators or women and the disabled. That is why I agree with the rapporteur that use should be made of the cultural contribution of the Structural Funds, especially now with the mid-term evaluation of the 2000-2006 programming period, so that we can take additional or corrective measures, such as promoting vocational training and, of course, promoting education at higher learning level, because in many countries, such as my own, Greece, it is inadequate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
