<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Brok </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty, the European Parliament has new powers of determining relations between the institutions. If we summarise the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty in the usual terms, it must be said that the European Council only has the right to propose the President of the Commission and that the European Parliament has the real right to elect him. This adds a new dimension to their relations and so we will also have to agree the procedures that need to be introduced in the course of this summer and autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">The political groups must grasp this new opportunity from the outset, which is why both the Committee on Institutional Affairs and I myself consider it right that in the long term we should adopt Jacques Delors"s proposal that the major political movements should nominate their candidates for the office of President of the Commission during the European election campaign. I believe that is extremely important because it personalises European policy and can thus also stimulate greater interest among the people in the European idea.</p>
<p class="contents">But I believe it is also important for the European Council and the governments to accept the results of the European elections as a determining factor in the nominations. That is why we think it is wrong for the presidency to propose nominating the Council"s candidate nine days before the European elections, for the European Council cannot know the outcome of those elections at that point. So it could make a proposal that was not compatible with the outcome of those elections.</p>
<p class="contents">A special summit must therefore be held after the European elections, so that, in line with the parliamentary majorities that emerge from them, a candidate can be proposed who is likely to win Parliament"s confidence. Here we will probably have to follow a new direction if we are to make the necessary headway. So we will attach great importance to negotiations with the European Council"s nominee, so that we can vote on the basis of the nominated president"s undertakings with regard to his political guidelines, the quality of interinstitutional relations, but also of the criteria which he and the governments will follow in the nomination of the other members of the Commission. Here, too, the nominated President of the Commission elected by the European Parliament has new opportunities, for the Member State governments can only submit a proposal in common accord with him.</p>
<p class="contents">That means this President of the Commission is also responsible for meeting another demand made by the European Parliament, namely to ensure a reasonable balance between the sexes and between the main political tendencies in the European Union within that Commission, so that it can act impartially. In our view that is also a real criterion for the conduct of the hearings of nominees. In that respect a number of improvements are still needed after the experiences of 1995.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also extremely important to make it clear that the Commission will become more independent because any conflicts of interest will be prevented by the declaration of external interests, by the obligation to refrain from taking part in certain discussions and other aspects addressed in the report. I believe that will help us avoid some of those situations that are currently the subject of criticism. This also offers new opportunities to hold Commissioners more politically accountable – as we tend to do in the case of national ministers – so as to make provision for their compulsory retirement and enable the President of the Commission to withdraw the portfolios of Commissioners who have failed politically, as laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam. Much of what we are discussing at present would not even have arisen if such instruments existed, because there would be more means of resolving the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">If possible, the President of the Commission should submit his proposals even before the summer break, after the European elections, and they should be voted on as early as possible so that the procedures for appointing the individual Commissioners can be initiated. I believe that on the basis of the timetable submitted to us we could find a solution that the Council and the future Commission could also come to support, so that in this way we can create the basis for new relations between the institutions, which would bring a new dimension to Europe.</p>

<p class="contents">It is a report which I think Parliament could comfortably adopt without any real reservations about its basic principles, because Mr Brok, encouraged of course by the favourable opinion of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, has drafted it in a way that takes into account most of the points about which we in this House feel strongly. And this is another demonstration that Parliament, at least in some cases – and fortunately there are quite a lot of them – can make timely headway and make even more rapid progress than the Treaties and anything that is likely to be drawn up in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We are debating the approval of the nomination of the President of the European Commission by the European Parliament, which is a most important change instituted by the Treaty of Amsterdam and which legitimises at least one of the two authorities that make up the European Union, if we accept the definition that the European Union is an association of peoples and states.</p>
<p class="contents">In that case, through the MEPs, the Members of the European Parliament, it confers popular legitimacy upon the proposal by the states, the Heads of State and Government, for the nomination of the President of the Commission. This is a very important institutional step and if, as we hope, the ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam has been completed by the French Presidency by the end of March, it will come into effect in May and immediately after the election of the Members of the European Parliament this very important new provision will be implemented for the first time.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in complete agreement with Mr Brok's observation that the scheduling of the European Council in Cologne one week before the Euro‐elections is unfortunate. I cannot believe that the result of the Euro‐elections will not influence the proposals by the Member States for the President of the Commission. We must insist and fight for this to change. After all, it is already January and we must do that.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not have much to add. My view, and that of the Legal Affairs Committee which I represent, is that Parliament must always interpret the Treaties imaginatively while not departing too far from the letter, because that might create more problems than it solves. The Treaties have loopholes, and these must be made good, but for the moment what is important is to implement the Treaty of Amsterdam correctly in July.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Delcroix </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I too congratulate the rapporteur on his report. This report is about the future – which makes a change from the debates we were having earlier – and, in particular, about relations between the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament with a view to greater democratisation of our institutions. Who is this report aimed at? I think it is aimed first and foremost at us, at the European Parliament. It is an internal discussion document, and I would also congratulate the Committee on Institutional Affairs on having initiated this process. It is then also aimed at the other institutions with which we need to find a balance.</p>
<p class="contents">The report deals with three groups of issues: the new features of the Amsterdam Treaty; the elements to revitalise the election campaign, namely, the Delors proposals; and finally, a clearer, fairer, and more transparent model of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Amsterdam Treaty, three new features have taken advantage, without admitting it, of universal suffrage, and, among these features – as Mr Brok has already mentioned – is the issue of assent, which is binding on all parties. The first matter of assent relates to the nomination for the President of the Commission, who will then chose the Commissioners jointly with the governments. A second assent relates to the whole of the College consisting of President and Commissioners, and the fact that this Commission will work to the political guidelines defined by the President.</p>
<p class="contents">This shows the importance of the role to be played by the European Parliament and the need to secure a majority. The outline is emerging of a European Union where an executive – the Commission – will be appointed by two legislative institutions, that is, the European Parliament, representing the citizens, and the Council, representing the Member States. This is a fragile tripolar structure and many concessions will be needed to achieve this balance.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is clear that the aim of the Amsterdam Treaty is that neither the Council nor the European Parliament should be in a position to alone appoint the executive without taking account of the position of the other institution. They are thus condemned, or at least invited, to work together and negotiate the composition, political guidelines and working methods of the Commission. Parliament is now in a position, therefore, to play a distinctly stronger role in the appointment of the College of Commissioners. That is new and I think we need to get used to it, which may not be so simple.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue involves adding vitality to the election campaign. As everyone knows, for a campaign to be successful, it needs to be about people and that was the appeal of the Delors plan. The problem is that our structures, especially the political parties, are not entirely ready for that yet. So it is unlikely to come into operation for these elections, but it probably will for the next ones and we must adapt to it. In any case, I do not think that the process of nominating someone for the presidency can begin until the voters have had their say, if only out of respect for the citizen in his role as a voter and for the European Parliament. After all, Parliament represents a breeding ground that Member States can draw from when forming their own governments, be it for ministers or for secretaries of state, and it may be surprising that the European structures cannot do more, particularly in terms of the composition of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally, I would like to say that I was very pleasantly surprised when the Council representative said in his statement this morning that the Amsterdam Treaty had given the European Parliament important new rights and powers, and when he added that he could see the next IGC granting the European Parliament an even more important role in the appointment of the Commission than is provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty. We have therefore probably been too modest up until now.</p>

We must remember that for a very long time EU policy was purely a matter for governments. Now the European Union is gradually moving closer towards fulfilling certain of the criteria of a parliamentary democracy, a most important and positive move.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is very important that this also gives considerably more political weight to the elections to the European Parliament. If the people"s representation within the European Union now acquires the right to have a determining say in the appointments to the highest offices of the executive of the European Union, it will also acquire considerably greater influence on Commission policy. I believe it is most important to follow on with the next step now and to enshrine in the political order of the EU the accountability of the Commission and its individual members to Parliament. After all, we have discovered the need for that very clearly in the current debates.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic idea is surely as follows: we want a strong European Union, a Union that can also assert itself vis‐à‐vis national interests. But a European Union that has this kind of power and influence needs a twin brother or sister. Its name is democracy. This report shows us that we can progress along this road to a democratic European Union in a crucial area, if the proposals it makes are implemented.</p>

Politics, in its most noble sense, is action, and I, in my own modest way, can contribute to this debate. In this respect, I must say that I have no desire to repeat here the statements I made in the competent committee regarding my disagreement with some of the solutions contained in Mr Brok"s report.</p>
<p class="contents">The emphasis on the Commission"s vocation of government is one of these aspects, together with the indication during the European elections of the name of the candidate for Commission President and the obligation to nominate a substantial number of Members of the European Parliament as Members of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I must say that I applaud and welcome the rule giving greater political responsibility to the Commission President. This rule, which results from the Amsterdam Treaty, means that the governments of the Member States must, by common consensus, nominate someone for Commission President. This therefore implies that the Member States must give more thought to the name of the person to nominate. The European Parliament has a vital role in considering and voting for both the President and the Members of the Commission. The greater political responsibility and authority of the Commission President is a principle to be applauded and is today, more than ever, a factor we should all welcome. If only one of my proposals had been adopted in the competent committee, this would have allowed some time between the nomination of the President and the latter"s programme and the respective vote for negotiating, settling interests and deciding on a strong personality with political credibility and authority over the Commission. Europe needs this rule.</p>

I do not agree with it because the institutional consequences of this proposal have not been thought through and because it makes the dilemma of our method of integration quite glaringly obvious.</p>
<p class="contents">The President‐in‐Office of the Council praised the Jean Monnet method today, the pragmatism of integration policy. That was the method of discreet projects that cleared the way and created momentum. I believe the situation today is quite different, which is why I am extremely pleased that the President‐in‐Office has now for the first time announced the need for a constitutional process. For the pragmatic method will certainly not take us forward any more. What is the point of this kind of election of a President of the Commission if it is not a real election?</p>
<p class="contents">How can a parliament downgrade its own election into the quasi‐election of an executive? Where does this quasi‐election of the Commission President take us? Towards a presidential democracy? Towards a federal system? Or does the President of the Commission have to be a Member of Parliament, and, if so, why? On the basis of what kind of constitutional vision? I think the time has passed for trying to turn the accumulation of power that is the EU into a democracy by means of those kinds of pragmatic, individual advances. The only way to turn this Union into a democracy now is through a constitutional process.</p>

However, on Tuesday afternoon, the slot devoted to relations with the Council, while we are discussing a text concerning relations between the European Council and Parliament in such a sensitive area – one where, post‐Amsterdam, Parliament now possesses the powers which led to Mr Brok's excellent report – well, the Council is absent. I do not see a Council representative, and quite frankly, if I may say so, given that Mr Brok, the rapporteur, was the European Parliament's spokesman in the working group which negotiated Amsterdam, this strikes me as conduct unworthy of a new presidency. Surely it could have paid a little more attention to such an important report. So, Mr Oreja, we shall say to the Commission what is meant for the ears of the Council, and then we shall send the minutes to the German Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I wholeheartedly endorse Mr Brok's report which, if adopted as it stands, without the amendments aiming to make it more lightweight, will I believe be an excellent starting‐point for the next five years, with a Commission that is equal to the challenges lying ahead of the European Union. I hope that the House will adopt my amendment on the European Council, drawing the Council's attention to the fact that holding the European Council on 3 and 4 June will jeopardise the whole scenario established at Amsterdam. I call on the German Presidency to acknowledge the need to move either the Council or the date on which the president‐designate is selected.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that my request will be noted in the Minutes.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Berthu </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, there are awful coincidences in parliamentary life. That is what has happened with the Brok report. Just as everyone is realising that the European Commission is rotten to the core with corruption, Parliament"s Committee on Institutional Affairs comes up with a proposal for us to act like a government of Europe by exploiting in advance the Amsterdam Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, the old theory of the independence of the Commission is trotted out. The federalists seem to regard it as a central pillar of their doctrine, but personally I see it as a clear cause of the evil that is eating away at the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution you are to vote on actually proposes strengthening the idea of the independence of the Commission, so as, and I quote ‘to safeguard the Commission as the motor that promotes the Community interest, the guardian of the Treaties and the exclusive holder of the right of legislative initiative". That amounts to virtual deification of the Commission: it is pure and virtuous, it defends the general interest and it is worthy of being granted essential powers.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the honourable Member who drafted those lines was no doubt thinking of strengthening the Commission"s independence with regard to the Council and the Member States, but not with regard to the European Parliament. Unfortunately, things are very different in practice and it is revealing that the most serious punishment recently meted out by the Commission against one of its officials was taken against Mr Van Buitenen, who made the mistake of passing compromising documents specifically to this Parliament. In fact, the doctrine of independence has led to a sense of superiority and impunity on the part of the Commission and this has encouraged lax behaviour to a much worse degree than we can probably even imagine today.</p>
<p class="contents">So we are combating this doctrine in order to get to the root of the evil. We want the Commission to be subject to thorough control on the part of Parliament and the Member States meeting in the Council. And in this respect, I would remind you, ladies and gentlemen, of how vital it is to vote on Thursday in favour of the motion of censure tabled on the initiative of my group, but now signed by Members from each of Parliament"s groups.</p>

But he has successfully got it through committee with very skilful compromise amendments. He is to be congratulated on that, even if he is not present. In connection with this report, and besides the qualifications and criticisms Mr Voggenhuber has already made, I would like to raise another subject that is not considered in the report itself and cannot indeed be considered given the Treaties as they stand.</p>
<p class="contents">I have repeatedly pointed out that I regard the nomination of Commissioners by the Member States as an inherent mistake in the EU"s institutional system. It inevitably gives rise to conflicts between what the citizens of the nominating Member State expect of their Commissioner and the latter"s obligation to give priority to EU interests. I think this is at least partly responsible for the current difficulties and believe that this aspect also needs to be considered during the discussions on reforming the institutions.</p>

Firstly, we are deciding on the destructive vote of censure – as it is called – against the Commission, and secondly we are establishing how our rights of assent can be used constructively in relation to future Commissions. It is a question of becoming stronger as a parliament. That is the main message of the Amsterdam Treaty. But a stronger parliament also implies equal legislative rights, full budgetary rights and the right both to elect and to control the executive. We have concrete demands to make in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The new President of the Commission must be voted in by the European Parliament, so the candidate must not be nominated before the elections. Furthermore, for the future I hope that the main political parties will fight the campaign for the election of the European Parliament with a supranational top candidate who also aspires to the office of President of the Commission. A substantial number of MEPs should form part of the college of Commissioners. Today, as we know, there are seven already. The proportion of women, currently 25 %, needs to be increased.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the composition of the Commission should reflect the spectrum of political tendencies that make up the European constitutional consensus. Last but not least, the individual members should also be held politically accountable in person for their sphere of responsibility. During the 1994 appointment of the Commission, the European Parliament demonstrated that it was exercising its rights in regard both to hearings of individuals and to the vote to approve the college as a whole. Much has happened since then. The new relations between the European Parliament and the Commission must also be based on a code of conduct and on interinstitutional agreements. The Brok report reflects our growing self‐confidence and our common responsibility for the European Union.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Corbett </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, the Treaty of Amsterdam contains among its innovations the fact that Parliament would henceforth elect the President of the Commission on a proposal from the national governments, just as Maastricht already provided that the college of Commissioners would be subject to a vote of confidence by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">This is very important for the democratisation of the European Union. It emphasises the fact that the Commissioners are not civil servants; they are a political executive accountable to the directly elected Parliament. In my country in particular, where the press often misportrays that reality, this step forward is important in underlining that democratic accountability.</p>
<p class="contents">The question that now begins to arise in the debate is whether we should go one stage further. Instead of Parliament electing at least the President of the Commission on a proposal of the national governments, should it not simply elect whoever it likes as President of the Commission? What would follow from that would inevitably be that the different party groups, and then the different political party structures in Europe generally, would then have to come up with candidates before the European elections. Different party federations would say: ‘So‐and‐so is our candidate" or ‘Somebody else is our candidate". That would add something to the European elections.</p>
<p class="contents">If you think about it, the big difference at the moment between European and national elections is that, when we vote in national elections, we go out to vote for or against a government, not for a parliament in isolation. Suddenly, every five years, the European electorate has to go out and vote not for a government, not to change or keep a government, but for a parliament in isolation. There is no visible consequence of the vote on the executive. To go that one stage further would add a new dimension to the European elections, make them more understandable to the public and have a visible effect, at least on the chief executive.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal would also have disadvantages which I do not have time to go into. It needs to be examined carefully. The danger is that a majority in Parliament feels bound to support everything that the Commission it has elected wants to do – just as many of our national parliaments feel bound to support their executive, come what may. We must find the balance. But the Brok report is a step in the right direction.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Barros Moura </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for the reasons already indicated, I consider that the Amsterdam Treaty implies the need to strengthen the democratic legitimacy and political responsibility of the Commission and also therefore of its President. I must say that I support Jacques Delors" proposal, which is backed by some very important figures on the political scene, to organise the European election campaign around not just a political programme but also the choice of Commission President, with the European political parties having to publicly present their candidate for this post to the electorate.</p>
<p class="contents">The main positive effect of this would be the personalisation of the campaign, which would lead to increased visibility of the institutions, better understanding of the rationale and greater emotional identification of the citizens with the European Union itself and its objectives and policies. I believe that the European Union would surely gain in terms of greater prestige, proximity to the people and democratic responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I also feel that the Brok report is heading in the right direction towards these objectives. However, the requirements of <span class="italic">realpolitik</span> , which aims to preserve the power of the prime ministers to negotiate and choose the person to be proposed to the European Parliament, have dulled the clarity of the report in favour of forms of compromise that allow room for both sides of the argument. In any case, it was the motion for a resolution that contained the proposal – and I am pleased to have contributed to this – for the European Council to choose the person to be nominated as Commission President bearing in mind the election results. It is therefore not right for the German Government to claim that it will start the process of nominating the Commission President at the Cologne European Council set for 3 June, before the European elections. I believe that this would negate the debate we are having and it would negate the innovation introduced by the Amsterdam Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">What is happening with the Santer Commission – due to the way in which it was nominated – and with the motion of censure – due to the way in which this was conducted – demonstrates that it is essential to clearly move in the direction recommended by the Delors proposal, which, despite everything, has been accepted by the Brok report, and it is to be congratulated in this respect.</p>

In my opinion, when this is achieved, it will result in a much better situation both for the institution and for the President of the Commission himself. The President will be given a mandate by the citizens of Europe, which will strengthen democracy in Europe, and we shall move closer to political union. I feel all this represents a definite improvement and, therefore, the quicker it is put in place, the better. It must come about as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">This excellent report also offers further significant recommendations. It suggests, for instance, a greater role for ideological political options, sidelining that vision of a merely bureaucratic Europe, which we hope to confine to history. The report is important for this reason, and also for the way in which it envisages European elections as transcending narrow nationalism and promoting a common idea of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Joint and balanced action by the three European institutions – the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament – is also to be commended, Mr Brok. So too, in my view, is the target of fair representation of the sexes on the Commission. Those photos of European Councils showing 99.99 % males are a serious affront to the democratic representation of the citizens of Europe.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Oreja, </span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. – (ES)</span> Mr President, Mr Brok"s report tackles an issue of extreme importance, namely, the relationship of trust between the European Parliament and the Commission. This fundamental concept was only introduced into the Treaties in 1992, through the Maastricht Treaty. Nevertheless, prior to that date, the European Parliament had regularly been confirming the investiture of the Commission for some time. For its part, the Commission took great account of Parliament"s view on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The experience of 1995, that is, the approval of the College of Commissioners by Parliament, made it possible for a full debate to take place between the Commission – the President and each of its members – and Parliament. I have the experience of having served as a member of the previous Commission, and therefore of being appointed under the old arrangements. I certainly believe that Parliament"s amendment of the Rules of Procedure to allow for the approval of the Commission was a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I recall those appearances in January 1995 very clearly. They provided an opportunity to exchange ideas, and enabled the members of parliamentary committees to find out about the views and programme of each of the Commissioners who were to be invested in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, the Treaty of Amsterdam has led to improvements in the procedure. There is no question about that. I believe that one of the major steps forward, though one that has not been given sufficient emphasis, concerns what one might refer to as the legitimacy of the Commission. Mr Brok"s report does highlight it, however. The Treaty of Amsterdam allows Parliament to approve the President of the Commission personally and specifically, rather than Parliament merely being consulted prior to the appointment.</p>
<p class="contents">My own view on this – as the Commission has not set out its position on the matter – is that the arrangements outlined, particularly those referred to by Mr Brok and other speakers, are steps in the right direction. I am referring to the arrangements that allow the political groups to put candidates forward, though the European Council would remain free to make its own decision. I do not think that this is a matter of modifying the Treaty, but is instead a matter of implementing the Treaty. The Treaty allows for various possible arrangements. One of these would be for the political groups to put candidates forward to the European Council. The Council would then make the necessary decision quite independently.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, adhering strictly to the terms of the Treaty, I feel it is a positive move for Parliament to be empowered to put such a proposal to the Council. Indeed, many speakers have drawn attention to Mr Fischer"s words this morning, when he said that more powers could be granted to Parliament. Any further means of enabling Parliament to legitimise the Commission must be helpful. Such an arrangement will allow the President of the Commission to go on to discuss the composition of the College of Commissioners with the various governments. I believe that this step taken in the Treaty of Amsterdam is of the greatest significance.</p>
<p class="contents">All this results in something that is made quite clear in the Treaty of Amsterdam: the function of political guidance ascribed to the President of the Commission. This too represents an improvement on the present situation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is imperative to guarantee at least the political coherence of the College of Commissioners in an institutional system in which the notion of governmental structure is becoming less and less clear and in which the resulting responsibilities are widely distributed.</p>
<p class="contents">We find ourselves at a crucial stage in the construction of Europe. In my view, it is essential to ensure that the basic pillars of the system of integration enable us to promote European interests more effectively, through the development of the Community method. I am referring to the pillars representing the Union"s interest, common interests rather than national interests. This will also contribute to the development of an effective relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">As might be expected, the Community method will need to be strengthened in view of the forthcoming reforms. History has shown how this method is much more efficient when compared with the poor results of the intergovernmental method. A good understanding between the Commission and the European Parliament will help to ensure the smooth running of the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope I have made it clear that I believe Mr Brok"s report is very significant, and must be given serious consideration. All these ideas and initiatives are paving the way for the future modification of the Treaty, but I feel that, prior to any modification of the Treaty, we can now implement a range of measures designed to strengthen the relationship of trust between the Commission and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be nice to conclude at this point, but I feel obliged to make one last remark. I have to say to Mr Berthu that I utterly and absolutely reject his attack on the Commission.</p>
