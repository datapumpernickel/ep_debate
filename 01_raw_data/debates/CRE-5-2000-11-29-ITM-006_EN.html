<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for inviting me to share with you my impressions of the sixth conference of the parties, the so-called COP6, to the United Nations framework convention on climate change, that took place the past two weeks in The Hague. After intensive negotiations, both at technical and ministerial level, on the basis of draft decisions with approximately 500 square brackets, it was not possible to reach a comprehensive agreement on key political issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union negotiating position concentrated on safeguarding the environmental integrity of the Kyoto protocol in the areas of land-use change and forestry, the “sinks” issue, the relation between the Kyoto mechanism and domestic action, known as “supplementarity”, and compliance. This meant that in the negotiations with other parties, trade-offs between these issues had to be explored.</p>
<p class="contents">With good technical progress on the rules for the Kyoto mechanisms and the development of a compliance system, final negotiations focused mainly on trade-offs between “supplementarity” and “sinks”. However, there was not enough time to fully evaluate last minute compromise proposals on the use of “sinks” in terms of their impact on the different countries inside and outside the European Union. Nevertheless, there was sufficient evidence that the environmental integrity would be seriously compromised. Therefore, the European Union decided not to accept these proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">In order not to let the mandate of the Buenos Aires plan of action, that ran until the so-called COP6 conference, expire without any concrete result or follow-up, parties have decided to suspend COP6 and resume the conference in May 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">COP6 was not all negative – far from it. We made some good progress. For example, a set of proposals responding to developing countries’ needs and concerns was drawn up, including new funding and new institutions, but also a more focused approach on climate change within the global environment facility – the so-called GEF. Also progress was made at the technical level on other issues, such as policies and measures to reduce emissions, capacity building, technology transfer, emissions trading, joint implementation and compliance. All efforts should be made to finalise these decisions at the resumed session in May.</p>
<p class="contents">Another positive outcome of COP6 is that it helped to obtain a better understanding of other parties’ positions. This knowledge is extremely useful and should be built on further in the coming months. Mr Pronk was a very dedicated president of COP6. The proposal he made at the end of the second week outlines a package and constitutes one of the bases for further discussion and negotiation in the coming months. However, insufficient time was left to finalise the negotiations on the basis of his document; too much precious negotiating time was lost on ministerial statements and the repetition of well-known positions. Consequently, there was not enough time to analyse all the impacts of the different proposals relating to sinks that were made in the final hours. This is an issue that remains the subject of significant uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">We all knew that, in order to get an agreement with the United States and its allies of the “umbrella group”, the European Union would have to make concessions. In the end, however, the concessions obtained from other parties on “supplementarity”, compliance and the Kyoto mechanisms were insufficient to compensate for the weakening of emission-reduction targets, that would have been the result if the proposal on “sinks” had been accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Where do we go from here? As a priority, evaluation and preparation of further discussions should take place within the European Union. With a view to preparing this next session, the EU should not reopen discussions on all issues, but focus on key priorities, notably “sinks” mechanisms, “supplementarity” and a strong compliance regime. A smooth transition from the French to the Swedish Presidency has to be ensured and close contact should also be kept with Mr Pronk. The EU must review its positions on the key issues and, where appropriate, make new proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is fully committed to developing a strong common EU line together with the incoming presidency. In addition to further coordination within the European Union, contacts with other parties should be intensified. An absolute pre-condition for an agreement on “sinks” at the next session is to have one common set of data, instead of every party doing its own calculation. The EU will deepen its relations with all major groups and will also contact the new US administration as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as the rules and modalities for the functioning of the Kyoto protocol have not been adopted, ratification of the protocol will have to be postponed until after the next session and the meeting of COP6. However, the internal preparation for ratification through the European climate change programme and the development of a European Union emissions trading scheme will continue.</p>

The European Parliament delegation to the talks was equally disappointed at the outcome, although we were not surprised. Certainly we could have foreseen, as she could, the problem that arose over “sinks”.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who read the French and British press will realise that there is quite a lot of attention on what seems to have been the breakdown in the relationship between Mrs Voynet, the French minister, and Mr Prescott, the British minister. They were, in a sense, an accident waiting to happen – like the Titanic and the iceberg. Mr Prescott is now holed below the water line and we do not know how long he will remain afloat.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the things we feel, at least I feel in a personal capacity, is the trouble is that a Green minister has absolutely no room to negotiate on Green issues. Madam Voynet was bound not to give way to the American point of view. You would not expect any less of her, would you?</p>
<p class="contents">My question to the Commissioner is: Does she feel that there is any flexibility likely to arise in the European Union position on “sinks”; secondly, when does she forecast that the talks are likely to resume; and thirdly, was Mr Prescott’s statement to the House of Commons actually true? He said in the House of Commons that the agreement which he had laboriously brokered with all the skills of a Sherman tank would have prevented developed countries from gaining credits from the clean development mechanism for planting forests in developing countries, which sounds rather good. This was felt by many countries, particularly the green groups, to be a huge loophole. The agreement would have placed a ceiling on the use of forest sinks by the United States, Japan and Canada, a ceiling which Europe had been asking for, and strengthen the scientific requirements applied to the domestic sinks.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the – surprise – glowing report by Mr Prescott on the deal which he had himself brokered, why was it that not only Madam Voynet but, I believe, and this is my last question to the Commissioner, most of the other environment ministers in Europe all rejected that? It seems from Mr Prescott’s report to his own Parliament that he was making them an offer they could not refuse?</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I regret that this has happened, but I hope that we will in the end share Mrs Wallström’s optimism and get the kind of agreement on climate change which we need.</p>

It is my wish that the European Union will continue to speak with one voice at the forthcoming international gatherings, and I consider it utterly futile to spend our time now apportioning blame to individual ministers. That will get us nowhere.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the failure of this conference is not the end of what has been a very lengthy and highly complex process; the process will continue. However, we must ask ourselves where improvements can be made. The first point, which I also frame as a question to the Commission, is whether this method we have chosen here, with conferences at which representatives of 180 nations have to agree on a joint document, does not ask too much of us, especially when time is pressing towards the end and the differences between the main parties have not yet been settled. Is it not time that this issue was dealt with by the U.S. and European Heads of State and Government at the G7 summits?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this does not mean that I aim to give us such an easy time. When we point the finger at the Americans, we must not forget that a number of fingers are pointed back at us. It is not as if we Europeans had all done our homework. CO2 emissions are on the increase here too; we know that, and we have discussed it often enough. The question is whether we actually need a global convention before we can start to reduce our own emissions. May I remind the Commission of its communication on emissions trading and on the conference in The Hague, in which it spoke of being able, in certain circumstances, to present a draft directive in which the quotas agreed by the environment ministers in 1998 would be prescribed and in which sanctions would be laid down for quota violations. My question is this: are you willing to do that, to present such an instrument, even though we have not completed the Kyoto process? Is there actually anything to stop us introducing emissions trading in the European Union in the year 2005, now that a number of countries have already made a start on emissions trading within their national borders?</p>
<p class="contents">My final comment is that I find it right and proper that you have remained firm on the issue of “sinks”, primarily because it is extremely difficult to measure “sinks” accurately. We were supposed to bring home measurable results, by which I mean physically measurable results, but that aim has not been compatible with the Americans' position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Davies (ELDR).</span></span>   – Madam President, these negotiations were always going to be hard but Commission officials believed that a deal would be done at the end of the day because political leaders across the world simply had too much to lose by returning home empty-handed. It is a matter of huge disappointment that agreement was not reached and I very much regret that the end of the convention was marred by a dispute between Britain’s Deputy Prime Minister and the French Presidency over the compromise proposals he put forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that after Mr Prescott’s rather noisy departure, the Americans tabled new proposals, which came closer to the EU position, demonstrates that the French Presidency was right to hold firm. We were getting closer, but sadly time ran out. The fear is that the momentum has been lost and the American negotiators will change and we start afresh in May.</p>
<p class="contents">The disagreement within Europe is all the more regrettable because my overriding impression of the convention was of a European Union negotiating as a closely-knit team, from a position which crossed party lines and united Member States behind shared principles, a shared outlook and a shared sense of anger at the refusal of the Americans to face up to their responsibilities as the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases.</p>
<p class="contents">From all we have heard, we must assume that the US Senate will not ratify the Kyoto protocol, however hard we compromise. Therefore, we must give greater priority to bringing in and gaining the support of nations elsewhere, to getting emissions trading up and running, and to taking real action to reduce global warming gases in this Union. Let us hope we get agreement in May; in the meantime let Europe take the lead.</p>
<p class="contents">The USA remains of great importance. Money talks in American politics more than it does within our Union. US industry and the oil companies are telling their politicians that they must reject the Kyoto protocol, whatever the American public say. My question to the Commissioner is this: How can we persuade American industry that it is in their commercial interests to support the protocol, so that they pull purse strings and pull the American politicians into line? How do we drag them kicking and screaming into the 21st century with all its problems? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nuclear energy has no chance of making a comeback. The developing countries said: if you northern countries are going to stop using nuclear energy then we do not want it either, not even if it is subsidised. Progress was also made in the field of enforcement. The developing countries are to receive USD 1 billion after 2005. If the clean development mechanism starts working then they will receive between USD 5 billion and USD 25 billion in addition, annually.</p>
<p class="contents">President Pronk acquitted himself well as far as the developing countries are concerned but his compromise was lacking in terms of environmental issues. The forests proved to be the major stumbling block this time round. Three years ago, in Kyoto, the United States wanted to use Russia as a means of getting round having to take any measures in their own country. Now the Clinton administration wanted the cheapest measures, i.e. to allow forests to grow. Of course forests eat up CO2 but once they are fully grown this no longer happens. Besides, forests burn down, which is happening increasingly often.</p>
<p class="contents">The solution must be found in energy efficiency and renewable sources of energy. The negotiators working on behalf of the European Union certainly wanted to leave quite a lot of leeway for forests, but no more than 20% of all measures to be adopted. Prescott’s deal, whereby the United States would be allowed to emit 1/3 via forests, 1/3 via hot air and 1/3 via CDM, was a poor and unacceptable deal. Fortunately, 14 of the 15 Ministers for the Environment were of the same mind on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">But we must press on, and equality must be incorporated in Bonn, in May 2001. Every citizen of the world has an equal right to CO2-emission, i.e. the Americans do not have the right to emit 200 times as much as the Africans. Only if equality is incorporated will the developing countries start to participate in the fight against climate change after 2012. In order to stabilise the climate on the basis of equality, the United States will have to cut back on their emissions by 90% and the European Union will have to cut back by 80%. China will then have to stabilise its emissions, and then India will be allowed to double its emissions. There needs to be a breakthrough in May next year, without the United States if need be. The Kyoto Protocol can, and must, be ratified, even without the United States. I hope we will come to see the wisdom of this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If this global warming continues, then part of the territory of the EU Member States will become sea or desert. We will need to drastically alter our economy if we are to keep the world and Europe habitable on a permanent basis. Parliament has recently pronounced itself in favour of a number of steps that will take us in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The European position during the climate conference, which ended – and evidently broke down – in The Hague last Saturday, was characterised by two sharply conflicting views. One view is that we should stick closely to the 1997 agreements in order to reduce emissions by a generous 5%, as compared with 1990. It is felt that we should now honour the Kyoto commitments already entered into, and that a willingness to compromise with America represents a betrayal of Europe’s commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">The other view is that the Kyoto obligations have never been feasible because there is too much opposition from America, Japan, and Australia, and the only way to reach an international agreement now, would be to reduce their commitments to take action. Creative accountancy would enable us to give the impression that they have already fulfilled a substantial number of their obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union made an error of judgement where the second view is concerned, because the green Environment Ministers of France and Germany were not prepared to forget Kyoto. We will still need to find a compromise of this kind at the follow-up conference due to take place in May 2001, in Bonn. My group favours the first view.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for Europe to stick with a position taken up previously, even though it means that the United States will not be in a position to subscribe to an agreement of this kind for the period of the Bush administration. Taking the long-term view, it is important that we convince the American public of the dangers of the do-nothing option, rather than agreeing a compromise with our opponents.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States produce the largest amount of pollution per capita. As yet, American public opinion has not given a great deal of credence to the notion that the deserts will expand and there will be an increase in hurricanes. They have a high standard of living over there and the price of petroleum products is low. The people feel that any actual changes will be to the detriment of industry and consumers. It is therefore unlikely that an international agreement would now be able to gain approval from the US Congress.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Third World is only in the very early stages of industrialisation. Poverty has forced these countries to sell their CO2 emission rights to rich countries, which want to use them to reduce their own obligations. At the end of the day, these countries will not give up their rights to progress. The emission of greenhouse gases will increase dramatically as a result. That is why we need to keep these realities in mind in the follow-up to the climate conference. A compromise cannot mean forgetting what was agreed in Kyoto. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is regrettable that the participants did not reach an agreement on how best to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The Kyoto accord of three years ago set out a timetable for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. This Kyoto protocol must not be watered down under any circumstances. In fact, the opposite is the case. The industrialised world in particular may have to set even stricter limits for the reduction of greenhouse gases in the future, if we are to ensure that the impact of global warming is to be arrested and ultimately controlled.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenge facing us in the issue of climate change is clearly one of the greatest challenges in the 21st century, if we are all to have a planet to live on in the future. If we do not address this issue in a structured and streamlined manner, then global warming will increase, with serious side-effects for land, marine and aerial environments, not to mention human life. It has already been said that the next meeting to discuss the issue of the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions will take place in Bonn, which will coincide with a publication by the United Nations intergovernmental panel on climate change. This panel is made up of some 3,000 scientists from all around the world who will give their assessment as to what measures are needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Environment Committee of this Parliament has been at the forefront in addressing the issue of climate change in the past. We are walking closely with the Commissioner for the environment, Mrs Wallström, on a number of EU regulations and directives, which will help control greenhouse gases in the European Union. The European Union must take a lead in this matter. The Environment Committee and Parliament have set a good example in the past as to how we should collectively address the issue of greenhouse gas reductions in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We must continue with vigour and determination in the future on this issue. Future generations will pay a price for our inactivity in this very important subject. I compliment Commissioner Wallström on her efforts in The Hague and wish her more success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Any discussion as to where the blame lies leads all too easily to the United States being singled out for criticism. As I see it, the fact that no agreement was reached was ultimately down to the intransigence of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussion in The Hague focused mainly on the question as to what exactly can be taken into account as regards the reductions agreed in Kyoto. In October we were able, during the discussion of the proposal concerning trade in emissions, to opt for efficient and effective ways of reducing emissions. Unfortunately, Parliament failed to make a clear choice at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the 50% is concerned, I feel I must point out that this objective should never be the be all and end all. If we could reach an agreement with the United States which allows them to work towards a lower realisation percentage in their own country, this would always be preferable to having no agreement at all. The same applies to the partial inclusion of the CO2 sinks, such as the additional planting of forests.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I do not have a good word to say about the US stance, one thing I do know is that the United States were prepared to achieve an acceptable compromise at the end of the conference. The intransigence of the European Union, led by the French Minister for the Environment, Mrs Voynet, stood in the way of a potential agreement. Some people value the European Union’s stance because they stuck to their guns. In reality, the chances of reaching agreement in the future are slimmer, which means that an effective strategy for tackling the climate problem is an even more remote prospect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should not, however, like to enter into personal squabbles, and I think we should refrain from that sort of completely negative discussion. I should like to congratulate the Commission, and Mrs Wallström, on keeping to the commitments it had always made towards reducing emissions, including among others greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">Without doubt, it was better to have no agreement at all than a poor one and it is true that, in this instance, the American proposal was a third-rate proposal, and one which was completely unacceptable to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, an agreement can only be accepted and acceptable if there is a balance between North and South, between developing countries and industrialised countries. I am already extremely concerned about resorting to the right to pollute. In my opinion, this can only hinder the economic development of countries that are already extremely underdeveloped.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States’ position, resorting to the idea of forests being carbon sinks, is unacceptable, for, then, no one would make any effort. We must reject these American diktats. This situation highlights the limitation of a Europe which, with its rotation of presidencies, does not have a strong political image to present to the United States and does not speak with a single voice. It also clearly highlights, once again, the desperate need to reform the European institutions and the way they operate. When will we have a President of the European Union that is strong and capable alone of representing Europe with regard to our partners?</p>
<p class="contents">Let us conclude, however, on a hopeful note. The Conference in The Hague is to be resumed, as you have informed us, Commissioner, next spring in Bonn. You may count on our support, Commissioner, so we might be able to stand up to the United States and take up the gauntlet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore the world needs a powerful political signal. Kyoto must not remain an empty promise. The failure of the climate conference sends out the wrong signal to the public. Many people will start thinking that the climate problems are not all that bad if those involved in the international politics of it are content not to do anything. This would also undermine the level of support for sustainable energy and energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">Climate change has a huge impact on the developing countries. Countries such as India, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Thailand have to contend with floods that affect millions of people. We set great store by the ‘polluter pays’ principle, but hitherto, it has been the third world countries themselves that have been saddled with the bill and adapting to climate change. This is unacceptable to my mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the statements on the failure of the climate conference were lacking in credibility. The negotiators declared afterwards that an agreement had been within reach. They said there was no shortage of political will, the parties moved closer to each other’s positions, and demonstrated increased understanding of each other’s cultures. Unfortunately though, they ran out of time. I do not find that very credible. Behind all the fine words lurks political impotence. The European Union is going to have to carefully assess its own role. It is not enough to blame the United States or to complain about the lack of flexibility shown by others. We have repeatedly said ourselves that no agreement is better than a bad agreement, but that does not mean that we should make our own political wish list the yardstick of a sound agreement. The climate conference will resume in the spring. So now we must look to the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I would like to thank you for the cooperation we have enjoyed. Finally, I would like to put three questions to you. Firstly, how would you yourself assess the European Union’s stance, and what practical lessons would you draw from the failure of the conference? Secondly, how do you intend to proceed in the coming months? Will you enter into debate with the United States over the forest problem and the scientific issues and lack of clarity that are still at large in this respect? Thirdly, which aspects do you think the EU should make more concessions on? Personally, I feel we could probably moderate our demands somewhat on the point of supplementarity. Your opinion on this would be much appreciated, and I thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think the EU successfully kept its act together, apart perhaps from in the last critical hours. Clearly, however, there are many losers following a conference of this kind. I think that we, as politicians, have lost out because we have sent a very bad signal to a great many committed people by failing to reach an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I think that the section of commerce and industry which looks seriously at this problem and which would like to have some ground rules has also lost out. Therefore, it is, of course, incredibly important for there to be another conference soon. I think the EU was right not to give way on carbon sinks. This is not just because of the difficulties of verification and measurement but also because more and more researchers maintain – whether rightly or wrongly, I do not know – that today’s carbon sinks may well be tomorrow’s carbon sources. Or, to put it another way: forests stop being carbon sinks and become carbon sources. If that is the case, then it would obviously be extremely risky to add this to the equation at the present stage, when it is still so difficult to come up with definitions. I should prefer to say, Commissioner, that, in the ongoing dialogue with the Americans, it would be better to be more generous when it comes to emissions trading<span class="italic"> </span>in general than to introduce something which is extremely difficult to substantiate on the basis purely of research.</p>
<p class="contents">I was a part of the parliamentary delegation. We had a meeting with a number of American Members of Congress. I was quite alarmed at the arrogance and ignorance shown by the Americans. I got the feeling that they do not want to ratify the Kyoto protocol under <span class="italic">any</span> circumstances. One conclusion I came to is that we need more in the way of transatlantic dialogue on these issues – not only dialogue between governments and the Commission but also, and especially, between Members of Congress. That is perhaps something which we in the European Parliament can help bring about.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a question: even if a conference in May were not to succeed, is the Commissioner prepared to go further, to be in the vanguard, take the lead and recommend ratification by the EU? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If there is one area in which there has been no lack of unity, it is in this relationship. I am bound to regret the fact, however, that the will of some ministers of the 15 Member States has been directed more towards racing to attend press conferences than creating a genuine spirit of unity that will guarantee a global policy on climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, we knew that this COP­VI would be of particularly great importance: it represented abandoning the stage of discussion in which we had been stuck since 1992 and moving on towards action. Since we were not able to reach an agreement, we failed in our objective of moving on towards action. To put it frankly, if we have to make an assessment of what took place, we could say that out of the three parties participating in the Conference, only one tried to reach an agreement and tried to achieve a global policy on climate change, and that was the European Union. The United States – but let us also state quite clearly that it was the entire “umbrella group” – concocted a whole series of excuses for not reaching any type of agreement at COP­VI, in The Hague. By May, by Bonn, the European Union must take action on two fronts: firstly through diplomacy, since the scenario that the United States will ratify the agreement is the least likely, and so diplomatic action must be developed with the other members of the umbrella group. Secondly, we must act within the Union in order to guarantee our credibility. Only if we have this credibility will the European Union be able to lead the debate and the action at COP­VI “B” in Bonn. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I actually remember meeting Mrs Corbey, who was there the whole time, going to a session at 5.30 one morning. You were all very supportive during the session and I thank you for that.</p>
<p class="contents">We sometimes discuss the climate change issue as if its effects will only be felt in the long term by our children and grandchildren. However, climate change has already happened, it is already there. The ice caps are measurably melting. Small island states in the Pacific are slowly disappearing because of the rise in sea level. We see the effects in our everyday lives. Even though the experts are very careful not to say that any particular storm or extreme weather condition is due to climate change, we will see more extreme weather as climate change continues. So it is also for us. Of course it is an issue for coming generations, but it is a fact, especially for people living in poor countries, as has also been said.</p>
<p class="contents">What can we do now? Now is not the time to apportion blame or to point fingers. Now is the time to decide that we cannot fail once more. Failing to achieve an agreement at the next COP6 meeting is not an option. I am quite optimistic because I felt we came so close and that all the ministers there understand that a five per cent reduction as in the Kyoto Protocol is only a small part of the commitment we will have to make for the future. This is only the start. Maybe we should not be too worried about taking a little more time, a few months more, to decide on the rules and the framework, the legal framework, that must be put in place in order to operate the huge economic market that will be created. Of course we need some clear operational rules to regulate an emissions trading market worth twelve billion dollars. We had too much left on the table for these negotiations and we will have to try to sort that out. We will have to make our own assessment of what happened, and prepare the documents to make contacts with different parties, and of course with the “umbrella group”. It is very much up to the American administration to tell us with whom we should speak. We will also have to continue our contacts with developing countries. That is how we can take this issue forward constructively.</p>
<p class="contents">Now let me just answer the questions on whether we were flexible. Sometimes these negotiations are extremely chaotic, and I think that you can always go home and look back saying that we made this mistake or that mistake. However, for the environment ministers present at The Hague, and you know we have also set the tone here, the main objectives were to defend the credibility and integrity of the Kyoto Protocol. So we would not allow any creative accounting on, for example, certain issues. The Americans presented us with a proposal that would have reduced their commitment by between 70 and 90 per cent. We simply could not accept that. Should we lower our ambitions when we know we need to do more? At the same time, we made concessions. We opened up discussions on what we had earlier said were big loopholes, or potentially of big loopholes.</p>
<p class="contents">We were very constructive and we negotiated until the last minute of these talks in The Hague. We will continue to be willing to make concessions, but I think we were flexible while at the same time defending our main objectives, and we should continue to do that. We now know what kind of questions we will have on the table for this last part. I am hopeful, I really think that the awareness is there. All ministers know that they cannot escape this huge task of combating climate change; this was also clear from the meeting in The Hague. We will do everything to be able to turn this into an agreement and actually be able to sign it. Of course the follow up of the next COP6 or the continuation of COP6 will be to ratify an agreement inside the Union. We can start emissions trading earlier. We can take a lot of measures, which the Commission will propose. As soon as we get the chance, as soon as the legal framework is in place, we will move.</p>
<p class="contents">I again thank you for this debate. I have taken note of everything that has been said, we will of course follow up and be willing to come back whenever Parliament asks us to.</p>
