<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Danuta Maria Hübner, </span></span>  <span class="italic">author. </span><span class="bold">− </span>Madam President, let me start by saying once again that there is no doubt that Europe needs growth. The last summit finally admitted what many of us in this House have been repeating stubbornly for years, namely that any further budget consolidation, including austerity packages, must be growth-friendly. The current forecasts are not good. If stagnation continues it will eventually lead to a deep erosion of Europe’s productive capital, human capital in particular and young human capital even more so.</p>
<p class="contents">So we are all for efforts exerted at all levels of European governance to get the most out of EU budget-supported policies. In this context, we were surprised to hear from the President of the Commission that there are EUR 82 billion of what were called ‘unspent structural funds’: EUR 22 billion from the European Social Fund – which corresponds to roughly 30% of the 2007-2013 allocation – and EUR 60 billion of the ERDF and Cohesion Fund, which means more or less 22% of the current programming period’s allocation. We discovered, however, that this is not really unspent money but rather money that has not yet been spent.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking more carefully into this announcement, we understand that these funds have not yet been allocated to concrete projects but that they are already committed to priorities and programmes. We also understand that allocation to projects, largely through tenders, is a process lasting until the end of the Multiannual Financial Framework.</p>
<p class="contents">It could therefore be expected that most Member States would keep part of the allocation for 2012 and 2013. We also understand that the remaining 70% of ESF funding and 78% of the Cohesion and Regional Funds have either already been paid or that the relevant tenders have been completed, which means that legal commitments have been made or that projects are ongoing.</p>
<p class="contents">Our question most likely comes too early to request a fully-fledged assessment from the Commission of the scope for the potential need for reprogramming. We understand that since 2007 growth and jobs have been priorities of cohesion policy and its overarching mission. Nevertheless, we fully share the view that the potential of cohesion policy to generate growth and jobs must be fully exploited.</p>
<p class="contents">What is worrying, however, is that the way in which this proposal – for the potential reprogramming of the funds scheduled for allocation by individual Member States to projects in the last two years of the current financial perspective – has been presented to public opinion has created false interpretations, unnecessarily undermining the image of the policy and of its real impact on growth and job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout the crisis Parliament has supported all Commission proposals aimed at strengthening the cohesion policy’s response to the crisis. In record time we adopted the amendments to the general regulation to increase co-financing rates. We are working very closely with the Commission and the Council to create a risk-sharing facility to facilitate use of funds in countries in distress.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying that we are all aware that there are problems concerning the take-up of funds in some countries. We appreciate the Commission’s efforts to help countries like Bulgaria, Romania, Greece and Italy in overcoming the austerity trap through the wise and efficient investment of structural funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to point out that regional policy, by definition, has always been targeted at growth and that will still be the case in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In times like these, it is even more necessary than ever that we make huge investments in growth. Europe needs growth. It is very important that we strive here to head off what some experts have described as a minor potential recession. It is absolutely essential that we tackle two issues, in particular: the first is promoting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the second is tackling extremely high youth unemployment in some countries which, in some age cohorts, amounts to as much as 50%. We need to support both these areas, as they are mutually interdependent.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you a simple sample calculation: we have 23 million SMEs in Europe and some 23 million unemployed. To put it in simple terms, if we were able to persuade each SME to take on an additional unemployed person, man or woman, the problem of unemployment would be cured. For that reason, the informal European Council of 30 January has very rightly said that we need even greater and more targeted efforts in the coming years to promote the competitiveness of our companies and, thus, ensure growth for Europe. There can be no long-term stability without equivalent qualitative and quantitative growth.</p>
<p class="contents">The Heads of State or Government have therefore proposed that we review once again those Structural Fund resources that have not yet been allocated to specific projects – EUR 22 billion from the European Social Fund (ESF) and around EUR 60 billion from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) or the Cohesion Fund, to be exact – in order to ensure the optimal utilisation of growth potentials. Although it is true that, in principle, these resources have been allocated to programmes, they have not been allocated to specific projects yet. Therefore, it would certainly be a legitimate approach to say: let us look at whether we can once again improve the funding structure.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has offered to use all the expertise available to us to help, in particular, those countries where youth unemployment is at its highest. It must be permissible to exhaust all the possibilities in such critical cases. We are at your disposal. We have offered this to Member States and they have accepted the offer. We will hold very specific discussions in the coming weeks and months and they are starting in early March. However, it is up to Member States to ultimately adapt and tighten their programmes and align them with the objective of tackling youth unemployment and promoting SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, I am grateful to the European Parliament for its support in enabling accelerated action which, on the one hand, serves the promotion of SMEs and, on the other, has made it possible for the cofinancing rate to be increased, which will ultimately allow us to overcome liquidity bottlenecks here and there and implement, complete or finish projects. We stand ready, if need be, to adjust or adapt programmes – as we already do, day in, day out – if requested by Member States. The willingness of the Commission is there. However, I would also ask Members of the European Parliament to contribute, within your capabilities and remits, to the project of tackling youth unemployment and promoting SMEs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Essentially, as Ms Hübner has stated and as has also been expressed in the questions, the point is how the European Commission can raise EUR 82 billion all at one go to help SMEs and youth unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">You have spent a week and a half in the Netherlands at our invitation and we have shown you how it works out in practice. You take one euro from the European programmes and form a partnership with businesses, universities, municipal authorities and regional organisations. The balance is no longer one euro but, in the programmes, effectively four. You do this three or four years in advance, and in my country, as you have also seen, the programmes are already set up for 2012 and 2013. By then it will be too late to change, or else everyone who lays his share of the cofinancing and a great deal more on the table will wonder what happened to trust in the Government.</p>
<p class="contents">Considering that EUR 82 billion is about what we already had two years ago, the question is whether this represents a book-keeping approach of the ‘so much is still unspent’ type, or whether you can name the amount of space in each separate country, in France, Germany or Poland. Then we would also have some idea of what we are talking about. What disturbs me is that, next day and all the week following, the newspapers will tell of mountains of unfulfilled projects and a wide margin between regional funds and the cohesion fund. Can you state the precise dimensions of the space in which you move? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, I very much welcome the fact that the Commission wants to put tackling youth unemployment at the heart of its policy. Giving hope and a future to young people is part of our remit and it is very important to us. Secondly, I also welcome the fact that the Commission is increasingly realising that, in a time of economic crisis more than ever, cuts are not the only route to success: we also need investment. In that respect, SMEs should, of course, be our topmost priority, because they create the most jobs and are very important for economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, let me be very clear and open about this: it appears, from what is being said in the media, that Mr Barroso has been giving the impression that he is able to stump up EUR 82 billion for this European Union, with the throwaway comment afterwards that that money will no longer be spent as planned in the cohesion policy, anyway; we will, instead, be able to use that money right away to do precisely what we have just been talking about: namely, tackling youth unemployment and supporting SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">EUR 82 billion – that is almost a quarter of the total cohesion policy budget up to 2013. As far as I am aware, that money is already tied up in programmes and projects. How exactly do you intend to go about this: that is, allowing all the regions, all of a sudden, to start doing something completely different with that money and, then, because the youth unemployment figures are not so high in your neck of the woods, making some of that money available to other countries?</p>
<p class="contents">The regions have responded to this with dismay. I have received a lot of calls from people asking me: what is going on? Is the money being taken away from us? What is the point of that? Let me give you a word of warning. The cohesion policy has really been a tremendously successful policy and one that has been extremely tangible and comprehensible to citizens. It creates trust. If we now start making vague statements like this, which create the impression that we have money left over, that our policy so far has not been adequate, or that we can rustle up a couple of billion just like that, that will not create any additional trust, but only uncertainty. Most importantly, when I consider the fact that the Council has failed to provide the full amount of funds considered necessary by the Commission and Parliament for this year’s budget negotiations and the fact that, according to the information I have received, some EUR 15 billion are needed this year for projects that have already been completed, but we only have EUR 5 billion, at the very most, at our disposal, then I really wonder how anyone can go around implying that Member States are prepared to fork out more money and allocate additional funds for the cohesion policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we need to be careful that we actually pursue the right policy and that we offer support to countries with high youth unemployment. However, I would also like us to ensure that we do not create even more uncertainty for people in times that are difficult enough already. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is essential that support is given to SMEs in order to achieve economic and growth and create new jobs. Member States which have not achieved a very high absorption rate of EU funds must also be able, where this is the case, to reorder their priority areas for allocating European money.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as you are aware, this is not the first recovery measure of this kind that we have adopted. Taking the depressing example of my country’s government, which is perhaps the worst performer in Europe in terms of EU fund absorption, we can say that this financial aid has not always been used as we might have expected. This is why the effectiveness of the recovery measures depends to a large extent on national governments’ ability and readiness to create the national framework required to implement these measures successfully.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, to enable us to make a fair, objective decision on the proposal that you have tabled, we need not only clear answers to all the questions which the Committee on Regional Development has submitted to you, but also some clarifications. For example, one concerns what action the European Commission is going to take to provide support and ensure that national governments which have already shown their lack of implementation of the recovery measures adopted at EU level will still manage to redistribute unallocated money quickly for specific projects targeting SMEs and job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point which I feel is extremely important is that you have focused on a list of eight Member States where the youth unemployment rate is sky-high. I wish to tell you, Commissioner, that this is a genuine problem in Romania, and we want to know, indeed, Romania’s citizens want to know whether the funds allocated to Romania will be redirected to other Member States. It would be unfortunate if this happened. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Youth Guarantee scheme proposed, or rather cited, by Mr Barroso was a proposal by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, from the own-initiative report which they earlier submitted to this House. However, unlike him, I believe that the focus should be on disadvantaged young people, in particular. This requires decentralised action. That would be much more appropriate here. The European Social Fund (ESF) money should remain in place and be allocated anew when the relevant location deems it appropriate. I address this to Mr Barroso.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, our group supports the Council’s decision on a green economy. That, too, originated in a Verts/ALE own-initiative report, which was adopted here in the plenary by a large majority two years ago. Hence, our demand, as part of the reprogramming of Structural Funds, that we focus on the green economy in areas where initiatives are needed. SMEs are exactly the kind of enterprises for which such a line is essential, because it would make them competitive. We must not allow money to be thrown out the window just like that. We need sustainable projects, those from which the next generations will be able to profit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are told that EUR 82 billion of funds have not been used and will not be used by 2013. We are being asked to take you at your word, but I would like to take a closer look. How can you be sure in 2012 that these funds will not be spent before the end of the programming period? What I want to say is that none of the regions which initially benefited from these funds should be penalised by this redeployment.</p>
<p class="contents">However, deep down, the reason behind this redeployment lies elsewhere, does it not? Is it not a case of alleviating the devastating effects of the austerity policies which are currently in place throughout the European Union?</p>
<p class="contents">In order to alleviate the effects of the crisis it would have been much wiser to use new resources. To use new resources to finance real growth policies and real youth employment policies. Within these new resources I am thinking of the financial transactions tax, which we have been calling for for a long time and which is yet to be finalised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Structural and cohesion policy is one of the key policy areas of the European Union and, by definition, it should serve the purpose of consolidating the economic and social cohesion of the Union, while at the same time promoting growth and employment, in underdeveloped regions in particular. The necessity and success of structural and cohesion policy has been demonstrated especially clearly in these years of crisis. The economic development situation in many regions would now be even bleaker had these funds not been made available.</p>
<p class="contents">Then comes the implementation of Structural Funds on the basis of operational programmes – as has already been pointed out – in which the promotional strategy of each region is described. The European Union, Member States and regions work in partnership here and thus create real added value for Europe. The success of structural and cohesion policy is based on the reliability of programming and funds which have either already been made available or are in the process of being made available.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, therefore, very surprised that, time and again, some Member States, and even the Commission – as we now see – attempt to make use of Structural Fund resources as a money box for all kinds of topical policy initiatives. That is not consistent with the meaning and purpose of cohesion policy and, in addition, it causes concern amongst players in the regions who are already working to achieve objectives on the basis of long-term strategies and contracts. It is true that tackling youth unemployment and commitment to economic growth are important goals. However, they will only be achieved if the cooperative partnership between the regions, Member States and the Commission is maintained and if players in the regions continue to be involved. After all, only they know what needs to be done in their regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Structural and cohesion policy is the unifying, cooperative, supportive bond of action between individual policy levels in the European Union. It reflects the solidarity of Europe on the ground, in the regions, and it should not be recklessly abandoned in favour of political quick fixes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We must provide solutions. These solutions will not materialise through labour reforms such as the one approved last Friday in my country, which will bring our young people even greater job insecurity and destroy their rights. The fact is that Europe has a youth unemployment rate of close to 23%. In my country, Spain, unemployment affects 49% of young people, many of whom are educated, trained and talented, and who are increasingly saying how tired and fed up they are with the lack of solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree on the urgent need to approve measures to stimulate the recruitment of young people and to help small and medium-sized enterprises, especially those set up by young people. That is why I believe that we must ensure that training matches the requirements of the labour market as a matter of priority. We must realise that an education system that is fairer in terms of the quality of education and that does away with the differences between public and state-subsidised private education will help to boost creativity and innovation, thereby increasing students’ entrepreneurial spirit, specialisation and mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">Could the Commission explain how the EUR 10.7 billion that it estimates is owed to Spain will be distributed between the various funds? With regard to the European Social Fund, what percentage of the EUR 82 billion that is still to be allocated will be assigned to this fund? What is this percentage in Spain specifically? Lastly, how does the Commission plan to integrate regional and local authorities and social partners into the action plans?</p>

<p class="contents">It is now necessary that the Commission take appropriate action here. We will also support the Commission in finally taking action in problem countries – in Greece, Romania, Bulgaria and in southern Italy. A reallocation of resources towards small and medium-sized enterprises, dual vocational training and tackling youth unemployment is absolutely the right course to take. That has to be our starting point. However, the vital thing is that capacities are built up, if we are to solve these problems. The impression the citizens of Europe have is that – as in Greece – all-out austerity is not working and that the government simply agrees measures which then remain unimplemented.</p>

<p class="contents">This is the best-trained generation for years, but their options are mini-jobs, bad jobs, unemployment or even emigration. They expect more from us, and we cannot use the crisis as a scapegoat or an excuse for introducing labour reforms that virtually mean austerity.</p>

After years of Mr Barroso and his colleagues in the Council having pursued a policy of austerity, and successfully having forced upon everyone unemployment and cuts in social security spending under the umbrella of the crisis, they have now discovered the unemployed. As important as this subject certainly is, it sounds like mockery if you see the promotional film for it on EuroparlTV, which talks about additional funding. I have a simple question for you, Mr Hahn, namely, where in your petty cash can you find EUR 82 billion? We all know that everything is actually already planned up to 2013 – and we are not far from the point where that door will be closing.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not be dealing in tricks, nor should we be talking as if everyone could now receive the same funding or indeed adequate funding. Quite specifically, what is the situation with Ireland, for example, which, as we all know, has already spent all of its resources? What advice do you have for the Irish Government when it comes to combating youth unemployment?</p>
<p class="contents">It is self-evident that we need to make major efforts in employment policy in order to reduce youth unemployment. That much is clear, but we also need real money to be able to do so. We also need to get behind it. Furthermore, there are, of course, other things that we need, such as more sensible protection against dismissal, or truly decent work.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would just like to reiterate what it is that we do not need, namely macro-economic conditionality over the forthcoming subsidy period. That is something that we should not even look into. We are observing at this point in time what that means. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the question that presents itself is whether we are able to do this quickly, effectively and efficiently and also whether the sum of EUR 82 billion mentioned by the President is actually available. I think that the fundamental question is: will Member States want to reprogramme Structural Funds?</p>
<p class="contents">Today on average over 20% of young people living in the European Union are unemployed. For this reason I would like to emphasise that, in the context of reducing unemployment, it is important not just to use the funds that are available, but also to use them effectively. It is important that EU funds allocated for raising qualifications do in fact support high-quality training that provides young people with skills that are required in the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">Small and medium-sized enterprises play – or should play – an important role in the creation of new jobs. Statistics show that only 3% of them are leaders in innovation. Many entities decide not to apply for EU funds because the application process is long-winded and the procedures are complicated and not altogether transparent. I think we would all agree with the statement that efficient functioning and growth in the SME sector is an exceptionally important factor in GDP growth, in the fight against unemployment and in economic stability. I also think, Commissioner, that thousands of European Union citizens are eagerly awaiting today’s discussion, so I would like to ask you a question: in practice, what does support for SMEs mean and what would be the nature of the attempts to reduce youth unemployment? How can we make these effective, as today we are already combating unemployment, but it continues to rise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Back in the election campaign ahead of the European elections in 2009, Mr Barroso promised that the fight against youth unemployment would be the single most important task for him and the Commission he wanted to lead. So far, we have not seen very much of this. There are enormous expectations and an enormous need to do something about the fact that we are ignoring the young generation that is to govern Europe in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Now there is suddenly nearly EUR 100 billion on the table, and it would be fantastic if this money could be used. It is late coming, but it would be extremely important. The question is why this money has to be taken from the Structural Funds of all places. Are the supporters of cohesion policy right down at the bottom of the career ladder and therefore the easiest to pick on? There are other parts of the EU budget that could donate funds without needing to interfere with the work of the Structural Funds. The question of how long it might take before this could be in place is also relevant. The young people of Europe are desperate. This needs to happen quickly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As you know, unemployment among young people in Greece now stands at 48% and unemployment among the population as a whole stands at 20.9%. Under the new Memorandum, young people under 25 years of age are being forced to work at wages reduced by 32% and, therefore, a 25-year-old is forced to enter the labour market at a wage of EUR 440 a month for an eight-hour day. Under such circumstances, young people are, of course, tending to leave the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Is there a real cohesion policy? In other words, are these policies that we debate here on social cohesion and youth employment in keeping with the measures being promoted under this new Memorandum? The big issue here is: are there unused resources? Can they be diverted towards creating jobs for young people in Greece and helping small and medium-sized enterprises or are new resources needed?</p>

One does not have to be a genius to realise that either the promise or the punishment will be forthcoming, but not both at the same time. As such, Commissioner, I would like to ask you a direct question: is the decision to suspend allocations from the Structural Funds still in force, or has it been frozen or cancelled? In other words, will Greece, Portugal, Ireland and other countries still be able to make use of the funds to which they are entitled, if they do not hit the targets imposed upon them by you and the Commission?

It is essential to channel these funds into boosting economic activity, by effectively supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, by stepping up research and innovation, by stimulating international activity and by encouraging entrepreneurship.</p>

This is a message I try to get across every time.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, President Barroso’s proposal had the virtue of showing that the European Union, through the Structural Funds, has significant public investment instruments at its disposal. In these difficult times for national public finances that is worth highlighting.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the President of the Commission, EUR 82 billion, which have not been allocated for the 2007–2013 period, could be redirected towards support for SMEs and the fight against youth unemployment. Like our Chair, Danuta Hübner, I too wonder where this amount has come from. It would seem that President Barroso is referring to money which has not yet been programmed but which has already been divided between the Member States and allocated to programmes which are in operation.</p>
<p class="contents">I have my doubts about the interest in redirecting this money. There is a risk of disrupting the programming of funds without having any real benefit on the ground. Furthermore, as I recall, Structural Funds are already heavily involved in supporting SMEs and youth employment. This must continue to be a priority for the next programming period.</p>
<p class="contents">I am taking this opportunity to remind my colleague, Mr Omarjee, who spoke about this a few moments ago, that President Sarkozy has decided to implement the financial transactions tax in France, in case he had not noticed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A young workforce is required to support the pensions system in an ageing European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the latest data from ANOFM, the Romanian National Employment Agency, more than 100 000 people under the age of 30 are currently out of work. I should mention that the biggest difficulties are encountered in getting the first job. The Romanian State’s annual expenditure on this is actually EUR 1.17 billion. This is why I welcome funding and support for young entrepreneurs in any form. However, the Commission must clarify whether it intends to reduce the amounts allocated to countries with low absorption rates. On the other hand, I think that these are precisely the Member States which require the most support to boost their capacity to use EU funds. Reducing the cofinancing rate is an option with this purpose in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">I also call on the Commission to submit an action plan for using the EUR 22 billion from the European Social Fund in apprenticeship and training programmes. I should stress that clarification is also required as to the method to be used for offering young entrepreneurs guarantees from EU funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If this scheme helps us, we will have done a great job. </p>
<p class="contents">Members have already questioned the desirability and the practicality of moving funds from the Structural Funds into this scheme, and I also noted Ms Ernst’s question as to how Ireland, a country which has already utilised its Structural Funds, can avail itself of a scheme like this?</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, assuming this can happen, EUR 82 billion is a lot of money. It is actually EUR 3 billion per Member State, with EUR 1 billion left over, and it can make a big difference to the situation we find ourselves in.</p>
<p class="contents">Assuming it can happen, however, I would appeal for a few things. Number one: flexibility, because without flexibility I can see State agencies gobbling the money up and the scheme not being as effective as it should be. So the private sector must be allowed to get involved in terms both of education and training and of providing opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the training has to be practically based, not the formulaic, off-the-shelf training that we often get from State agencies – and I saw this in particular in relation to FAS (the Training and Employment Authority) and the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund in Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would appeal for the message to be communicated to the State agencies, especially local authorities, and to young people themselves, that this is going to happen, that they can avail themselves of it and that through it they can get jobs.</p>

The institutions agree on the need to encourage growth also by combating unemployment, above all youth unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sense, I welcome the declaration on the use of the EUR 82 billion in the financial framework 2007-2013 for the benefit of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which today form the true backbone of our economy. As has been demonstrated by the statistics provided by the Commission itself, we owe 85% of the new jobs created between 2002 and 2010 to SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is clear that we need to make a joint effort, through synergy and cooperation between the European budget and national budgets, in order to focus and redirect the resources available to individual Member States towards the stated priorities, especially towards those measures and programmes capable of having a concrete impact on this problem and turning things around for our young people.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore asking the Commissioner to specify the actions, programmes and budget lines – in addition to those more clearly relating to small and medium-sized enterprises – which he considers need to be enhanced in order to reduce the level of youth unemployment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have no doubt that it is inspired by the best intentions. However, the Commission is aware that it is not about blocked or wasted money but about money for infrastructure, for instance, for large-scale projects outlined at the start of the financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, a large proportion of funds are targeted actually at small businesses and youth programmes. In any case, this kind of reallocation may offer an opportunity to those Member States wishing to invest more in these two areas. However, this must remain an individual option for each state, decided on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Setting up a fund to be managed by the European Commission is not a solution. The mere suspicion that funds could be reallocated between Member States is a risky issue. The right solution is to provide greater flexibility in reordering priorities internally. At the same time, we should not forget that the biggest obstacle preventing the effective use of EU funds is the lack of resources for ensuring national and private cofinancing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The economic crisis has absolutely devastated youth employment. The statistics are frightening: youth employment stands at less than 10% in only three countries: Germany, the Netherlands and Austria. Elsewhere it is more dramatic. In the Baltic for example, in Ireland, in Greece and in Slovakia unemployment among young people stands at 30% or above, and in Spain it is more than 40%. This is a brain drain that we cannot afford.</p>
<p class="contents">We are an ageing Community; we need young people, we need a workforce that is able to meet the challenges from the low-cost economies. In order to end that brain drain we need to provide opportunities for our young people. They are young, they are intelligent – many of them educated – but we must be able to keep them here.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own country we have an economic crisis, which, thankfully we are getting out of. But the vast majority of young people educated in Ireland, many of them with third-level degrees, many with master’s degrees, some of them with doctorates, have gone to Australia or to Canada and, in many cases, unfortunately, they will not come back.</p>
<p class="contents">A lot of them paid tribute – or at least lip service – to the SME sector. And of course this is a vital component which, in my country accounts for 60% of jobs. But I fully concur with my colleague Seán Kelly: if you are introducing schemes make them flexible, and in the name of heaven do not strangle them with bureaucracy and red tape. Too many excellent programmes and schemes coming from Europe have died the death because of a lack of flexibility and because of red tape. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Young people are being forced to leave their home for other countries, both inside and outside the European internal market. Strengthening businesses is the best method because, on the one hand, it is businesses which can absorb the talents of young people in Europe with innovative ideas and a high level of education and, on the other hand, young people can, at the same time, develop their own creative activities. The Structural Funds must help here, because they are the basic tool we have for a Europe which is short of solidarity mechanisms and mechanisms to react directly to the crisis and solve the problems.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, I should like to ask some questions, Commissioner. Will the EUR 82 billion invested in this direction be accompanied, under the action plans, by flanking policies? Often the obstacle is not the lack of resources; it may be of an administrative or legislative nature. Investments are also needed in additional sectors, such as research and development of technology and innovation. I should also like to ask if this redirection of resources will be accompanied by flexibility. There are areas with serious structural problems which require immediate solutions which are properly designed and focus on them. Other areas suffer from emergency disasters. In my country, Greece, will Ileia, which is a ‘special area’, be able, for example, to benefit from such a flexible and immediate programme? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that the current state of EU fund use is, on average, about a third of the EU funds for the programming period 2007–2013. The implementation of policies during the last year, 2011, gained speed, however, and at least two-thirds of the allocated resources, and in some cases the total amount of available resources, have been legally contracted, that is to say, the funds guarantee a constant supply of resources to support investments in these difficult times, and the Member States naturally have an interest in ensuring that these resources really are used. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important for the European Union funds available to be channelled more effectively into growth and employment, but while remaining within the ceiling limits agreed for each Member State and without jeopardising the implementation of the scheduled development programmes. Member States must allocate, as a matter of priority, funds for stimulating employment, especially among young people, and for boosting the financing of the economy, in particular SMEs. Specific support must be given to Member States going through the process of fiscal consolidation as the economic crisis has also triggered a major social crisis in these states.</p>

This announcement is part of a rhetorical exercise seeking to obscure the disastrous effects of the last informal European Council’s decisions. To speak of growth and youth unemployment at the same meeting that institutionalises recessive policies of so-called ‘austerity’, and advocates more of the liberalisation and attacks on labour laws that are facilitating redundancies in Portugal is much more than a rhetorical exercise: it is supreme hypocrisy.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the Commission announced that EUR 82 billion was available for the Member States as a whole for this reprogramming. The Portuguese people will be paying 40% of this total, or EUR 34 billion, in interest to the IMF and the EU under the pact of aggression being perpetrated against the country. More than reprogramming, what is needed is to substantially increase the Structural Funds, so as to realise solidarity rather than producing insulting propaganda. What is needed is an end to policies which stifle small and medium-sized enterprises and which raise youth unemployment to unprecedented levels. What is needed is an end to the intolerable process of extortion of natural resources associated with IMF and EU programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore welcome the prompt response of the European Commission to the current situation in the labour market, where several EU countries have seen a sharp rise in youth unemployment. The proposal to support with additional funds small and medium-sized enterprises and projects that encourage the employment of young people are the right steps to halt and reverse the alarming situation where, in some countries, youth unemployment exceeds 30% and, in two countries, it is even approaching 50%.</p>
<p class="contents">If young people do not acquire working habits after completing their education, it is very likely that they will give up looking for work in the future and will join the community of people living off social benefits. Who will create pensions is a question that probably does not interest many people – it is the Structural Funds that are important. I therefore welcome the European Commission’s initiative of increasing support for small and medium-sized enterprises and, in conjunction supporting projects that promote youth employment, addressing this serious social problem through the flexible use of the available funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The measures for redistributing the unspent sums must take into account the principle of subsidiarity provided for under the Treaty by respecting the powers of local and regional authorities with regard to using EU support. In actual fact, the question which has caused a stir and awaits a response is simple: can a Member State lose the funds initially envisaged following this redistribution process?</p>
<p class="contents">The main role of cohesion policy is to narrow the disparities between regions. Applying redistributions as part of the financing instruments may produce immediate, concrete results. However, the Commission must provide clarification regarding the framework for applying the proposal and compliance with the main objective of cohesion policy.

Against the darkness of the radical austerity measures, these initiatives to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and above all to combat youth unemployment, represent a necessary ray of light. Like you, Commissioner, I am an Austrian, and it was the Austrian Chancellor, Werner Faymann, who presented the European youth initiative in the European Council. Youth unemployment is very low in Austria, thank goodness. One reason for that is our system of dual training, but the main reason is that there is a fundamental political commitment in Austria that young people should be able to rely on the fact that their training is secure, that their employment is secure.</p>
<p class="contents">It therefore strikes me as the right approach for the European Union to now aim to implement a European training and employment guarantee. It is absolutely the right course to take to dedicate EUR 10 billion of European Social Fund (ESF) resources which have not yet been specifically allocated to creating 2 million jobs and training places for young people by the end of 2013, and to do so with radically simplified administrative terms and with a reduced cofinancing rate of 10%. However, I do ask, Commissioner, that you pay close attention to ensuring that this money is not merely moved from one trouser pocket to another. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Speaking as the competent Commissioner, I can tell you that that is a very pleasant conclusion to be able to draw.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the debate also shows that it is clear, all in all, that the Structural Funds represent a very comprehensive and effective instrument, indeed the most comprehensive and effective instrument bar none at European level, for appropriately tackling European concerns and goals. Honourable Members, I ask you to consider President Barroso’s proposal as a very vigorous wake-up call – something that is a necessity given the volatile situation, especially when it comes to youth unemployment. It goes without saying that it was, and is, absolutely clear to him, and to everyone else, what the ground rules are when it comes to the Structural Funds. The point here, however, is simply drawing attention to the fact that a total of around EUR 80 to 82 billion is still not, as things stand, directly allocated to projects. As a result, it is therefore legitimate and more than reasonable to ask whether there is scope for refocusing by means of looking into whether monies that have not yet been specifically allocated to projects – although of course they have been allocated to regions – could be better utilised through some redeployment in the regions with a focus on promoting small and medium-sized enterprises and in particular on creating jobs for young people.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that the bulk of the Operational Programmes were debated, agreed and adopted in 2005 and 2006 against the backdrop of a very different economic situation. It is therefore both necessary and appropriate to ask, given the current situation, whether there is scope for a really focused fine-tuning here. That is why the Commission has offered to hold discussions with the competent parties in the Member States concerning what possibilities there may be for action – and there are already action teams on the ground in each of the eight countries with the highest rates of youth unemployment which will be in place until the end of February. We in the Commission will be providing an initial oral report on these discussions in early March.</p>
<p class="contents">I would invite you to bear in mind, however, that very extensive preliminary work has been done under the area of responsibility of my fellow Commissioner László Andor – from the point of view of ‘youth opportunities’ – with the aim of bringing forward proposals about everything that can possibly be done when it comes to combating youth unemployment. Precisely these proposals are now to be tailored in the discussions with the Member States in order to develop solutions that could work in each individual region and sub-region in order to bring about an improvement of the situation. That said, it is fair to mention at this point that we cannot expect to make everything better overnight. The point, however – and this is a call to arms that I am happy to endorse – is that now is very much the time to act. Initiatives need to be put in place. I hope that everyone will pull together in the way that was evident from all the contributions to the debate today. I am convinced that we could achieve the first discernible successes specifically when it comes to combating youth unemployment in Europe in just a few weeks’ time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The biggest difficulty small businesses have is in accessing sources of credit, and one in five young people in the EU is unemployed. I would, however, be interested in hearing the Commission’s response to the issue of the EUR 82 billion still to be allocated to the Structural Funds and how that figure was reached. My understanding was that all Structural Funds for the 2007-2013 period were already allocated to Member States and to certain targeted actions and therefore it is a surprise that there is still money to be allocated. Small businesses and local and regional groups often contact me about obtaining funding from the Structural Funds for worthwhile projects. In the majority of cases, authorities reply that the money has all been spent. It must be properly explained where that EUR 82 billion comes from and why worthwhile projects which have the potential to generate employment are being refused outright. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

UK youth unemployment stands at 22.3%. It increased from 575 000 in 2004 to 1 016 000 in 2011, a rise of 450 000, while over the same period 600 000 EU migrants entered the UK. The Commission wants to allocate EUR 82 billion unspent Structural Funds to youth unemployment – money corresponding to as yet unused budgets earmarked for programmes that depend upon funding – shifting resources without an impact assessment or guaranteed results. Unemployment is a fluid entity relying upon job creation. Job creation relies upon private sector growth. Private sector growth needs inward investment, trade opportunities and production flexibility: all are stifled by EU bureaucracy and marred by trading partners’ economic uncertainty. The Commission wants to divert funding from programmes construed to boost local economies towards training without guaranteed employment at the end. Whilst I support stimulating the labour market through skills development, the best way to mitigate youth unemployment is to ascribe localised investment to the labour market as a whole, rather than reducing investment flexibility through targeted policy making. Job creation requires dynamic development Member States are best equipped to deal with autocratically, via idiosyncratic programmes catering for particular portfolios of industries and demographic patterns. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the last ten years the number has been in the region between 15 and 20%. The Commission estimates that 21% costs society today EUR 2 billion per week or 1% of the EU’s economic output. These are mere figures and do not portray the real tragedy among young people who face serious difficulties finding any job.</p>
<p class="contents">The informal Council of 30 January has agreed to re-allocate funds from the structural and cohesion funds to fight high youth unemployment, especially focusing on the most affected countries such as Spain with 46% and Ireland and Portugal facing rates around 29%. The Member States together with the Commission must rapidly work out a concrete re-allocation plan, to be presented to and discussed with all actors involved.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial to create new flexible job schemes, additional quality apprenticeship and traineeship possibilities both for young people who enter the job market, but also for those who need the opportunity to re-enter. Europe needs its young people more than ever and today’s crisis gives the opportunity for the EU to show flexibility in budgeting and finally seriously target this long-term problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The younger generation is a dwindling resource, with estimates that the proportion they currently represent of 20% will drop to 15% by 2050. This means that we have a duty to create more opportunities for young people in the areas of education and employment. In fact, a basic tool for achieving the objectives proposed on this is the cohesion policy. If, at the moment, reprogramming funds for 2012 and 2013 is not such a simple task and may have more negative than positive effects, I strongly recommend Member States to focus much more attention in the forthcoming programming period on young people and to include in the national programmes’ structure well-financed axes, specially aimed at youth employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The aim of supporting small enterprises and promoting youth employment is of course one that we can all support, but it risks being just words unless the Commission makes it clear what measures and programmes it intends to implement and identifies the budget line to be drawn from. The EUR 82 billion on which the Commission bases its proposal are resources that have been allocated to the Member States and not yet spent, but they are mostly already committed. The concern that these resources could be taken away from national and regional programmes at the behest of the Commission has been decisively laid to rest by Mr Hahn, who, recognising that Parliament’s remarks were well founded, has announced that the choice to reprogramme the expenditure will be left to the Member States and that the funds will remain available to individual countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is likely that this EUR 82 million injection will help combat youth unemployment, finding ways that would help to rapidly reduce the level of unemployment among young people. It is excellent that we are discussing efforts to develop practical opportunities or incentives for employers to employ young people. However, this financial injection and momentary attention are far from being a panacea. Even now, when youth unemployment is a hot topic on the political agenda, we need to search for targeted measures that would be truly effective in the lively and dynamic EU market. For some years we have been saying that we need to strengthen links and promote cooperation between the business and education sectors in order to reduce the gap between them. This gap between business and education is precisely the main reason for the huge rate of youth unemployment: employers continually stress that young people lack specific abilities and practical skills, while their pay expectations do not reflect reality. It is also a concern that in the EU education system we do not put enough emphasis on entrepreneurship education and the abilities to create jobs as well as take them up. I would like to believe that the European Commission experts who have begun consultations with the Member States will not only pay due attention to putting out the current ‘fire’ of youth unemployment, but also to finding integrated solutions in education, social affairs and sectors of the economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Similarly, the 23 million SMEs in Europe are vital for economic development in our regions and must be given special attention. However, letting us believe that the European Union has EUR 82 billion of unspent funds in its safes that the Commission can just use as it pleases could worry our citizens and lead them to believe that there is a lack of rigorous and planned management for structural funds. Also, the Commission must prove that it has learned its lesson to place greater emphasis on the importance of long-term programming for the ERDF and the ESF and the Member States and regions’ responsibility to manage them. It must then support the Member States using its expertise in the implementation of projects in order to simplify their allocation as much as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the Commission’s plan to divert EUR 82 billion of Structural Funds resources that had not previously been allocated, including EUR 22 billion from the European Social Fund, should still be carefully analysed in tandem with the Member States involved. Thought should be given to where and how to invest those resources most effectively for the long-term development of the labour market, particularly in terms of creating jobs for young people. At the moment there is still a considerable lack of clarity. The Member States ought , in every respect, to take their responsibility for the quality of education and for breaking the vicious circle very seriously, so that young people, particularly those without any work experience, may successfully enter the labour market. This might be, for example, through undergoing work experience or receiving assistance to start up their own businesses. The programmes of this type that have been proposed are very important to States with a high unemployment rate, such as Latvia, where talented and educated young people who are unable to find attractive work are already going to look for jobs outside Latvia. This trend is very dangerous for the nation’s viability and economic growth in the long term. I greatly appreciate dialogue with the Commission on resolving an issue of such importance for Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was the spearhead of the European Economic Recovery Plan adopted in 2008 and the recent increase in the percentage of cofinancing for projects implemented within the framework of cohesion policy is yet another example of the contribution made by the Structural Funds to recovery attempts. During the informal summit on 30 January 2012, the EU-27 leaders agreed that resources should be used to address youth unemployment and to increase funding for small and medium-sized enterprises, by using the EUR 82 billion yet to be allocated to the Member States by the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund. However, it must be made clear that the EUR 82 billion in question has simply not yet been spent on specific projects; these are not unallocated resources. Finally, the following paradox needs to be emphasised: even though the Member States are supporting efforts to recover from the crisis via the Structural Funds, some of them are proposing cuts both in the future cohesion policy which they extol and in the annual Community budgets, which will create numerous problems with the most important development policy of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
