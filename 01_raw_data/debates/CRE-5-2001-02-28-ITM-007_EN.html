<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Brunetta (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in a short space of time, the European telecommunications industry has, thanks to the impetus given to it by the Community institutions and the innovative action of the market, moved over from a system based on national monopolies to one based on general liberalisation. Market forces and new technologies have pushed this regulatory process forward, generating results in terms of competition and new operators coming into the market, which have in some cases exceeded expectations. The proposed revision of the current regulatory framework governing the telecommunications sector, currently before the European Parliament, consists, therefore, in laying down general objectives from which are derived the regulatory principles governing the new reference framework, basically with the aim of gradually moving the telecommunications market from a phase of market liberalisation to a phase of genuine competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The approach to regulating the market should be geared to the future state of markets in which the conditions will be much more competitive and diversified, with the rapid spread of innovative services, and focused on the implementation of competition law, to replace the<span class="italic"> ex ante </span>rules applied on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="contents">This objective can be pursued by means of a body of <span class="italic">ex ante</span> rules harmonised at European level, which are of a transitional and exceptional nature. In other words, <span class="italic">ex ante</span> regulation must provide for its own disappearance once a sufficient degree of competition has been achieved, for excessive regulation is against the interests of the market. With regard to the content of the directive which is the subject of my report, Parliament has identified priorities through its Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.</p>
<p class="contents">The definition of the term 'access': the definitions given in the Commission's proposal were extremely broad and the failure to define terms clearly could have led to disputes with the regulatory authorities. There is a particular risk of the rules and instruments set out in the directive being applied indiscriminately to extremely different situations, such as access for operators and users to end-user services, network facilities, system facilities, networks and roaming.</p>
<p class="contents">Roaming warranted more detailed consideration. I do not feel that it should be seen as a form of access, given that it has different connotations according to whether what is involved is enabling a user with a subscription to a foreign operator's network to use a mobile service in a given country and vice-versa – what is known as international roaming – or enabling operators entering the market to use the facilities of existing operators in a given country until such time as they have installed their own networks, which is known as asymmetric roaming.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of light regulation: the report stresses the fact that light regulation and flexibility, central parts of the European legislation, must not mean 'anything goes', but must be a means of overcoming the problems of the current approach involving <span class="italic">ex ante</span> regulations which have failed to keep pace with the times and with technological progress. The management of access and interconnection rights in fact requires a balance to be found between the rights of operators which are infrastructure owners to manage their networks and infrastructures for their own benefit and the rights of other operators, which are service providers, to access to essential facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Degree of competitiveness of the market: another point which required clearer definition was the assessment of the degree of competitiveness of the market. The achievement of a high degree of competitiveness is the precondition for reducing the role played by the regulation so as to enable its place to be taken by competition law alone, or, conversely, for subjecting operators that have been notified as having significant market power to regulatory obligations and<span class="bold"> </span>subsequent cost orientation negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The definition of the ‘new significant market power’ is based on Court of Justice judgment and refers to a form of 'reduced' domination, since one of the features of dominance is to 'hamper competition', which is an <span class="italic">ex post</span> concept. The proposal for a directive applies the 'new' significant market power' or 'reduced domination' concept, which, its 'negative' feature of hampering competition having been corrected, leaves the field open to <span class="italic">ex ante</span> measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Obligations imposed on operators: national regulatory authorities may impose obligations of transparency, non-discrimination, accounting separation, access to and use of specific network facilities, and price control and cost accounting obligations on operators notified as having significant market power. The proposal also lays down arrangements for applying or revising the obligations deriving from the implementation of the current system and those deriving from the new regulatory framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The first remark to be made regards the arrangements for imposing obligations on operators notified as having significant market power. In fact, notification does not automatically entail any obligations but the national regulatory authorities have to specify the obligations to be imposed on each operator that has been notified. However, the fact that an operator has significant market power does not always mean that it is misusing that power. When considering whether an operator does or does not have significant market power, national regulatory authorities should at the same time consider whether it is actually using that power before imposing obligations provided for in the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, environmental impact. An issue which is particularly close to my heart, as a local administrator apart from anything else, is reducing the number of masts in residential areas. Operators are increasingly being forced by technical requirements to install infrastructures which do not fit in with the landscape. It is the duty of the Community institutions, as well as national local authorities, to reduce this impact on the landscape and the environment as much as possible. It is the duty of all policy-makers, at all levels, while safeguarding the importance of competition in the telecommunications market, to find regulatory solutions which allow maximum use of the installations currently available, taking into consideration the impact on the landscape and the environment and the socio-cultural implications for the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are other points relating to the different taxation systems, in which area there is a call for harmonisation, and to the need for coordination by the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking all these considerations into account, we can only recommend the proposal for a directive, in that it seeks to stimulate growth in the sector, it will stimulate future investment and enhance the competitiveness of businesses, and, by increasing efficiency, will help to bring about a fall in prices and contribute to economic growth across the board. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Paasilinna (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FI) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the biggest change going on in Europe is obviously the opportunity to network, and this is of particular political importance because the participation of ordinary citizens in it is becoming ever more dependent on their level of income, and sometimes where they live. In addition, it is those very people that are on the wrong side of the digital divide who are already today’s excluded citizens. The aims of an electronic Europe and civil society will thus not be achieved without network services helping people to establish connections with one another and get organised accordingly. We need to create a basic amount of telecommunications time for everyone, so that everyone can use the telecommunications and information society services without charge. It would be an important addition to citizens’ rights. In this way a person could function in the networked society and we would not be creating an elite network.</p>
<p class="contents">As much as EUR 170 billion are estimated to have gone into radio spectrum auctions. This huge amount of money was obviously noticed in political circles and part of the profits was taken for the benefit of society. Apart from anything else, the timing was unfortunate. The US economy started to wane and the Union decided to build a Europe that would embrace all its citizens, which is our main strategy. This auction policy works against this, as now the charges for telecommunications services are rising. Investors have begun to shun the industry and the production of the next generation of networks, equipment and services is slowing down. The result is more problems, the stock market value of many operators having collapsed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s framework directive, as with other provisions relating to this package, is a relevant and balanced solution, and I thank them accordingly. The framework directive is a move towards the regulation of all telecommunications networks and services. With it the number of provisions will fall to less than a third of what there are at present. What is most surprising about all this is that the telecommunications industry, in which goods move across borders at the speed of electrical current, has no coherent European market. On the contrary, the same EU provisions have been interpreted in very many different ways and in many areas exorbitantly high charges have been maintained. Genuine competition has been prevented through many forms of trickery. As the telecommunications services sector has grown, costs have become an ever more important factor for both households and countries’ economies in general. Certain big players in the industry are all for competition in other sectors, but are in truth against it in their own. The bigger the market and the more powerful a company is, the more effectively it can compete with smaller companies in the market and the new players trying to enter the market, and that is true of those other markets.</p>
<p class="contents">In my own proposal I have increased the scope of the national regulatory authorities and supported an improvement in resources. At the same time, I propose an increase in transparency. The national regulatory authorities are by far the best agencies to assess the situation in their own market, but I believe that it is the Commission that is best placed to assess the situation regarding the telecommunications markets throughout the Union as a whole. I also believe that if the Commission had had the proper powers the auction principle would hardly have been established of the type and on the scale we know at present. The Commission must act when a Member State is not complying with common telecommunications legislation. It is essential for companies that they are able to function on the same terms and conditions throughout the Union. As a result of Commission action we will also be able to avoid having to establish a separate pan-European regulator. As the auction principle could also extend to other resources caught in a bottleneck and new generations of mobile phone networks, I would ask the Commission now to investigate the situation comprehensively for Parliament regarding the effect of auctions on companies and consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Another essential sector is the definition of significant market player. We in the committee have broadened the notion in the light of recent developments. A significant market player is now also one that has the continued ability to limit other operators' contacts with users. The same goes for a situation where a company operates in several parts of the production chain and has a significant position in one of them. We consider that many companies are in a dominant position in markets in which they can, as it were, tacitly agree on the swings in the market that will touch others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank the Commission and the Council Presidencies for working with us in a highly constructive manner over recent weeks and months.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the authorisation directive and my report. How do things currently stand as regards the authorisation procedure for communication services and networks in the European Union? According to the Commission's fifth and sixth reports on the implementation of the reform package for the telecommunications sector and according to the reports of the European Telecommunication Office, the Member States all have completely different licensing regimes. This causes problems, especially for operators offering cross-border telecommunications services, and means that, at present, a business in the telecommunications sector can only start trading once an authority has so decided, i.e. once an individual licence has been issued.</p>
<p class="contents">These individual licences vary enormously from one Member State to another; some licences have extensive information requirements attached, others have none at all. As a result, the licensing procedures in the individual Member States take varying lengths of time, the terms and conditions differ and the fees charged vary widely. The purpose of the authorisation directive submitted by the Commission is to remedy this. The directive calls for simpler, more harmonised rules for market access for electronic communications services and networks in the Community. Future licensing regimes must be fair, predictable and the least cumbersome possible for applicants. Some Member States have already put this into practice and it is therefore good and the Commission is right to propose that such regimes be introduced throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">A couple of comments on the content of the proposed directive. In future, network operators or communication service providers will no longer need to obtain an individual licence, i.e. to get permission from the authorities before providing their services. They will merely be required to meet the conditions set out in general licences. At the same time, the number of conditions that can be imposed on service providers has been sharply reduced and harmonised at European level. The proposal also provides that, in future, service providers will no longer have to furnish comprehensive information. In future, the national licensing authorities will only be able to demand the information which is strictly necessary for the authorities to verify compliance with the conditions for authorisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The change in licensing regimes will ensure that service providers are able to provide their telecommunications services and networks quickly, and without a great deal of red tape, throughout Europe. This is in my opinion, without doubt, a milestone on the path towards a dynamic and competition-orientated market for electronic communications in the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to address a problem which currently hits operators hard in practice. Time and again they come up against serious difficulties as regards the granting of rights of way. Here again, the Member States have very different rules on procedures, fees and conditions. This makes it even more difficult to develop an infrastructure – unnecessarily so. Laying long telecommunications cables is an expensive business. Operators have to apply for a whole series of rights of way in towns, communes and districts. They have to obtain planning permission. They often need consent from hundreds of property owners before they can start trading as operators. The directive should therefore at least place Member States under an obligation to publish a list of charges, procedures and conditions in connection with the granting of rights of way. This would at least give operators an overview of the legal situation, thereby saving a great deal of time when applying for rights of way.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the subject of administrative charges is another crucial point. Administrative charges as a whole should mirror the costs incurred in administering and controlling general authorisations more closely. The directive provides here for the Member States to publish reports in order to make the costs transparent. The proposal for a directive apportions the administrative charges between the individual undertakings providing services under a general authorisation. I disagree with the Commission proposal and consider that they should be apportioned equally between applicants, rather than on the basis of the turnover of the undertaking in question. Smaller undertakings, with annual turnover of up to EUR 10 million, should be exempt from any charges, thereby making it easier for small and medium-sized undertakings to access the market.</p>
<p class="contents">That concludes the introduction to my report. I should now like to take the liberty of highlighting an important aspect of Mr Paasilinna's report. As Mr Paasilinna has already explained, the Commission proposal stipulates that the national regulatory authorities will, as a rule, no longer be allowed to take important decisions on telecommunications regulations independently. Instead, they will simply prepare drafts, which the Commission will examine within one month and either approve or reject, as appropriate. If the draft is rejected, the Commission has a further two months in which to give the regulatory authority in question a decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would also decide in future if and on what frequencies radio communications can be broadcast. Parliament has always taken the view that this is a matter solely for the individual Member States. I should therefore like expressly to object to this proposal, which is also contained in Amendment No 33 by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and was adopted in committee by a broad majority.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally am positive that the national authorities are closer to the market than the Commission and are therefore better placed to decide how and to what extent the telecommunications markets can be further liberalised on a case-by-case basis. The liberalisation of the telecommunications markets has been a real success story. Consumers today have a choice of service providers and telephone charges have fallen rapidly. There is no cause, especially at this stage of the proceedings, to take the reins away from the successful national regulators and hand them to the Commission. This would only complicate and slow down the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">I have re-tabled the proposed amendment which Parliament will be voting on tomorrow. I refer to Amendment No 78. I ask you to support this amendment and thank you for listening. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It refined and specified certain aspects of the Commission’s proposal. That is to be welcomed, also in the interest of culture and education, because I viewed the report from the perspective of the draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport.</p>
<p class="contents">Telecommunications are changing our lives at a fast pace. Particularly with the rapid development in telecommunications it is important that directives are put in place in good time in order to regulate access and interconnections within the European Union and beyond its borders as effectively as possible. The Commission’s proposal focuses mainly on competition and a level<span class="italic"> </span>playing field. It is of great importance to national regulatory agencies, certainly in relation to a position of considerable power. It is therefore a purely commercial approach and focuses on the infrastructure. What I feel is missing is the proviso that cultural diversity and plurality should be guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the reason why we in the Committee on Culture have tabled a number of amendments strengthening this aspect. I am consequently very happy that these amendments have also been accepted by the Committee on Industry. In this context we are very concerned that the ‘must carry’ obligation should be extended to broad-band format, as indicated in Amendment No 14.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to turn my attention to the regulation of the APIs and the EPGs and other accompanying facilities in accordance with the procedure of a regulatory committee. In the view of the Commission that only needs to be implemented when there is a revision, but it is now clear that developments are so far advanced that they should fall within the scope of the regulations. Well, Mr President, that will in fact be much too late. It is to be welcomed that the rapporteur has taken this line of reasoning into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It makes perfect sense to want to simplify and organise the current legal framework of no less than 28 different legal texts more clearly. That a horizontal approach has been chosen is logical and to be welcomed. The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport has called unanimously in its opinions on the various reports for care to be taken in all regulations on electronic communications networks and services so as to ensure that no conditions are attached to access which might, in the final analysis, have an adverse effect on the broad range of content.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, we must ensure that networks and services of general interest are adequately disseminated. The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport also sees a need for harmonisation measures within the internal market, but in a wider sense than the Commission, which wants to consolidate its powers here. The institutions have agreed, after years of arduous discussion, that different legal rules are needed for infrastructure and content. They have likewise agreed that there are links between the routes and the content disseminated via them and that these links must be duly acknowledged and taken into account in the interests of cultural variety and democratic opinion-forming within society.</p>
<p class="contents">The market can do a great deal, but it cannot do everything. In plain text this means, for example, that in order to safeguard pluralism and a variety of opinions, the widespread dissemination of a range of content to a wide public must be guaranteed under a ‘must carry’ obligation, with the Member States alone responsible for putting the flesh on the bones of such a regulation. We must make it clear that Europe has no business interfering in national and regional radio sovereignty. From this point of view, the principle of coordination before harmonisation applies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that this is exemplary in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">We are discussing three important reports and at the same time we are talking about a sector characterised by a great degree of uncertainty. In every conceivable kind of article in magazines and newspapers we even see prophets of doom sowing the seeds of doubt on the question of whether the 3G sector is at all viable. I believe that the Commission and the Swedish Presidency have an important role to play in the run-up to the informal summit that will take place in Stockholm on 23 and 24 March 2001. It would be very good if a plan of action could be agreed there. I should like to mention here a number of elements, which strike me as important in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first place, the Heads of Government should state expressly at the summit that they consider the 3G sector to be of prime importance for high-quality employment in the European Union, and that they are also prepared to work towards a single Europe-wide market.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it would be very wise if the two countries that bear the greatest responsibility for the high auction results, the United Kingdom and Germany, were prepared to consider other sources of finance. Perhaps they will also be willing to postpone this financing for a little while, so that the financing burden on telecom companies would ease, with all the accompanying stabilising effects that that can bring about on the financial markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it would be a very good thing if Commissioner Liikanen were to sit round the table with all these companies to discuss the question of how the public at large can be better informed about the achievements and potential of the 3G sector, and particularly to examine collectively how, for example through collocation, more effective use can be made of transmission masts, etc., resulting in a reduction in infrastructure costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, it would be a very significant step if the Member States that have benefited greatly from those auctions were prepared to boost demand by stimulating the need for 3G, for example in the field of e<span class="italic">-</span>governance projects, and to do more in areas such as education, in-service training of teachers, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as part of the sixth Framework Programme we should use a significant part of our financial resources to solve questions such as the new internet protocol 6 (IP 6), <span class="italic">e-</span>banking standards, etc. I hope that the Commissioner will respond to the recommendations I have just made.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to the reports. In the first instance to the report of Mr Brunetta: I think it is an excellent report. It is very important that we should establish now that Parliament, in cases where open competition does not yet work and there is emphatic evidence of problem areas in the market, has the courage to take a position and to opt for the consumer. A well-known example is that of the international roaming tariffs. We have seen a Commission report of last December, from which it is apparent that there is actually a closed system, that there is too little price competition, that there is too much disguising of costs and that it is vital that there should be transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the report of Mr Paasilinna I want to make the comment that the suggestion that we should strive for greater competition is supported by our group. We must indeed work towards a Europe-wide electronic communications market. Fifteen separate national electronic communications markets cannot work. A Europe-wide market must be created and that is why it is so important that the role of the Commission is maintained. I appeal passionately to the House not to support the amendment of Mrs Niebler, because that amendment misrepresents matters. We must ensure that the Commission is able to fulfil its task in that area and to guarantee that true competition is created and that a Europe-wide market becomes a reality. That is the priority. To that end we need a clear division of tasks and responsibilities between the Commission and NRAs, as is rightly advocated in Mr Paasilinna’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mrs Niebler’s report. She has produced an excellent report, and I should like to draw attention expressly to the amendment in which we are now trying to formulate criteria designed to ensure that in the distribution of frequencies Member States take account of the fact that we live in a Europe-wide market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For me, the emergence of a fully integrated and liberalised telecommunications market by the end of 2001 is the vital precondition for the transition to a digital knowledge-based economy, which I hope will bring considerable growth to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential to note that the consequences of this package will certainly not be restricted to one recipient in particular. On the contrary, the new legal framework will serve to enhance competition in this sector. This House’s objective is to encourage incumbents to continue to be major players, yet there is a danger that their over-dominance will discriminate against new entrants, when one of our key priorities is to create a climate in which new entrants are allowed to flourish. We are getting the balance right on this issue, and this I hope will actually counter concerns over the mounting debt in this sector at present.</p>
<p class="contents">For my group the intention of this raft of legislation is to encourage market development and to reduce the burden of legislation. However, rules with a significant effect should not be based on a short-term vision. I am therefore pleased that in the access directive the committee approved the inclusion of mobile networks in the definition, and I am equally pleased that the retail prices of international roaming, which are exorbitant at present, will be transparent and cost-based in future.</p>
<p class="contents">In a sector which is subject to such swift technological change, it is important to ensure that the regime is able to deal with unforeseen issues that might arise in the future. The access directive will have the greatest impact on the European consumer as it will lead to lower prices, greater choice and better services. At the same time, the new situation will create opportunities for businesses across Europe and especially small businesses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, the liberalisation of telecommunications has created a new market environment with more competition and lower prices for companies and consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless there is still no single internal telecom market. The fifteen fragmented, liberalised markets must be merged into a single transparent market, and the legislation now before us must create the framework for this. The NRAs have an important part to play in this, but in the view of my group the final responsibility should remain with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point, Mr President, concerns licences for radio frequencies. At this moment there is no question in the Member States of the European Union of a consistent policy on the granting of licences. Think, for example of the UMTS auctions. As a result, the Union is threatening to lose its leading position in the field of mobile telephone communications. In the dividing up of the radio spectrum the licence procedures should be subject to the same conditions in all Member States, because for optimum development of the radio and television market we should aim for a better balance in occupation of frequencies between public service providers on the one hand and commercial providers on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Commissioner to take a more active role in future in formulating the conditions and in relation to the way in which frequencies are distributed. I believe there is also a job here for Commissioner Monti.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, the revenue that comes from the allocation of wavebands, such as the UMTS auction, should be channelled back to the ICT sector. Mr van Velzen has already pointed this out. It also concurs with the agreements at the Lisbon Summit. Auctions should be avoided wherever possible. Consequently, it is to be welcomed that the Dutch Government decided last week not to hold an auction. In addition, the proceeds of the wavebands should never be seen as a stealth tax. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One may well ask why this should be, given that these directives basically deal with the privatisation of the telecommunications market. The public-sector undertakings have already been partly or completely privatised throughout the EU. So the point is not if they should be privatised, it is merely how.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Greens have a clear attitude towards liberalisation. We believe that the state has not always acted in the citizens' best interests, but we fear that privatisation will dismantle public services and we intend to fight a digital divide in society. A great deal has been said about technological neutrality. Technological neutrality may well exist at a purely legislative level. But at a social level, technology is never neutral. We want developments for the people, which are good for the people, which benefit everyone and hurt few, which is why we are in favour of maximum controls on monopolies in the telecommunications sector. Maybe this cannot prevent our still having three telecommunications giants in the whole of the EU in ten years' time. But it can prevent it if the national regulatory authorities are strengthened and the Commission also takes on an arbitration function, because then – and only then – is monopoly control even thinkable.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also in favour of new companies' being able to offer services which compete with former public undertakings on fair terms. This at least will give more people a chance of being able to afford Internet access even though – let me stress once again – we believe in neither the hand of fate nor market logic.</p>
<p class="contents">So where does this take us? The aim is to regulate a sector of the economy which should bring people greater independence and more self-determination. We want to help ensure that everyone who wants access to these technologies can take advantage of this opportunity. And we want people to be able to use digital communications to communicate and organise themselves, in brief to develop this, throughout the world. And that means fair access. Not just in private households, but also in public places, in libraries, schools and all public places.</p>
<p class="contents">This communication must be free. It must be available to everyone indiscriminately and, if at all possible, it must be available to everyone on the same terms, which is why we say no to the numerous attempts to restrict, censor or criminalise the Internet. Even if this is not specified in the directives before us, censorship and the supervisory authorities' quest for more and more control over people appears increasingly to be the essence of any attempt to shape the digital sector, which is why it must be said here that we Greens are in favour of open access for everyone. We want open digital communications. We do not want more supervision, we want no supervision. That is the only reason we went along with the arrangements for privatisation, given that we do not in fact want privatisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But can we trust in competition as a regulator of the market? No, we cannot. Although telephone charges have gone down in many countries, not all charges have. For example, in Finland charges for local wired telephone calls have risen by a quarter in the last few years. In addition, it is impossible for consumers to discover what mobile phone calls cost to different companies’ networks or wired telephones.</p>
<p class="contents">We live in a jungle, where the laws of the jungle determine prices. The lion’s share of profits are being grabbed by supranational operators whose objective it is to dominate the market. Unfortunately, the governments of certain Member States of the Union are like Tarzan, King of the Jungle, who has in his hands a limited natural resource – new frequencies. The central left governments of Germany and Britain have auctioned off mobile phone UMTS frequencies to telecommunications companies in such a way that a crisis is looming for the companies involved and many banks. The stock market bubble has now burst as far as that sort of thinking is concerned, based as it was on a belief in the power of information technology to work miracles.</p>
<p class="contents">The auctions have sabotaged the <span class="italic">e-</span>Europe project. They have weakened democracy. They have caused telephone charges to go sky-high. They are an imposition on the free flow of information and data. Would all of this have been avoidable if there had been a framework directive on telecommunications at the disposal of the EU? I would like to think so, although it is not certain it would have. But now we have to try out a framework directive, and Mr Paasilinna has been engaged on an immense task in its preparation. He is calling for a thorough investigation into the financial effects of auctions. Our group supports this. However, it is difficult to agree with Mrs Niebler’s amendment to the framework directive. It is based on the values and interests of certain European monopolies and is at odds with a democratic information society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, one of my key areas of concern with regard to the e-commerce and e-Europe revolution is equality of access for consumers. Members have already mentioned the costs and the tariffs that are associated with the different structures. However, we are seeing a new divide being created between the haves and have-nots as regards digital technology and access to it. One of the key components which must be enshrined within all liberalisation or competition law in this area is the question of universal access for all, so that no matter where anybody is living they have the same access as somebody living in a large urbanised area.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to ensure that people of a different generation from the present younger generation are not disadvantaged because of lack of access to training for this new means of communication and this new information network.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point that I would make is that we must move to a system where there is a flat rate for access to information technology and not allow internal competition to arise which will block the further expansion of this new global system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We would, however, like to emphasise the existence, in any case, of a serious contradictory situation affecting the electronic telecommunications sector which, if, something is not done, is likely, in time, to sabotage any endeavours to create a situation of competition benefiting the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">The contradiction lies in the genuine conflict of interests present in many European States, who find themselves in a situation in which they are both regulators and holders of economic and political interests, both referees and players in the game. This is true in the field of telephony, but also in the field of digital television, where the huge investments financed by public funding give public broadcasters enormous power. We must therefore be aware of this fundamental anomaly but, overall, I repeat, we support the package. Following the result recently achieved with the adoption of the regulation on local loop unbundling, it is now time to find an initial solution to a situation in which any company operating on the European electronic communications market finds that it has to weave its way not only through the layers upon layers of directives and regulations issued over the years but also through a plethora of national regulatory authorities acting under extremely varied legislation according to a very wide range of criteria which the operator cannot even hope to predict, and it therefore finds itself in a situation of fragmentation and, at times, great legal uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposals have the merit of streamlining the existing legislation to form a small number of directives, in addition to creating an increasingly pan-European telecommunications market.</p>
<p class="contents">It must also be stressed – and I think Mr Brunetta made this point – that the goal to be striven after is the achievement in as short a time as possible of a situation of genuine competition where there is no longer a need for the heavy regulatory hand of the authorities. We must endeavour to reach a stage where there is no longer a role for the national regulatory authorities, we must bring the electric communications sector to the point where the general competition rules valid for the entire market are applied. We will only be able to achieve this when we have succeeded in prising out the root of this fundamental problem of multiple roles and the conflict of interests, which are still there at State level, with the weight of the State in the electronic communications economy: only then will we be able to bring this sector into line with the common competition law which prevails in the other sectors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clear from roaming fees, for example, that the market is far from transparent. It would be good if consumers really could find out exactly what their conversations cost or if they at least received a follow-up SMS straight away, telling them what the call had cost.</p>
<p class="contents">This sort of transparency results in benchmark comparisons, i.e. you can compare who is best in Europe and how we compare with the rest of the world. We want to work out a best practice method together with the Commission. Who in Europe or anywhere else in the world has the models which work best and which we can use ourselves? Above all – and this is very important – we also want to use SLIM. Various regulations being introduced today will, in fact, need to be repealed as quickly as possible once the market starts functioning.</p>
<p class="contents">One very important point in the Paasilinna report is Amendment No 47, because we have seen that, although the auctions were fair, a great deal of money has pulled out of this important sector. That is why we consciously do not want to treat the proceeds from auctions as straight taxation and why we politicians take the view that this was an investment, an asset which was once a public-sector asset and which is now a virtual asset for the companies. I also believe that, once the licences have expired, these rights should be retained by the companies, which can then sell, rent or otherwise trade them. That will improve the companies' rating and it will improve the capital market and, by extension, the share prices, giving us an investment in this sector and strength for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to try and avoid that. But I too should like to highlight two or three points. I too should like to express my gratitude for the interesting and exciting cooperation in Parliament right across the group divide. There are certainly material arguments here which go beyond political bounds. I too found the discussions with various representatives from companies large and small right across Europe very interesting and, although not everyone will be satisfied, I think we are on the right track towards a more viable future. It has been my conviction over recent years that we need to create tight, bundled rules which allow us to react quickly in the future to technological progress. In this respect, my maxim still holds: less regulation may be much better regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, in concentrating on the directives being debated today, we have succeeded in doing this. I also think that sooner or later – I think relatively soon – we shall be able to start applying general competition law. I must, of course, pour just a little cold water on one point. I personally and many of my fellow Members fully support Amendment No 78, as tabled by Mrs Niebler, and shall vote in favour of it. As I said, this support cuts more or less across the group divide, because I am positive that this proposed amendment does not stand in the way of European harmonisation. On the contrary, in my view, the type of licensing procedure and powers set out in this article are more time-consuming and bureaucratic and, in my book, constitute interference in regional affairs in the public-service radio sector, as my fellow Member, Karin Junker, has already said. In this respect I feel strongly that, whatever the approach, we must prevent the ‘must carry’ obligation from being abolished through the back door. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today we are debating the options for the second phase.</p>
<p class="contents">The question has been raised, and it is more than a question, it is a choice. Mr van Velzen was one of many who said that our aim is a great pan-European market. I concur. Today, however, we are discussing the options of ‘how’ to achieve this, and there is a difference between choosing to achieve genuine and sustainable competition, as in a traditional sector – which is what Mr Brunetta advocates – and what we would like, which is different; i.e. public regulation of networks in Europe, with competing services but alongside the development of a universal service, and, where necessary, possible sharing of infrastructure. What is at stake, therefore, is the debate on how the market will be regulated rather than the objective of creating a pan-European market.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the option being considered is of dubious value; i.e. to have national regulation of the telecommunications market and common rules on genuine competition on a Community level. It is unsound, because, currently, national regulation means every man for himself. All the Members of this House have criticised the problems of allocating radio frequencies, the extreme variations in licence costs, the excessive debts of some of the operators, and so there may be risks of the telephone market crashing just as the property market crashed a while back.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we are not favouring indiscriminate national regulation but we are in favour of the rules of competition, even if, for example, the Commission has tried to move towards the concept of a relevant market, which is not supported by the Council and we have to deal with – and the Commission, perhaps, is not moving in this direction – issues on development of a universal service, problems with investment savings and on sharing of the networks so as to be able to reduce costs.</p>
<p class="contents">We would therefore advocate – and I personally would advocate – a system of European regulators, basically to create a pan-European market, but we come up against the European framework of references and rules, and I believe that we are going to have to look more closely into this, because the solution that we currently have is an absolute hybrid, I must stress this. The proposed package, which will result from all these negotiations, cannot be seen as set in stone. Despite the efforts some have made, it is another regulatory nightmare. That is why I believe that we need to widen the public debate on the action plan that you are outlining, by involving civil societies to a much greater extent in order to reach agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have had difficulty in reconciling the texts. We have not made the Commission’s task easier. Between us, we have overcomplicated these texts and it is going to have a job to sort these out before the second reading. It is a lesson for us in the future that, as politicians and parliamentarians, we should focus on simplification and minimum regulation. I was interested that my colleague, Mrs Gill – unfortunately she is no longer here – made the point of support for market development to minimise regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">We have not done that with the amendments that we have made. The problem with the work that we have done so far is that we have got bogged down in today’s thinking. We are actually finding excuses for regulating. We have spent an enormous amount of time on significant market power and deciding how to regulate it, instead of actually thinking about the way forward. I am pleased a number of colleagues, including Mr Glante, made that point as well. That is something that we need to reflect on between now and the second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly concerned about the fact that we are not thinking about the way the market is going to reconstruct. We should look at the change in sentiment in the market that has taken place over the time that we have been reviewing these texts and think about the mobile market which is still enormously dynamic, has shown terrific rates of growth, is introducing new products all the time, and is within sight of getting mobile communications to two-thirds of the European population.</p>
<p class="contents">We are spending far too much time here thinking about transitory issues of roaming. I know colleagues feel very strongly about it but the market will actually cure those issues. I remain entirely unconvinced that the sort of interventionist approach we have taken here is right.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I remind colleagues that there is one more very important report to come, my report on universal service, and many of the things you have talked about and, indeed, some of the provisions on mobile are actually more appropriate for my report and not for Mr Brunetta’s. I am sure the Commission will remind us of that but I shall resist those sort of temptations when I come back to you in two months time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are looking at where regulation has succeeded and, if I could say to Mr Harbour, not only where regulation has failed but why it has failed, and that is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Paasilinna, in his written contribution, posed the question who will regulate the regulator and I think that the role of the Commission is absolutely crucial in this. It is not only about who will regulate the regulator but why we need to regulate the regulator.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Clegg spent an enormous amount of time just last year on the local loop unbundling rules and I am posing a separate question to you, Commissioner, to ask if you will give an indication of where already we are seeing resistance at Member State level to implementing local loop unbundling.</p>

We have made a stab at trying to enhance and improve the text but I am concerned, as was Mr Harbour, that we may actually have complicated matters, so whilst I feel that we have added a menu of additional concepts, a mélange, a pot-pourri of new tools to deploy under the title of SMP, I wonder whether we should perhaps be a little more bold in the second reading and perhaps think of drawing back where we consider, on reflection, those new concepts might actually be adding to confusion rather than diminishing confusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Second point: NRAs. This is really a point I would like to address to the Council, not that there is much point in doing it here this evening, but the Member States cannot have it both ways. They cannot have their cake and eat it. They cannot wish to see a vibrant pan-European telecoms market established and yet not have any meaningful criteria attached to the way in which NRAs operate. That is an unsustainable position and, politically, we should push the Member States harder and harder on this. There need to be clear criteria of independence and autonomy and proper resourcing which we need to really push upon the Member States, and not be swayed by their slightly misleading claims that it is all to do with subsidiarity and therefore none of our business.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the all-important Article 6 of the Paasilinna report and the vexed Amendment No 33, which Mrs Niebler spoke about earlier, we should perhaps have another look at it in second reading. I am not sure if you have the balance right. I am clear at this stage – and my group will vote against it – that those provisions should not cover ‘must carry’ provisions and we will be voting against that section of that amendment tomorrow.</p>

However, in a capitalist society, the only thing that matters is to maximise profits. Now that everything can be bought and sold, we have the apparent paradox of radio frequencies being treated as a commodity, auctioned to the highest bidder. The next step will be to market the very air that we breathe.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, the whole telecommunications sector, which was once a public-sector service and which was developed using public funds, has already been handed over to the private sector. And now we are in the ridiculous position of examining directives which qualify as intervention of a purely state monopoly nature by the European Union in a bid to regulate various monopoly interests in the context of the full liberalisation of the market and support for competition. The sole purpose of a harmonised framework is to overcome national barriers restricting the unaccountable spread of supranational monopolies to all the Member States. The pan-European market preached by the directives is no more than unaccountable action on the part of big business, despite the supposed interest in protecting small enterprises.</p>

The rapporteurs, Mr Brunetta, Mrs Niebler, and Mr Paasilinna, in particular, as well as Mr van Velzen, have all worked very hard indeed to create compromises, and I would like to say a special thank you to them.</p>
<p class="contents">The definition of a dominant market position has been the main area of special attention. The balance now achieved will be a clear message to the Council, which it will also then have to take account of. The Commission at one stage was going to walk all over the national supervisory authorities, but that did not happen. Owing to cultural differences the national regulatory authorities must be given some leeway and they must have their role strengthened. The Commission is above the NRAs, and its role must be to monitor the adherence to rules common to all.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be able to intervene in roaming charges that are currently distorting competition. A written question of mine last year was connected with the hampering effect these roaming charges have on competition. The workings of an open internal market must be respected. There must be further wide-ranging discussion with regard to the position of virtual operators. We have to consider upon what terms and conditions a virtual operator can work in the network, to permit free competition and to guarantee a benefit to consumers, though, on the other hand, the rights of network ownership should be protected. We are in a bipartite situation and we are hardly going to find a solution to it right away. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that this form of cooperation has brought about a good compromise which may not, of course, be supported on all points by the whole House but which has demonstrated nonetheless that we are often able, through productive debate, to bring about a result which, on several counts, has real potential for development over and above the Commission's concept.</p>
<p class="contents">The crucial question throughout has been whether or not to support Mrs Niebler's amendment – my fellow Member, Mr van Velzen, is engaged in conversation just now, but he addressed this point and pleaded in favour of it. I too am in favour of our supporting it, addressing as it does the crucial question of how harmonisation is to be organised at European level. The Commission has rightly pointed out that we need more harmonisation in this sector and more uniform structures. Of that there can be no question; we have been discussing this point for years. I have in the past always been a fanatical advocate of a single European regulatory authority but this idea is now dead and buried. We opted for a different variant and I think that numerous regulatory authorities have demonstrated that they are independent, self-sufficient and autonomous and that the state too is more than capable of developing excellent competition models here.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there are other models which fall short of our expectations at European level, of that there can be no doubt, and something needs to be done here. The crucial question is how to configure the relationship between the European and national levels and here I would have preferred a lighter model, either along the lines suggested by me and my fellow Member, Norbert Glante, or along the lines of Mrs Niebler's model. Which is why I shall call for a vote in favour of Mrs Niebler's amendment tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, we must pause for thought and I am most grateful to Malcolm Harbour and Nicholas Clegg, who have pointed out that they have been wondering in the meantime if the variations which they supported were the right ones and I think that is most intelligent of them. We have enough time to consider this between now and the second reading; perhaps we shall have found a common approach by then. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I tabled similar amendments in the Culture Committee. These were amendments to help to ensure that disabled users benefit equally from electronic communications. Service providers must recognise their role in facilitating access to terminal equipment for disabled users and the framework directive must include, in my opinion, access to terminal equipment and software.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 7(4)(e) says that they are keen to address the needs of specific social groups, in particular disabled people. That is meaningless without these amendments. We do not want to regulate all equipment sold on the high street but the interfaces should be regulated for vision-impaired people, for instance. The menu on television or mobile phones should have an audio alternative. It is a small change. It is not much to ask but it would affect the lives of disabled people and mean that they could be included in the electronics communications revolution instead of being excluded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – I would first like to thank the three rapporteurs, Mr Brunetta, Mr Paasilinna and Mrs Niebler. These are not just any reports. Firstly they cover three directives which will be central to the future competence of the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the amount of knowledge of technologies, markets and regulation which is needed for drawing up these reports is exceptional, so let me sincerely salute the reports for their high quality.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not able to cover, due to the time-limits, all the issues of crucial importance that I would like to. I apologise for this and will try to concentrate on the very core issues.</p>
<p class="contents">First, on the framework directive, the Commission is very pleased with the Paasilinna report, in particular as regards the consultation and transparency mechanism contained in Article 6. This is the key provision to ensure that not only national interest drives regulatory decisions but that European interest is also taken into account. After all, if we do not take into account European interest, we do not serve national interest in this business either.</p>
<p class="contents">This legislation will ensure a level playing field for operators across the single market. Its application will lead to a European regulatory culture in the telecommunications sector which will help to even out those differences in national decisions that can threaten the single market and the whole sector. I am referring here, as many here have already done, to different licensing conditions imposed by Member States for the third-generation services. The Commission is happy to support those parts of Amendment No 33 which aim at strengthening the transparency and consultation procedure and the Commission is strongly against Amendment No 78 which would weaken this procedure. However, we consider that the requirement to consult other national regulatory authorities on draft measures is necessary for the creation of the European regulatory culture.</p>
<p class="contents">The second key element is the SMP definition. It is the Commission’s view that the definition in Amendment No 56 is too wide. We are concerned that it could lead to over-regulation, which would lead to fear of over-regulation by the operators, which could in turn hamper investment. We also believe that this definition could undermine consistency of regulatory action. The Commission considers that its original proposal would better serve the fundamental objective of the whole package, which is to minimise regulation but provide regulators with flexible tools to ensure effective competition in every market segment.</p>
<p class="contents">On institutional issues, I am convinced that we must involve the European Parliament closely in the process of implementing the new framework. We must seek together the most efficient and flexible mechanisms for involving Parliament but for institutional reasons we cannot go against the agreements on comitology. Thus I regret that the Commission cannot support Amendments Nos 72 to 74.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on digital television, I will soon be inviting the market players to discuss how best to ensure that digital television systems are rolled out swiftly in Europe so that digital television becomes a viable alternative platform for Internet access. For the time being, the Commission considers that voluntary industrial standardisation is the best process, and it is not ready to support Amendment No 63.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the report of Mr Paasilinna is concerned, the Commission can accept in full Amendments Nos 4, 12, 29, 32, 34, 55, 65 and 68 and the Commission can accept in part or in principle Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 22, 25, 27, 28, 30, 31, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 45 to 48, 53, 54, 57 to 61, 66, 67, 69 and 75. The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 5, 8, 14, 16, 18, 20, 23, 24, 26, 39, 41 to 44, 49 to 52, 56, 62, 63, 64, 70 to 74 and 76 to 79.</p>
<p class="contents">On Mr Brunetta’s report on access and interconnection, I am thankful for the support for the basic principles of the directive. In competitive markets interconnection of and access to networks should, in principle, be agreed on the basis of commercial negotiations. If this does not happen regulatory intervention is warranted but we have to ensure that regulatory intervention is done on the basis of a market analysis. We have to prove first that the market is not competitive and only then impose <span class="italic">ex ante</span> regulation if necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I believe that imposing straightforward price regulation on mobile call termination or on roaming charges would be over-regulating. The Commission cannot support Amendments Nos 39 and 40. However, there is a field where all service providers have been subject to access regulation. This is the conditional access for digital television. This regime has worked well. Moving away from the regime of Directive 95/48 would require wide consultation and careful analysis. Therefore, the Commission does not support Amendment No 46.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, the Commission can accept in full Amendments Nos 7, 8, 15, 21, 29, 41, 44 and 48. The Commission can accept in part or in principle Amendments Nos 1, 6, 9, 12, 16 to 18, 19, 23, 24, 26, 28, 30 to 34, 37, 38, 42, 43, 45 and 47. The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 2 to 5, 10, 11, 13, 14, 20, 22, 25, 27, 35, 36, 39, 40, 46 and 49 to 51.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Mrs Niebler’s report on the authorisation directive, the Commission is very pleased with the support for the basic principles of its proposal. The move from individual licences to general authorisations will greatly improve market access and cut red tape. In many respects, Mrs Niebler’s report strengthens and improves the Commission’s proposals. For the key issue of usage fees for radio spectrum I welcome the elements that seek to strengthen coordination and to eliminate the possibility of unproportionate and potentially disastrous licensing conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea of annual instalments for the payment of one-off amounts is a possible solution. We will, however, have to look carefully at the exact wording. The obligation on Member States to take account of the policy objectives of the whole framework in their systems for frequency pricing is likewise welcomed. It is also one of the key objectives pursued in the Commission’s proposal for a regulatory framework for radio spectrum policy. Specifying that frequency pricing mechanisms are subject to the consultation and transparency procedure of the framework directive is also useful.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, we are happy to accept most of Amendment No 21, subject to some redrafting. However, on the matter of administrative charges the Commission cannot support Amendments Nos 7 and 20. They would delete the provision that aims to ensure that such charges will not have a discriminatory effect. Maintaining turnover as a key for dividing administrative charges seems the most appropriate way.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is willing, however, to consider some of the elements proposed in the new Amendment No 27 tabled by Mr van Velzen. To sum up, the Commission can accept in full Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 23 and 25. The Commission can also accept in part or in principle Amendments Nos 8, 11 to 14, 16, 18, 20 to 24 and 26 to 28. The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 4, 6, 7, 9, 15, 17 and 19.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to touch briefly on the situation on the telecommunications markets and licensing for third-generation services. Of course we are all worried – Europe is the world leader in mobile communications and we have to maintain this lead.</p>
<p class="contents">We know the facts. The current legislation leaves Member States the choice of licensing methods and licensing conditions. We know that it has led to a wide divergence in the sums paid for the licences. The single market is fragmented. Frequency actions which coincided with the peak of the new economy stocks led to price levels which would be unimaginable in today’s market conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">I am ready to reply positively to Mr Paasilinna’s request for a Commission report later on the licensing issue. There is uncertainty and preoccupation in the market now, but we have to remember the fact that third-generation mobile communications will offer enormous potential for totally new types of services. There will be a strong business case for it and public authorities must ensure that the right conditions are in place, and here we need to work together. We have to safeguard Europe’s lead in mobile communications. There is no magic wand but we absolutely must get the future regulatory framework right.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposals, with Parliament’s support, provide for procedures that allow for coordinated or even harmonised assignment of radio frequencies. The consultation and transparency procedure of Article 6 of the framework directive, the authorisation directive and the Commission’s proposal for a regulatory framework on radio spectrum policy provide us with the necessary instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">The new framework will also allow for secondary trading of radio spectrum which enables more flexible management of this resource. More than ever we need to work together. The European Parliament and the Commission should try to convince the Member States to take a more coordinated approach to frequency assignment.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge Parliament to debate soon the proposal for radio spectrum policy and thus send out a strong signal on the importance and the urgency of the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the proposals made by Mr van Velzen, I strongly agree with him that we need firm actions to stimulate the use of mobile Internet and take steps to keep the European lead in third-generation. We have to see that new Internet protocol version 6 will be rolled out swiftly. We have to stimulate European content production and we also need to increase the availability of public sector information for these purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to see that sufficient research funding is available for future wireless technologies as foreseen in the Commission’s proposal for the sixth Framework Programme for research and also, the other proposals which he made, I am ready to look at them and the Commission will come back to this area. Together we must guarantee that Europe’s lead in mobile communication will be safeguarded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
