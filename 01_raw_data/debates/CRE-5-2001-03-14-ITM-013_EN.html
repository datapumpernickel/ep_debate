<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Väyrynen (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FI) </span>Mr President, the European Council accepted the Union’s strategy on Ukraine in Helsinki in December 1999. Now, more than a year later, we can say that the basic premise of the strategy is the right one. The report that was adopted in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy only features certain proposals connected with the implementation of the strategy and some supplementary proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">In my report I have adopted the same general approach as Parliament did with regard to Mr Oostlander’s report as a basis for the Union’s policy on Russia. Thus the report openly criticises Ukraine for its shortcomings regarding the implementation of democracy, human rights, freedom of speech and the market economy. On the other hand, it recommends that the Union should improve cooperation to help Ukraine solve these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Ukraine, however, is very different from Russia. It has a major strategic importance both for Russia and the West. Ukraine is split internally. The western parts of the country were, for a long time, part of Poland or Austria-Hungary, and there the Russian population is relatively small. The country’s central and eastern parts have long been under the influence of Russia and many Russians live there. The Union must seek to bring about a situation where Ukraine can unify and have balanced relations with Russia, on the one hand, and the West, the European Union and NATO, on the other. Ukraine now clearly orientates itself towards Europe. We have to encourage and support the country in this.</p>
<p class="contents">I have tried in my report to place Ukraine in a wider pan-European context. My basic reason for this was the views adopted in Elmar Brok’s report on enlargement. Paragraph 56 of the report reiterates the idea of a new European area that would be based on a market economy and free trade, protection of the environment, democracy, human rights and security. Paragraph 57 calls on the Council to develop a comprehensive pan-European policy for the Union by combining the enlargement process with the bilateral and multilateral external relations of the Union. It goes on to propose that the EU should make systematic use of both the Council of Europe and the OSCE for preparing the present and future candidate countries for membership and for promoting the goals of the CFSP and integration on the pan-European level.</p>
<p class="contents">These paragraphs are, to some extent, open to interpretation. It is clear that Parliament hopes that a comprehensive pan-European policy will be created for the Union. But the new European area’s connection with the proposal that the Union should start using the Council of Europe and the OSCE as a tool of pan-European policy remains open to interpretation. My own thoughts are that creating a new European area as a separate organisation could easily come into conflict with the fora that already exist. For that reason, we should first make use of existent organisations and act without prejudice in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and, especially, the ‘shadow’ rapporteurs for their constructive attitude to the report. I would like to make one criticism, however. The committee adopted too many amendments, in my opinion. As rapporteur, I prepared a draft version which already exceeded the set length. The 21 paragraphs of the draft contained everything that was essential, in my view. In the vote on the report, however, 37 paragraphs in all were added – many of them against the recommendations of the rapporteur. I think we should consider together ways of preventing adopted reports from being made too bulky or fragmented in committees and in plenary. On this basis I am wary of amendments which would only serve to increase the report’s length. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a report which is very well worth reading.</p>
<p class="contents">My first visit to Ukraine was back in 1991, soon after independence, to attend a health conference. More recently my visits have largely centred on nuclear issues. Last week I met a group of ten members of the Rada who were in Brussels to learn of our institutional relationships. In all the contacts that I have made over the years I have been struck by the desire for closer links with the European Union. Ukraine has not found the transition to a market economy an easy process. They have yet to bring their regulatory and financial structures closer to our own. Privatisation goes ahead slowly. But we should look upon these efforts in positive terms and with understanding.</p>
<p class="contents">It is almost impossible to talk about Ukraine without reference to nuclear power. I believe I am the only Member of this Parliament who has visited Chernobyl, Khmelnitsky and Rivne, the three stations which have featured frequently in our debates. The latter are the two sites where reactors are now being completed to western safety standards. But we should recognise that Ukraine also has a coal industry and is pushing ahead to promote energy efficiency and renewable sources. Our financial support should encompass the whole sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the report of the European Investment Bank, I would include support for tourism and agriculture. The latter has plummeted in recent years and both can do much to drive the economy forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this report will be strongly supported tomorrow and that the Members of the Rada will see in its adoption an emphatic endorsement of their wish for ever-closer relations with the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The murder of the journalist Georgiy Gongadze and the subsequent demonstrations, some of which were countered with violence, highlight the inner weaknesses and democratic deficits in this country eleven years after its secession from the Soviet Union. The rapporteur, whom I should like to thank, is equally conscious of these facts and of Ukraine’s economic plight, with its high foreign debt and even higher exodus of capital, where large sections of the population live in poverty and wealth is concentrated in a few hands.</p>
<p class="contents">That this is a breeding ground for corruption and international organised crime cannot be a matter of indifference to us. Human trafficking in general and the trade in women in particular and illegal immigration have a spill-over<span class="italic"> </span>effect on the European Union and need to be effectively combated, with the help of the European Union, especially as, once Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania accede, Ukraine will form the external border of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The common strategy on Ukraine and the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with it rightly seek to consolidate democracy, the economy and society and bring Ukraine closer to the EU's system of values. What has been done so far still falls short of the mark, despite the funds which the European Union has given Ukraine. Ukraine itself has set itself the ambitious target of being ready for accession by 2007. Even if this sounds more like pie in the sky under the present circumstances, the Väyrynen report points in the right direction by finally giving Ukraine the prospect of accession and by mooting the possibility of a free trade agreement without precluding accession at a later date.</p>
<p class="contents">With the enlargement of the EU imminent, everything should also be done in the form of cross-border programmes and assistance with border management in order to avoid erecting new dividing lines in Europe. This is all the more important in that Ukraine plays a fundamental role in European security, both as a result of its commitment in ex-Yugoslavia and its involvement in the Partnership for Peace, as the Charter on a Distinctive Partnership with NATO proves.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ukraine also plays an important role in the network of relations between the EU and Russia and as a regional force for order. The Väyrynen report shows how we can help Ukraine to help itself and extend our mutual relations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am aware of my responsibility as Chairman of the Interparliamentary delegation, but I also believe that it is important for us to be critical on occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s common strategy with regard to Ukraine is the practical expression of a clear, political stance, namely that Ukraine forms an integral part of our continent, that welfare and stability in Ukraine have a substantial impact on welfare and stability in the rest of Europe, and that, for that reason, the European Union is willing to assume part of the responsibility for the democratic, economic and social development in that country. That is the good news.</p>
<p class="contents">However, let it be clear that the European Union cannot shoulder responsibility for building up the Ukrainian state and helping that country in its socio-economic development on its own, or even take the lead in doing so. With this common strategy, the European Union and its Member States have demonstrated their willingness to give the necessary technical and financial back-up, provided that the Ukrainian political leaders are willing, and have the courage, to take control of a process of far-reaching reform. That is a difficult, but not impossible task. If we are critical, we are so in the interest of Ukraine. Our demands of that country should be the government’s own.</p>
<p class="contents">Part of the EU’s responsibility is also to express our concern about the issues which relate to the fundamental human rights and civil rights in that country. This includes, among other things, the investigation into the murder of journalist Gongadze. As Delegation Chairman and co-chairman of the EU-Ukraine cooperation committee, I have already called for further investigations, also with regard to the brutal and harsh manner in which demonstrations have been broken up in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">Governments are not formed on the streets, but democracy can be killed off on the streets if the right to the freedom of speech is taken away from the population by means of violence. That is the bad news.</p>
<p class="contents">In the capacity of Chairman of the parliamentary cooperation committee, I will presently be joining my colleagues in a trip to Ukraine, in the hope that we, partly on the basis of the report which is being discussed today and adopted tomorrow, will enter into a fruitful discussion on the issues which concern us all and about which we need to be concerned as a group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, however, we need more effective cooperation with the Union for Ukraine to be able to solve its acute problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Secretary General Solana recently reminded us that Union programmes should be focused and prioritised. The committee, however, has apparently forgotten this instruction and has overburdened the report with numerous amendments, making it unreasonably bulky and fragmented. This is something the rapporteur also referred to in his speech. In the plenary we must prune these unnecessary amendments and focus on the essence of the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to ensuring that the human rights situation improves and that the rule of law takes root, the question of energy is something I would like to raise. The worst safety problem has been eradicated, since Chernobyl was finally shut down. It must be a condition of the Community’s financing of energy that proper care is taken of the environment and safety standards conform to western standards. Ukraine also needs a comprehensive energy plan to which the country’s government and leaders can commit.</p>
<p class="contents">Cooperation and an increase in trade will require extending the trans-European transport networks as far as Ukraine. At present the plans for, and implementation of, these networks stop at the Ukrainian border. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are two ways of looking at this. Either we say no, economic and trade agreements suffice, in which case the EU will only be able to make a minor contribution to stability and will be unable to apply its strict criteria. Or we give Ukraine the long-term prospect of membership and immediately start applying a comprehensive stability strategy which, first and foremost, strengthens democracy and then leads to social and economic development. But then Ukraine must not become the atomic dump of Europe! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is precisely at this moment that the country is climbing out of an economic trough in a most spectacular manner. The highly-charged battle surrounding President Kuchma’s direct involvement in the sinister murder of the<span class="bold"> </span>journalist Gongadze is threatening to thwart the undeniable reform course of the Yushchenko government.</p>
<p class="contents">This on-going scandal is also affecting the European Union. The clear report by Mr Väyrynen underlines the importance of the EU’s relations with its future neighbour, Ukraine. It is in Europe’s interest to have effective democratic rule in Kiev. And there is no sign of that yet, claims Mr Väyrynen, and rightly so. In fact, the political pandemonium surrounding the sinister Gongadze affair has widened the chasm between Ukraine and Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">What can, and should, Europe do about this depressing state of affairs? Rapporteur Väyrynen provides a realistic solution of granting European aid, as before, for actual Ukrainian reform efforts and consciously keeping the door open to full EU membership for Ukraine. This option of entry is not least intended as a necessary incentive for the country’s reformists to persevere in their vision and policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, after the Soviet empire broke up, a Polish diplomat stated that if Ukraine remains independent, Russia has a chance of becoming a normal state. This profound statement – probably a true Polish wish – is in line with the political desire of the Member States and candidate countries of the European Union. The Väyrynen report manages to illustrate this in a realistic manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is much about these plans and ambitions to which some of us might object, but one of the strengths of the European Union at its simplest is its role as a pole of attraction for countries that have not had the benefits of democracy, the rule of law and economic prosperity. The prospect of European Union affiliation or membership is a great incentive for countries that have lived under communism for many generations to put their political and economic house in order and to resolve long-standing problems with neighbouring states.</p>
<p class="contents">In the course of this present decade Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania will become European Union Member States. They border Ukraine, a country of enormous geopolitical significance, whose very existence is a major factor in the security and stability of Europe, but where recent developments are cause for concern. It is in all our interests that Ukraine should be helped in its consolidation as an independent, democratic country anchored in the west but with an open, vibrant and friendly relationship with Russia to its east. In this regard we should not forget that, in addition to its association with the European Union, Ukraine also has a strong partnership with NATO, which has contributed to the sense of security of Ukraine, as well as much-needed military reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Väyrynen should be congratulated on an excellent report, even if it is somewhat longer than he had originally intended. It is so important now for the European Union to improve the focus and implementation of its strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me touch very briefly on one very specific aspect: the issue of anti-personnel landmines. Ukraine signed the Ottawa Convention on the prohibition of the use and stockpiling of anti-personnel mines in 1999. It has yet to ratify its accession. Meanwhile, it has the fifth largest stockpile of APL in the world, with an estimated 10 million weapons. The Ottawa Convention places an obligation to destroy stocks of APL. We should expect Ukraine to take action. I hope the Commission and Council will place emphasis on this aspect in their dealings with Ukraine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following the political upheaval in central and eastern Europe, association agreements were concluded in a bid to help these countries one day become members of the European Community or Union. Ukraine was not one of them. The question of the borders of Europe, which reappeared on the agenda with the fall of the Iron Curtain, has never been seriously discussed here, and hence nor has the fate of Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the answer to the question of the borders of Europe is that Europe does not end east of Bulgaria because that is where Ukraine lies, and not just Ukraine. Europe’s borders cannot be determined unequivocally, which is why the complete enlargement of the European Union is a contradiction in terms. The current enlargement concept will inevitably bring about new divisive borders in Europe, for example between Poland and Ukraine. This is a huge problem, which is why we need a new concept. Since 1989/90, Europe has no longer been politically or geographically divided; it has become an open continent. What sort of concept do I mean? The principle of exclusivity, whereby a candidate country is either fully assimilated into the EU or is completely excluded should be replaced by the following concept: any country which thinks of itself as either partly or wholly European, such as Ukraine, should be given the opportunity to decide if, and to what extent, it is willing and able to subscribe to European policy. This would maintain the vision of the founding fathers of a free Europe in the dialectic sense and allow us to focus again on the crux of the matter, as formulated at the time, namely to create peace in freedom for all the nations of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On 7 February this year, the Swedish Presidency commented on the general situation in Ukraine and, at that time, highlighted the disappearance of the journalist, Georgiy Gongadze, whose fate touches us all.</p>
<p class="contents">Ukraine will soon be a neighbour of the EU. Mr Väyrynen's report deals with our immediate neighbours once the EU is enlarged. We can see a similar development in Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus, with increased political unrest, antidemocratic tendencies, economic recession, increasingly authoritarian regimes and reduced political pluralism. As the first Vice-Chairman of the European Parliament's delegation to these three countries, I am concerned about this development. I have had the opportunity to meet various representatives in the country, for example the young mayor, Natalia Gnatyuk, and the leader of the young people's movement of the Uniate Greek Catholic Church, Andriy Yaniv. Their message to us was: do not forget the importance of ethics and religion in our country's development.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to direct two questions to Commissioner Patten, who is doing an excellent job for the EU as regards foreign policy. Firstly, I wonder how the Tacis programme and the partnership and cooperation agreement can help to strengthen ethical and moral principles, particularly in the areas of commerce, politics and civil society – something that is necessary in a country like Ukraine. Secondly, I wonder whether, in light of the fact that both countries are developing in the same direction, it is tenable or reasonable in the long term to treat Ukraine and Belarus as differently as we are at present. Can we isolate one country, but not the other? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – This is a good report. I congratulate the rapporteur. It gives an impressive overview of the situation in Ukraine at a crucial juncture in the country's history. The current events there are of deep concern to all of us. The regrettable violence in recent days and its causes underline the present risks to the political and economic stability that are so important for Ukraine, as our common strategy makes clear. The situation is particularly worrying, given that Ukraine will share such a long border with the European Union after the first round of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Ukraine wants to draw closer to the European Union and its neighbours. We welcome that. But, for that to happen, Ukraine must be able to demonstrate its willingness and ability to live up to basic values, European values, values which are also set out in our partnership and cooperation agreement. That means strengthening the rule of law. It means making progress in the fight against corruption. It means adopting market-oriented legislation. As the report points out, Ukraine has, alas, lost a lot of time, but it is a country with a vast potential in terms of economic and human resources. With the creation of the government under President Yushchenko things have certainly improved but there is still very much to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">Several Members have referred to the Gongadze case. It has brought to the fore not just the issue of journalistic freedom but of a pluralistic society and the way executive power is exercised in Ukraine. The House will recall that in early December, shortly after the Kuchma tapes had been presented in Parliament, the European Union expressed its deep concern about the disappearance of Mr Gongadze. In January, President Prodi had a long conversation on this case with President Kuchma when they met in Berlin. I am sure Parliament will have seen the statement that the Swedish Presidency released prior to the recent ministerial troika visit to Ukraine. I was part of that troika delegation. I can assure Parliament that we made our position abundantly clear. The only way to deal with this issue is complete transparency in the short term and adequate checks and balances in the longer term.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to emphasise this evening – it should not be necessary to do so – how strongly we feel about this issue. The Swedish Presidency has included the European Union's support for the establishment of a free media in Ukraine in its working programme on the implementation of the common strategy. It will organise a seminar on independent media in Kiev. We are also ready to provide technical assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">The report rightly stresses the need to promote economic growth and trade in Ukraine, but for this the conditions must be right. Recent reports drawn up by the European Business Association, the OECD and private bodies concentrate on the overall investment climate. They make clear how far there still is to go. In Ukraine the private sector still accounts for less than a quarter of GDP. An EBRD study two years ago suggested that managers of Ukrainian enterprises spend up to 17% of their time just trying to find a way through regulatory requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">As stated in the excellent report before us, energy sector reform is absolutely crucial for economic stability and growth in Ukraine. It is also a key condition in the memorandum of understanding of 1995 on the closure of the Chernobyl nuclear plant. Together with our international partners we are following Ukraine's progress in reforming the energy sector very closely and we are providing substantial assistance in close cooperation with the Ukrainian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Gas and electricity market reform is also one of the priority projects in the TACIS Action Programme 2000. I am glad that the report finds the main focus of the TACIS Programme for the Ukraine appropriate. The report has proposed enhanced attention to certain activities. I can confirm that a number of them are indeed being incorporated into both the TACIS Indicative Programme for 2000 to 2003 and the Ukraine Action Programme 2000. This goes for projects concerning institutional, legal and administrative reform as well as assistance for private sector development, economic development, development of NGOs and civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">Addressing the social consequences of transition in the health sector and the labour market is another important part of TACIS activities. So far our cooperation has concentrated mainly on technical assistance in the area of justice and home affairs. TACIS customs and border-crossing programmes are aimed at improving both operational capacity and the efficiency of customs and border controls to curb criminal activities.</p>
<p class="contents">More explicitly directed at combating organised crime is an anti-money laundering feasibility study which supports Ukraine's efforts to establish the necessary legislation and to create a financial intelligence unit. For the future, following frequent requests from the Ukrainian side, more attention will be paid to the eastern borders of Ukraine, to control better the influx of illegal migrants who seek to enter the Union illegally. I say to the honourable gentleman who spoke last in the debate that, as far as the overall purpose of the TACIS programmes is concerned, they do, of course, have to incorporate the ethical considerations, the democratic considerations, the market-oriented considerations to which he quite properly and quite eloquently referred.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to recognise and act upon the legitimate concerns in the Ukraine regarding the possible consequences of enlargement. Overall I remain convinced that these will be largely beneficial to the Ukrainian economy but there will be problems, for example, on the movement of people between the Ukraine and its western neighbours. We need to take the time to manage these issues so that they do not become a barrier between the enlarged European Union and our Ukrainian partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Van Orden referred to the stockpile of anti-personnel landmines in Ukraine. The point he makes is entirely valid. It is one which we were recently discussing with our Canadian colleagues at the ministerial meeting between the European Union and Canada and I hope that we can make progress on that extremely important subject in the months and years ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">The work that we – the presidency, the Commission and Parliament – have done so far is evidence enough of the seriousness of our engagement in Ukraine. Despite the considerable internal problems in that country, some progress has undoubtedly been achieved. The closure of Chernobyl, for example, has marked, I hope, a turning point but we shall still be deeply involved in the follow-up.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of our political agenda we can now focus on other issues: on the rule of law, on democratic checks and balances, on stimulating trade and investment, on setting the framework for cooperation in justice and home affairs and on the relationship between Ukraine and the European Union after enlargement. This is vital work on which all the European institutions will need to concentrate in the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the honourable Member on his report. I rather sympathise with his view. I do not think that it required all the subsequent authorship to which it has been subjected but he showed a good deal of long-suffering charity in his remarks, which is also not surprising. He has written an excellent report and our relationship with the Ukraine will benefit from his wise advice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
