Already there have been 74 000 deaths and getting aid to those in need is a race against time. The Pakistan Government has put the financial cost of the earthquake at USD 5 billion. The EU has already contributed substantially, but we must do more, much more, and so should the rest of the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is not just about money; it is about access; it is about helicopters and other equipment to reach inaccessible areas. Access over the line of control between India-administered Kashmir and Pakistan-administered Kashmir is also of vital importance. I am very pleased that India and Pakistan have opened the five crossing points for goods and I hope other crossing points will be opened as well, not just for goods: civilians should also be allowed to cross. People with relatives and friends on the other side want to help. They want to bring much-needed support and relief, and at present they are unable to do so. Already, 950 Kashmiris on the Indian side and 2 000 on the Pakistani side have asked for permits. I know it is difficult because of the long-standing dispute over Kashmir, but I hope that the applications can be processed quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">This human tragedy demands a compassionate response. Let us hope that out of this terrible tragedy something good will come and that the survivors may be allowed to live in peace. I hope that, at last, a just solution to this 58-year dispute over Kashmir can be found, involving both Pakistan and India but, above all, the Kashmiri people who have suffered enough already. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I speak on their behalf, as well as that of my own Scottish constituents, who have asked me to raise their concerns about the issue of how people are being treated after the devastating earthquake.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of utmost significance that the European Parliament expresses its opinion on the Kashmir earthquake of 8 October. At the October part-session we marked this tragic event and people passed condolences both to the victims and their families. However, six weeks after this event that has destroyed the north-west region of Pakistan and India, the scale of devastation and trauma the earthquake has caused is still being realised. It is estimated that 80 000 people are dead, hundreds of thousands of people are injured and 3 million people are homeless.</p>
<p class="contents">Aid workers have many problems to overcome, including landslides, bad weather, aftershocks and generally difficult terrain. People in the most remote areas appear to be the hardest hit, with very many not having received aid at all. These problems are made worse by the onset of winter and, therefore, it is imperative to get the right type of aid to those who need it.</p>
<p class="contents">Although this is one of the most complex relief operations undertaken, it is no excuse for us not to do our utmost. The fact that most of the earthquake victims have been evacuated should be welcomed. However, snow levels are already creeping down the mountains day by day and thousands of survivors face a more perilous situation as each day becomes a struggle just to stay alive. The conditions in the temporary camps are far from encouraging and it is my understanding that the hygiene level in the refugee camps is intolerable and conditions are primitive.</p>
<p class="contents">Kofi Annan has warned us that a second massive wave of death will hit hard as disease begins to spread amongst the survivors. This is a race against time and I want to see the following action points. Firstly, although welcoming the Commission’s aid package of EUR 93.6 million, we must give more and we can do better. Official estimates state that more than USD 5 billion are needed over a period of 5 to 10 years to restore the infrastructure of the region. We need to recognise that a standard relief package is not adequate for a situation as dire as this and we need to deploy the reconstruction phase immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I strongly urge the Commission and the Council to follow the precedent following the tsunami of giving special trade concessions to assist the countries affected by natural disasters of this scale. At the very least they should implement the preferential GSP Plus scheme voted by Parliament this year to ease the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I applaud the opening of five points along the line of control on the border between Pakistan and Indian-controlled Kashmir. Perhaps some goodwill will come out of this tragedy. I call upon Member States and the Commission to ensure that we do not fail the vulnerable and traumatised. I therefore urge you to all vote in favour of this motion. People’s lives depend upon it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Rules of Procedure are as follows: when Members request to speak as author, their turn to speak depends on the order in which they arrived at Parliament’s Sessional Services. Therefore, it would seem that Mrs Lynne was quicker than Mrs Stihler, who was quicker than Mr Elles, and so on. On the other hand, we resume the usual order when speakers take the floor on behalf of their groups, with the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats speaking first, followed by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and so on. I thought I had better remind you of the Rules of Procedure because I believe I sensed a slight hesitation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was familiar with the Rules of Procedure and this procedure is, in fact, the one relating to urgent procedure, which has been dealt with in a rather special way. As for the order in which the groups take the floor, we are returning to the usual procedure, so everything is as it should be. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I want to make three comments at the opening of this debate, which I and other speakers welcome. Firstly it is one of the biggest disasters in South-East Asia. Our resolution mentions the figures, which were recalled by the previous speakers. This earthquake has killed and seriously injured more than 200 000 people. Millions of people are still left homeless, facing extreme weather conditions and all kinds of serious illnesses. More than 1.8 million people are homeless, as are about 85% of the population of Muzaffarabad, which I have visited. This is a horrifying statistic and we in Western Europe must do as much as we can to remedy this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in terms of looking at the reaction so far, I applaud the swift action by the Commission and the Member States to give immediate aid. In this troubled part of the world, we must also welcome in particular the significant efforts by the Pakistani and Indian Governments to make sure that people can make contact across a line of control that has been impassable for more than 50 years. Hopefully this can be put into practice more.</p>
<p class="contents">More importantly, and most urgently, I should like to ask the Commission about recent UN figures that indicate that so far very little of the aid that has been promised has been received. We would like to know how much of the aid offered by the European Union and the Member States has reached its destination. But maybe we can make additional efforts in the conciliation of the 2006 budget next week so we can make sure that those who are homeless today will at least have some elementary cover as the winter approaches. This will supplement those really hard-earned funds raised my constituents among others to help these people who are in serious need today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ladies and gentlemen, the border area between China, India, Pakistan and Afghanistan is one of the most earthquake-prone regions in the world. It is also the scene of one of the longest-running conflicts in South Asia. The border in the region is not yet properly demarcated or secured by means of bilateral or multilateral agreements. Armed conflict still smoulders under the surface. In the Pakistan-controlled area, which is virtually inaccessible, several million people have lost their homes and in some cases there is a complete lack not only of food and medicine, but also of any kind of contact with the outside world. We therefore call on all countries and organisations to help the victims. In the resolution before us, we naturally support the complete opening up of cross-border routes, including the reinstated bus link with India. It is certainly a positive development that further bus links connecting people on either side of the border in Punjab are at the planning stage, and further talks on rail links and the prospect of agreement on the joint construction of a gas pipeline in the region are developments that we naturally welcome. These measures will help to build up trust between opposing factions.</p>
<p class="contents">Still on the theme of assistance to those affected by the earthquake, the aim is to provide help as quickly as possible to those who need it. Indeed, solidarity between the peoples of this divided region can help smooth the path towards solving age-old conflicts. The urgent call for local organisations to distribute assistance fairly is entirely justified. At the same time, the Commission and EU Member State governments must be called upon to speed up the assistance provided to the victims. The needs are well known and we are all aware, particularly with the onset of winter, that the saying ‘he who gives quickly gives twice’ applies more than ever before. I wish to thank all of you, ladies and gentlemen, for supporting this resolution. I believe that the issue of peaceful conflict resolution in this part of the world is one to which we shall be returning and that the Commission will soon submit to us a report on the measures that have been taken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Kashmir is one of these cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the earthquake that occurred in October, which caused the deaths of between 70 000 and 90 000 people and made seven million people homeless, we must respond in an immediate, urgent fashion. That is the appeal we are clearly making and which must be addressed to the European Union, to the Council and to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We can only stress our condolences and guarantee that we are fully committed to providing this aid. At the same time, however, we must not be content solely with the emergency action. We must tackle the more structural aspects and, in this regard as well, the European Union must commit itself to supporting the reform and resolving the structural problems that require a response, not just in terms of infrastructure, but also from a socio-economic point of view, so that, when similar events occur, the consequences are not as serious as those we are seeing at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore insist to the governments of the countries affected that this would be a good opportunity to prioritise social and internal needs, to stop spending so much on military aspects and dedicate — and this is where we must support them — all their efforts towards ensuring that the best possible structures are in place and reducing the effects of earthquakes of this kind as far as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reason I say this is because it relates to urgent crisis intervention, which in my opinion is an area where the European Union should and can take successful action. No one argues with the need for such interventions, and we can achieve our goals in this respect using existing methodological, financial and logistical resources. I have therefore been delighted to hear the comments made by all the previous speakers, including those by the Member who had visited Kashmir herself. The fact that this debate is taking place a matter of weeks after the tragedy is also to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the people affected by this disaster deserve our urgent help. There can be no question that they are much more deserving than those regions and countries that recently suffered riots, and I refer to one country in particular. Even though these riots were a result of the countries’ own policies, we have heard that the EU wishes to come to their aid too.</p>

What this headline shows is that it is the people, God help them, who suffer when political tensions are in play, even in this extremely dire situation.</p>
<p class="contents">When Germans think of the artificial division of countries, they unfailingly think of Berlin. I myself have seen places in the heart of Berlin where people drowned in canals because nobody on the wall could help them, or was allowed to. What that means is that people had to refrain from doing something perfectly rational – that is, saving a person from drowning – because, at that time, the Iron Curtain was in place and political considerations prevented them from doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">That sort of thing gives you a feel for what is going on in Kashmir. Let us not lose sight of the fact that this earthquake is already a terrible human catastrophe, but a winter is looming in which there will be mass mortality among the civilian population unless the powers-that-be on both sides at last get the better of their inability – which is to some extent their unwillingness – to cooperate and help one another, and unless aid gets to where it is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Kashmir is a victim of India’s refusal, at the time of its own foundation, to accept the country’s right of self-determination. There are now problems with Pakistan as well. The conclusion we should draw from this is that Kashmir is not merely a bilateral problem involving these two states, but also, and primarily, a problem for the Kashmiri people, and hence also for us. Not only should we carry on dialogue with both the powers there – important though they are as nuclear powers and major states – but we should also step up direct contact with the Kashmiri people and their representatives, particularly those on the local level, which is what this humanitarian catastrophe offers us an opportunity to do.</p>
<p class="contents">First, we must help these people in a way that owes nothing to ideology; then we must work towards a solution for the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Eighty–eight thousand people are missing, and over 245 million have been hard hit by the aftermath of this disaster. Even today, it is still hard to obtain an exact estimate of material losses, but it is safe to say that they are on an unprecedented scale. The UN has called on the international community to provide urgent financial assistance to the tune of USD 500 million, but the countries affected by the disaster have received only 20% of the anticipated figure, even though over one month has passed since the earthquake took place.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the region of Kashmir has long been a source of conflict between India and Pakistan, last year the two countries embarked on constructive dialogue with a view to ending this conflict. Following the natural disaster, they also decided to set up special crossing points along the Line of Control to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to victims in Kashmir. At present, however, only goods are permitted to pass through these crossing points, and not people. This makes it a great deal harder to distribute aid. Worse still, the mountainous nature of the region, as well as the devastated infrastructure and the lack of access roads, cause further delays in aid distribution.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has a moral obligation to urge Pakistan and India to agree to allow citizens of both countries, and not only humanitarian aid resources, to pass through the crossing points. This would make it possible for the assistance of the international community to reach those who need it most. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The earthquake which devastated the area came on the back of decades of political violence, and now winter is upon them, when the infrastructure and reserves remain so fragile.</p>
<p class="contents">This House is no stranger to the Kashmir issue. Our delegation some time ago reached out to investigate a long-term political solution. It has to be acknowledged that local political progress was rather slower. Let us please hope that the earthquake can focus minds on cooperation and dialogue. Across my country, Scotland, we have seen Scots Asians reach out to their friends and relatives in Kashmir. We have seen fund-raising, donations and practical assistance. Their generosity of spirit sets us a challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now over to the politicians, and we in this House and the Commission can play our part in urgently coordinating aid, and in the long term, in helping find a viable political solution, because if there is not a political solution what other solution could there possibly be?</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps there are some positive signs. Yesterday the opening of a fifth crossing across the line of control might be the start of a process that will lead to a peaceful solution. The immediate problems of the region are desperate, but as this resolution indicates, we stand ready as we must to help participate in a very long-term rebuilding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Earthquakes know no borders, however, and the recent disaster affected both India and Pakistan, uniting them in misfortune. The scale of the tragedy can be gauged from the fact that it claimed the lives of an entire generation. The majority of its victims were children and young people, and virtually no schools have remained standing.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has a moral and political obligation to provide charitable assistance and to help reconstruct the region in the future. The USD 20 million donated by the World Bank, and the EU’s donation of less than EUR 4 million, represent only short-term aid for the victims of the disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">Thought should also be given to the more distant future, since the effects of this disaster will be felt for the next few decades. Our debate on this issue should act as a reference point for the Commission and the Council. I should like to conclude with one final observation. According to my calculations, the EU’s financial aid for the victims of the tragedy in Kashmir amounts to 16 times less than the aid that is to be granted to France following the riots there. I have to say that I find this truly absurd. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The devastation caused by the earthquake is hard to comprehend, even after seeing repeated pictures of the suffering on our media screens and newspapers. The last 12 months has seen so many tragedies and natural disasters that have hit parts of the world: tsunamis, drought, mudslides, floods, repeated hurricanes, typhoons and now an earthquake. It is difficult to keep a focus and priority on the need for generosity and rapid relief, as we almost become conditioned to natural disaster after natural disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">In the immediate term, the need to assemble aid and coordinate its distribution is fundamental, particularly in inaccessible parts of the disaster zones. Tens of thousands are still without shelter in inaccessible parts of Pakistan and Kashmir, and the freezing temperatures of winter are approaching. The politics of this region must be put aside in an effort to save lives, and this motion welcomes the coordination and opening of new routes between India-controlled Kashmir and the Pakistan side.</p>
<p class="contents">We fully support an immediate and generous response to the call by the UN for donors to contribute more than half a billion dollars in emergency aid, much of which has not materialised yet.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the Commission will be able to make further funds available during budgetary discussions next week. Related to this motion, I believe the EU needs to show some initiative in encouraging the international community to plan for and prepare for natural disasters in the future. The reality is that natural disasters in many cases are predictable. We know the likely areas where hurricanes will strike next year and where earthquakes may strike, and we need to concentrate on building regional capacity in those regions rather than the kind of dramatic aid efforts that we are now involved in. So we need longer-term and future planning as well as the immediate aid requirements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, within hours of this devastating earthquake the first funding was made available, and field teams were despatched. EUR 13.6 million had been allocated within a few days. The first tranche was made available within a few hours of the disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commission humanitarian funds for 2005 were depleted, the Commission, through the ECHO and Relex departments, requested EUR 30 million from the reserve of the Commission budget for humanitarian aid, and EUR 10 million for reconstruction. We very much appreciate Parliament’s cooperation in releasing these additional funds. As a result, the Commission has been able to provide an overall financial package, as already mentioned, of EUR 93.6 million in response to the crisis, of which EUR 43.6 million will go to humanitarian relief, and EUR 50 million to rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="contents">The funding to date is mainly for shelter, health – including the Red Cross field hospital at Muzaffarabad – water and sanitation, coordination, and logistics, including 11 helicopters, as was mentioned earlier today.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner is today leaving for Pakistan where over the next two days she will take part in the Reconstruction Conference, along with United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and other major international donors.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall share with you some of our main concerns today. The Commission is fully aware that the location and scale of this disaster makes it very difficult for all humanitarian organisations to deploy rapidly and deliver aid to the victims. An additional constraint on meeting needs and allocating the funds available has been the implementing capacity of the aid agencies. There must be a rapid improvement, especially in reaching out beyond the main hubs.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with you that coordination is very important. Part of the role of the rapidly deployed ECHO field teams is to ensure or has been to ensure coordination. In addition, ECHO is also allocating funds to the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for their coordination role, including civil and military coordination of the use of military logistic support.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the issue of special trade measures, which was raised by one of the honourable Members of this House, we are determined to take Pakistan’s trade interests into account within the confines of our international obligations. Pakistan will benefit from the new GSP from January 2006. For the first time in 10 years, all Pakistan’s exports will be covered. This means that Pakistan is getting identical treatment to the tsunami-affected countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Commission are very concerned at the prospect of a secondary humanitarian disaster as winter approaches. That is your concern as well, as thousands of injured people remain stranded in isolated mountain areas without food, shelter or sanitation. A sustained wide-scale relief action throughout the winter period is therefore to be expected. It is a must for all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this, let me inform you that the Commission, through the ECHO DG, has just received a further EUR 30 million from the emergency reserve. I want to thank you for your support in these joint efforts to help those who are in need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
