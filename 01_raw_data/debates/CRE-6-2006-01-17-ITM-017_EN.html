<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jules Maaten (ALDE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, in the past few days and in fact, in general, during the discussion of this directive, the question of whether it is really necessary to prescribe standards for bathing water at European level has been put to me on a regular basis. Is this not a classic example of a matter that could be dealt with at Member State level? I am aware of the fact that Members belonging to the Dutch Social Democrats, who are sadly not here at the moment, even referred to it in a report as a disgraceful directive for swimming pool water. Well, it is not a directive for swimming pools, let alone a directive for bath water. It deals, of course, with coastal waters and lakes.</p>
<p class="contents">The question has been raised as to whether European action in this field adds any value. Parliament did not have any doubts about this when the House debated this very point at first reading. What is more important though, is that the Member States, and especially the Member States, felt that a directive was needed. If that is what they want, that is what they should get, but I do believe that it should be a serious directive rather than one that allows for more exceptions than anything else.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, after more than 12 years of discussion, a compromise has been struck – albeit with difficulty – between the Council and Parliament, which I assume will be translated into legislation tomorrow. The new directive provides for cleaner bathing water along beaches and lakes in Europe, better information for bathers and less red tape for local authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Across the whole of the European Union, more than 80% of bathing water locations already meet the stricter standards and in a number of Member States, even more than 90% of the swimming locations comply with them. At present, some 12% of bathers annually suffer from nausea, from stomach infections, rashes, tightness of the chest or eye or ear infections. The effect of the new directive is to tighten up health standards, as a result of which only 8% of bathers are expected to contract an illness.</p>
<p class="contents">From 2015, bathers will also be informed of the current bathing water quality at their bathing locations by means of symbols that will be identical across Europe. At the moment, bathers can only access the quality that pertains to the previous year with some difficulty and only on the Internet. What appeals to me is that before long, I will be able to see for myself what the quality of the water is on the spot, because I do not know about you, but I only take my laptop to the beach on very rare occasions. Instead of 19 parameters, Member States will only need to measure 2 parameters, and that is an example of how the red tape will be cut when water is measured.</p>
<p class="contents">For a long time, the European Parliament and the governments were at loggerheads over the question of how strict the standards should be and how high the associated costs for the Member States. We have reached a compromise that is satisfactory for all parties, and I think that in this respect, whilst the British Presidency deserves a compliment, it is the Commission – and you, Commissioner, in particular – who have been instrumental in bringing this compromise about. I should also like to thank many of the shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Bathing water will not only be cleaner, it will be <span class="italic">much</span> cleaner, the costs will be manageable and deregulation is underway. In conclusion, I am interested to hear what comments the Commission will have to make on the article that is soon to appear in the scientific magazine ‘Environmental Health Perspectives’, written by Mr Albrecht Wiedenmann and which carries the rather complex English title ‘Concentration responsive effects with no observed adverse effect levels’, abbreviated to NOAELS.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot quite describe the term myself, but I am sure that you can. I am at any rate interested to see if the Commission will also use this study in its 2008 assessment report, because it contains quite a few terse comments about the directive as we are about to adopt it. I would add, though, time for incorporating it is rapidly running out. I will be delighted when the directive will actually be adopted tomorrow. I think it is a success for all of us, including myself, even though I am not exactly a keen swimmer. I only go in if I have no other choice. After 2015, I will be at least happier to take a dip. I hope, Commissioner, that I will be able to do so without any concerns in your Member State too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to thank the delegation of the European Parliament which took part in the conciliation meeting with the Council on 12 October 2005, and vice-president Mr Trakatellis and the rapporteur Mr Maaten in particular, and to congratulate them on their outstanding work and on the result achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Discussions in the Conciliation Committee were complicated. However, at least, as far as the vital question of introducing ambitious standards for the classification category of adequate quality is concerned, I consider that Parliament achieved noteworthy results and a significant improvement in comparison with the Council's original position.</p>
<p class="contents">The quality standards may not ultimately be as strict as certain would have wished – and indeed the minimum quality standards are not as strict as those which the Commission had originally proposed. Nonetheless, they were strengthened considerably during discussions in the Conciliation Committee, with the result that the final text is a considerable improvement over the provisions which apply today and which date from the time when the directive was issued in 1975 and, as such, have been overtaken by modern scientific data.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission supports the conciliation text with particular satisfaction and, as such, I would like to hope that Parliament will ratify the positive result achieved by its negotiating team.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, this evening, we are closing the debate on two very important directives, which no doubt will improve the environment and protect the health of European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To be frank, I was a little disappointed in the Commission when it gave its opinion on the Council common position. I should really have liked to see more support for a tougher, more sharply defined line on bathing water quality as, after all, we have considerably watered down the standards to which the Commissioner referred. With the support of the Commission, we could have put together a tougher directive, one that obliged Member States to introduce higher standards without the States being faced with the heavy spending that is so often talked about.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that the main problem today as regards the pollution of bathing water is not localised pollution, but diffuse sources of pollution – agricultural sources in particular, of course. We could have achieved a substantial improvement on this issue with a relatively small amount of money. Yet we have reached a compromise, and one should stand by compromises; which is why I would appeal for the adoption of the proposal for a directive in Parliament tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">We have, however, taken a step in the right direction. I am now pinning my hopes on 2008, when the Commission is due to review the directive and assess the situation prevailing by then. May I, then, anticipate this by asking the Commissioner, who is of course a keen swimmer, to make sure that his services carry out this assessment accordingly and perhaps after all raise the health standards to OECD levels, on which all States have in fact agreed, so that we do not find ourselves attempting to level down the health standards in this field. Bathing water undoubtedly has a strong ally in the Commissioner.</p>

We have had extensive debates both in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and later in the Conciliation Committee. It was not easy to make clear that we cannot apply the same criteria to inland and coastal waters and lakes – such as Lake Balaton in Hungary – as we apply to the Atlantic Ocean. That does not mean that we do not want to have strict rules as regards our inland waterways. However, lakes and oceans are obviously different.</p>
<p class="contents">Landlocked countries such as Hungary and Austria should have a right to their own bathing water as well. The area around Hungary’s bathing lakes is subject to a ban on certain industrial and agricultural activities, and the sewage system covers almost 100% of households. We can improve many things, but we cannot turn a lake into an ocean.</p>
<p class="contents">The present compromise is acceptable to us but means a lot of work for my country: some beaches will be closed and many others should be improved, but that is the cost of a clean and healthy environment. The compromise on a stricter version of the category ‘sufficient’ is to be welcomed. Public information on water quality at bathing sites is also very important. Indeed, on all beaches around Lake Balaton there are huge information signs written in Hungarian, English, German and Russian. Of course, we could add French, hoping that more tourists will come from France and other French-speaking countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In my last speech, at second reading, I had a rather tough tone, due to the one-minute limit and the speed of a heavy debate. Now I should like to thank Mr Maaten for his report and readiness for constructive compromise. He did a good job.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, when I welcome him to Hungary, that he will be able to see how clean and sweet our Lake Balaton is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The diseases acquired in this way range widely in severity. Most are clinically benign to moderate, but some are serious and a few are fatal. As expected, children, the elderly and the immunosuppressed are the most vulnerable. It is thus imperative for the legislative bodies of the EU to be greatly concerned with the quality of bathing waters.</p>
<p class="contents">They have indeed been working on this issue for many years, and one would expect the parameters used to monitor the quality of bathing water to be as strict as possible. Unfortunately this is not quite the case, and the reason for that is simple. It is that vast amounts of money are involved in the recreational and tourist industries associated with bathing waters, and if an area is pronounced to be of low bathing water quality then this has a serious economic impact on that region and that country. So the doctor’s opinion is no longer paramount, and ‘political compromises’ are the order of the day. Thus it is that after many years of talking, discussion and arguing – mainly about things that, if seen purely from a common sense point of view, are crystal clear – we end up in a conciliatory position in which we reduce the possible economic damage to countries with unhygienic bathing waters and increase the collateral risk of causing ill health among our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Many colleagues will disagree strongly with what I say, but how else can it be explained when, for example, we have invented a distinction, as far as health risks are concerned, between inland and coastal bathing waters, and we are prepared to accept that inland waters can be almost twice as unhealthy as coastal waters yet still be of sufficient quality for bathing in. And how else can it be explained when we are prepared to label bathing waters as being of good quality when the risk of falling ill after swimming in them is of the order of 5% – i.e. 1 in 20 swimmers. Although I will support this directive, it does not go far enough to make our bathing waters really safe. It just makes them less hazardous.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, many thanks are due to everyone who has worked so hard to produce this directive, and especially to my colleague Mr Maaten – although he is not a swimmer he has still worked extremely hard – to the Commission and, of course, to the members of the Conciliation Committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why my group will be abstaining in tomorrow’s vote.</p>
<p class="contents">With that abstention, we intend to indicate the following. First, that the values agreed on fresh water protection are completely unclear: the parameters have been so tampered with by statistical changes that the degree of protection they will provide is extremely dubious. According to the peer-reviewed article about to appear in the scientific journal <span class="italic">Environmental Health Perspectives</span>, which was mentioned by Mr Maaten, these values will bring no improvement for the quality of fresh water at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the real opportunity we had to extend this directive to cover recreational uses has been completely lost in the compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, after a strong fight for higher standards, Parliament’s delegation suddenly dropped all of its demands after the Council offered a minimal increase of one of the two standards of the sufficient category.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the process by which this final agreement was reached was highly unsatisfactory, with last-minute technical proposals being introduced – verbally, not in writing – and with no time to properly study their implications.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a disappointing result, but, in spite of that, I should like to thank everyone involved. I appreciate that it is not an easy business, but we will be abstaining tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I can inform you that I will agree to the result of the conciliation, even though I am not entirely satisfied with it. The category ‘acceptable’ that has been created is nothing but an excuse for covering up the fact that the standards have not been seriously firmed up. Moreover, the division that has been created between salt and fresh water is based on very limited information, and all of this means that the protection of bathers has improved far less than it might have done.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to draw the attention of the Commission and the Council to the article that Mr Maaten mentioned, which will be published next month. In that article, the standards are set out as to what we need in order to really protect bathers.

<p class="contents">In my region of Northern Ireland there are many beautiful beaches, several of which proudly boast blue flag status. We have others yet to attain that accolade. I trust that this directive will assist in their achievement of that status. Equally relevant is compliance with the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. This has been easier for countries eligible for cohesion funding, which makes available grants precisely for such projects. However, regions like mine, which have not and still do not qualify for cohesion funding, have greater difficulty in bringing their water treatment infrastructure up to acceptable standards. Extra national funding is, therefore, the only resort and has to be found. It is important to realise that the Bathing Water Directive should be considered in that wider context. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This demonstrates how effective European Union policy can be, because, from the outset, local councils, local authorities and the States began to work to improve the condition of beaches and bathing waters, both inland and on the coast.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is important to stress – whenever I am teaching in the future, I shall explain this to my students – that this is a genuine example of the extent to which environmental policy is an added value for the economic system, for the wellbeing of the citizens and also in terms of increased land values.</p>
<p class="contents">A beach with clean water is a welcoming and high-quality tourist area. If it is not clean, we know that the public will not go and will become increasingly conditioned. This is the result of a policy of cooperation and of a mutual effort. I therefore believe it to be satisfactory and furthermore the introduction of the category of ‘sufficient’ for water seems to me to be very realistic, because we must remain within the bounds of reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Ensuring that waters are clean costs an enormous amount of money and takes an enormous amount of management effort, many sanctions for dumping along river banks and an integrated policy. We politicians must be aware that that effort comes from the citizens’ pockets and from a very significant scientific policy for controlling dumping, and that it is not easy to achieve all of this. I am therefore pleased and I would point out that this demonstrates the extent to which the quality of the environment adds value to the economic system, to industries and also to social welfare. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to confine myself to a few of the medical aspects of the directive. Bathing water is not free from germs, but low in germs. In principle, bathing water should be of drinking-water quality, as many bathers and swimmers do end up drinking it. In southern Germany, for example, we have one of the largest drinking-water reservoirs in the whole of Europe in the shape of Lake Constance. It must be mentioned, however, that even drinking water is not completely free from germs, but only low in germs, and that many germs – albeit of varying pathogenicity – are present throughout our daily lives.</p>
<p class="contents">The degree of protection we have now achieved with this directive is not perfect, of course, but is an initial step in the right direction. After all, the limit values of 330 intestinal enterococchi for inland waters and 185 for coastal waters that have now been agreed – for the ‘sufficient’ category – represent a reduction in health risk to bathers from 12% to 8%, and ‘health risk’ does not necessarily mean illness. The same goes for <span class="italic">E. coli</span> bacteria, with counts of 900 and 500 for the ‘sufficient’ and ‘excellent quality’ categories, respectively. In my view, standardised laboratory methods should be as much a matter of course as uniform sampling quality. The main concern as far as I am concerned should be that the public be informed sufficiently and in good time and that the ‘excellent quality’ designation be achieved in all our waters.</p>
<p class="contents">A further aim – subject to strict scientific provisos at first – must be to control the viral load of the waters. This is progressively gaining in importance: there has been a rapid increase in the number of people falling ill in Europe as a result of enteroviruses and noroviruses. If only for this reason, we can expect a further revision of the directive in the not-too-distant future. I support the directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For my electoral district, which directly adjoins Lake Constance, the Bathing Water Directive represents a difficult balancing act between protection of consumers – bathers – on the one hand, and nature conservation and tourism on the other. The compromise we have reached on pollution requirements and quality standards in the ‘sufficient’ category, as Mr Ulmer put it, is a fair compromise between all the three interests that meet there. For this reason, I have found that this compromise has met with a great deal of acceptance back home, for which I am much obliged to all the MEPs concerned, the rapporteur included.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to point out, however, that, by reducing the number of categories of polluter from 19 to just 2, we have found a solution that also serves the objectives of better lawmaking and less-bureaucratic regulation. This is a good example to demonstrate that we are all at pains to cut down the excessively numerous regulations that were commonplace in the past to the really important aspects, and for this, too, I am very much obliged to everyone involved.</p>
<p class="contents">In the view of my group, the scope of the directive as a whole is very satisfactory. It is also to be welcomed that Parliament did not keep to its original intention of extending the scope of the Bathing Water Directive to other water-related leisure activities, too, and for this I am obliged to all the MEPs concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
