<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Garosci </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (IT)</span> Mr President, I am pleased that Mr Van Miert has called for a human and social interpretation even of fiscal and economic problems. This House will undoubtedly provide the assistance he is seeking. Besides, the matter under discussion this evening, concerning value added tax, is of no small consequence for the harmonisation which we are seeking at this very time in launching the single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's document contains two closely related proposals, both aiming to improve the common VAT system. The present lack of uniformity in this system directly results in the fragmentation of what should be a single market, or rather an internal market, as we prefer to call it.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that it is impossible to know about all the VAT provisions in force in the other Member States means that taxpayers have to operate in a situation of legal uncertainty, which provides those who know how to exploit it with the opportunity of creating a competitive advantage, which in effect constitutes a distortion of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to stress that these proposals are merely provisional, pending the entry into force of the definitive rules governing the common VAT system based – as we all know – on the principle of a single place of taxation and deduction.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission takes the view that at present the best way to simplify significantly the common VAT system is to authorise taxable persons to deduct the VAT paid in another Member State in the periodic VAT declaration submitted in the state of residence. This proposal requires an amendment to Article 17 of the sixth VAT directive introducing a regulation governing relations between Member States as regards compensation and VAT refunds and revoking the special VAT refund procedure described in the eighth VAT directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The effects of this proposal for taxable persons residing in the Community are that, if the taxable person is identified for VAT purposes in a single Member State, the VAT is deducted there, irrespective of the Member State in which he incurred the VAT‐bearing expenditure. If the taxable person is identified for VAT purposes in several Member States, then if he is identified in the Member State in which he has incurred the VAT‐bearing expenditure, the VAT is deducted in that state. If the taxable person is not identified in the Member State in which he has incurred the VAT‐bearing expenditure, the VAT is deducted in the Member State where he supplies goods or services for which the expenditure is used. Hence, the amount of VAT eligible for deduction will be determined in accordance with the rules of the Member State of residence, rather than of the Member State which collected the tax.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal introduces a derogation from the eighth VAT directive by establishing that the Member State of purchase will be responsible for verifying that the VAT has actually been paid, whilst the Member State of deduction will be responsible for monitoring the actual deduction of the tax.</p>
<p class="contents">The second part of the Commission proposal concerns expenditure which is not eligible for full deduction of VAT. This is expenditure which, even when incurred as part of the normal running of a business, is often intended to meet private needs too, because it has the characteristics of final consumption. At present, most Member States exclude or limit the right to deduct by simplifying the administrative procedures and limiting the opportunities for tax fraud. Only three Member States – Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands – guarantee the right to full deduction, the only exception of course being expenditure which has no business element.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is proposing harmonisation of the different national rules, whilst leaving the individual Member States a margin for discretion. As regards expenditure relating to passenger cars, generally speaking the normal deduction rules apply. The only exception provided for is if it becomes difficult to ascertain the non‐business use of the vehicle, in which case the Member State is entitled to limit the deduction to a maximum of 50 % of the total VAT applied, thereby obviating the need to monitor whether a vehicle is actually used for business purposes or not. If the percentage of business use is not as high as the percentage of the ceiling for deductible VAT, the deduction is made according to the normal rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, so‐called ‘business tourism' – conventions, congresses, business travel and so on – accounts for approximately 20 % of the total turnover of the tourism sector and plays an increasingly substantial role in it. The business sector is of both economic and social importance, and makes tourist activities and resorts less dependent on holiday seasons. In other words, the choice of a seaside, mountain, lake or other location for a business congress outside the tourist season enables such locations to be revitalised even in the off season or low season.</p>
<p class="contents">The national legislation of only eight countries out of the 15 allows use of the option provided for in the Sixth Directive No 388 of 1997. It would therefore be logical to make VAT deductions the same in all the Member States with regard to hotel and restaurant expenditure. Finally, the Commission considers that expenditure on luxuries, amusements or entertainment should be totally excluded from the right to deduction.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we and the Commission should be guided by this logic, given that a single currency ought to dovetail with a single fiscal, taxation and banking system. That is true harmonisation.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Randzio‐Plath </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly commend the way in which the Commission has used this proposal for a directive to simplify significantly the procedures governing the right to deduct value added tax. This will assist the further harmonisation of VAT in the Union. In future, taxable persons registered in one country only for the purposes of value added tax will quite rightly be entitled to enter the deduction directly on the periodic tax returns which they complete in their country of residence.</p>
<p class="contents">The actual place of supply of the services to which the expenditure relates is not the key element here. The level of the deduction depends, as one would expect, on the rules applicable in the Member State of residence. If, however, a company is identified for VAT purposes in several countries, and has outgoings in one of them, the right to deduct value added tax will also be granted in the country of purchase. Where the company has no VAT registration number in the Member State in which the expenditure is incurred, the deciding factor will be the place where the services to which the expenditure relates were supplied, bearing in mind that the deduction is linked to that expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">Henceforth, value added tax will no longer be deductible solely in the Member State in which turnover is taxed. Businesses and tax administrations alike are set to gain from this new situation. The current reimbursement procedure under the eighth VAT directive is far too complicated and bureaucratic. It has meant that companies were generally obliged to hire local tax consultants and endure a long wait for refunds. Every application outside the framework of the standard tax return has to be considered individually at the moment; this takes up the tax authorities" time and creates additional red tape.</p>
<p class="contents">Against such a backdrop, the bilateral approach to debt compensation and refunds envisaged in this proposal certainly promises to be more efficient. Member State ‘A" notifies Member State ‘B" of the amounts it has deducted over the previous six months. The two states then work out what they owe one another; there is no need for a costly and time‐consuming clearing procedure. The multi‐phase monitoring system ensures that tax administrations are not called upon to take an immediate and final decision on deductibility. The first stage corresponds to the assessment performed by the Member State granting the VAT deduction. This state electronically informs the state in which the expenditure was incurred of the amount of turnover for which a deduction was allowed pursuant to Article 17(3)(a). Provision is rightly made for eventual irregularities to be reported; the Member State uncovering a problem must notify its counterpart within three months of having obtained the relevant information. The authorities which granted the deduction will then check whether this was legitimately obtained.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome harmonisation of the rules governing deductions for expenditure of a dual business and private nature – on company cars or business trips, for example. There are currently many different yardsticks used in assessing borderline cases – witness all the various provisions in national law and the different ways in which they are interpreted nationally by the tax authorities. A single market cannot afford these variables; too often the result is that the tax due is not paid. In future, outgoings on cars will be covered by the standard rules, which is right and proper. I also think it wise that Member States should be allowed to limit the deduction to a maximum of 50 % of the tax applied. Where problems arise with establishing levels of private use, this ceiling will be calculated on the basis of maximum estimated business use.</p>
<p class="contents">The other solutions envisaged succeed in addressing the problems. With business travel in particular, it is certainly the case that action is required on the flat‐rate deduction of 50 % in respect of accommodation costs.</p>
<p class="contents">While it is to be welcomed that this proposal for a directive remedies some of the shortcomings of the transitional system, I would not wish that fact to be used as a pretext for shelving the idea of a definitive new regime. The Union needs uniform arrangements in terms of structures, definitions, procedures and monitoring. The country of origin principle must become the basis for taxing turnover everywhere; we also need a single clearing procedure. This is essential, given the differing interests of the various Member States. The dawning of the age of economic and monetary union does not necessarily demand total tax harmonisation, but VAT is one charge that can be dealt with in a uniform fashion. As we speak, untaxed goods are circulating through the commercial channels, effectively depriving the EU exchequer of over 700 billion euros. That is too high a price to pay.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Secchi </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, I wish to begin by expressing my support for this proposal and congratulating the rapporteur, whose arguments I fully endorse.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like briefly to explore three points. Firstly, I believe that – as has already been said – this proposal has the great merit of helping to simplify the VAT system by allowing the right of deduction in the country of residence in certain cases. In one sense, therefore, over and above the advantages already highlighted, it also represents something of a bridge towards the definitive system.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would take up the rapporteur's point concerning the right of deduction and the need – especially in certain areas – to harmonise the different Member States' systems. I too would emphasise the fact that business tourism is penalised in Italy – but not only there – from this point of view. Such tourism is clearly at a disadvantage, in that the existing rules are not only incompatible with the elaboration of a broadly harmonised, definitive VAT system in Europe, but they are also unable to compensate for the serious distortions currently burdening a sector which can provide a large number of jobs, to the benefit of local economies adversely affected by seasonal factors.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point ties in with what I have just said, namely the need to step up our efforts to make the VAT system more compatible with the aims of job growth and economic development. Because time is short, I would merely draw attention to the fact that the proposal to introduce on an experimental basis a reduced rate of VAT for non‐commercial activities – ones unlikely to distort competition but likely to boost employment – has faded away. Quite frankly, I find it increasingly difficult to understand the inactivity in this area.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gallagher </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Mr President, at the outset I should like to congratulate Mr Garosci on the preparation and indeed on the presentation of his report. We live in an internal market operating within the Union, with the free movement of goods, services and capital across the territories of the 15 Member States, covering a population of nearly 250 million people. There is no common VAT system operating within the Union at this time and this lack of uniformity at this time has led to the fragmentation of the working of the single market across the 15 different fiscal areas. The fact that it is impossible to know all about the VAT provisions in force in other Member States of the Union means that taxpayers have to operate in a situation of legal uncertainty as well as having to work with different bureaucratic structures.</p>
<p class="contents">VAT is one of the areas covered by the second phase of the SLIM initiative, in which the Commission has shown considerable interest. In particular, SLIM has identified the need to bring in more simple VAT refund procedures, which would assist businesses across the Union in the payment of refunds for the sale of goods and the provision of services. This is to be welcomed. As part of the ongoing work to improve the common VAT system the European Commission has put forward proposals concerning the rate for deducting VAT costs that have been incurred, seeking to change the current system by which traders have to go through exceedingly complex and costly procedures to ask for a refund from the tax authorities in the Member States in which the VAT was incurred. This will be replaced with the simpler system under which companies can use their regular VAT returns to deduct VAT incurred in another Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">I support measures which help businesses to prosper and operate more effectively within the territories of the Union. The European Union must introduce fair and definite rules governing a common VAT system based on the principle of a single place of taxation and deduction.</p>
<p class="contents">Any proposal to simplify the tax procedures does not necessarily mean harmonisation of taxes. To simplify tax procedures is indeed to be welcomed.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hautala </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(FI)</span> Mr President, my group also supports the Commission"s proposals for simplifying the VAT system among the fifteen Member States. But as far as deducting VAT is concerned, we actually think the Commission"s proposal is more sensible than what the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy is proposing. We believe we have to distinguish between business travel and private travel and recognise that travel is very often dual‐natured. So we support the Commission"s proposal that there has to be a limit to any deduction, for example 15 %. The hotel and catering sector has obviously appealed to the parliamentary groups that business travel hotel and restaurant expenses should be deductible in full, but, in our opinion, that is not reasonable because of the possible dual nature of the expenses, as I said.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the hotel and catering sector in itself is vital for employment and Member States should now be able to experiment with lowering VAT to give support to employment in these areas. In our opinion, the Member States should undoubtedly seize this opportunity. It is quite clear that jobs in the future will be created ultimately in service industries and the hotel and catering sector is an important example of this, but it would be a mistake if business travel costs were made entirely VAT‐exempt.</p>

We recognise the importance of VAT as a possible way of promoting employment, but we do not support a policy in which certain sectors are promoted on an ad hoc, arbitrary basis.</p>
<p class="contents">We are certainly in favour of objective and transparent experiments to find ways of using VAT to promote employment. The Commissioner knows what I am getting at here. After Parliament"s innumerable calls for this to happen, the European Council in Vienna finally asked the Commission to put forward proposals on experimenting with low VAT rates for labour‐intensive services.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Commissioner when Parliament can expect to see this proposal. You know that this is a subject to which Parliament attaches great importance, and I would urge you to ensure that before this Parliament is dissolved we are given the opportunity to approve a Commission proposal on experimenting with low VAT rates for labour‐intensive services. This means that you would have to come up with something concrete either this month or next, which you could do perfectly easily, because we have already had extensive negotiations on this issue and we are, I think, largely in agreement that it must be limited to a number of very labour‐intensive sectors. We already agree on the approach, so I think the proposal is actually already there. I would therefore urge you most strongly to ensure that we receive the proposal in the next few weeks.</p>

The result, as we know, is that because of all the red tape involved many of them give up their right to deduct VAT, which is certainly not the intention.</p>
<p class="contents">Business people have been waiting for a long time for the rules on reclaiming VAT in other Member States to be harmonised, and harmonisation is certainly something to be welcomed, so we agree with the Commission"s proposals here. They represent genuine progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of harmonising the rules on expenditure for which VAT cannot be deducted in full is also a step in the right direction, but here we support the amendment tabled by the rapporteur, Mr Garosci. The proposal to make VAT on hotel and restaurant costs fully deductible not only responds to what the business community wants, it is also a logical fiscal approach. Entertaining business partners is often the only way to publicise a company"s products and services, particularly for small firms, so it is therefore logical to classify the actual costs incurred, whether in a hotel or a restaurant, as business expenses from which VAT is fully deductible.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the Commission could come up with more than these specific proposals, and then we can show businesses that the European institutions are concerned not just with the problems of the multinationals, but also with the problems of small firms and more besides. This is why I support Mr Metten"s question about what progress has been made with the idea of experimenting with low VAT rates for labour‐intensive services. It is a question asked many times before, Commissioner, but one that is not going to go away.</p>

Serious distortions of competition arise because of the differences in the way Member States treat tourism companies in respect of the right to deduct value added tax. This affects ‘business tourism" – in other words, conferences and congresses – as well as private business travel. As the rapporteur says, business travel accounts for approximately 20 % of total turnover in the tourism sector. Expenditure per guest is by far the highest, since many overseas visitors – especially from North America and Japan – attend these business events. Competition between the various congress and conference locations is consequently extremely tough. Business tourism deserves our support as a valuable source of jobs. Hence the particular importance of Amendment No 7, which advocates full deduction of expenditure on accommodation and food or drink, as well as on entertaining business partners.</p>

<p class="contents">Due to the lack of time, I will concentrate on the amendments on tourist activities, which I fully agree with. These amendments relate to so‐called ‘business tourism" – conventions, congresses and business travel – which already accounts for nearly 20 % of European tourism and is highly likely not only to increase significantly in the medium term, but also to compensate for one of the most complicated phenomena in the tourist sector, namely seasonal variations. Business tourism is therefore a way of helping to ensure that employment in the tourism sector remains stable throughout the year. In fact, business tourism occurs in particular outside the high season, thereby contributing to a more balanced and more profitable operation of tourism businesses throughout the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Eight EU countries are fully aware of this. Belgium, Germany, Spain, Finland, Luxembourg, Holland, Sweden and the United Kingdom already allow the deduction of VAT on hotel and restaurant expenditure in the case of business travel. This is a real incentive from the authorities of these countries to the development of business tourism, both for nationals of these countries and in order to attract congresses to the respective markets. It must be borne in mind that competition in this sector is quite tough, despite Europe having exceptional conditions in terms of its supply.</p>
<p class="contents">The seven countries that have not adopted this principle, namely Austria, Italy, France, Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Denmark, are at a disadvantage due to both the competitive edge of the other eight EU countries already mentioned and the growing number of non‐European destinations in the tourism sector where VAT does not even exist. I am therefore personally in favour of the proposals included in the amendments tabled by Mr Garosci, who I must congratulate, as they seem to me to make a very important contribution to the future of European tourist activities.</p>

The tax authorities in the Member States are going to have to work with each other to make this proposal successful, and it must be a success because the current state of affairs is a recurring source of irritation for the business community.</p>
<p class="contents">The legislation on which we are delivering our opinion today has great potential. European businesses are heavily burdened by the red tape involved in claiming back VAT paid abroad, and if the VAT is reimbursed it often takes months or even years until it actually reaches the company in question. It seems fitting that we should have an Italian Commissioner and an Italian rapporteur here, because the longest wait that I have ever heard of was twelve years for a VAT repayment from Italy to reach the firm entitled to it.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal solves a number of existing problems, but this change to the VAT directive is not enough. Our ultimate aim must still be to achieve a definitive VAT system based on the principle of the country of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal from the Commission is an important intermediate stage and should improve confidence between the various Member States and their administrative systems. This confidence will be needed if we are ever to have a definitive VAT system with a sort of repayment clearing house similar to the repayment system now on the table. The definitive VAT system will involve infinitely greater sums than is currently the case, since the VAT reclaimed from abroad, which is what we are discussing here, forms only a small part of the total VAT payments in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much support Commissioner Monti"s proposal, and I congratulate the rapporteur on his report. This first step should bring us closer to the definitive VAT system, which will make a world of difference to the non‐exporting small and medium‐sized companies that unfortunately make up the majority of those affected.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with what Mr Metten said. I think that from now on we must insist on lower rates of VAT for labour‐intensive services in all our reports on taxation.</p>

The Council"s proposal to simplify the system for deducting VAT expenditure incurred in a Member State in which the taxable person is not established, a proposal which was improved by the amendments of Parliament"s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, is a small step in the right direction, a very small step, since this simplification will make life difficult for the fraudsters.</p>
<p class="contents">A pity the Council does not have another, equally effective magic formula for preventing the corruption regularly perpetrated by one or two European Commissioners who cheat, scheme and fiddle with impunity. So much for that footnote – I have finished, Mr President.</p>

These procedures are particularly cumbersome in certain Member States; we repeatedly see the adverse effect on businesses of the time and costs involved. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy is therefore expressly in favour of simplifying the procedures. We would even go a step further in some areas. Accommodation and food or drink expenses incurred as part of a person"s business activities should, we believe, remain fully deductible. It is hard to see why money spent in hotels and restaurants for purely business purposes should be treated differently from any other business expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">The business lunch or dinner is valuable when it comes to fostering contacts and building up client confidence – especially for small companies, who can also use the occasion to present their products. In Austria, we have found that reducing the tax deductibility of business entertainment can harm the gourmet restaurant sector. We therefore believe that Parliament"s amendment offers an appropriate way of resolving this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have a proposal on translation costs. Tax administrations are quite entitled to ask for the details on an invoice or whatever to be translated. We do know, however, that this can cause difficulties for SMEs, who often do not have the necessary language expertise to hand. Some countries even require officially certified translations; this can mean bringing in a ‘sworn" translator or court‐recognised interpreter. Consequently, it would make sense for the costs of external translation to be borne by the requesting administration. I am delighted to see that the Commission"s commitment to a leaner and fitter regulatory system at single market level is now bearing fruit in the VAT sector too.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Monti, </span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. – (IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to be discussing with you one of the first legislative initiatives on VAT which derives directly from the SLIM exercise, and to be doing so on the basis of such an excellent report as the one by Mr Garosci.</p>
<p class="contents">The work of the SLIM group has led to a series of important recommendations which we are following up as a top priority within the Commission's work programme, so as to improve the operation of the VAT system. Therefore I am always happy to hear observations to the effect that, as Mr Secchi said, this is one stage on the way towards the definitive VAT system, to which Mrs Randzio‐Plath also referred.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal contains two parts: the first relates to the procedure for refunding VAT to non‐resident taxable persons; the second relates to harmonisation of the rules governing deduction.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the first aspect, the refund procedure – the purpose of which is to allow a taxable person to recover the VAT paid in a Member State in which he is not resident – has been identified as an area where simplification is urgently needed. The procedure set out in the eighth directive has proved very unsatisfactory in practice, both for national administrations and for operators. The latter criticise in particular the cumbersome administrative formalities and the delays in obtaining refunds.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has concluded that the only modification likely to bring about true simplification consists of abolishing this procedure altogether and replacing it with a mechanism enabling a taxable person to deduct, in his regular returns, tax paid in a Member State in which he is not resident. This system requires the introduction of a bilateral refund and compensation system for debts between Member States, as well as a clear‐cut division of the Member States' responsibilities for verification, presupposing that a relationship of trust exists. The Commission notes with satisfaction that Mr Garosci's report supports its proposal concerning this first aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect is harmonisation of the rules governing deduction of VAT paid on expenditure which is of both a business and non‐business nature. The proposal relates first of all to the deduction of VAT applied to expenditure relating to passenger cars, our aim being to end the total exclusion from the right to deduct which currently applies in certain Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission is proposing a flat‐rate deduction of 50 % of the VAT payable on expenditure on accommodation, food and drink, and a total exclusion for expenditure on luxuries, amusements or entertainment. I note that Mr Garosci's report basically endorses the Commission's proposed approach. The amendments put forward relate mainly to the provision for a 50 % flat‐rate deduction in the case of expenditure on accommodation, food and drink. Even when incurred in the context of an operator's business activity, such expenditure is, by its very nature, intended to satisfy personal needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Application of the normal rules requires a discrete assessment of the business and non‐business elements of expenditure; this assessment often gives rise to awkwardness between tax administrations and operators. Consequently, the Commission is proposing a flat‐rate deduction of 50 %, with a view to simplifying – that is the key word – verification, especially in view of the obvious risk of improper deduction. Moreover, a flat‐rate deduction makes it easier for operators to prove the business nature of such expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, we cannot accept the proposed amendments. Nevertheless, I can assure you that the Commission will take your observations into account during the forthcoming negotiations on this proposal in the Council. Indeed, were the Council not to agree unanimously on flat‐rate deduction but to argue that the application of the normal rules creates no insurmountable problems of verification, the Commission would then be prepared to suggest a practical solution, allowing a Member State to apply either a deduction in accordance with the normal rules or the flat‐rate deduction of 50 %.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as thanking you for your support, which I consider particularly important in persuading the Council to adopt the proposal, I wish to close – in this very welcome climate of confidence between our institutions, referred to by Mrs Peijs – by answering the question concerning the possibility of a reduced rate of VAT on labour‐intensive services, a subject touched on by Mr Secchi, Mr Metten and Mrs Thyssen.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been pointed out, the Commission presented a communication to the extraordinary European Council in Luxembourg in November 1997, asking the Council to back this proposal. As you know, there has since been some inconclusive discussion in the ECOFIN Council. The Vienna European Council invited the Commission to authorise the Member States to apply the reduced rate on labour‐intensive services having no cross‐border content. Naturally, under the existing legal system, the Commission cannot authorise the Member States to do this; that would require an amendment to the sixth VAT directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that this matter is of great concern to Parliament, and I am pleased to take this opportunity of announcing that I intend to present the relevant draft amendment to the Commission in February, in order that Member States wishing to do so may, on an experimental basis, apply a reduced VAT rate to labour‐intensive services.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the best way for taxation to help employment is to move towards fiscal coordination, and Parliament has always supported this major undertaking of recent years. One specific contribution which may well be worth trying out is the one to which we have referred: the possibility of a reduced VAT rate on labour‐intensive services.</p>
