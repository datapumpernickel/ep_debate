This is a really important and sensitive subject. It is therefore very important for us and this House to be able to have this debate with you today.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission intends to re-evaluate the Less-Favoured Areas during the reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP). In the report by Herbert Dorfmann in May 2010, we had already expressed huge concerns about the new calculation model. The proposal provides for the classification of Less-Favoured Areas according to eight biophysical criteria, such as low temperatures, aridity, soil conditions or slope of the land. The result of the new mapping is disastrous for many regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The new criteria would result in massive redistributions in some regions. We have been told this by some Member States. The detailed calculations and simulations are not available to us, however. For the continuation of the negotiations on the CAP, in connection with which the European Parliament, as legislator, will have to take a decision on this matter, all of the facts must be made available to us. We will do everything we can to prevent sensitive regions which are clearly affected by natural handicaps from disappearing from the map. What data can the Council provide and when will Parliament receive all of the simulations? As representative of the Member States, the Council must ensure that Parliament does not have any gaps in its knowledge. Parliament wants and intends to find good solutions for farmers during the CAP negotiations. Until all of the data have been provided, we reserve the right to leave the issue of Less-Favoured Areas out of the reform completely.</p>
<p class="contents">I hereby ask you to take this House and its concerns seriously. I am calling for planning security for our farms and programmes that enable our holdings to make a living. Our main point of criticism is the fact that the delimitation of individual holdings according to the type of production they employ is no longer to be possible. We want a bundle of criteria. When it comes to maintaining agriculture in areas in which conditions are difficult it is important to recompense for the total capacity. It is important to recognise the services provided in the public interest and to appreciate our agriculture which is found throughout all of the regions of Europe. It is a question of preserving our rural cultural heritage. We expect specific answers from you today.</p>

We want to preserve biodiversity, we want to prevent forest fires, we want better water management and we want better soil protection. It is not, therefore, the idea of this type of support that we are debating here today; what we are debating here today is very practical in nature. We Members, who are currently invested with the responsibility of drafting reports on common agricultural policy reform, will have to make decisions; will have to legislate without a bare minimum of information on the real impact of applying new criteria to an area.</p>
<p class="contents">By now, the Council should already have informed us; the Member States should already have made available all information on the real impact of these new criteria on each of the Member States. I should therefore like to ask the Council the following question: is it in a position to provide this information and, if so, when? I should also like to remind you that the rapporteurs will submit their work for translation within a month and that it will be practically, nay actually, impossible to legislate responsibly if this information is not available.</p>
<p class="contents">As such, since responsibility for this area is in the hands of the Member States, I should very much like the Council to tell us very clearly and specifically when it will be in a position to provide us with this information that is essential for our work as lawmakers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Currently 70% of agricultural land in the region is designated as a Less-Favoured Area. The payments received by farmers who are covered by this scheme are vital to their livelihoods, especially as many are only part-time farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">We should therefore approach adopting this scheme – and changing the criteria for limiting the scheme – with the utmost caution. Forecasts suggest that, under the current proposals, a substantial amount of currently eligible land in the United Kingdom as a whole will lose LFA status. This figure is thought to translate into a loss of up to 30% of current LFA land.</p>
<p class="contents">I am concerned that, while some areas may lose out, it seems in fact that more productive land could well be included under this new scheme. These are areas which may not necessarily require this type of support; this demonstrates that, quite possibly, the Commission failed to carry out an adequate impact assessment of the consequences of this proposed notification.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to see a level playing field for all Member States. This requires the recognition of all types of natural constraints, and of the fact that they are equally damaging to agricultural production. I would like to take this opportunity to point out, for example, that rainfall – as experienced where I come from – can be as detrimental to agricultural activity as the droughts which occur in other parts of Europe. We have to overcome the obstacles and a one-size-fits-all approach will not suit on this occasion.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to safeguard the effectiveness of the LFA scheme, I wish to see a broad and flexible approach. I believe that the current scheme has worked very well, and I do not wish to see it in any way jeopardised.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I am beginning to wonder who exactly is driving the CAP and the reform. Is it the Commission or is it the Court of Auditors? It seems that the Court has criticised the Commission’s every move, even, this week, regarding the reform package. If this specific reform of the LFA scheme proposed by the Commission is simply a reaction to criticism from the Court of Auditors which claims these payments are not justified, it is totally scandalous. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Under the original map, there were significant areas of Scotland that would have dropped out under the new designation, but thankfully that has been rectified – to a certain degree – by the Commission’s inclusion of excess soil moisture, i.e. the amount of rainfall that actually falls on land, being included. That has helped to iron out some of the anomalies revealed in the original mapping exercise in Scotland, although there are still some serious problems with regard to the amount of good land that has been brought in, especially on the east coast of Scotland, and I think that most independent analysts would recognise that this was not genuinely less-favoured or disadvantaged.</p>
<p class="contents">At least in the United Kingdom we have had a clear idea of how the new criteria impact on UK farmers and on Scottish farmers, as the maps showing the changes have been published by both the UK and Scottish Governments on a regular basis and consulted upon. However, in many other countries – as other Members have said – they are keeping the impact of these changes a secret and are refusing to give the Commission permission to release the information to the European Parliament. How can we decide whether the new LFA criteria set out in the CAP reform are appropriate and meet the criticisms of the EU Court of Auditors, when key information such as this is being deliberately withheld from Members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development?</p>
<p class="contents">I would say to the Council here today that this is a matter of principle, and – as co-legislators – Parliament must have the same access to the same information as both the Commission and the Council. The countries concerned must come clean and reveal this information to us as soon as possible if the legislation is to make any progress through this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask colleagues to support this call for all information relating to CAP reform to be shared with Parliament on an equal basis with the Commission and the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In connection with its work to obtain an understanding of the precise impact of the application of eight biophysical criteria used to designate Less-Favoured Areas, the Commission asked the Member States to produce maps of particular areas. These are areas that will be eligible to receive Less-Favoured Area payments on the basis of simulations of the application of the criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that Parliament wanted the detailed maps to be distributed. Unfortunately, that has not yet happened.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of new criteria for the designation of Less-Favoured Areas is now being included in the reform of the common agricultural policy. Nevertheless, no official information has yet been presented concerning the impact of the application of the eight biophysical criteria. I agree with the authors that both Parliament and the Council should have access to the same basic information concerning the impact of the application of the biophysical criteria for the designation of land that is eligible for subsidies in areas with severe limitations for agricultural production.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as I am aware, all Member States have now submitted provisional information and maps concerning the impact of the application of the eight biophysical criteria to the Commission. Even if this information and these data are provisional, they will provide useful information on the impact of the application of the new criteria, which may be relevant to both the Council’s and Parliament’s understanding of the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Council does not have access to this information and these maps. The maps belong to the Member States and they can only be made available to Parliament and the Council once the Member States have given the Commission permission to distribute them. The Commission is not able either to publish or to distribute this information without permission.</p>
<p class="contents">I am given to understand, however, that 12 Member States have now agreed to grant the Commission permission to provide information on the impact of the application of the eight biophysical criteria for the designation of Less-Favoured Areas in these 12 Member States. This will happen at the meeting of Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on Monday, 23 April.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this cooperativeness, I also understand and share the authors’ surprise at the lack of disclosure and transparency in relation to this information. At the most recent meeting of the Special Committee on Agriculture on 16 April 2012, the Presidency therefore encouraged more Member States to reconsider their position and to grant this permission, so as to ensure that there is as much transparency as possible in this process. I hope that more Member States will now grant the necessary permission so that both Parliament and the Council can gain understanding of the impact of the proposed biophysical criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">On account of this situation, the Council is unfortunately not able to make any further comments on the questions raised, and I therefore propose that any further questions concerning the details of this matter be directed to the Commission at the forthcoming meeting in Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which will take place on 23 April 2012. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have just heard from the President-in-Office of the Council that the Member States and the Council are entirely different things. That is news to me.</p>
<p class="contents">About two years ago, my report on this matter was adopted in connection with which we made many proposals here in Parliament, as has already been said today. Absolutely nothing from this report has been retained in the Commission’s reform proposal. The Commission is continuing on its own stubborn path. Above all, however, we still do not know what this new delimitation will mean. We do not know which areas will be removed or which new areas will be included. Please do not misunderstand me: it may very well be that there will be a better delimitation than the one we have today. If we see that some Member States are made up 100% of Less-Favoured Areas, that is entirely possible. However, it is a question of delimiting the right areas and not simply of delimiting as many areas as possible. In my view, the eight proposed criteria will not necessarily help us to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, however, it is absurd that Parliament has still not seen the simulation of these criteria. While the Commission is claiming that it cannot release the maps because they belong to the Member States – as has just been confirmed to us – ministers of individual Member States are demanding that Parliament amend the criteria. How can we be expected to do that if we do not actually know the results of this? In fact, the only thing that is missing from this whole charade is for some Member States or the Commission to claim that Parliament is insisting on the new delimitation in this form. Then the confusion really would be perfect.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore urgently call on you as President-in-Office of the Council to proceed in a transparent way here and to put Parliament in a position to be able to do its job properly in the interests of the Council, the Commission and, most importantly, the farmers themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is nothing to prevent a new delimitation of less-favoured areas being carried out. It is also acceptable to try to base this on fewer criteria than is currently the case. However, if these are to be limited to eight criteria, made up of climate-related and geological criteria, it is unacceptable for MEPs to be denied the opportunity to scrutinise whether these criteria are indeed appropriate. We need maps of the new distribution of less-favoured areas in order to be able to examine whether this new distribution based on the eight criteria makes any sense at all. However, the withholding of the map material will obviously arouse distrust as to whether there really is any desire at all to enable Parliament to exercise its right of codecision.</p>
<p class="contents">As a farmer, I have serious doubts from a purely professional point of view as to whether these simple criteria will enable this sort of area classification to be made appropriately. There are, after all, other criteria that could convey disadvantage, such as a lack of infrastructure, labour market access or general historical farm structures. Moreover, different combinations of various criteria could lead to very different results. It is high time that we were able to evaluate the Commission’s proposals in an objective way in order to be able to improve them if necessary. Otherwise, I would agree with my fellow Members who wish to leave less-favoured areas out of the current agricultural reform discussion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a remarkable situation for us as the legislature to find ourselves in, and you as President to be defending.</p>
<p class="contents">Less-favoured-area status is of crucial importance to vast swathes of European territory. In Scotland, as we have heard, 85% of our territory is less-favoured area, and for our farmers LFA reform is actually more relevant and more important than CAP reform in its totality. So this is crucial; this is not a subsidiary issue, it is absolutely relevant to how we manage our environment and how we produce food across vast swathes of European territory.</p>
<p class="contents">In Scotland we have done our modelling and our mapping. We lose precisely 622 square km under the new criteria; we gain, according to the Farmers’ Union, 5 536 square kilometres, so we are proceeding on the basis of knowledge, facts, transparency and openness and all the things that the Scottish and Danish governments want to see.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea that in this Chamber we are operating blind as to the implications of these new criteria for vast swathes of our territory is simply inexcusable and is not a basis on which we can proceed, so I too would back calls from colleagues for this information, the importance of which we identified in the Dorfmann report.

Without such documents we are, indeed, unable to deliberate in a rational manner. In my opinion, the criteria that should guide us when delimiting Less-Favoured Areas (LFA) should relate mainly to soil conditions. The humidity of the soil, which Mr Nicholson referred to, is a very important condition which needs to be taken into account. Similarly, conditions relating to labour intensity are also important. To put it simply, in some areas, much more work is required in order to produce crops, in comparison to other areas. Mountainous regions fall into this very category. Competitiveness is yet another relevant issue. We should take account of areas at a greater distance from market outlets, where additional costs have to be borne in order to sell produce or to source means of production. The aforementioned criteria should be the main ones used for the delimitation of less-favoured areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Farmers in Northern Ireland need to know the effect that this scheme and the new criteria will have. It is my understanding that land currently designated as disadvantaged will be excluded. In Northern Ireland we also want to be reassured that we will have regional flexibility on the administrative unit to be used in the designation of the new boundaries in this land.</p>
<p class="contents">We also, I think, need to re-evaluate the start date for this scheme. Currently this is 2014, with payments on a degressive basis until such time as the Areas of Natural Constraint scheme is completed. We need to look at all these aspects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You are claiming in all seriousness that there are Member States sending maps to the Commission, while in the Council they are saying that these maps are not intended to be published or passed on to the European Parliament. That is simply incomprehensible. Up to now, I believed that the European Council was made up of the sum of the Member States. Is there are two-part working system here, where the Commission receives maps that are then intended to be kept confidential? I simply cannot understand this. It would, in my view, help to build trust if we could at least receive the Member States’ maps that the Commission is in possession of. How to actually get hold of these impact maps is indeed the most closely guarded secret in the European Union. They are being treated in a very precious way, like very expensive shares. This cannot be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the drawback with the Commission’s proposal is that it is not just a question of the physical soil conditions, but also of the yield capacity of the soil. We must not carry harmonisation in the European Union to the extreme. Conditions in the EU are much too varied for this. I would therefore argue in favour of us discussing the less-favoured areas once again calmly and objectively, without any time pressure. That means that we should not do this within the framework of the agricultural reform, but in a separate report, precisely because we will have no time pressure, because the situation is so confusing, because we should not allow this issue to get lost in the huge ocean of agricultural reform, and because we are talking about less-favoured areas here.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not about who is right. In my opinion, it is simply about the farmers affected and their families and incomes. We should therefore give ourselves the time that we need to discuss and take a decision on this problem properly.</p>

For example, I recently had a group of visitors from the Eifel region. They had the same conditions, the same agricultural expectations and the same soil points, and yet half of the region is suddenly no longer classed as less-favoured. It is not possible to explain this, and it is not the way to pursue European policy. I think that if the Member States are afraid to give us the maps then I no longer know how we are expected to continue with the process.

In my own Member State, Ireland, the total area designated as disadvantaged is almost 75% of the total land in Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">From an economic perspective, the less-favoured area scheme is particularly significant, contributing to the support of in excess of 100 000 Irish farming families whose ability to farm is restricted by the physical environment and in particular the impact of the prevailing wet, cold climatic conditions in Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">Farmers making a living in less-favoured areas face additional hurdles in trying to make a fair return for fair work. The market does not respect nor take into account the additional and costly challenges facing farmers in areas at a natural disadvantage. In this regard we must be sure that LFAs under Pillar 2 are adequately financed within the overall CAP budget and that the principle of subsidiarity is upheld, and that Member States are given the utmost flexibility to utilise the criteria in a manner that works best for their farmers and that they have the freedom to fine-tune it so as to best serve rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that Member States have been facing delays in the preparation and submission of the maps of areas that would be eligible for less-favoured area payments and, judging from today’s debate, it would appear that some Member States have refused to hand over these details. The process for delimiting and classifying these areas is proving problematic for some areas. Perhaps in this regard the Commission could give an indication, assistance or direction to Member States, to speed up the process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, no information has been made available to date on the process under way, which becomes particularly important when Parliament is debating the future common agricultural policy (CAP).</p>
<p class="contents">Identifying less-favoured areas is absolutely key to realising the European agricultural model represented by the CAP, since it establishes support levels on the basis of positive discrimination, so as to make agricultural production viable and promote it throughout the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">This will also ensure rural areas’ viability and prevent land from being abandoned or depopulated. At the same time, it is important that the evaluation of Less-Favoured Areas – to be undertaken on the basis of simulations carried out by the Member States – be fairly detailed, whilst ensuring a high level of subsidiarity when setting out criteria that must be socioeconomic as well as biophysical, considering limits at levels that suit the characteristics of each Member State, and respecting the specificities of each region thereof.</p>
<p class="contents">The established criteria should also consider the possibility of cumulative biophysical characteristics, combining physical criteria, such as soil and climate, with geographical ones, such as isolation and distance, as well as production, pasture proportion, herd density, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Regrettably, the Commission proposal totally fails to mention geographical disadvantages, such as isolation, farm dispersal, distance from consumption centres, or distance from decision-making and services centres. These issues are very important in a country like Portugal, whose territory comprises an area in the far west of the European mainland and two outermost regions – the Azores and Madeira – in the middle of the Atlantic ocean. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is that they adopt a 50% UAA threshold as a standard qualification; secondly, that they use the smallest size of administrative unit in order to reflect more accurately the area’s agricultural potential; and, finally, that they show a degree of flexibility in the way that natural handicaps and biophysical criteria are measured in order to classify the area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This aid will be added to the funds already available under the rural development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Five per cent of the budget is assigned to farmers with land falling in Less-Favoured Areas, with a bonus of up to EUR 300 per hectare. However, the issue that is really worrying farmers is the definition of Less-Favoured Areas. The eight biophysical criteria may not make for a reasonable and understandable delimitation and do not seem to respond to the interests of farmers or tax-payers. The proposed thresholds are too rigid and the results do not meet the desired objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">I maintain, furthermore, that measures similar to those set out in Article 68 on helping vulnerable sectors or regions ought to be retained. Aid for vulnerable sectors should however be restricted in order to avoid distortions of competition. Here I am referring, for example, to the cultivation of ‘monumental’ plants such as olive trees in Apulia, southern Italy. Following the reform, it has been forecast that the olive-growing sector would lose 60% of its value against previous levels. The longevity of monumental olive trees is of huge importance for the region, including in ecological, economic and productive terms: ecologically, it is important because keeping these crops healthy and productive means carrying out work on hydrogeological defence works in areas subject to erosion; in economic and productive terms it is important because it represents one of the region’s main revenue streams, since in Apulia alone there are 1 200 oil mills working 53 varieties of olives of undeniable value and quality.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we are asking the Commission to put alternative, suitable thresholds into its proposal on biophysical criteria and to make it possible for these criteria to be used cumulatively, with physical and geographical criteria added to other production-related criteria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Bare figures concerning the weather and soil conditions will not be able to provide us with the data on which to base a decision. I would urge you most strongly: let us forget the atlas in the form that has been requested now. The Member States are clearly not willing to provide it anyway.

I would like to point out here that the compensation payments are a success story in European agricultural policy. They have helped the management of the land to continue throughout these areas, where the biodiversity of the cultural landscape has been safeguarded and the jobs of people in these areas have been retained. This has meant that people in these areas continue to have prospects.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore find the way that the Commission as well as the Council have dealt with this sensitive matter even more incomprehensible. If we consider these eight biophysical criteria, we see that we will gain new inequities that are significantly worse than those under the current system, in which there are a few delimitation problems. We would have a system that would probably cause a great deal of anger. Details have leaked from Germany indicating that 2.8 million hectares would be removed and 1.2 million new hectares would be included in their place. When I speak to farmers from these areas, they are surprised that they should suddenly be in a Less-Favoured Area. From France, we hear that an area where farmers have the highest average income is to become a less-favoured area. This just does not add up.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Council whether it is prepared to work with Parliament in the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon so that we can draw up better proposals. Sometimes all I can say, with a certain amount of irony, is: I think as Parliament we need to make a few copies of the Treaty of Lisbon available to the Council and the Commission so that they finally catch on in all areas that this Treaty exists. It appears that many of them are not yet aware of this. Since the whole business really does already resemble a comedy show, as Mr Jahr put it, I would like to make another suggestion. We should declare the area in which the Commission and the Council meet to be a Less-Favoured Area, because they are withholding more than 66% of the information from us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is clearly insufficient justification for the adoption of LAU 2 as the administrative unit to be used as the basis for qualification, given that the size of this unit varies widely across the EU. For the Union as a whole, the average size of an LAU 2 unit amounts to 3 500 hectares. In Poland, however, the average size is 12 500 hectares. In the case of some Member States, there can even be a tenfold difference in the size of LAU 2 units. This situation does not allow comparability on a EU level. In my opinion, small administrative units such as cadastral units should be used. These are uniform in terms of soil conditions and consequently provide a better representation of natural impediments. Moreover, the application of the LAU 2 level in conjunction with the high qualification threshold, namely 66%, especially in countries with a variety of soil and climatic conditions such as Poland, will result in the exclusion of some areas with natural handicaps in situations where the required level in terms of qualifying criteria is not reached.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of Poland, areas with scientifically proven low productivity and the risk of set-aside would not fall within the category of areas with natural handicaps. This indeed is turning things upside down and, before it is too late, we should exclude this issue from the reform of EU agricultural policy currently under discussion.

I should therefore like to know, how much time do I have for this speech?</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, first of all, to mention the context of this debate. By excluding socio-economic factors, the recategorisation of the less-favoured areas proposed in 2005 is harmful to some of the poorest regions of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, small and medium-sized farmers and family farming are hit even harder. The European Commission insists on using a number of means to deny them the role that they must play in the future of European farming. This has subverted the concept of the less-favoured area. The current definition ignores an entire dimension other than the biophysical: the socioeconomic dimension. This dimension cannot be ignored, at the risk of exacerbating even further the existing inequalities and injustices in distribution of common agricultural policy (CAP) funds between countries and producers. It is therefore necessary, not just to retain, but to expand and diversify socioeconomic criteria in terms of, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, indicators of desertification and rural flight.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has appointed a panel of experts to define biophysical criteria, but it forgot to include representatives of the various Member States therein; it should have, as it acknowledged in a question that I asked it in 2010. No expert from any Portuguese institution was included in this panel, and that is true for the overwhelming majority of Member States. The dangers are obvious. The diversity of existing situations means that the complexity of setting out uniform criteria could, once again, result in some benefiting at the expense of others.</p>
<p class="contents">A key issue in this CAP reform remains unaddressed: the need to ensure the fair distribution of CAP funds that guarantees each country its right to production and its right to food sovereignty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, the new common agricultural policy will not be able to take effect without new regulations on Less-Favoured Areas, which is impossible until Parliament gains access to the simulations carried out. Parliament cannot endorse what is an unknown quantity because it is ultimately Parliament’s role to explain to the public the decisions that have been made. Any decision made without consulting public opinion will be disputed and devoid of legitimacy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, instead of waiting for the results of the simulations, the Commission should go ahead and draft another proposal reflecting the remarks made by the European Parliament. Farmers are waiting to take into account all the factors imposing restrictions on production, including geographical factors such as being isolated, or socio-economic criteria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Yet within that, I would like to highlight something which has still not been addressed today: the serious demographic problem we have in the European Union and the shortage of young farmers involved in agricultural production is one of the biggest problems facing the future of European agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">I recently had a public debate on this issue in Parliament and it was revealed that only 6% of young people actively involved in agriculture within Europe are under the age of 35 – clearly this number is far too low.

Secondly, I found it extraordinary that Mr Deß pointed out that in the reclassification, Germany would lose 8 million acres and it would gain 1.2 million. That seems to be extraordinary, basically at the push of a pen. Thirdly, that information is available to the Council and so forth and it is not freely available to Parliament.
