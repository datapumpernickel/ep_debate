I am pleased that we are joined today by the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, and by Commissioner Verheugen. I know from my extensive contacts in preparing this debate that Commissioner Verheugen is determined to have these reports adopted by the college of Commissioners after he has presented them to this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret that as a result of a failure by those other than Commissioner Verheugen to observe the correct procedures, you will, over recent days, have already read in the newspapers much of what you are to hear today. Indeed, it was reported extensively in some French newspapers yesterday. This is not a criticism of Commissioner Verheugen, because I know he was determined to follow the procedures as agreed between this House and the Commission. I regret that this afternoon we will not be hearing for the first time what should be a major communication between our institutions from one year to the next. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(IT) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, representatives of the acceding countries, the top priority of my Commission, the absolute top priority is about to become a reality. Less than six months from now we will see the biggest enlargement in the Union’s history.</p>
<p class="contents">The presence in this House of the representatives of the countries that are going to join the Union next year is a tangible sign of how important that event is. First, let me say how much I admire the governments and peoples you represent. Over the past few years, you have moved heaven and earth to bring your legal and administrative systems into line with the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire. </span>These reforms demonstrate your strong desire for freedom and democracy. Indeed, you have carried out a quiet revolution that is taking you into the European Union with your heads held high, proud of your achievements.</p>
<p class="contents">Before the membership negotiations closed last year, I announced that the Commission would be presenting a report on the preparedness of the acceding Member States about six months before they actually joined. Today, I am here, together with Commissioner Verheugen <span class="bold">– </span>whom I would like to thank for his remarkable work <span class="bold">– </span>to present that report to you. The Comprehensive Monitoring Report adopted by the College this morning is the fruit of lengthy, painstaking efforts by the Commission, which has been monitoring and supporting the acceding countries' preparations for years. It is based on the 10 reports prepared by the Commission, one on each country, which are also available to you. These reports draw on all the Commission's expertise in the various areas of the <span class="italic">acquis</span>. They will also be the last such reports the Commission will prepare on the acceding countries, although we will continue to follow up the issues still outstanding over the coming months. This means we are no longer in the pre-accession phase. As from today, the Commission is starting to exercise its customary institutional role as guardian of the Treaties with regard to the new Member States too.</p>
<p class="contents">I will shortly ask Commissioner Verheugen to outline in detail the Commission’s findings in the Comprehensive Monitoring Report, but let me first make some general remarks. The official accession date for the ten new Member States is 1 May 2004, but the prospect of enlargement has already had positive effects. The European Union is increasingly becoming a reference in many countries for the development of civil society and political life. No other <span class="bold">– </span>and I repeat, no other <span class="bold">– </span>player on the world stage can boast the same drawing power. The reason is clear. The Union has succeeded in putting the highest ideals into practice: peace, on which we have founded our Union; democracy, which we defend through all our policies; greater opportunities for economic prosperity and solidarity towards the least-favoured regions and groups. Why our model is so successful today is also clear. On its own, each country would be at the mercy of greater and more powerful political and economic entities, but, united, we can direct the process with due regard for democracy and the human dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that the accession of the new Member States next year will bring no great problems in terms of implementing the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> where either the single market or the other Community policies are concerned. Of course, there are still issues to resolve <span class="bold">– </span>clearly outlined, moreover, in the report <span class="bold">– </span>including some very important ones, but I am confident that all these countries will overcome these last remaining obstacles. The 10 governments are perfectly aware that any shortcoming in any area would deprive them of the benefits of accession in that sector, in terms of both financial transfers and market access. If problems still remain after accession, the Commission will do its duty, as it always has, and will take the necessary steps. In any case – I must stress – I do not envisage any major obstacles to the conclusion of this process.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, all the issues we have identified are manageable and we have the instruments for the purpose. Moreover, it is in everyone's interest for the Union to absorb this enlargement as quickly and smoothly as possible because there are many other issues facing the Union and many other goals we must achieve, including the Intergovernmental Conference and the smooth functioning of our institutions in an enlarged Union, the Lisbon strategy, the new Financial Perspective, the completion of the enlargement process and the ring of friends policy <span class="bold">– </span>the Wider Europe policy. These will be the real challenges for the enlarged Union of 25 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">One of our tasks will thus be the continuation of the enlargement process. As I have often said, this is a continuous, inclusive, irreversible process. Our common target is to carry through the accession process for Bulgaria and Romania in 2007. Considerable progress has been recorded in these two countries as well this year, and Commissioner Verheugen is going to say a few words on this too. The accession negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania have moved forward significantly and it is time to think about a framework for finalising them. These negotiations must be based on the same criteria as those observed by all the other countries, and, of course, in particular, what is known as the principle of own merit. At the beginning of next year, the Commission will point the way to finalising the negotiations by presenting a proposal for a financial offer for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania. Everyone agrees that these negotiations must not depend on the outcome of the debate on the new Financial Perspective or the debate on future reforms – we have always kept these issues separate – and, to prevent this happening, we need to take as a benchmark the financial framework worked out for the ten acceding countries. On this I am counting on Parliament's support, and I intend to involve Parliament fully in this next phase in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">Next year will be decisive for Turkey. Indeed, this will be one of the last big decisions that it will fall to my Commission to take in this term of office. It will involve assessing Turkey's progress in meeting the Copenhagen political criteria and issuing a recommendation as regards the opening of accession negotiations. Let me make one point very clear in this respect: it is this Commission that will present the Regular Report on Turkey and the recommendation in autumn 2004. That was the undertaking I gave at Copenhagen last year and we will keep our promise.</p>
<p class="contents">We have followed developments in Turkey very carefully over the past year. There has been considerable progress that shows the determination of the Turkish Government to leave no stone unturned in their efforts to meet the political criteria for membership. We will be watching further developments closely in the areas where progress is still needed, as regards both legislation and the actual implementation of the new rights and freedoms to which the Turkish people are entitled thanks to the reforms undertaken. Lastly, let me reiterate the Union’s desire to see Cyprus accede as a unified country. We continue to hope this will happen. Clearly, it is in Turkey’s interest, too, to reach a settlement quickly, because this would prevent the Cyprus issue from becoming an obstacle to its own aspirations. The issue can still be settled before 1 May next year on the basis of the UN Secretary-General's proposal. All parties concerned must contribute to this process and the Commission stands ready to assist in every possible way.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before closing, I would like to mention the Balkan region. Croatia has already presented its membership application and the Commission is now looking at Zagreb's replies <span class="bold">– </span>a huge number of replies <span class="bold">– </span>to the questionnaire sent to it at the beginning of the summer. Other countries in the region intend to follow Croatia's example shortly. Our response to these countries needs to be discerning and far-sighted and we must make it clear that the prospects of membership are genuine and that we commit ourselves to accompanying them along this common road, even though the stringent criteria we have always adopted still stand.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, history has vindicated the vision of Europe's founding fathers: the original Six that had just emerged from the war are now 25 <span class="bold">– </span>free, strong countries <span class="bold">– </span>and they will, no doubt, number more than 30 in the future. In a few months, our family will have 10 new members. With their enthusiasm, we will be able to enhance our Union and give it new horizons. We must extend it too and, together, all working together, we can uphold and assert more firmly the values on which it is founded.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, with your permission, I will now give the floor to Commissioner Verheugen, whom I would like to thank once again for his extraordinarily astute work and his remarkable commitment to this project.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Verheugen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, when we concluded negotiations with the ten candidate countries a year ago, we did so on the basis of a prognosis that these ten countries would be fully prepared by the date set for accession, that is to say that they would have discharged all the obligations into which they had entered in the course of negotiations. That is the reason behind monitoring; it is there to determine whether or not this prognosis was accurate. The concluding monitoring report that the Commission adopted today is the last one. There have already been two previous reports, which have had very positive effects, and I can tell you that we of course have to expect the media, following the debate in this House, to focus on those points where we say there is something not yet right.</p>
<p class="contents">It therefore seems to me to be necessary to start by putting this into perspective. In the first place, we did not have to re-examine most of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, as it had already become apparent during the negotiation process that all the requirements had been met. We did not even give it a second look. We only revisited the areas in which issues had remained open during the course of negotiations and in which commitments had been entered into. We divided up this part of the <span class="italic">acquis</span> into 140 sectors of widely varying importance, some of them comprising several hundred legal acts, others only one – and that is just an illustration of the volume involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that we had, all in all, 1 400 such sectors to monitor made that an immense task; it is a communal effort by the Commission as a whole, one that, in recent months, had required many hundreds of staff, but I will also claim that this work is very substantial and that the sort of overview we have was never possible at the time of any previous enlargements. I have to tell you that such a thing has never been done in the history of the EU, and it is important that we should know that if we are to properly evaluate what the outcome has been.</p>
<p class="contents">It turned out that, in the 1 400 sectors that we monitored, preparations are running perfectly according to the timetable in 70% of all cases and that no comments are called for. In a further 27% of cases, we have noted that some individual points remain to be dealt with, but there are, generally speaking, no grounds for concern. This process is in motion, and, according to our prognosis, everything will be in place on 1 May 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">That leaves 3% – precisely 39 instances out of 1 400 – in which we have observed serious omissions and delays that can be compensated for only with difficulty. In these instances, we are telling the future Member States that decisive action has to be taken as a matter of absolute urgency in order to fulfil the conditions in time for 1 May 2004, so that everything in this area, too, can be in good order.</p>
<p class="contents">The thirty-nine problem areas are spread out over ten countries. I would advise against attempting to rank them in order; the fact that Poland has ten such areas does not mean that Poland is worse than others. The simple explanation is that a large part of the problems are present only in Poland, as the size of the other countries means that certain of the problems are not found in them. I regard the overall outcome as very balanced. It relates to only a few chapters of the <span class="italic">acquis,</span> and we estimate that the problems will be able to be resolved everywhere even before 1 May 2004. If they are not – and it is this point that is crucial – then the Commission will, in good time before 1 May, take the necessary actions, and we have a whole range of options to choose from.</p>
<p class="contents">We can apply the safety measures that are in any case already contained in the Treaty. We can apply the specific safety measures provided for in the Treaty of Accession; we can institute normal infringement proceedings; we can make use of administrative interventions. We have, then, a wide range of options, and agreement has today been reached within the Commission that each Commissioner, within his or her own area of responsibility, shall oversee the ongoing handling of these still unresolved issues and shall, if necessary, propose the necessary measures in good time before 1 May.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking for myself, I do not expect this to be necessary, as, in most instances, the adverse consequences resulting from these problems being left unresolved would not affect the Community as such, but only the new Member States themselves. For example, the question was raised of whether the structures were in place to enable agricultural support grants to be paid in full. If administrative structures are inadequate for this purpose, the result will be that the money will not flow, which means that the government that makes itself guilty of such negligence will end up under considerable domestic pressure, because their farmers are not getting their direct support payments. I therefore predict that all these cases will be resolved as a matter of course before 1 May 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Knowing that this House pays particular attention to the area of food safety, I can tell you that there are still a number of problems in this area too, and our position remains unchanged, namely that no food not conforming to our standards – by which I mean our hygiene rules – must be allowed onto the internal market. For that reason, the necessary measures relating to food safety will be taken by February at the latest in order to ensure that no products not complying with the standards get onto the internal market. There are, however, relatively few of them, and people must not get the idea that a country has performed badly in a particular area just because a few firms in a few countries fail to reach the standards.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, then, we come to the conclusion that institutions and policies will continue to function after 1 May 2004, that no appreciable disruptions are to be expected and that, while the possibility of problems cannot of course be excluded, they will be manageable in every respect. All this, then, adds up to a good outcome. I unreservedly endorse, and associate myself with, the Commission’s expressions of appreciation for that and President Prodi’s recent underlining of the especial achievements of these countries’ governments, parliaments and peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">With which, let me turn to Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey. I can keep this relatively brief. Both Bulgaria and Romania have made remarkable progress. I would in particular like to stress that Bulgaria has now at last managed to promote reform of the judicial system, which had been a major problem in assessing it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight the more positive valuation given to Romania in terms of the market economy criterion. The Commission is now stating that Romania can be regarded as a market economy, provided that the reform process continues without change, which we assume it will. This amounts to an appreciation of the significant economic reforms that Romania has already achieved and of the remarkable macroeconomic stability that it manifests.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to how we take matters further in relation to Romania and Bulgaria, the Commission counsels against decoupling these processes from each other. We are sticking to the target of bringing both countries, together, into the European Union in 2007, although the principle still holds that no country should have to wait for another. If, then, it turns out in the course of the ongoing process that they are progressing at different speeds, we will also be able to conclude the negotiations on different dates.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we can regard it as a sort of compliment that both countries are very keen to complete negotiations before the present Commission leaves office, we are very cautious when it comes to making a statement about this. I would also appreciate it if Parliament could follow us in not, at the present moment, specifying any dates, but could limit itself to confirming 2007 as the accession date. For that to be the case, work on the accession treaty needs to be completed before the end of 2005. That means that the time window for completing the negotiations is between now and somewhere around the summer of 2005, when, if the country in question really has done everything, it will be possible to conclude them. As a whole, I regard this picture as a favourable one.</p>
<p class="contents">I want, though, to again strongly encourage these countries to make determined efforts towards improving political and economic governance; I am referring particularly to corruption and to the fight against economic crime. This is also important in terms of the investment climate in both countries and of making them attractive to investors.</p>
<p class="contents">We have tried hard not to prejudge anything where Turkey is concerned, and it can be speculated whether or not the report that the Commission has presented today makes a statement about the decision that is to be taken next year. We have tried hard not to do that, but, instead, to give Turkey fair and objective treatment, and that means that we have to attest and acknowledge the remarkable fact that reforms have been better implemented, and at increasing speed, in both the political and economic spheres. It also means, though, that we have to tell the truth and say that a very great deal still does not meet our standards or conform to our requirements, and that these things have to be addressed. It makes no sense to keep any of this quiet. I noticed that Turkey reacted with a degree of surprise, for one of the consequences of the leak – which is regrettable and, from my point of view, absolutely so – is that I know the candidate countries’ reactions even before the reports are adopted, and the Turkish reaction tends towards astonishment. No doubt they had reckoned on a rather more favourable assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">So I want to reiterate very clearly that, although we entirely acknowledge what has been achieved in Turkey, we have to point out to the Turks that there are still problems with a number of issues to do with fundamental rights, that Turkey’s willingness to be bound by the rulings of the Court of Human Rights is still problematic, and that there are, in particular, major problems when it comes to implementing the reforms that have already been decided on. There is a considerable implementation deficit here, and the government recognises this and wants to do something about it.</p>
<p class="contents">President Prodi has just made reference to the problem of Cyprus. I must, again, do likewise, because I want to inform you that the Commission has today taken a new step, one that is new and may well lead to controversy. In our strategy paper, we have linked Turkey’s desire for accession to the Cyprus issue.</p>
<p class="contents">In order that there may be no misunderstanding, and also with Turkish reactions in mind, let me explain – as I must – that this is not a condition. We have to adhere strictly to the Helsinki conclusions, which state that this is not a condition. It is a statement of fact. We are simply stating the fact that failure to resolve the Cyprus issue would represent a major obstacle to Turkey’s European ambitions. To say that is no more than to state a fact, but I do not, of course, deny that such a statement of such a fact acquires political significance when contained in a strategy document of this sort, and I can also tell you that this political message, this political significance is deliberate. The Commission wanted to make it clear that it can see such a political connection and wanted, in so doing, to encourage Turkey to be even more pro-active in order to resolve the Cyprus question on the basis of the UN’s plan.</p>
<p class="contents">I am firmly convinced that the elections in the Turkish part of Cyprus will open a window of opportunity, and that, in their immediate aftermath, greater pressure must be exerted on all parties in order to introduce some impetus into a situation that has been bogged down for some time. I do indeed think that a message of this sort from Europe helps the present Turkish Government, in that it gives it a strong argument against those elements in Turkey that have been standing in the way of further progress, particularly on the Cyprus issue.</p>
<p class="contents">That is something I wanted to explain to you, as the coming days will certainly see wide-ranging international discussion of this question. We have always said that the accession process is intended to be a catalyst for resolving the Cyprus issue, and we must, I think, use every available opportunity to deal with the anachronistic situation of a future Member State of the European Union with a barbed wire fence and UN troops deployed there in order to protect the two ethnic groups from each other. For us as Europeans, that is simply not acceptable, it is unworthy of us …</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">… and that is why the Commission has decided to take this step. As this is the last occasion on which the Commission will be able to put such comprehensive reports before Parliament, let me conclude by again thanking you very, very warmly for your cooperation, which has always been constructive, fruitful and trusting.</p>

Having said that, I intend to keep it brief. You mentioned the material that has been published. I find it intolerable that certain things should get into the press without Parliament having the documents in question. Commissioner Verheugen, to what do you attribute this state of affairs?</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Now for my second question. Whilst I would encourage you to work towards the candidate countries actually implementing what has been agreed, I would also ask you whether it is not the case that we have to set them a good example, for example in matters of stability policy? Do we not also, for our part, have to do everything possible to adhere to the Treaties, in order to give a good example to our future partners in the European Union?</p>
<p class="contents">My third point has to do with Turkey. We are all very glad that Turkey has chosen this particular way forward. The Turks are our friends and partners, but do we not also have to distinguish between that which is theoretical and what is put into practice? Where Turkey’s membership is concerned, I ask you to consider the possibility of another form of relationship, for example by way of a privileged partnership. The majority in our group favours good, strong and neighbourly relations founded upon a privileged partnership.</p>

Let me just say in all seriousness that it is perhaps a weakness in the Community’s procedures that the Commission has to be sent too many sensitive documents before it can take a decision. Leaks are a regular occurrence as soon as papers leave my office. I knew that this would happen. When, at 6 p.m. last Friday evening, in accordance with Commission rules, we had to dispatch the papers, I was in no doubt whatever that my weekend was, so to speak, done for – and so it was! I told the Commission this morning that I had no wish to tell them how much political interference I had endured in the last few days, on the part of Heads of Government and foreign ministers from every quarter, because I do not wish to give the impression that the Commission gives in to such pressure. The real problem with these leaks is that they limit the Commission’s capacity to act. We have been unable to make any amendments today, because all and sundry would have been able to draw comparisons between what happened today and what we originally wanted. That is profoundly sad, Mr Poettering, and I cannot give you an explanation. We are dealing here with derelictions of duty by individuals. Past attempts to discover who was responsible have failed time and time again, and I no longer have any confidence that such attempts will prove successful. What I can do is ask Parliament to forgive this manifest untoward conduct by members of staff whom I do not know by name, but which I hope you will excuse.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with you as regards the second question. If we were to set the number of problems that have been identified with the new Member States against the number of infringement proceedings brought against long-standing Member States in any given year, you would discover a startling discrepancy. The fact is that the number of infringements of the Treaties about which we have to complain to the present Member States every year is many times higher than the number of problem areas that we have now identified. I entirely share your view that, if we were to be able to measure the present Member States against the same benchmarks that we apply to the candidates for membership, we would, in one area or another, get some perhaps surprising results, whether in the area to which you referred – that of macro-economic discipline – or, perhaps in others as well.</p>
<p class="contents">What you said on the subject of Turkey is nothing new to me; it is a point of view that I respect. You will be aware that this is an area in which the Commission has a clear mandate from the Council, and that it must act accordingly. I would like to use this opportunity to make just one comment. A discussion of the principles behind Turkey acceding or not acceding is necessary and has to be conducted. Where, then, if not in this House? Where if not among the people of Europe? I am in full agreement with that. I simply ask that, in this discussion, we should never lose sight of the fact that we in Europe have a direct interest in Turkey being a fully-developed democracy, a fully developed state under the rule of law, with respect for human rights and protection for minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">If we constantly keep that in mind, then I do not actually have any fear that this necessary and unavoidable discussion might do any damage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, we also identified problem areas and then sent out what we called ‘early warning letters’, the sort of thing that in my schooldays in Germany was called a ‘blue letter’ – I believe that, in English, they are called ‘red letters’ – which always contained the threat that if you did not buckle down to work at once, then you risked having to repeat a year. The results were very interesting. Almost half the cases that we identified have, in the interim, already been sorted out, so that they do not appear in the concluding monitoring report. We will now also be writing to the governments, and I know that, in every case, the Commission’s insights will be accepted – nobody disputes that – and that all the governments will be cooperative, so I believe that we will be able to sort the problems out. Some of the governments, for example, have told me that the relevant legislation is already on track. Monitoring has undoubtedly proven its worth as a method that helps us to make progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The only thing I can say in response to your comment on Romania is that the encouraging political and economic stability that we have seen in Romania over the past two years is continuing, and that, in view of this stability, Romania is actually in a very good position to achieve the objective it seeks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am entirely optimistic that far and away the greater part of it will be. Although we cannot exclude the possibility of mishaps in one instance or another, I will reiterate that all the problems that might crop up are capable of being isolated and will not result in any overall danger to the internal market, the Agricultural Policy, or the food market as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may turn to Romania and Bulgaria, it is certainly the case that Romania still has a long way to go, but there is no doubt that it has, over the last two years, caught up to a significant degree. Bulgaria and Romania were given their financial signal when we undertook to present the financial package in the first half of next year, that is, during the Irish Presidency, and, moreover, very early on in the year. I have already discussed in depth with the Irish finance minister how this can be handled. I regard the political and technical difficulties involved in the financial package for Bulgaria and Romania as being manageable, for the reason that we intend to use the same methods, the same principles and the same rules as we did for the Ten. We are not putting together a new package for Romania and Bulgaria; instead, we are, so to speak, extrapolating what we have already done for the Ten. That is also the only option available to us if our orders are that the financial package for Romania and Bulgaria is not to prejudice the next Financial Perspective, which, in its turn, should not prejudice the conclusion of negotiations with Romania and Bulgaria. That is why we can do no other than choose the same methodology that we have already chosen for the Ten. So I do not think that is so terribly difficult and do not want to exclude the possibility of our being able to make perceptible progress in this area in the first six months of 2004. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Germany, there is a ‘Chancellor of Unity’ and now also a ‘Commissioner for the Unification of Europe’. My sincere congratulations on this. I am particularly glad that, in your report, you have quite clearly given priority to the political criteria in respect of Turkey. This is an important point. It is evident that the progress made is significant to the Turkish public. I think we should note this with a sense of gratitude.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I have to conclude from your report that you are fairly disappointed with what has actually happened. So am I, to say the least. I thought that more would have been done than has actually been the case, especially with regards to the position of the army; this at any rate, is evident from your report. These are matters with major implications. Your optimism concerning the ten countries that will be joining the EU on 1 May relates to minor aspects that can still be ironed out. I think that the big step towards the democratic constitutional state – which still has to be taken in practice – is of such a scale that we can hardly expect this to be completed in a year from now. Correct me if I am wrong, Commissioner, but is the date of December 2004 either the date on which we will no longer take our political community of values as such seriously, or as the date on which the guillotine comes down on Turkey's membership? In that sense, I think that this date is causing us increasing anxiety. Would it therefore not be preferable, in respect of Turkey, if we were to focus on programme-based progress, or guidance, on the road to a democratic constitutional state? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At present we are working extremely hard to show the Principality of Liechtenstein and the Czech Republic a possible way out of this problem. I cannot yet predict how successful we will be, but we are trying, and we are doing our best, but obviously, you never know.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with you, Mr Oostlander, that it is precisely in the area of the military that we had hoped for more progress in Turkey. There are two issues that give me particular cause for concern. The first is that Turkish military personnel are still in supervisory authorities controlling important areas of civilian life, such as the National Council of Education or the National Council of Radio and Television. The military have lost nothing there. It is also the case that large portions of the Turkish defence budget are not subject to the control of parliament, and when a budget is outside parliament’s control, then that clearly indicates a lack of democracy. There is no question about that.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that we need new benchmarks for Turkey or a new deadline or anything else. Turkey itself will decide whether or not the end assessment will be favourable. It is up to them to press ahead with reforms and, as Mr Poettering quite rightly said, to put these into practice, so that we can make an assessment. The political conditions governing accession have been met. The roadmap is clear: a decision at the end of next year. The Commission will accomplish this task seriously, fairly and objectively and will not shy away from this responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In various accession countries, there are a number of sectors, and it is often these very areas of policy which require increased efforts. I am, for example, referring to discrimination in the area of social policy and employment, the right to asylum, and justice. Specific problems spring to mind; they are particularly shocking to our EU citizens, and I assume also to the citizens of those countries. I am talking here about such things as the discrimination against the Roma, child prostitution and human trafficking. If these points do not receive priority attention in the sense that they need to be sorted out prior to accession, what means do we have of exerting influence after it? In this connection, I would quote to you your own words: these countries will then have joined and, as you stated in your introduction, you will have very little influence on these new Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, as regards the political, economic and social integration of minorities, Europe has problems not only with Roma. I could name groups in a number of Member States for whom discrimination is similarly prevalent, just to put the record straight. It is not, therefore, just the south eastern Europeans that have problems with the integration of the Roma minority, but also well-established old Member States that have problems integrating national minorities. As regards the Roma, they were and are, as you know, the main focus of our pre-accession efforts, and we will not declare any country ready for accession that has not devised and implemented a viable strategy for their integration. I have, however, said many times in this House that it would be a complete illusion to believe that the problem of discrimination and the Roma could be solved before accession in the sense of there being no more discrimination; that is a challenge for at least a whole generation. What we can reasonably achieve is, precisely, to see a policy drawn up and implemented that reduces discrimination, and I think that we have achieved just that.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the other issues such as prostitution and trafficking in women and girls, we repeatedly and emphatically point out these are, of course, prohibited in all of these countries. We cannot say that there is a shortfall in the legislation but we can say that there is a shortfall in its enforcement. Allow me to say something else, though, since, recently in particular, the issues of which I am all too aware have become apparent at Czech/German and Czech/Austrian border patrols. When we talk about prostitution and even child prostitution, then there are always two sides. There are those who offer their services or are forced to offer their services, but there are also those who ask. I have always been in favour and have always said that the issue needs to be tackled from both sides. I do not believe that we can solve it if we only tackle it from the angle of these unfortunate women, girls and children, who are abused for the purpose of sexual adventures, or whatever else. It must also be tackled from the angle of those who feature as customers, who create the demand and also an offer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have three questions. Firstly, it was announced in the media in Poland that fifty-one complaints have been lodged, and in Parliament it is said that an iron fist is needed. Perhaps you should also use the iron fist in your area, but when the iron fist is directed against people, then it will be difficult and not just the officials will be affected. I have the impression that the social burdens in Poland will increase; the wind is blowing in the government’s face.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question is what do you think about the regional processes in the candidate countries? In Prague there is 3% unemployment, in the industrialised area of Northern Moravia there is approximately 30%. My third point is that we want good partnerships. We have just spoken about the Roma and if we want to have a good partnership with Russia then the issue of Russian minorities in the Baltic States must be tackled with greater consistency and seriousness, without political reservation and discrimination, but rather in a way that really leads to a solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not know what you mean by fifty-one cases and an iron hand. I am familiar with neither the number nor the choice of words. As regards Poland, I believe that it has proved itself capable of fulfilling the conditions governing accession and of implementing the <span class="italic">acquis</span>, and the Polish Government is working hard at dealing with the problems that have been identified, but there are nine of them rather than fifty-one.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards regional differences in development, this is an issue that the Commission takes very seriously and on which we report regularly, and we are including these regional differences in development into the strategy for the structural funds that will be introduced in all of these countries from next year and which should significantly help to reduce these regional discrepancies.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of the Russian minority in the Baltic States, Mr Modrow, I do not agree with you that the issue is being dealt with in an inconsistent manner. On the contrary, I think that the Commission is handling the issue extremely well, but that there are nationalistic forces in the Russian Duma that are irresponsible in their approach to it. I can go into further detail if you so wish. As far as the situation of the Russian minority is concerned, we have been rigorous in ensuring that Estonia and Latvia meet the corresponding standard, and they are doing so. That does not mean there is no room for improvement. I also mentioned, in talks last week in Moscow with President Putin and the Russian Foreign Minister, Mr Ivanov, and other leading representatives, that we are able and willing to bring about improvement, but that overall the standards that exist in Europe regarding minorities have been met in both countries.</p>

Having said that, I have a specific question relating to Cyprus and Turkey. I greatly welcome the clarification in the progress report of the fact that the non-resolution of the Cyprus issue is an obstacle. I think that it is also extremely difficult to imagine beginning negotiations with a country that is, at the same time – as will be the situation under international law from May next year – occupying part of the EU territory.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads me to ask a specific question: at present Turkish citizens in their masses are being given passports for the illegal North Cypriot state, which is intended, on the one hand, to change the demographic situation and, on the other, to prevent an opposition victory. That is the current situation. Even if we do not recognise this election, we know that the result will greatly influence what happens next. I think that it will also be extremely important for Turkey. My specific question to you is, therefore: do you think that it is possible to influence Turkey in this area and to make it clear that we want to put an end to this? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, these elections are politically important, especially this year. I have noted with satisfaction the assurances given to me by my Turkish partners in dialogue that Turkey would not allow a shadow to fall over these elections. What we, and many sides, are describing means, however, that one already has. That is clearly an attempt to manipulate electoral lists so that the desired election result is achieved. The possibilities of influencing it are extremely limited.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that these elections are being monitored by both independent media and independent non-governmental organisations, which will regularly report on them so that a European public opinion can emerge and exert pressure.

What I know about this system is that we have been aware of the issue for about a year and a half and that initially the Polish agricultural administration responded very hesitantly and then decided on a change of strategy, which led to a considerable time delay. If you have evidence that Commission staff gave wrong advice or false information, then I ask you to let me know, as I would like to look into the issue. I am not aware of this having happened.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing, though, I am willing to concede: what we have experienced here is further proof that our administrative structures are so unbelievably complicated in some areas that an accession country cannot, even if it wants to, fulfil these demands in a relatively short space of time. This is especially true for the area of agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">It has also been our experience that the Sapard programme has proven to be the most difficult of all pre-accession programmes, because it makes the greatest demands of the new Members and because, of all the systems, it is the most complicated and carries the most obligations. I will readily concede that we are dealing with an extremely complicated system but that, if you want to discuss who is responsible for the fact that we have or must have such complicated structures in this area, then that is quite a different matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first question I would like to ask concerns the so-called ‘status law’, the law applying to Hungarians residing in neighbouring countries: what do you make of the current situation, Commissioner? Do you really think that the commitment to consult neighbouring countries before amending that law has been respected?

For a long time, I have endeavoured, with the utmost discretion, to help all countries concerned avoid any conflicts that might result from it. In the meantime we have reached the point where there is agreement between Romania and Hungary and the discussion process between the Slovak Republic and Hungary has not yet been concluded. I urgently advise against us interfering there, as this is more of an opportunity for the two states to talk and act in a neighbourly fashion. If our help is required, then it is available. At the moment, however, the two countries are talking to each other and I think that they will reach an outcome sooner or later. Even if they do not, European Community law will apply in this matter from 1 May 2004, and this will, in any case, rule out any differences in treatment on the grounds of nationality.</p>
<p class="contents">The other question is a very complicated issue in the light of the domestic disputes in Hungary. I do not think that we are dealing with a systematic problem here, that is, with a problem that could be said to show that Hungary has not met the conditions for accession. Rather, we are dealing with massive, extremely weighty and very emotional domestic disputes. I do not think that it is for me to get involved in such a conflict and give my opinion on it. Just as little as I would get involved in domestic disputes in current Member States, we should now understand that our new Member States have left behind the phase where, as it were, they were under some kind of surveillance. I do not feel in any way responsible any more for domestic events in these countries. To observe and judge them is now a matter for Parliament, a matter for the Council, but it is certainly not a matter for the executive power to judge what a freely elected government and a freely elected parliament do. I urge you to understand that I do not want the Commission to start getting involved in a future Member State’s internal politics. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As regards Romania, I would like to add that even recently we have seen visible measures against corruption, and this should be seen as a good thing. There is one issue that I ask you to consider closely, Commissioner, namely the spread of some aspects of petty crime to neighbouring countries. This causes great problems and I ask you, Commissioner, to really urge Romania to do something to counter this; it would be in their own interests.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Turkey, I find your report very well balanced, and the issue of Cyprus was also handled well. I would like to ask you, Commissioner, whether you would join with me and perhaps also urge all parties in this House not to make Turkey a campaign issue for the next European elections, since I fear that there are some forces that see ‘For or against Turkey’ as the election campaign issue for 2004. I hope that you agree with me that this should not be the case. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You know, Mr Swoboda, that all parties in this Parliament must be completely at liberty to pick out any European problem as a central issue. I have said so many times: I cannot and will not prevent any one from also raising in elections an issue of such fundamental importance to the future of Europe as the possible accession of Turkey. Indeed, where else are they to do so if not with the electorate in the run-up to an election? As I understand the basics of democracy, citizens have the right to have such issues discussed with them. That is completely clear to me and I will not, therefore, criticise anyone.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only repeat what I have already said, namely that the discussion should be conducted in such a way that no harm is done and that in doing so the common European interest is always taken into consideration and that the public are told that we want something from Turkey. What we want from Turkey is that in its political, strategic and geographical situation they take on security functions from us, both politically and economically, which no one else in the world is in a position to take on. We need Turkey on our side. The public also needs to be told this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I speak as rapporteur for Bulgaria, a country on course for joining the European Union in 2007. I hope that all possible steps are going to be taken to complete negotiations in 2004, ideally by May 2004. This would send a very powerful message to the people of Bulgaria. While the Commission correctly states that the accession process for Bulgaria is based on the ‘own merits’ principle, nevertheless it has also said that it is committed to a common accession treaty for Bulgaria and Romania together, by the end of 2005. Bulgaria should have no difficulty with that and I hope that Romania will meet that target as well, but I would not like to think that Bulgaria’s aspirations would in any way be held back by slower progress on the part of her northern neighbour.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to Cyprus, I agree there are strong possibilities for the two communities to reach a comprehensive settlement, but this requires goodwill and flexibility on <span class="italic">both</span> sides and indeed pressure from the Commission on both sides. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must apologise for the irregularities and derelictions of duty that have been blamed on staff unknown to me, but I cannot allow the fact that duties were neglected anywhere to lead me to also violate my own and to disregard the Commission rules. I ask for your understanding. We sent the document to all rapporteurs – and to you – a few minutes after it was adopted by the Commission. I would, however, urge you to evaluate the progress in regular personal dialogue with me as we often did last year. As regards Bulgaria and Romania, I agree with you. The one country should not wait for the other, and we have also guaranteed this, but at present there is no need and no reason to contemplate decoupling the one country from the other in this accession process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This outcome was, however, inevitable once we did not opt for the most sensible accession method, that which we were advocating as early as 1992 and which consisted in creating a large political confederation and in then having the Eastern European countries subscribe to each Community policy as their interests or capacities progressively dictated.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council, on a proposal from the Commission, preferred a one-phase accession formula to a unified system, leading implicitly to a super state, and we are now going to suffer the consequences, because it is neither technically nor politically viable.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also striking that the candidate country that comes in for the most criticism, often for trivial reasons, is Poland, in fact the freest and most pugnacious country at the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Cyprus, the Commission is beginning to ask itself questions about the Turkish occupation. It is not too early. We need to demand that Turkey withdraw its troops immediately. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have told us that this wayward trend is difficult to control, and that worries me. Then I note that the report on accession preparations treats Turkey in the same way as the other candidates, the ten plus two, in that way seeming, contrary to what you said, to anticipate the decision to be taken by the Council at the end of 2004 on this issue. Finally, I notice that, before the ten countries have even entered the European Union, they are already being threatened by safeguard clauses and being severely rebuked by the Commission, which is, furthermore, adopting a schizophrenic stance, systematically alarming the candidate countries and, at the same time, getting them to believe in themselves. Should the candidate countries really be put on trial in such a way? Or, does this awkwardness on the part of the Commission not reveal a fundamental methodological error which has not allowed the specific characteristics of each country to be properly taken into consideration in the enlargement process and which is in danger of having long-term consequences? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
