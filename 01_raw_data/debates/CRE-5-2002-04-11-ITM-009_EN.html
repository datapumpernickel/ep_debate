Today, it is for happier reasons than those behind our last discussion of Angola in this House. The entire international community, and especially the European Union, must make it clear that we expect all parties to do everything they can to ensure that this peace process is definitive and irreversible. The Angolan government has done well to cease all military offensives and Unita’s political leaders and military command have acted properly. All concerned have demonstrated the ability to enter into dialogue, which is to be emphasised and applauded.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial now to lay the foundations for a shared democratic life. Military units must be disbanded and the State administration must be extended to cover the whole country. Unita must be integrated into democratic life. Conditions must be established for the democratic rule of law to take root, respecting the rights of the opposition, press freedom, increasing the transparency of public authorities, fighting against corruption and influence peddling, combating poverty and social exclusion and promoting the country’s development in an environment of peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who were previously dedicated to war must be reintegrated into normal civilian life and all those who were forced to flee their native areas by the violence of the civil war must be returned to their homes. As soon as the necessary conditions are in place, elections must be scheduled. I also wish to call on all parties to commit themselves to ensuring that the situation of the Portuguese children who disappeared months ago is quickly cleared up. The key word, therefore, is to stimulate: to stimulate the good faith of all parties and to trust in the ability and the determination of the Angolan people. So that, even thousands of kilometres away, they hear our voice in Luanda! The very best of luck, Angola! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, having been reduced to a pathetic caricature of a country, with its people living a life of hell on earth, hope came to this long-suffering nation the day after the Unita rebel leader Jonas Savimbi was shot to death. The new dialogue, set up immediately between the government and Unita representatives and born of a common will to restore peace, has the support of the entire international community. This promises to be a turning point in Angola’s history. Angola could become a model of national reconciliation, normalisation and return to the rule of law. In a word, it could bring its people back to life.</p>
<p class="contents">Angola has acquired the resources and is making the efforts needed to reunite its people and remould its society. Nature has given this country sufficient resources and wealth to deliver it from need and give it the best conditions of life on earth. It is by counting on us and on action by the entire international community, especially multiple support from the Union, that Angola will be able to assure itself of a future.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union can no longer use the excuse of danger from armed forces and can now send food aid to the starving population. There is no country more in need or more willing to follow the democratic rules and respect for human rights suggested by the European Union. What better example than our European history to avoid the horrors of neo-colonialism in Angola and lead the country, in transparency and independence, towards sustainable economic development and the emancipation of its people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapid development of the situation and the positive prospects that are currently opening up for the country and for the Angolan people do, in fact, allow for a different approach to the country’s situation, which is now fundamentally geared towards implementing measures that will bring about the consolidation of peace and reconstruction and the development and progress of a country and of a people who have suffered inordinately as a result of decades of war.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, furthermore, we must emphasise and applaud the enormous steps forward already taken in this short period of time since the death of Jonas Savimbi. In particular we welcome the significance and scope of the memorandum of understanding signed on 30 March in the framework of and as a supplement to the Lusaka protocol, in addition to the amnesty proposed by the government and approved on 3 April by the National Assembly, and also the formal signing of the ceasefire, on 4 April, by the Angolan armed forces and Unita. These are measures that, in addition to the emergency programme put forward by the Government, designed to return four million displaced people to their home regions, to reintegrate the 150 thousand demobilised soldiers and ex-combatants and to rehabilitate 100 thousand people who have been mutilated and 50 thousand children orphaned by the war, make up the basic framework for launching the country into a new era.</p>
<p class="contents">In order for this new era to become a reality on which there can be no going back, however, what is needed now more than ever before is the support and the commitment of all Angola’s political and social forces to ensure the mobilisation of the commitment and resources which exist and which are crucial to the new country that seems to want to come into being. In this context and at the same time as the essential and definitive end to Unita’s military activity and its total demilitarisation, it is also important to guarantee and provide incentives for its full integration into the normal political life of Angola as an unarmed political party.</p>
<p class="contents">Still crucial, furthermore, is the active and positive contribution of the international community, including the European Union, specifically in terms of providing urgent humanitarian aid for the Angolan people and, more generally, in terms of the country’s reconstruction. Where the European Union is concerned, and given the state of weakness and destruction that country is in and the enormous amount of work on reconstruction and rehabilitation that must be undertaken, as well as the importance of this country in the regional framework, special attention and support are clearly justified as is even, perhaps, the adoption of a specific aid programme for the consolidation of peace and for the reconstruction of Angola.</p>
<p class="contents">The way in which the situation is developing is encouraging. The measures and instruments already adopted appear to be a step in the right direction. The very prospect of holding elections, which have already been announced, indicates the desire to continue along the path of political normalisation, even if the path is pitted with difficulties and with hard choices to be made. This is a time for optimism and all our action must be determined by unlimited support for turning the hope that the Angolans have today into reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We could scarcely have imagined at that time that events would move on at such a pace that, today, great expectations for peace and reconciliation have appeared in that long-suffering country. The award of that Prize certainly helped to strengthen the spirit of peace and the demands for peace to be achieved that were made to everyone following the death of Unita’s leader.</p>
<p class="contents">Angola is now emerging from that tragic category of countries that have come to be known as ‘war-torn countries’, and is embarking on a period of building a lasting peace. All humanity must welcome this, particularly those who love Angola and who feel infinite pity for the indescribable suffering of its people, who, for decades, have been the victims of a bloody conflict between the two factions fighting for power. All of those who make up the anonymous population of Angola are, quite simply, heroes and martyrs! This extraordinary people now has the right to peace, to freedom, to democracy and to progress. It has the right to bread and freedom; it has the right to the future. Only in this way will the enormous hopes raised by decolonisation and by independence finally be fulfilled. The international community must, now more than ever, demonstrate moral and material solidarity with the Angolan people. There are thousands and thousands of children abandoned and missing. On this point we must also demand the truth about the young lives of two Portuguese citizens who were killed recently in a brutal ambush, an event that is shrouded in mystery. Angola has thousands and thousands of mutilated people and millions of displaced people. They are all hoping for a solution to their tragedy. The return of peace and the reconstruction of Angola will have to address this situation, which is a genuine human disaster. Peace and democracy will only truly be achieved in Angola when the monopoly of power is brought to an end and the diversity of political opinion can be expressed without hesitation or fear, when power is made truly democratic and when there is a fair and equitable distribution of resources. We must be at once optimistic and prudent. We must be optimistic because Angola is now heading in the right direction; prudent and vigilant in order to ensure that there is no change of mind or backsliding. We are surprised, in particular, that the voices of prestigious independent intellectual, religious and political figures should have been so discreet. In fact, unless civil society comes fully to the fore in Angola, everything could become more fragile, limited and uncertain. In any event, it is time to say: long live Angola! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The declaration by the Angolan Government giving Unita a bone fide role on the political stage and time to reorganise is, in our view, a step in the right direction. We are encouraging the two sides to take measures to involve representatives of the whole of Angolan civil society, including the clergy, who have played an active role here, as Mr Lage has just pointed out, in discussions to bring about national reconciliation and sustainable peace.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as humanitarian aid is concerned, to which Mr Miranda referred, we are providing important humanitarian aid to displaced people inside Angola and constantly calling on the government to take additional measures to help get emergency aid to zones which, for the moment, are still accessible. We are also encouraging the government to include the extension of humanitarian aid to the entire country in its negotiations with Unita as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">We are well aware of the fact that the presence of land- and antipersonnel mines is a huge obstacle to humanitarian aid convoys, to the return of displaced people and to various recovery operations. From this point of view, it is by improving safety on the ground that we shall be able to start using specialist organisations in mine-clearing operations, for which serious financial resources have already been earmarked.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as political rights are concerned, we are calling on the Angolan Government to strengthen democracy by improving human rights and freedom of the press as a <span class="italic">sine qua non </span>to the restoration of lasting peace. Basic political rights, freedom of movement, constitutional reform, electoral reform, a census – all predicated on the ceasefire – will all determine whether or not free and fair elections are held in the future. We are prepared to support the organisation of elections as soon as local conditions allow.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategy in the long term is currently being discussed both with the government and civil society and at Commission and Union level. We are endeavouring, with this strategy, to forge very close, very permanent and very coherent links between aid, rehabilitation and development, which are the three problems we have to cope with. We need to release important financial resources to help the return of displaced persons, including under micro projects, and to restore agricultural means of production and livestock structures so that social and economic life can gradually resume in the zones affected by the conflict. We all know from experience that zones which have been prey to conflict and mined as these have are very delicate zones when it comes to development operations.</p>
<p class="contents">We will of course continue to provide aid for health and education and to strengthen the capabilities of the provincial administrations because, in the final analysis, they will be the ones in charge of setting up and maintaining structures, systems and the social and local fabric.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we also welcome news of the Angolan Government’s stated intention to organise an international conference on reconstructing the country. We stand by our conviction that all sections of society must be taken into account in the reconstruction project which is to be presented and which – subject to examination of course – we are prepared to continue to support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
