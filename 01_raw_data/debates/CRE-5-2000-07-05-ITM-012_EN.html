<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jackson (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. –</span> Mr President, the idea that is fundamental to the report that I am bringing forward is that the proposal from the European Commission for a recommendation on this subject should be changed to become a directive and, as you will see from my report, this secured near unanimous backing in the Environment Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The members of the committee agreed with me that a recommendation is far too weak an instrument in this instance. I suppose a recommendation is really rather the equivalent of us all moving down into the centre of Strasbourg and attending the cathedral in order to make an act of collective prayer. That really is all that a recommendation is. There is no way in which the European Commission can go back to Member States and say that they have not complied with a recommendation because a recommendation merely says that they may do something, it does not say that they must do something.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is very worried about this report because it recognises that if we persist in insisting on a directive rather than a recommendation, the whole thing may founder in the Council. I recognise the Commission's worries. I did faithfully try in the Environment Committee to get the members to agree to a recommendation rather than a directive. I got a very rude answer from them which I will not repeat to you but which is basically reflected in my report.</p>
<p class="contents">They want a directive and not a recommendation. And, indeed, if the guidelines on environmental inspection which the Commission is so keen to see survive were incorporated in a recommendation, my committee feels that they will simply be ignored. We want to see a directive which definitely commits the Member States to introduce environmental inspections operating on broadly similar lines.</p>
<p class="contents">I must underline that what we do not want to see, in case anybody hangs this round my neck, is a supra-national European environment inspectorate: lots of little men and women in blue uniforms with gold stars rushing round the Member States, reporting back to Brussels saying this is wrong or indeed, in the case of Germany, this is right. We do not need that kind of supra-national inspectorate. I believe, and my committee agrees with me, that the primary responsibility for enforcing European Union environment legislation should be firmly lodged where it belongs, with the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot understand the Commission's readiness to propose only the minimum possible. Neglect of European Union environment law forms an alarming background to this proposal. Yesterday was a historic day in the history of the European Union, not, I hasten to add only because of the visit of President Chirac to Strasbourg, but because it was the day of the first report of a fine levied by the European Court of Justice, an actual fine of EUR 20 000 a day on Greece for failure to comply with a European Union environment directive. But it is interesting to note that that case was actually launched thirteen years ago and relates to a directive which dates back even further.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment there are currently nine other environment cases which have come back to the Court of Justice for a second time because countries have ignored earlier judgments. There are no less than 157 cases still pending and I regret to have to say that in many cases the European Commission has not been able to act, to bring cases to the Court of Justice, because it does not know what is happening in Member States as the countries concerned have not reported back to Brussels on what they are doing about legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the reasons that they have not reported is that the countries themselves do not know. Why do they not know? Because they do not have systems of environmental inspection which form the essential raft on which the whole edifice of compliance with European environment law is built.</p>
<p class="contents">We need the kind of directive that the Environment Committee would like to see. A recommendation will do no good. I hope that the European Commission has the courage, and I mean courage, to accept the European Parliament amendments. I hope that the European Commission has the courage to go into the conciliation process arm in arm with the Parliament against, and it will be against, the Council. I think some members of the Council are really quite wobbly in the direction of a directive rather than a recommendation. The tiny concessions so far offered by the Council lodged in the preamble to this proposal are simply not enough.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Davies (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, those of us who survived the conciliation procedure for the water framework directive must be delighted that here we have an issue which is entirely clear-cut and easily understandable. The first issue is that we want equal and effective enforcement of environmental legislation across the European Union and we must all agree to that principle.</p>
<p class="contents">The question obviously is why we have not had that before. Why have the Commissioner's predecessors not brought forward proposals before now and why are the proposals now introduced so miserably weak? There is also a question for Member States. What have they been doing signing up to environmental legislation if in reality they do not have the means to check properly that it has been carried out and have no intention of ensuring that it is properly enforced?</p>
<p class="contents">I have chemical companies in my constituency in the north-west of England. Some of them, I am sorry to say, discharge polluting materials into air and water. They get inspected. Action is taken. They are forced to clean up their act. They pay the price for that. But they are competing with chemical companies elsewhere in this European Union which are not having to carry out those checks, which are not having to pay the price and they are not able to compete therefore on a level playing field. It is simply unfair.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is the clear conflict here between the Parliament and the Council. Any student who wants to understand conciliation procedure or codecision procedure has a nice straightforward case study here. We have codecision powers but we have the threat from the Council that if we do not fall into line then they will abandon the whole legislation. Well, they might as well, as Mrs Jackson has said.</p>
<p class="contents">The message for the French Presidency is that we want tangible progress. We do not want to see this abandoned. There is room for compromise, presumably over the implementation date. All the institutions in the European Union want the laws enforced properly. It is time to give these warm but rather woolly sentiments some real meaning and action.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, may I first of all thank the rapporteur, Mrs Jackson, and the Committee on the Environment for its work on this proposal on environmental inspections. I cannot resist the temptation to point out to Mrs Jackson that she reminds me of my promise to the Committee on the Environment not to propose new directives all the time, but rather to concentrate on implementation. The bad implementation of environmental rules has nothing to do with the lack of such rules and directives. We have a lot of these and we really want to achieve something. We want to see results.</p>
<p class="contents">So we came straight to the key issue: was it to be a recommendation or a directive? It will not be a surprise to you that the Commission cannot agree to the proposed change to a directive, for the following reasons. The Commission's 1996 communication on implementing Community environmental law noted a disparity between Member States' inspection systems and recognised the necessity of ensuring that minimum inspection tasks were performed. Maybe it is not such a bad idea to have those people in blue uniforms with gold stars to check on what is happening!</p>
<p class="contents">It recommended that guidelines should be established, leaving to the Member States the choice of structures and mechanisms, fitting in where appropriate with their existing systems.</p>
<p class="contents">A recommendation will achieve something. Some Member States already have well-developed inspectorates or agencies, and the guidelines will ensure that they operate them in accordance with common standards without necessarily having to change their systems that much. For those Member States which do not, the recommendation will be helpful to enable them in the first instance, with the possibility of Community funding for eligible Member States, to develop their infrastructure and capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">A directive might mean that some Member States will have great difficulty complying with it in its entirety from its coming into force, and this was not deemed to be practically or psychologically desirable by the Commission. I am convinced that the ‘carrot’ rather than the ‘stick’ approach will achieve a better result at the present state of development of national inspectorates.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already achieved some progress in the area with the IMPEL inspectors' exchange programme and the other work that IMPEL has done on inspections, monitoring frequency of inspections etc.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal should therefore be viewed as the first step in an ongoing programme, and the experience gained in this operation will help us to consider at subsequent stages how to broaden the nature, scope and application of the minimum requirements. The proposal requires Member States to report back on the operation, and I will take a personal interest in this. If it transpires that Member States are not applying it in practice then we will not shrink from bringing forward a proposal for a directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The attitude in the Council of the Member States, even those with well-developed inspectorates, was unanimously in favour of non-binding legislation at this stage. Being realistic, if Parliament insists on asking for a directive we will end up with no instrument at all. In that case we will have failed those Member States most in need of assistance and guidance, and the consequence will be no change in the status quo and no improvement in those Member States' implementation. For these reasons the Commission cannot accept any of the proposed amendments relating to changing the form of the proposal from a recommendation to a directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept the following amendments of substance: Amendment No 5 to help Member States distinguish between national – for example non-EU derived – law and EU law. Amendments Nos 6 and 11 which try to change voluntary reporting and advice schemes to mandatory ones. Amendment No 12, second part, because it does not add anything. The proposal already refers to reports being in a readily accessible database. Amendment No 13, second part, relating to reports of site visits being available within two months of inspection because the common position's wording “as soon as possible” is preferable. And Amendment No 14 which seeks to limit to brief data the compliance information in reports to the Commission, which is not sufficient for the Commission's purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if the proposal is to remain in the form of a recommendation, the Commission can accept in principle Amendments Nos 2, 10, second part, and 15, second part, in relation to point 9.1. They all concern the involvement of the EEA and/or IMPEL in certain activities relating to inspections. These were accepted by the Commission at the first reading stage and included in the Commission's revised proposal.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
