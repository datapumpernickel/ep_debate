<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Henri Weber (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ‘Television without Frontiers’ Directive is, without doubt, one of the success stories of the European Union. In 1989, when the first text was adopted, there were only about 50 television channels in Europe. Today, there are 50 times that many. The audiovisual landscape has been changed radically by satellite, cable, digital, the Internet and the mobile telephone. New media, new broadcasting methods and new services have appeared. There is therefore a crucial and urgent need to revise and extend the directive. Mrs Reding has announced that she will present these proposals to us in autumn. I take advantage of this occasion to congratulate her on her commitment to European television and to thank her for the attention she has clearly given to professionals from the sector. I invite her to pay attention to the three parts of this report, to our thoughts on the application of Articles 4 and 5, to the paths we propose for the revision of the Directive and to the significant problem posed by media concentration.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Articles 4 and 5, the results are good and these measures must be upheld. They are the minimum standards satisfying the most people and it is advisable not to downgrade them, even if pressure is growing to reduce regulation. We can, however, propose improvements when it comes to defining the concepts of ‘independent producer’ and ‘work’ or to establishing a more standardised grid of the results of the Member States, for example. Revising the directive is not easy. We must find the right balance so that the audiovisual sector does not become a purely commercial sector to the detriment of cultural diversity. At the same time, however, we must not hinder the development of a sector in the throes of a continuous technical revolution, which is very important for our industries and for our jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The standards laid down by the directive are minimal as it is, and they have not always prevented a slide towards commercialism and mindlessness in certain Member States. Unfortunately, the numerous interviews I have been able to have demonstrate that the general mood is such that the level of regulation will decrease under the combined pressure both of the industries and advertising and also of a number of Member States. That is why, together with my colleagues, I call for the legal basis chosen to be one that allows this text to be overseen by the Committee on Culture and Education. Without wishing to create hostilities, I am afraid that another committee might tackle this text from a more commercial than cultural angle. The proposals that I am submitting are not intended to deviate from the principles of the current Directive, which is based largely on self-regulation and which is not overly prescriptive. It does not deviate, either, from the two previous reports by our institution, including the one by my fellow MEP, Mrs Hieronymi.</p>
<p class="contents">This revision of the Directive must enhance a number of fundamental principles: free movement of European television broadcasts, free access to exceptional events, promotion of European works and recent independent productions, protection of minors and public order and protection of consumers thanks to the identification of content providers and to transparency in advertising and the right of reply. It must also promote the movement of national works in every country of the Union. We produce a great deal. We exchange too little among Europeans. We must remedy this shortcoming. We must also encourage European content to be shown on television. That can of course be promoted through the Media (Plus) programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like us to address the definition of what a work is. The ‘Television without Frontiers’ Directive indicates what it is not. It is not information. It is not advertising. Yet is it reality TV, for example? I would prefer – as would a number of professionals – an actual definition. I could also emphasise the role of public services. They must be able to carry out their remit. How can we help them to do this? I regret that my fellow MEPs have not followed my proposal for a European Public Audiovisual Service Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to invite the Commission to find the means to protect the diversity of television property and to prevent all excessive media concentration. Media pluralism is essential in democracy; since the Union keeps telling us that we cannot legislate in that area, it must at least help the Member States to lay down more stringent rules. On Tuesday 13 of next week, we are going to hold a seminar on this important issue, in Manchester. Since Mrs Reding is listening to us, I would like her to inform us of the developments envisaged by the Commission at this stage of the work, in particular on issues relating to advertising, to the field of application of the directive, to the support measures for the production of European and independent works and to the organisation of the regulation. What about adapting the country of origin principle and the principle of media pluralism? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I firmly believe that democracy is essentially a system of public opinion and that its quality therefore depends on the quality of what we have come to call freedom of expression, a right that not everybody understands properly. For me, freedom of expression is above all the right of each citizen to choose the channels of information he or she prefers. Consequently, in order to safeguard that right we must prevent too many media organisations from falling into the hands of a few, and I entirely agree with you, Mr Weber, on the need to combat the phenomena of concentration, but we must also consolidate a situation in which the media are not subjected to criteria laid down on a whim by the government that happens to be in power at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I believe these comments to be very general, and they lead to certain specific considerations which I would like to be implemented in the not too distant future. We must combat all initiatives that reduce the quality of freedom of expression. It is therefore not acceptable to interfere with the content of programmes. Let us stop doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that we should dictate to the commercial television channels how to administer their advertising, because advertising is essential to commercial television. They must respect the limit established by law, but we should not lay down how they must distribute advertising, because they know exactly how to make the source of their commercial survival viable.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Weber, we must establish the political objective — and this is where we disagree — of putting an end to a concept that I believe to pose certain difficulties: that of public service. That concept makes sense insofar as spectral space is limited and the governments must therefore regulate it by means of a system of franchises, which in the end become intimidatory. Nevertheless, Mr Weber, you have acknowledged that we are moving towards a world in which television must be redefined, a world in which television means conventional television as we know it, but also television via the Internet, television via mobile phone and television via all the new technologies. It is not therefore a scarce resource, and we must restrict State interventionism. I hope that in the not too distant future, this concept of public service will no longer be applied to commercial television.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like us to be able to agree on how to redefine the role of public television channels. They are fundamental, provided they adhere to the principle of subsidiarity, that is to say, that they make the programmes the viewers wish to see and cannot see on the commercial channels. Mr Weber, that is the principle of subsidiarity, which I defend.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, I believe technologies are changing and that consequently the perspectives are changing too. I also believe it is our responsibility to do our utmost to ensure the new ‘Television without frontiers’ Directive becomes an opportunity to increase the quality of democracy. I would therefore like to express my hope that we do a good job. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A proper media policy providing cultural values is crucial to broadening the understanding between our nations.</p>
<p class="contents">When the first legislative act on this subject was approved, my country – Hungary – was not yet a member of the European Communities. However, this legislation meets the requirements of our cultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards this topic, I should like to raise the question: why do we have to regulate the programmes on our television channels? The answer is very simple: because we want to save our national cultures and create a common European identity. In order to promote cultural diversity and build up a European identity, we need a stronger exchange of our cultural values, including our cinematographic heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">This new report is a further step in the right direction. The so-called quotas generally worked well. The cases where they failed to do so should be compiled and studied. However, we should give a more precise answer to the question: ‘What is a European production?’ How can we ensure that it will consist of as many films with cinematographic values as possible? For me, that is a crucial point. I am sure that European cinema helps European people – mainly the young people – to understand each other's sorrows and joys. Perhaps having a sub-quota, especially for feature and documentary films, would be an improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">The other question concerns the case of non-domestic productions. In smaller countries, such as Hungary, it is not a problem. On our television channels, many non-Hungarian and European films are broadcast. However, in some larger Member States, there are hardly any non-domestic European programmes. As the referendum on the Constitution shows, people from some larger nations hardly know anything about the values of the Central and Eastern European countries or of other smaller Member States. The European identity needs and deserves to be reflected, even on the channels of the bigger nations. Often our legislation just follows technical developments. I hope that, in the light of the digital revolution, we can pass proper legislation in due time. That is why I welcome Mr Weber's excellent report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Through the impact it has, it creates a strong and clear link between all Europeans; it remains one of the essential factors of intercultural dialogue and contributes to developing our European identity.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Weber’s report not only refers to the application of Articles 4 and 5, but also to issues such as the revision of the Directive itself or media pluralism. Through my amendments, I was particularly keen to encourage assistance to be given to Europe’s special character so that cultural diversity, freedom, pluralism and independence of the media remain the crucial components of Europe’s audiovisual model. I also attached great importance to prioritising qualitative methods of analysing cultural content when confronted by the offensive of private or commercial production companies on the European markets. It is therefore crucial, in my opinion, to develop the special European character of content by establishing a link with funding methods. This precise point did not need to be developed in this report but it will absolutely have to remain a priority objective during the overall revision of the directive. In actual fact, nothing can be truly effective as long as the Member States do not commit to continuing funding public service television and to justifying the use of funds to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, it is impossible to talk about revising this directive without addressing the delicate issue of advertising. With regard to the latter, I considered that its content and regulation ought to be clearly defined, in particular for advertising relating to alcohol, which has a harmful effect on children and vulnerable people. I would even consider it crucial to extend the Directive to all audiovisual services made available to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that the new Directive can lay down legislation that genuinely implements the application of the penalties provided for as regards quotas and advertising. To conclude, I therefore ask you to vote in favour of this very satisfactory report proposed by our fellow MEP, Mr Weber. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over recent years, it has been possible to reserve most of the broadcasting time to European works, which is what the directive was intended to do. What is also crucial is that the process of integration in which Europe is engaged means that there has to be more exchanging of television programmes between all the European countries. In view of the regrettable fact that the percentage of broadcasts produced by independent producers has declined over recent years, more of them should be sought out and more European joint productions facilitated.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two problematic aspects that I would like to address. Particularly in the new Member States, there has been an increase in media concentration to a disturbing degree, and that is something of which we must not lose sight. Media concentration of such a kind cannot, politically speaking, be in our interests, for media diversity makes for freedom and liberality, and is something that we must defend. I agree with Mr Weber about the need for regulation if we are to be able to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">The second crucial aspect is that in adapting the directive to the new technological revolution, and to digital media, we must do everything possible to enable public television, whatever the challenges posed by the competition, to really benefit from these new technologies, thus preventing it from being undermined and put at a disadvantage without anyone noticing. The real test of our success will be media diversity in the public sector too. Speaking as a German Member of this House, whatever the high regard in which I hold public television and whatever my commitment to it, I have to say that it must do what is required of it even with the new resources at its disposal and there must be no more of what one might describe as surreptitious advertising in public television. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, the two major problems against which we need to pit ourselves once more – both the European Parliament and the Commission – in the run up to the review of the directive in the autumn are:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly and most importantly, over-concentration of the media, which is damaging pluralism and substantially restricting democracy, as the rapporteur rightly notes. However, we also have some experience. Until now, this matter has been left solely in the hands of the Member States and over-concentration is increasing and in several Member States democracy is suffering. I therefore think that we need to ask the Commission for a common European antitrust policy which will protect pluralism and diversity and prevent the unfair concentration of ownership.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem concerns the very defence of European television productions, which are a facet of our European identity and of our European culture. We need to do whatever we can here to strengthen European productions by reinforcing the circulation of national productions at trans-European level, by supporting joint European policies and productions and by improving how we use and coordinate the positive role of public broadcasting. In addition, if we want to talk about quality, the Commission needs a positive definition of what works are, so that ridiculous, reality-type productions do not pass as quality and as European productions.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that Parliament will play a fundamental role in shaping the new directive in both these sectors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Back in Communist times, a Soviet directive along the same lines was in force in the Czech Republic, aimed at drastically reducing the number of American films in favour of European productions, except that back then it applied to French and Soviet films respectively.</p>
<p class="contents">According to paragraph 14 of the Weber report, Parliament should endeavour to ensure that the content of television programmes is uniquely European. This begs the question of who should decide what ‘European’ means in this context. I can assure you that if there is such a thing as a universal European, then there is a simple solution to any concerns he may have in this regard. By using his channel selector, together with a small satellite dish and a receiver costing EUR 130, he can watch 1 400 television channels. It would be nigh on impossible to regulate his viewing habits.</p>
<p class="contents">We will not succeed in creating a European television oeuvre by means of the Directive. The only cultures that exist are national ones, and it will always be the latter that fill European quotas. For that matter, the most European programme of all is the American film <span class="italic">Pretty Woman</span>, since every viewer from Finland to Portugal can understand it in its entirety. Hollywood productions are surprisingly European in their universal appeal, and our persistent attempts to keep American culture out of the mainstream of European civilisation and values are laughable. I look forward to the time after Turkey’s accession when we will use quotas to deny Europeans easily-understood American films of this kind, and be obliged to broadcast Turkish films in their place as part of a single European culture.</p>
<p class="contents">This amounts to nothing other than the customary social engineering, based on the belief that bans, quotas, regulations and subsidies can be used to create cultural values. This belief is entirely misguided, as the only thing that we will create is mollycoddled film directors safe in the knowledge that they can make absurd films that only a select group of relatives, mistresses and friends will see fit to applaud. By implementing the Directive, we are providing livelihoods to vast supervisory bodies in the EU Member States and granting subsidies to talentless creators who would otherwise be left behind in the usual competition for viewers. We are also perpetuating an ineffective public television system and funding European television stations that attract such a small number of viewers that it is a waste of electricity to run their transmitters. Real culture does not depend on regulations or on an endless stream of subsidies. It survives at national level, even without artificial precautions on the part of the EU. We should abolish the Directive, and leave cultural values in their rightful place, namely in the nation states. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Protection of young people, protection of consumers’ interests, cultural diversity, European content and European productions – all these things are of value and the ‘television without frontiers’ directive guarantees them to viewers in all the European Union’s Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very grateful to Mr Weber for highlighting the success of this and demanding those things that we need if it is to be continued. As we are all aware, people not only have a television at home, but are also, and increasingly, able to receive programmes over the Internet or via their computers and mobile phones. It is not acceptable that the same transmissions should be subject to different regulations depending on where they are broadcast from, and so it is indeed the case that this directive urgently needs to be revised.</p>
<p class="contents">In a couple of weeks’ time, the Commission and the British Presidency will be holding a major conference on this subject in Liverpool. I strongly urge not only the Commission and the Member States, but also businesses and broadcasters, to be ready and willing to really carry forward this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I urge, firstly, that the digital divide be reduced, for we need access to all media. Secondly, the television directive’s objectives – ensuring cultural diversity, the dual system, protection of young people and consumers – need to be guaranteed appropriately in the new media. It is for that reason that this report enjoys broad support from this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union is aware of the lack of quality European productions and has set itself the primary objective in the TV without Frontiers Directive of reversing this worrying state of affairs by setting broadcasting quotas in order to promote European and independent productions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very positive that the European Commission notes in its last report for 2001-2002 that there has been a bigger increase in the number of European works scheduled, with broadcasting of independent European productions fluctuating at around over 10%.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this positive image has a number of negative aspects. For example, careful examination of the quotas shows that they are mainly met by domestic productions. Although this certainly does not contradict the directive, it does not help to create a European audiovisual area, which cannot come about while European viewers have inadequate access to the audiovisual productions of other European countries. It is a fact that joint European productions need to be promoted.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Mr Weber, who has worked methodically and has received congratulations on a job well done by the entire Committee on Culture and Education, also extends to other important matters, such as safeguarding pluralism and the major issue for many countries of concentration of the media.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore needs to take serious account of the proposals in the report. It is our duty to resist the pressure being exerted for a reduction in the regulatory arrangements in the directive, the minimal rules of which have been unable to reverse the deterioration in programme quality.</p>
<p class="contents">This century's culture of the image is a challenge to us to defend European culture and to channel it as a competitive product to other continents on our planet, given that to date, unfortunately, its citizens have consumed whatever is produced on the other side of the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="contents">This major issue is a cultural and, primarily, a political issue. We have seen the extent to which the glamour productions of the United States contrast with the reality of New Orleans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only is it essential for everyone to receive accurate information, but everyone must be able to participate in the management of communication.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress, however, that the issues of information and communication are far more extensive than merely a debate on competition and pluralism. A public sector is not enough to guarantee public control of information management; it is not enough for state television to be subject to the government and the parties as is the case in Italy and as, apparently, threatens to be the case in Slovenia; nor is the private sector a guarantee of anything, if all the commercial television channels are in the hands of a few and if advertising imposes decisions and content with regard to both entertainment and information.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Europe and Parliament must take a big step forwards in order to understand problems such as this one. It is vital for the directive to be revised, but the Commission should bear in mind that the debate goes beyond market-place arguments. In fact, television determines the cultural, intellectual and ethical environment of every country, and that in turn determines its degree of democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is confirmed by the type of message and values or, to put it another way, lack of values that are disseminated through systems for the production and broadcasting of television’s message, which are squeezing our own production and suffocating the free expression of independent producers. I therefore believe that it would be a positive step to revise the directive in such a way as to be able to support producers and small and medium-sized enterprises, which are certainly not the recipients of the aid in question, thus restricting and circumscribing the influence of such messages.</p>
<p class="contents">We have not exhausted here, however, the debate over this outright cultural ‘mongrelisation’, being imposed through the globalisation of audiovisual messages. This is, however, the central point: European identity is being threatened by the very broadcasting of such messages. This is, therefore, the point that we should be debating, and we should have the courage to call a spade a spade, since what we are seeing is actually the pauperisation of everything that is imported from European culture. One particular point should be stressed, and it is mentioned in paragraph 38: censoring messages from non-EU channels that incite hatred of our culture, of the West, as was recently the case when the Lebanese channel Al Manar transmitted messages opposed to our civilisation, from sources very close to Hezbollah, via a European satellite. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Despite the fact that, with the application of Articles 4 and 5 of the Television without Frontiers Directive on the future of European policy in the audiovisual sector, positive steps have been made, there is nonetheless still concern about broadcasting quotas for European programmes, which remain low, making competition with other productions, especially from the United States, difficult to impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I note that there has been a reduction of about 4% in independent productions over the last four years, which is out of keeping with the directive and with efforts to enlarge the free market in the field of the audiovisual media. On the contrary, it restricts the free expression of producers both qualitatively and quantitatively, with the monopoly tactics being applied by other countries in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, infringements of the rules adopted by the European Union on total advertising time, interruptions to programmes for advertisements, scheduling of unsuitable works at specific times and the indirect promotion of banned products, such as tobacco and alcohol, during broadcasts, are just some aspects of an uncontrolled phenomenon for which the Member States are responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">Cultural diversity is impossible without television without frontiers, without a single market and protection of the human dignity of consumers, minors and citizens in general. Only with freedom of thought, of provision of services and of protection of producers' intellectual property rights can television without frontiers survive and operate.</p>

<p class="contents">Bearing in mind that the audiovisual public services are key to the development of public opinion, contribute to cultural diversity and pluralism and help to create an awareness of European citizenship, I would like to emphasise the importance of language learning with a view to greater access to pan-European channels and audiovisual works.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that the revised Directive must safeguard the development of new technologies and new services, in order to guarantee growth of the European economy and job creation, in accordance with the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must ensure pluralism of the media. Concentration is a threat to democracy and should be prevented, as should the granting of licences that do not comply with the law. Cultural diversity, freedom and pluralism of the media must continue to be the most important elements of the European audiovisual model. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, this directive covers almost all the issues that the Council of Europe’s Convention has passed a decision on. Both have the purpose of maintaining and promoting the quantity of high-quality European works in television broadcasts. It is an excellent objective, but this is one example of the work of the Council of Europe overlapping with that of the European Union. In the discussion of this directive we should approach the search for modes of cooperation between these two bodies with an open mind, and clearly identify the areas of responsibility the Council of Europe and the European Union should have. It is not sensible to have both bodies dealing with the same issues in exactly the same way.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, however, it would be a good idea to agree on common concepts in order to eliminate differing interpretations of what constitutes a European work or independent producer. What is most important, however, is that resources should be combined. This way we will achieve the best result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some might think it is clever to use early television images of pan-European friendship as a metaphor for EU cultural integration. Actually, the concept contains a deeper truth, which supporters of this proposal miss entirely or are deliberately concealing.</p>
<p class="contents">Television is without frontiers. Twenty years ago, communist regimes could stop human beings getting across the Berlin Wall, but they could not stop television signals being beamed into East German homes. Today technology has moved on and people all over the planet can watch what they like, where they like. Yet the EU presses ahead with this paranoid, illiberal plan, with its quotas of European programming, and we all know what chaos quotas can create. The fact is that, if viewers want to watch American or any other programmes day and night, then nothing can stop them, certainly not the EU – or is that the hidden reality?</p>
<p class="contents">In the UK <span class="italic">Jeux sans frontières</span> is called 'It's a Knock-Out'. Europe's viewers, not the politicians, will deal the knock-out blow to this pipedream project, because ordinary people know that if the EU is the answer, then it must have been a stupid question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, I realise that a new directive should naturally not stand in the way of the development of a European audiovisual industry, but that should surely not mean that no measures can be taken against the high concentration of broadcasters, whether they be horizontal, vertical, cross-border or otherwise.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has repeatedly asked the Commission to table proposals on this subject. As everyone knows, that is crucial if we want to retain pluralism in the media. I think that the Commission is a little too ready to acquit itself of this task, the excuse being that this falls within the remit of the Member States, in other words that it will not make any proposals, and that I regard as unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea of a European observatory, the function of which would be to observe the market and collect data has also been mooted. Excuse me, but that is really not good enough. It is a mere palliative and totally unnecessary if not backed up by enforceable measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to comment on the position of the national channels. A study commissioned by Parliament actually states, in black and white, that the independence of the national channels cannot be guaranteed with any certainty in many Member States. The Commission labours under the assumption that policy of national channels is in the hands of the Member States. While that is true, I do wonder if we – that is the Commission and Parliament – should not consider routes and measures we should take in those cases where the national governments have turned national channels into virtual branch organisations of government policy. Let me conclude by saying that the minimalist starting position that is now before us will lead us straight into American-style situations. I assume that here in this Chamber, which is now starting to fill up nicely, there are few Members for whom this prospect is an enticing one. Time is pressing, Commissioner; it is time for action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like first of all to thank Parliament for this broad overview and to congratulate it on the broad support expressed by Mr Weber’s report in favour of the overall approach reflected in the summary documents published at the beginning of July 2005. It is a new and comprehensible approach suggesting progressive regulation for linear services (radio broadcasting) and non-linear services, such as video on demand. As the report rightly points out, the existing rules must be adapted to structural changes and technological developments, while fully observing the basic principles of the current ‘Television without Frontiers’ Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The fundamental objectives of the directive, including the objectives of an internal market and of public interest, that are still valid, are as follows: free movement of audiovisual programmes on, and between, platforms, whatever their method of transmission may be; free access to events of major importance; promotion of European works, independent productions and cultural diversity; minimum standards of protection for viewers against clandestine advertising; integrity of audiovisual works, in particular films; protection of minors and human dignity, and the right of reply. The consultation process has been conducted in complete transparency with the participation of Members of the European Parliament. That will also be the case for the important Liverpool Audiovisual Conference, where the future rules on the regulation of audiovisual content will be discussed in six different round tables.</p>
<p class="contents">Having regard to the current Articles 4 and 5, we have taken due note of your concerns with a view to securing a better and more uniform application of notions such as ‘independent producers’ or ‘European works’ through the introduction of clearer concepts. I have taken full note of Mr Weber’s wish to give this concept of work a more specific content. The measures to promote European works and independent productions were also subject to consultation within the framework of the summary documents covering the same points that were highlighted in the Weber report. The consultations demonstrated that the basic principles remain valid, as Articles 4 and 5 have provided a stable and effective framework for promoting cultural diversity and the European audiovisual production sector. The idea of organising a European Year of Television and Media, with the aim of drafting a European Innovation Pact, deserves to be considered and shown interest and calls for more extensive investigations. A commitment for a year, however, still cannot be made at this stage of reflection and debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I note the concerns expressed in the Weber report about the need to safeguard media pluralism. During the Liverpool Conference, a round table will address this crucial issue. The Commission acknowledges the importance of media pluralism and, in the context of its powers, pays great attention to issues of concentration and property. Several public debates have been initiated to examine whether this issue should be dealt with at Community level. This debate showed that there is no immediate solution to this difficult issue. What can be said is that there is without doubt a need for a set of measures that include effective regulation at national level, application of national and European competition law and active promotion of media pluralism at national and Community levels by facilitating the movement of European works or by supporting European producers in the context of the ‘Television without Frontiers’ Directive and the Media programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are the handful of points I wished to highlight, on behalf of Mrs Reding, by once again saying to Mr Weber and to all of the Members who followed the debate that the Commission has taken a great deal of interest in this dialogue and in this exchange with Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
