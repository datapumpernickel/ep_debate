However, sound legislation is also key to the functioning of the European Union. Simplification of the European lawmaking process should therefore be one of the fundamental concerns of the European institutions. One very important aspect of this is the reduction of the administrative burden on our enterprises. This will release a new impetus for economic development and innovation. However, Europe is not always to be found where it is heralded to be, at least that is the experience I have had in my country. The Commission must take great care to ensure that the Member States enact regulations that do not go beyond European requirements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report on ‘better lawmaking’ comes from the same institutions that have turned this part of the world into the most over-regulated and least competitive bloc on the planet, that have brought us the bureaucratic nightmare of the common agricultural policy, the ecological calamity of the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">But let me try and be constructive. Here is an idea for better lawmaking: let us try not to be declamatory when we make legislation. Let us try not to use the statutes of this House as a way of showing that we are nice people, that we care about unemployment, that we care about the Roma or longer working hours or whatever it is. Heavy-handed intervention by the state is not usually the best way to solve problems. We are far better off allowing decisions to be taken as closely as possible to the people that they affect.</p>
<p class="contents">So my modest proposal for better lawmaking is that we close down this Parliament for the next six months on an experimental basis, we do not pass any legislation at all, and we see whether our constituents complain about it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this regard, we do not think there is anything to be investigated in relation to Denmark’s or Germany’s deportations. Denmark acted by the book, and if Germany cannot send home refugees from a war that is over, the concept of refugee status will be lost and we will then have a completely new legal status in the world.

They supported the opening of our borders; they concluded those treaties; they sometimes even wrote or promoted them; and they must certainly realise today that the fragile barriers that were erected – the temporary solutions that only allowed the Roma to come and settle in France after 2013 – well, they have all gone by the board.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, what I find most disagreeable in our fellow Members’ attitudes is that, on the pretext of fighting discrimination, there is in fact systematic discrimination – or stigmatisation, to use their expression – of the indigenous majority populations. It is all very well to defend minorities, but do you not believe that sometimes problems may arise – cultural, behavioural or other kinds of problems – in the conduct of these minorities that in fact prevent their integration? Would it not be doing these minorities a service to be honest and put these problems on the table as well? Just the once would not hurt. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A Member State does indeed have the right and the obligation to enforce the rules of a State governed by the rule of law and to take action against illegal immigration and the attendant nuisance. In any case, an important key to solving the problems lies with the Roma communities themselves. I should like to mention a memorandum from former Dutch Minister for Housing, Communities and Integration Van der Laan, a socialist, which states among other things that, among Roma, crime is disproportionately high, school absenteeism is sky-high, and children are being abused for begging and criminal activities. With that position, according to socialist Van der Laan, the Roma are excluding themselves from Dutch society. There is work to be done, therefore. Mr President, I know it is not popular to say this here in Parliament, but Roma, like all other people, have not only rights but also obligations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our inability to solve the problems of the Roma community can be summed up in one sentence: We know what we do not want but we do not know what we want. We do not want anyone to be punished for the offences of another only because they both belong to the same ethnic group. However, we also do not want some people to think that the law does not apply to them. We do not want to force anybody to give up their culture, but we also do not want to tolerate violations of the fundamental principles of coexistence in the name of ethnic identity. The French Government knows what it does not want. As long as it has not broken the law, there are no grounds for reproach. If it has broken the law, the courts must decide on the matter. One brief comment on the meeting this week in Paris: I would be delighted if the countries that are expected to provide a positive solution to the Roma issue were among the first to be invited to such meetings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The resolution concerns an essential feature of the law, which makes it very clear that no sanction can be linked to nationality. Responsibility must always be of an individual nature, and that is a foundational principle of the law. Roma people should be treated in the same way as other citizens of the Union. This means, too, that they are subject to the law, and if they break it they must bear responsibility on the same basis as others. We cannot allow a situation in which nationality is invoked as a reason for exemption from bearing responsibility for breaking the law.

In view of the unfavourable demographic changes which are troubling Europe, immediate action in this area seems essential. As well as helping elderly people to be active and guaranteeing them appropriate care, we must not forget the people who provide that care. Often they are people who have no other help, because besides caring for an older person, they also have to hold down a job. It is not easy to reconcile these two roles. I am thinking, here, of families in rural areas, who most often take it upon themselves to care for infirm family members. The legal situation of these people should be regulated. This will encourage others to take care of older people, who want to grow old with dignity. I think we would all want that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, as regards the question of judging the impact of legislation and the reduction of administrative burdens, further efforts are needed.

In this context, under the terms of Article 225 of the Treaty of Lisbon, and because I believe that it is an example of ‘better lawmaking’, I proposed, in an own-initiative report, the drawing up of a specific directive for bio-waste that was adopted by a majority in this Chamber in July: I hope that the Commission will respond to it soon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the other hand, I find it regrettable that, while the report repeatedly points the finger at what it calls ‘gold-plating’ of legislation by the Member States, it does not mention a highly interesting piece of information that appears in the explanatory statement. Of the thousands of legislative acts in force, 72 alone have imposed 486 information obligations, resulting in over 10 000 implementing acts in the Member States. It seems to me that this information reveals the opposite: that the roots of this evil lie in the Commission’s hyper-regulation. More fundamentally, I wonder whether there is anything other than formal respect for the principle of subsidiarity, in that the Treaties provide for areas in which the European Union has exclusive competence and which cannot be called into question at all, while in all other areas it seems that certain national parliaments are still unable to fully exercise their rights on the subject. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many people, politicians and legislators in particular, do just the opposite, probably without realising it. It is for this very reason that the continued examination of legislative practice and its improvement will always be crucial to the work of the European Union. I voted in favour of Mrs Geringer de Oedenberg’s report on better lawmaking because it raises important points on how legislation might be improved. Firstly, Parliament needs to remember its own responsibility: all too often, attention-seeking on the part of EU legislators has led to a situation where a viable directive has got bogged down by detailed amendments during the parliamentary debate. According to Schopenhauer’s precept, simple, transparent legislation does not mean that it is inferior in terms of its content: complexity and casuistry are often a way to hide a lack of ideas. Secondly, I wish to raise the matter of the impact assessments of legislation. A few important legislative initiatives, such as the history of the Emissions Trading Directive, showed that there were serious flaws in the impact assessments. People have to be precise, especially in the drafting of environmental legislation: a problem solved in one place can create a new problem somewhere else. As the resolution states, the Commission must consult interested parties regularly and comprehensively to make an objective evaluation. I think that the SME test launched by the Commission in its internal guidelines is a welcome development. Thirdly, we need to realise that national authorities are often vitally important for lightening administrative burdens. I come from a country where the official machinery is so meticulous in the application of statutes that it frequently results in additional burdens. The responsibility of the Member States cannot be ignored regarding this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, I agree with the Commission’s programme aimed at reducing the administrative burdens arising from European Union legislation which has been in place since 2005 and which seeks to reduce those burdens by 25% by 2012. It is very important to reduce the costs for businesses operating in the European Union, in order to enable them to function effectively in difficult economic conditions and compete globally and to streamline public administrative procedures. We must focus on the unnecessary requirements to provide information and apply the ‘only once’ principle set out in the Small Business Act. Electronic communication constitutes an excellent tool for reducing administrative burdens. The EU institutions must actively cooperate with the Member States in order to avoid discrepancies in interpretation and the ‘gold-plating’ of legislation. According to the Commission, 32% of EU administrative burdens are the result of decisions by certain Member States, exceeding the requirements of EU legislation and of the ineffectiveness of their administrative procedures.

The Treaty of Lisbon states that the European Parliament must act in partnership with the Council and encourage closer participation of national parliaments in monitoring the application of the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the regulatory environment of the European Union must continue to support impact assessments and reduce administrative burdens.

The European Commission has decided, in the face of general reaction, to set up a special working group to study the problem. They think that this will appease the general outcry about the policy of discrimination and will limit the decisions by the French and Italian governments to deport the Roma. The political spokesmen of capital who alternate in the governance of the Member States and jointly make decisions in the EU believe that condemning these government decisions will absolve them and the EU of responsibility for the constant and systematic discrimination against the Roma.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the policy of discrimination is in the very nature of the imperialist, transnational union of capital. The more vulnerable the social group and the greater the profit to capital, the more acute the discrimination. The Roma are increasingly coming up against the EU, its bodies and the powers that support it. Only a joint fight with the workers to overturn the society of exploitation and to fight against the EU and its supporters will bring about respect for their rights and satisfaction of their contemporary needs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Expelling these people to their countries of origin is obviously not going to resolve anything. They will return as soon as they can and no one can stop them because every one of them is a European citizen, free to go where they want as long as the provisions of Directive 38/2004 are respected. My vote firstly expresses the slight reservation I have about the motion for a resolution from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats)/European Conservatives and Reformists due to the tacit acceptance that expulsion is not excluded as a possible solution. However, I totally disagree with the joint motion for a resolution proposed by the other political groups which, influenced by the political backlash towards the Sarkozy government, attempts to make the gypsy minority a victim of a majority and not to blame for the situation which they have been happy with for centuries.</p>
<p class="contents">The events occurring in France and Italy must remind Europe of the presence of a minority of 10-12 million people, which is already pan-European, with major integration problems. However, hiding them behind national borders is the wrong solution.

Let us give the French side a chance to explain everything and only then let us draw conclusions as to whether it is a case of a violation of human rights or whether the approach to the Roma is being carried out within the confines of European law.

The structure of the EU was designed on the premise of the territorial stability of the member peoples.

It further emphasises that mass expulsions are prohibited by the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and that such measures are in violation of the EU Treaties and EU law, since they amount to discrimination on the basis of race and ethnicity and a breach of the Directive on the free movement of citizens and of their families in the EU. I welcome Commissioner Reding’s belated but strong response that she is convinced that the Commission will have no choice but to initiate infringement proceedings against France for breaches of the Free Movement Directive. Roma are the single most discriminated-against community in Europe.

None of the motions for resolutions put to the vote answered the pressing question of how best to meet the needs of the Roma people. It is quite clear that the Roma community is socially and economically discriminated against in the vast majority of Member States, which have not necessarily made use of the integration methods that the Union has made available. If the Roma community has rights, which are clearly being ignored, it also goes without saying that it has duties, like all other European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to the Member States, which have a duty to provide these European citizens with somewhere to live and a chance to make a living. With regard to the events for which France has been criticised, and while we are still waiting for the Commission’s decision on the illegality of the operations carried out, I condemn any mass expulsion not based on respect for European law. However, I refuse to fall into the questionable amalgamations contained in the joint motion for a resolution, comparing the events of this summer with deportations.

The stigmatisation of the Roma by the President during a speech on insecurity, the statements by his Minister for Home Affairs against the Romanians and the blatant expulsion of several hundred of them in breach of the law are an insult not only to the values of the French Republic but also to the fundamental values of the Union. Throughout history the Roma have been systematically marginalised, discriminated against and used as scapegoats. Regardless of whether they are French, Romanian or Bulgarian, today they are European citizens. The indignity of the treatment they have received should not be tolerated in a community founded on the principles of law, freedom, equality and non-discrimination, which lie at the heart of the EU Treaty and its Charter of Fundamental Rights. The resolution is therefore a firm and unambiguous condemnation of the French Government’s actions and of the discriminatory rhetoric that accompanied them. It condemns expulsions in breach of the law. It demands that the governments of Europe and the Commission coordinate their actions to integrate the Roma, using the funds allocated by Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this case, however, dealing with citizens of EU Member States, they have folded their arms or made merely circumstantial statements.

The resolution reminds us of the right of all European citizens to move and reside freely throughout the European Union, and of the basic principle of equal treatment of citizens and of non-discrimination. Nicolas Sarkozy and the government are mistaken if they think they can flout the values of the Union, European law and the Charter of Fundamental Rights with total impunity: the European Parliament has vigorously called them to order, and it would do the same to any Member State tempted by such practices. The resolution also makes the European Commission face up to its responsibilities, calling on it to stop dithering and finally to implement a clear and determined strategy for the inclusion of Roma communities, in all areas – access to housing, employment, education and health – in order to put a stop to their unacceptable exclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This exploitation of the Roma issue is unacceptable in my view, and Parliament ought to react. Progressive Members, including the Social Democrats, have therefore demanded an end to this discriminatory rhetoric and to the collective expulsions, whereas the European right wing has largely supported the French Government in its drift to the right. We urgently need to implement a global strategy to tackle this subject, which affects 10-12 million EU citizens. This resolution deplores the lack of any reaction from the Commission, which is, however, supposed to be the guardian of the Treaties and as such should have condemned the French Government’s actions.

As I already indicated in the debate on Tuesday regarding the questions addressed to the European Council and Commission, political opinions and legal assessments are two different things, and while we may find the expulsions deplorable or excessive, only the European Commission has the competence to assess the legality of the steps taken by France. In my opinion, to accuse a country of a serious infringement based on unsubstantiated information, prior to the Commission’s pending assessment and not knowing its results diminishes Parliament’s authority. However, as rapporteur for Parliament’s European Roma strategy, I felt that in the current situation it is imperative for the European Parliament to formulate the progressive recommendations made in the motion in an official resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore important to state that the EU and its Member States share the responsibility for Roma integration, which requires a comprehensive EU-level strategy. This should be created with the inclusion of Roma communities from grassroots levels to international NGOs, including all aspects of planning, implementation and control. We must also state that a complex development programme must be created, which targets simultaneously all related policy areas and facilitates immediate intervention in ghetto areas struggling with serious structural disadvantages. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problems of minorities in Europe are complicated and sensitive, and they are often exploited for narrow political ends. Political manipulation that essentially fails to tackle problems at their root but complicates the integration of minorities I find unacceptable. Proper EU financing and the cooperation of Member States in order to implement it are essential to encourage the social integration of Roma people. Several instruments that could be used to eradicate Roma exclusion, including the possibility of using the European Social Fund, are already at the EU’s disposal. They will be supplemented by the opportunity to use up to 2% of the common European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) finance for housing expenditure for socially excluded communities. That is why it is important to ensure practical action is taken for the integration of the Roma people, beginning in those Member States whose nationals they are. At the same time, of course, we must guarantee freedom of movement within the Union, and when expelling EU citizens from a Member State, every case must be considered on its merits, and the decision for expulsion must be based on the appropriate decision of a court. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should be remembered that Romanian citizens will only enjoy full freedom of movement in 10 countries of the EU, including France, from January 2014. Moreover, all EU citizens can be obliged to provide proof of their means of support after staying longer than three months in a country that is not their own. If they prove to be too great a burden on the social security system of the host country, measures can be decided on, under paragraphs 9 and 10 of Directive 2004/38/EC. While the mass expulsion of Romanian citizens of Roma ethnicity can be questioned, people who protest violently against it should also be concerning themselves with a great deal more, and with the same intensity. They should be concerning themselves with the children whose families generally prevent them from attending school; with children and women who are used in begging; with begging adopted as a life choice; and with the rejection of work and recourse in its stead to the social security systems of third countries.

The resolution adopted during plenary is an ideological text rather than a concrete action plan.

This resolution is attempting to make us believe that now we are all racists.</p>
<p class="contents">That is except for left-wing politicians, of course. The resolution was drafted and voted on without any proper knowledge of the Roma’s situation, either in Eastern or Western Europe. The Roma issue is not a national problem and cannot be described either in terms of racial policy. The Roma issue goes back a long way in Europe’s history and still remains unresolved. The use of clichés and the political agenda, mainly in the form of the socialists’ clash with the right-wing administration in France, will not resolve anything, apart from the left wing’s electoral objectives. I voted for the resolution from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) precisely because this document suggests measures and calls for coordination at European level. The Roma issue is not a question of racism, but of realism. If the Roma issue is dealt with according to the terms stipulated by the left, it will quickly resurface and will trigger new crises in one Member State or another.

The Member States should provide support, as a matter of priority, for the establishment of home palliative care units, and devise and implement advanced training systems to help raise the educational level of those working in the eldercare system.

It calls on the authorities of all the riparian countries to cooperate and rehabilitate the River Jordan by drawing up and implementing policies which focus on achieving tangible results in the areas of domestic and agricultural water-demand management, water conservation and the management of sewage and agricultural and industrial effluents, and on ensuring that an adequate quantity of fresh water flows into the Lower Jordan. It welcomes the cooperation among Israeli, Jordanian and Palestinian local communities facing similar water challenges in the Lower Jordan area and calls on Israel and Jordan fully to honour commitments made in their peace treaty concerning the rehabilitation of the Jordan River. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
