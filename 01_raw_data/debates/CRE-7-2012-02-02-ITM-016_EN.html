We have also seen an increased participation in cooperation in the policies of the BRICS and the emerging powers on an international level, and this is to be encouraged at all times.</p>
<p class="contents">We can now see the development of a multipolar system where economic and political power is distributed between a number of blocs. It is for this reason that I support the report’s proposal for the development of a coherent EU approach, to treat the BRICS as a single bloc, and to also seek to establish partnerships with each of the countries within the bloc, which will prove to be invaluable when responding to global challenges such as climate change, terrorism and, of course, the financial crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It had far outperformed the United Kingdom, burdened as it was with the enormous debt-to-GDP ratio that it had at the end of the Second World War.</p>
<p class="contents">But we can now see in retrospect that our timing could hardly have been worse. In relative terms, Western Europe stopped growing in the oil crisis of 1974 and never really got going again. We foolishly stood aside from the parts of the world which are still developing, where the growth still is, not least the Anglosphere and Commonwealth markets to which we are tied by habit, blood and speech. We are cabined, cribbed, confined in a dwindling customs union. We should raise our eyes to the broader, brighter and more distant horizons that our fathers took for granted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is a space for closer cooperation between the EU and the BRICS countries. This is especially relevant at a time when BRICS countries are showing their clear ambitions in foreign policy terms.

In my opinion, this role should better reflect their share in the global GDP.</p>
<p class="contents">Changes in the world economic landscape and in the new role played by countries like China, India and Brazil give the opportunity for strengthening global development policies.

<p class="contents">What we should be looking at is the granularity, and the differences between individual countries. So, for example, Brazil offers great prospects for many companies across the EU. The same goes for Russia, but the problem is, as Kasparov said, when it comes to elections, you already know the result, but you do not know what the outcome might be.

Just as the US did after the Second World War, and just as the Soviet Union did during the revolutionary period, so the European Union attempts to encourage other parts of the world to form regional blocs in mimicry of its own structures. It does not just make its aid dependent on reproductive rights and so on, but it very often – and far more damagingly – requires countries to be part of whatever regional bloc is nearby. It makes clear that it will not sign trade or aid deals with individual sovereign states but will only deal bloc to bloc.</p>
<p class="contents">People often do not realise the extent to which organisations like Mercosur, the Central American Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific Union, are not just bodies encouraged by the European Union, but were really creatures of the EU, sponsored by the Commission and largely dependent on it for their financing. This creates a beautifully circular argument for European federalists who say, ‘We have to be part of this big bloc because that is what the rest of the world is doing’, when, of course, they are obliging the rest of the world to do so. In reality, it is the little countries that are doing well. The wealthiest countries of the world are the Monacos and the UAEs. In the top ten, only one state has a population of 7 million.

He talked me through a number of statistics on foreign aid, and the figures were pitilessly clear. He showed that international assistance was not useless; it was actively harmful. If you compared countries in receipt of it with countries not in receipt of it over the same periods, the countries not in receipt grew faster, were more democratic, developed more impressively, and for the obvious reason: foreign aid breaks the link between taxation, representation and expenditure. It allows governments to remain in office without the support of their populations.</p>

We could open our markets; we could abolish the common agricultural policy; we could encourage their exporters to sell. But the one thing that is absolutely not going to help is giving this kind of assistance, especially when we do not have the money. This is the crazy thing!

I can understand this. It is the duty of the European Union to help people in need. Nonetheless, we must be equally clear on the other side: when assistance is given, we need to know what it is being given for and it must be easy to check whether the aid reaches its intended destination, rather than ending up in the coffers of some corrupt governments, never to be heard of again. Although this is self-evident, we nonetheless need to demand this on a daily basis. Naturally, this also means looking to ensure that the aid is genuinely efficient. We need to check that the aid really gets to where it is needed and that it is efficient. If we can manage these two things, then we shall make a lot more progress. Transparency is a minimum requirement in all of this. For this reason, I have voted in favour of this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I personally had a recent experience in Uganda where I went out with a local faith-based organisation who are drilling one new well every week, bringing water to miles around and doing a fantastic job.

It is a very disturbing report.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we have the role of the United Nations. The report contends that the control of EU funds awarded to the UN is absolutely terrible. Reports to the EU are vague and late. The Court of Auditors is obstructed when it comes to accessing information about projects carried out and there is a lack of transparency, efficiency and effectiveness when it comes to the management of resources. Reforms that had been required in the past have simply not been implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, we have cost efficiency when it comes to aid in general. From my own investigations, I know that fraud does take place in EU development projects. Thanks to OLAF and the Court of Auditors, cases are brought to light. I am focused on the fact that much more needs to be done and I will fight hard, on behalf of the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV), to ensure that that happens.</p>

Obviously, as welfare societies, we Europeans want to support undeveloped countries, so that people there can lead a happy and full life. It is very important, however, to ensure that, when, as Europeans, we act, we implement projects which reflect European Union values and which are, in that way, ethically sustainable. Above all, we need to export democracy, human rights and freedom of expression, and make sure that Europe’s heritage of values and intellectual input are strongly present. That is why it is good to be having this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I voted in favour of this report, but we still have more to do in this area, because there are several examples of these ethical principles not having been implemented in all respects everywhere as far as our EU projects are concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But we do have the capacity to destroy jobs and we have been doing that by these intrusive regulations.

These meetings should be prepared for adequately and should not be a sideshow put on by some of the big Member States and their leaders.

It sponsors militias and terrorist organisations in Central Asia, in the Balkans; it struck even as far afield as London and Buenos Aires.</p>

Its military aspect may have significant security implications, with not just a regional, but also a global impact. This is why efforts must be stepped up to find a solution which combines tough measures with proposals for dialogue. At the same time, the impact of the sanctions must be constantly assessed to ascertain their effectiveness. In light of this, I should mention how important it is to coordinate our actions with those of the other global actors in order to achieve tangible results. Turkey can play a positive role in the efforts to resolve the Iran dossier. I hope that cooperation will be enhanced in this area with Ankara. I appeal to the authorities in Tehran to respond to the calls for negotiations and to avoid escalating the situation by blocking the Strait of Hormuz. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My group, including myself, views these sanctions with caution, because we fear that they will strengthen Iran’s administration and therefore defeat their own purpose. After all, Iran’s leaders need some sort of enemy to be, and to look, strong, and I am afraid that now, as a consequence, we have fallen into this trap. However, now we still have to negotiate and discuss matters, although we know that Iran is not an easy negotiating partner, nor can it be trusted.</p>
<p class="contents">Sometimes, it is also worth putting yourself in the position of the opposite party. Iran is the former Persia, a country proud of its history, and one that regards itself as a civilised nation, which, in the light of history, it is. My fear is that sanctions will make the Iranians feel that their pride has been injured and that things will go against what we are all hoping for: negotiations, peace and the renunciation of nuclear weapons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is perfectly obvious that both the European Union and the international community must send a clearer message to Iran that we will not accept their nuclear weapons programme.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the case that the speeches that Ahmadinejad has made both at the UN and to the world at large are so provocative that we need to respond to them. We Europeans have to stand up to this and be frank and clear. We also have to support the sole democracy in the Middle East, Israel, which is especially under threat from Iran now, as we know from what Ahmadinejad has said about threatening to wipe Israel off the map of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is not just Israel, as a bastion of democracy in the Middle East, that is under threat: it is also all of Europe and the Western world, the free world, the democratic world. That is why we have to act robustly and firmly to ensure that Iran is prepared to abandon its programme. Unfortunately, sanctions seem to be the way we have to go, though, of course, discussions should also be continued. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">But, of course, in Iran, all the evidence suggests that the intent goes far beyond nuclear energy and has a military dimension. This has been borne out by six resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations, of which Iran is a member; all have been ignored.

I would specifically like to highlight the role of sport in fostering European unity and an atmosphere free from intolerance.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me bring to your attention a curious incident in connection with this report: recently, the national ice hockey teams of Romania and Hungary played each other in Miercurea Ciuc, a Romanian city with a Hungarian majority. Since all but two players on the Romanian national ice hockey team belong to the Hungarian minority community of Romania, these players, too, sang the Hungarian national anthem at the customary singing of anthems before the game. The incident received special attention from the Romanian central press, and many accused the ice hockey players of Hungarian nationality who make up almost the entire Romanian national team of treason.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be high time for mutual respect and tolerance to permeate not only the atmosphere of sports events but also public statements, as in this case it was not the gestures of the fans but the malicious and manipulative activities of Romanian politicians and the Romanian press that incited intolerance. Romania won the game </p>

<p class="contents">This weekend sees the start of the Six Nations Championship, where Wales will proudly play their national sport. As an avid rugby supporter, I cannot help but see this as a missed opportunity for the Parliament. The report should have focused on the positive contribution that sports can have on both participants and supporters in terms of instilling values of respect, fair play and social inclusion, and should have focused on how the EU could help the development of grassroot sports. It instead concentrates on how the EU can take advantage of the increasing popularity of professional sport, including how to develop a database to share information on hooligans, which effectively duplicates the work already being conducted by Europol. The report proposes that all agents representing European sportsmen have their fiscal residence in the EU. This clearly does not serve to promote sport across the EU and certainly not globally.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s vote was undemocratic, however, when smaller groups requested roll-call votes. It is because they need to register disappointment on certain parts of reports. Today, sadly, that was denied by the President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, the report focuses far too much on the commercial side of sport. Instead, the development of grassroots in sport is overlooked in favour of developing means to take further advantage of the popularity of professional sport.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of, for instance, creating a new EU database of football hooligans, which is already a Europol competence, we should focus on national authorities developing sports facilities at the more local level, with the aim that hooliganism can be diminished thanks to greater Community involvement and the ability to get along with others or work as part of team. We should focus on skills; participation in sport has been proven to be a way of teaching these skills. We should be giving more people the chance to learn a sense of discipline and self-worth rather than focusing exclusively on introducing new EU legal rules on fiscal residence for sports agents, as the report seems to suggest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One such proposal sought to politicise sport by having the EU flag flown at all major sports events in the EU. Another proposal sought to politicise our sporting athletes by making them have an EU logo on their clothing. I cannot support those proposals, because I do not believe you should politicise sport.</p>
<p class="contents">I certainly do believe we should encourage sports participation in schools, increase the awareness of social responsibilities in sports stadiums, highlight the importance of volunteers in sport, increase the attention to the needs of disabled sports people. I call for sport to benefit from EU Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">But in my 22 and a half years here, I have never witnessed such a spectacle as I did today, when the President of this Parliament shamefully took his actions. I do not agree with Mr Hannan, because the President of this Parliament is well advised by the people to his left and to his right. He made that decision and he made the wrong decision and that needs to be retracted in the interest of the minority groups in this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must remember that it is the first more extensive report on sport, and sport, of course, is the biggest popular movement in the whole of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a first step, and I am therefore slightly disappointed that the friends of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group there on the right see only a threat and not opportunities. Perhaps you might reconsider this for a moment: this will provide great opportunities for taking sport forward, improving public health, increasing well-being at European Union level, and more.</p>
<p class="contents">Trivial matters like the flag, whether or not it is on the inside or outside of the team shirt (which is completely optional), or whether the EU flag should or should not be raised at a particular sporting event, are neither here nor there. Moreover, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland can play under their own flags, and no one will say anything about it. On the contrary, the aim is for civic commitment on the part of Europeans at grassroots level: for people for whom sport is important. We are also trying get people involved in building their own nation, as a priority, but it is also seen as a common benefit in the European internal market if we have healthy employees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

UEFA, the football organisation, has a UEFA fair play award.</p>

<p class="contents">There are too many citizens who even now, in 2012, are paying for the consequences of poor waste management in terms of their daily lives and their health, incinerators and landfills being cases in point. All the same, virtuous examples of ecologically sustainable waste management in the EU do exist. We must therefore do all we can to reach a point of total recycling, where waste actually becomes a genuine resource.</p>
<p class="contents">This is already a reality today. There are treatment plants that recycle nearly 100% of urban waste, as in the case of the Vedelago waste centre in the province of Treviso, whose technology is exported throughout Europe. Nevertheless, we need more controls, prevention and, above all, responsible choices. We should recycle, recover and reduce waste and say ‘no’ to huge incinerators and landfills that are often the cause of air and aquifer pollution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Romania is among the countries targeted by petitions about waste management. In order to meet EU standards, my country is currently implementing the integrated waste management system.

Until recently, the construction of the Northern Gas Pipeline – from Russia to Germany – was intended to be the panacea for all energy shortages. The pipeline was supposed to secure a steady delivery of natural gas to the European Union. As recently as yesterday, the Russian company, Gazprom, reduced gas delivery to a number of European Union states. According to the company, the decision resulted from the increase in demand for natural gas in Russia, which occurred as a consequence of the freezing conditions. A few years ago, political point scoring in Russia led to other countries suffering from a shortage of natural gas. This illustrates the importance of the pursuit of new energy sources within the European Union, both in the context of the European Union’s security as well as in terms of the protection of all types of EU activity. It is, of course, not possible for the EU to attain self-sufficiency in this area, but it is necessary to use all possible means to achieve security.

<p class="contents">However, we could not agree with the report’s conclusions. We are, as a group, strongly in favour of the protection of national fiscal sovereignty in order to promote a low tax competitive business environment throughout the European Union. We do not believe that fiscal federalism will do anything to promote responsibility in tax management at a regional level, nor do we believe that greater economic efficiency will be achieved as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with the sections of the report that address issues of transparency and believe that the number of loopholes in the system and the many uncertainties in the way it functions must be significantly reduced or reformed. We believe that better access to information on tax rules within the European Union Member States would go some way to address this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like mainly to deal with the second issue, namely, the reform of the Fining Guidelines.

<p class="contents">Nonetheless, we, the European Parliament, believe that there is an urgent need to clarify the 1/2003 Guidelines so that it will be easier to predict in future the penalties a business can expect if it does not adequately comply with these legal regulations.</p>

It is clear on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of this important report that the EU’s policy on competition has indeed brought many benefits for the welfare of European consumers. It has aided the free movement of goods and services, as well as capital, and has become a vital part of ensuring the prosperity of the single market. We support what the report has to say on the main areas it addresses, particularly State aid, collective redress, fines and settlement procedures, and strongly believe that with the suggested measures in place, it will continue to be a very useful tool in preserving the economic level playing field within the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">Can I also pay a special tribute to Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, who, as Competition Commissioner 10 years ago when I knew him in this Parliament, really put this essential EU competence on the political map as far as the countries like the United States were concerned.

We, Members of European Parliament, conclude that the EU should take into account the new weight in political and economic terms of the BRICS and other emerging powers and use its political leverage to continue promoting universal values in the looming new multipolar system of global governance and be at the forefront of the process of reform of the international governance system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this renewed world asset, the EU must be at the forefront of the reform of the international system and must use its political leverage to continue to promote universal values. To lead this process, the EU needs to act as a single and robust political and economic entity. Without an inclusive new global governance system, based on full participation by the BRICS and other emerging economies, there will be limited international cooperation on major global issues. In addition to that, there will be also the potential risk of political and economic fragmentation, and of competing world agendas. With this report indeed, we ask for a strategic partnership with each BRICS country as a means of advancing peace and global security, the promotion of human rights, democracy, sustainable development and global financial regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These countries want us, the western powers, to include them more with a view to strengthening global governance and multilateral diplomacy.

For the time being, they are doing this without us. It is therefore imperative that we take into account the new economic and political weight of the BRICS countries. As the rapporteur emphasises, ‘this proves all the more necessary, considering that transnational challenges – such as climate change, global regulatory issues, access to raw materials and rare earths, terrorism, sustainable development,’ etc. – will require an inclusive approach based on common values.

Ever increasing demographic imbalances between Western countries and the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and other emerging powers in the near future threaten to change the hitherto established relationship of influence in the international arena and the system of global governance itself. In 2050, seven emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China, Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey) are projected to have larger economies than all the Group of Seven (G7) countries (USA, Japan, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, France and Italy) put together. China is projected to become the world’s largest economy by 2020, while India could become the fastest growing economy in the world by 2050. These countries will become increasingly important internationally, particularly for tackling global issues such as combating climate change, international terrorism, the distribution of resources and rare minerals, political stability worldwide, etc. Therefore, the EU must enhance cooperation with the BRICS and other emerging powers in the system of global governance and in international organisations. I agree that we need to consider at EU level how to maximise the role, voice and voting power of the EU in international fora and achieve more streamlined coordination and a more cohesive stance among EU Member States in such fora. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Faced, for example, with the prediction that China will soon become the world’s largest economy, Brussels must increase its efforts to influence the emerging multipolar system of global governance effectively. One of the objectives of the Union’s foreign policy is the adoption of a coherent approach towards these countries when viewed as a potential bloc, and the widening of cooperation and strategic partnerships with each of these countries individually, especially with those that are democratic, for such a partnership will constitute an ideal tool with real potential for introducing change. In an increasingly coherent manner, the BRICS countries are also deciding the political direction of prominent international organisations, such as the United Nations. Moreover, taking into account the economic as well as the demographic potential of these countries, only a coordinated European policy can contribute to the increased role and effectiveness of the Union on the international arena.

In the interests of reconciling positions with Russia, the existence of the G8 should also be harnessed, so that common challenges can be addressed in a coordinated and effective manner. I support the G20 parliamentary dimension and I believe that it should be further consolidated and involved in decision-making processes, in order to ensure reinforced democratic dialogue and greater scrutiny. I firmly believe that the current sovereign debt crisis will be an important test for the G20 as an effective forum for strategic political dialogue, creating foundations for the elimination of systemic unbalances which can be particularly damaging both for developed economies and, in a longer-term perspective, emerging ones, and promoting solidarity in international financial fora such as the International Monetary Fund. The EU must enhance political dialogue and cooperation with the BRIC countries in order to push further forward the reform of global financial and economic governance institutions, that is to say, the Bretton Woods institutions, with the aim of ensuring the broader representation of all member countries while reflecting changes in economic weight. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I prefer the distinction between the CIVETS countries (Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Turkey and South Africa) and the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) to designate the main emerging global economies because I believe that this ‘separation’ between the two emerging economic groups brings greater precision to the strategic analysis of their relations with the EU. However, I believe that this report proposes a set of rather important measures for the future of our relations with the BRICS, to use the name that includes South Africa, which should obviously be considered by the EU. Multilateralism should be given the greatest importance in international relations, but the BRICS should also be more involved in economic development policy at global level, and the role of Parliament should be strengthened in relations with these countries.

The concern being expressed is, however, that they should be considered separately. There are a number of reasons for this. The growth and diversification of the BRIC countries’ economic activity jeopardises the traditional division of global labour, which is unfavourable to these countries. Their role is not limited to producing items low in value added and exporting raw materials and agricultural produce for countries at the heart of the capitalist system. Today, they are increasingly becoming world powers to rival the triad: the US, Japan and the EU. Some of them are even pursuing the opposite path to the EU in the fight against hunger and poverty. We should not forget that in a few years, millions of people have been pulled out of extreme poverty in China, India and Brazil, in a process that has not been without major contradictions. It is a fact that, internationally, the BRIC countries have been coming together on a number of important issues. The positions taken up by the BRIC countries in the international arena and their working together are increasingly being seen as a threat to the influence and dominance of the aforementioned triad, especially in the institutions of international capitalism: the World Bank, the IMF and the G20. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Good relations with countries like Brazil are vital, especially in terms of encouraging trade. One key area of interest to me is the trade of agricultural products. We import large amounts of meat from Brazil; meat that comes from animals that do not have to comply with the same rigorous standards and regulation that our farmers are subjected to. One example is the introduction of yet another pointless and costly regulation to electronically identify all sheep within the EU. These new rules to monitor the movement of sheep are flawed. They require a 100% accuracy rate of recording to be achieved by farmers, a task which is impossible because the available technology is not 100% reliable. If our farmers fail to achieve a 100% accuracy rate, they face heavy financial penalties. This is completely unacceptable. I therefore urge the Commission to review this regulation to allow some discretion to reflect the reality of the unreliable EID technology. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to the report, the ultimate aim of these relations should be to organise, and I quote, ‘an inclusive system of global governance’; to try to play a role in this multipolar world – still in perfect harmony (submission?) with the United States – the aim of this cooperation being to preserve and support a global political, economic and financial system which has largely shown itself to be harmful and doomed to failure. With this in mind, we are proposing to give a few more powers to these emerging countries in the UN and the IMF, since we are begging them for a bail-out in the euro crisis. It would also mean exclusively entrusting relations with the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) to the European Union, so, for the moment, to Baroness Ashton, while national diplomacies would be mere relays with no autonomy from the decisions taken in Brussels. This is all unacceptable. I am taking this opportunity to condemn the fate of white farmers in South Africa, who are being brutally murdered with the complicity of the authorities while Parliament remains completely silent on the matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead of abating, the recession is deepening, unemployment is growing, and the lack of innovation and new investment in Europe do not suggest that the situation will improve. As it falls into a state of apathy, Europe is no longer a model to emulate, in contrast to the accelerating economies of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (the BRICS group of countries), which are relatively unaffected by the global recession. According to economic forecasts, the economies of these countries are predicted to accelerate even further. In addition, these countries are strengthening politically and developing common positions – which are often controversial for Europe – in relation to global conflicts and problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I agree with the rapporteur that the Union should cooperate closely with these countries, but that this cooperation should not come at any price. We should bear in mind the unquestionable potential of these countries, but we should not undervalue our own economy and its capabilities. This is a difficult challenge, since taking into account the unequal conditions of competition, manifested by cheap labour achieved at the cost of human rights, as well as lower production standards, or quite simply, superior natural conditions and access to natural resources, Europe will face a difficult task. We cannot, however, succumb entirely to economic pressures and forget about fundamental European values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU States are not isolated in economic terms. The recent economic crisis illustrated just how much countries depend on one another. It is therefore very important that we should improve and develop economic relations with the aforementioned countries in particular. Nonetheless, the EU should not be influenced too much by the ideas and initiatives of the United States. I fear that this proposal will strengthen the dominant position of the US, which could, in turn, lead to stagnation in the development of trade with the BRIC countries. The EU must develop its own initiatives and must not allow itself to be intimidated too much by its big neighbour on the other side of the Atlantic. I am in favour of improving trade relations with the BRIC countries. However, this must primarily be in the interests of the EU.

I believe that this proposal does not make sense in light of the Treaty of Lisbon. Firstly, it concerns two quite different policies, subject to very different systems under the EU Treaties. Secondly, under the Treaty, the High Representative only has the jurisdiction to steer foreign and security policy, and not to ‘coordinate’ the various EU external action policies, in particular, foreign trade policy. Thirdly, where there is a need for such ‘coordination’, this falls to the High Representative and the Commissioner for External Trade together, without this meaning that one has any authority over the other, or that there is any hierarchy. This proposal will therefore mean an unacceptable change to the balance and distribution of powers between the institutions and bodies of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As pointed out by the rapporteur, it is estimated that in 2050, the combined relevance of the seven largest emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China, Indonesia, Turkey and Mexico) will be greater than the economic relevance of the G7 countries. The aforementioned growing economic powers have already proven that they foster high ambitions in terms of foreign policy, and it is likely that they will gradually take over leadership in the shaping of global governance and strategies of global significance. This shows how important it is to increase internal cohesion within the EU and to strengthen our common foreign policy. Only by acting as a single robust entity will we be able to compete with the growing economic and political powers and maintain relevance in the new, multipolar system of global governance and leadership. The emerging new global balance of forces creates an opportunity for the European Union to take initiative and assume leadership in the process of changing and reforming the system of global governance, which will include the new powers. We have an opportunity to create a new platform for international foreign policy based on mutual trust and common values, which will support cooperation in trade and economic terms, as well as cooperation to find more effective solutions to global issues such as climate change, global peace and security and sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Among other things, this is shown by business travel to Brazil, which is up by 30% compared with last year. It is a similar matter as far as the East is concerned: there is considerable growth with regard to China (up by 27%), including to lesser destinations as well as the traditional ones of Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai. All this confirms that investments by European companies are being increasingly directed at the new emerging economies. The strong degree of interdependence between emerged powers and emerging powers requires that the EU’s respective bilateral policies with the BRIC countries should also be reviewed.

The dynamic that has been created and developed in terms of multilateralism, in particular, the composition of the United Nations, the UN Security Council and other international organisations, has been implemented for and adapted to the current international system. Today, there are a number of countries that have developed an area of common ground on foreign policy: namely, the so-called BRICS – Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – and other emerging economies such as Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey, which are seeking a multipolar system of global governance. In terms of international action, the BRICS are already taking up common positions on several topical issues. There is certain to be reform of the international institutional framework. The current problems are of a cross-border nature, so they require global, not national, solutions. The BRICS are emerging as essential partners in ensuring global stability and security, so it is imperative that there be close cooperation, consultation, dialogue and consensus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this rapidly changing context, Europe cannot remain silent. It must propose strong initiatives to reorganise the system of global governance in order to ensure that it is more inclusive and based on relevant instruments and representative bodies. In my view, we must not look at the BRICS countries with trepidation, but with realism: the economic, social, financial and confidence crisis has demonstrated the extent to which our economies are interdependent, if any such demonstration were necessary. We can no longer allow ourselves to adopt unilateral approaches when the challenges we face (energy, sustainable development, food, security, etc.) affect all of humanity. The EU must, however, take care not to lose its influence or neglect its historical allies, especially the Arab world. I firmly believe that any pulling back or weakening on our part would result in the BRICS countries consolidating their ties with our strategic partners.

The fact that the crisis of capitalism is not even more severe is solely due to the contribution that these countries are making to world output. In the power-rebalancing process under way at global level, the majority in this House now supports closer ties with these countries on an individual basis, as they fear their unity and that it could mean a weakening of the influence and dominance of the capitalist triad – the USA, Japan and the EU – in the institutions of international capitalism. They want to restrain their growth and the diversification of their economic activity, which jeopardise the international distribution of labour and the role these countries were supposed to play; namely, that of producers of products low in value added. Today, the BRICS countries are increasingly becoming world powers, rivalling the triad, and some of them are even taking the opposite course to that of the EU in terms of combating hunger and poverty, which will increase for us as a result of the course and the misguided policies of the EU and the Member States. We advocate the establishment of relations with all countries, refusing to pigeonhole them and safeguarding mutual interests, regardless of differences and of political, economic, social and cultural perceptions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such behaviour has often encouraged criticism for applying double standards. With this resolution, we want to stress that sanctions should be applied regardless of political, economic and security interests. All restrictive measures must comply with international humanitarian law and with the principle of proportionality and must not penalise the most vulnerable population groups in countries affected by these measures.

Sanctions or restrictive measures, such as arms embargoes, trade sanctions, financial and economic sanctions, the freezing of assets, flight bans, restrictions on admission, diplomatic sanctions, boycotts of sporting and cultural events and the suspension of cooperation with third countries, can only be effective if imposed by the whole of the EU. Disagreement among Member States often leads to inconsistent application of restrictive measures, which damages the EU’s credibility and has a detrimental impact on the effectiveness of those measures. I welcome the European Parliament’s recommendations that an effective sanctions policy needs to be established throughout the EU, developing clear criteria for when sanctions are to be applied, determining clear objectives, the form of sanctions to be applied and guidelines for their evaluation, which would help improve collaboration and synergy among Member States and ensure that there are no double standards when deciding on restrictive measures or sanctions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Strengthening the array of restrictive measures, through denying sanctioned leaders the right to perform monetary transactions within the Member States, to travel and obtain education, to provide funding to research centres and operate businesses, are just some of the instruments that we can employ.

With this own-initiative report, Parliament calls on the EU to adopt stricter measures and policies towards politicians and key figures in non-democratic regimes of third countries when they exercise their personal or commercial interests within the borders of the 27 Member States. We also call attention to the need to make violations of religious freedom and freedom of expression in third countries sufficient reason for Member States and the EU as a whole to implement more than political sanctions and responses. It is further proposed that forms, means and procedures for enforcing sanctions be codified more precisely than thus far. I voted in favour of the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In other words, people who, by getting round the measures imposed by Europe, manage to exercise, influence and exploit personal, economic and political interests on EU territory. Better coordination is therefore desirable among Member States in applying those measures imposed at EU level; in addition, EU Member States should actively investigate and prosecute persons or legal entities in Europe that have assisted sanctioned leaders and persons associated with them in evading or avoiding the sanctions imposed against them. Lastly, clear criteria must be developed for when restrictive measures are to be applied and, at the same time, the objectives for such measures must be identified: by establishing precise rules, it is possible to enhance the consistency and credibility of EU sanctions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report drafted by Mr Watson concerns the proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on how to implement a consistent policy on regimes against which the EU applies restrictive measures when their leaders exercise their personal and commercial interests within EU borders. I voted for this report, as those who lead authoritarian regimes and enrich themselves through corruption and by exploiting the people and resources of their countries must be forced to respect human dignity.

Moreover, the explicit encouragement of support for parties that are in conflict, with a view to regime change or to shifts in political power in certain countries, constitutes unacceptable interference, which invariably includes undisguised ambitions to satisfy economic and/or political interests.

<p class="contents">However, the EU has often applied its sanctions policy inconsistently by treating third countries with similar human rights and democratic records differently, and such actions have prompted criticism for applying double standards. I therefore firmly believe that it is necessary to develop clear criteria for when restrictive measures are to be applied, the objectives for such measures, the form of sanctions to be applied, guidelines for their periodic evaluation and the review procedure to be followed in consultation with the European Parliament. We should establish the criteria in a way that enhances the consistency and credibility of EU sanctions, but leaves sufficient flexibility at the operational level, enabling the Union to leverage the instrument as an effective tool in its external action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sanctions themselves should only be deployed to influence the accountable elites of repressive or criminal regimes and the responsible non-state actors of failed states, and should ensure that restrictive measures and sanctions are targeted and proportionate to the objective pursued, limiting as far as possible any adverse impact on civil populations, especially the most vulnerable.

Similarly, Kim Jong-il has roughly USD 4 billion in European banks. The last example is Omar al-Bashir, President of Sudan, who is suspected of siphoning off USD 9 billion from the oil boom his country has enjoyed and depositing much of it in British banks. This is precisely why EU Member States need to strictly enforce the travel bans imposed on sanctioned persons, preventing them from travelling within the EU for any purpose other than humanitarian. It is equally important that EU Member States investigate and, where appropriate, prosecute persons or legal entities in Europe that have assisted sanctioned leaders and persons associated with them to evade or avoid the sanctions legally imposed on them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the application of sanctions or restrictive measures is only effective if it forms part of a consistent and comprehensive human rights strategy for the EU and its Member States.

We must ensure that the impact of such measures on ordinary citizens is minimised. To that end, we need to have common criteria and standards for the introduction and abolition of sanctions. A full contribution by both the countries of the European Economic Area and those countries seeking EU membership will increase the effectiveness of restrictive measures. The imposition of sanctions should also be mandatory for all, both third-country persons and entities operating in the EU market, and citizens and economic entities of EU Member States operating outside the EU.

The EU is now the world’s biggest market and the largest donor of development aid. It represents a unique opportunity for promoting human rights and respect for the rules of peaceful coexistence of the community of Member States. Unfortunately, thus far, the cumbersome red tape surrounding the EU’s restrictive measures against regimes that do not respect international law, and the failure of such measures to feed into one another, have meant that they have not always had the desired effect as deterrents and sanctions. It is unjust that sometimes, peoples that are already oppressed or European companies and citizens should have suffered the consequences of sanctions, while the corrupt, violent local elites have managed to evade them. In the same way, it is equally unjust that third countries take and have taken advantage of European respect for the rule of law and fundamental rights. I therefore join Mr Watson in calling for the Council to adopt, as soon as possible, clear rules – to be applied uniformly and subject to periodic review – that will enable the restrictive measures to be more effective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A natural corollary of this is the need to reject authoritarian regimes which, instead of pursuing the common good of the people that they represent, are predisposed to satisfy the personal interests of the holders of posts in public bodies. In this context, it is appropriate that any measures adopted by the EU clearly identify which individuals are subject to sanctions, on the one hand, and when sanctions should be applied, on the other, so that measures adopted will be targeted at the subjects to be sanctioned, in order to prevent the people of the country from being affected, wherever possible. Any guidelines established should also be adopted by all of the Member States, in order to ensure an effective foreign policy. Moreover, and this is a key point in the report, they should take advantage of the possibility that a large proportion of the personal assets of leaders subjected to the sanctions will be within EU borders, opening the door to more effective action by the EU.

I therefore support the contents of this report, as it states that economic and financial sanctions applied to those in power and/or the natural and legal persons and/or entities concerned should also include all financial assets and property within EU borders. To this end, there is a need to set out clear criteria for applying sanctions and coordinating them among the Member States, in order to evaluate the assets of individuals who appear on the sanctions list, so that these assets may be confiscated.

<p class="contents">According to Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), ‘The Union’s action on the international scene shall be guided by the principles which have inspired its own creation, development and enlargement, and which it seeks to advance in the wider world: democracy, the rule of law, the universality and indivisibility of human rights and fundamental freedoms, respect for human dignity, the principles of equality and solidarity, and respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law’. The regimes against which the EU applies restrictive measures, when their leaders exercise their personal and commercial interests within EU borders, are regimes that violate human rights, fundamental freedoms, the rule of law and principles of good governance. The purpose of these restrictive measures is to promote peace and security globally and the principles of Article 21 of the TEU.

There have been many examples – some of which are mentioned in this report – where the leaders of ruthless dictatorships have increased their wealth with the help of other EU Member States. Even more shocking is the fact that all of this went on very openly and for a long time. Gaddafi’s regime, for instance, was estimated to have assets worth billions throughout the EU, particularly private property in the United Kingdom. The fortune of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and his family amounted to almost USD 70 million, mostly invested in the EU and USA. As a minimum, we urgently need to tighten restrictive measures against recognised authoritarian regimes, directing such measures against their personal and commercial activities within the EU. I welcome the basic idea behind the report that we need to have a consistent policy towards authoritarian regimes. However, we must seek more. We also need a consistent policy towards those Member States that violate the rules. Last week, Human Rights Watch published a report which condemned the EU and its Member States for demonstrating an unwillingness to combat human rights violations within the EU, despite the fact that the EU itself spoke of the importance of human rights and freedoms during the Arab Spring. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe defends the universal values that it promotes and for which it must ensure respect. In that regard, it must set an example and impose sanctions on those who violate human rights and fundamental freedoms. Any EU sanctions regime must respect the principles of legality and proportionality and avoid penalising the populations of the countries concerned. Otherwise, the cure would be worse than the disease. We must not lose sight of the fact that the aim of these sanctions is to force authoritarian leaders to initiate democratic change, stop oppressing their people and restore the rule of law. I am also in favour of strengthening coordination on an international level. Indeed, the high number of parties involved requires exemplary cooperation in order to implement the relevant instruments. An absence of coordinated multilateral action would result in less effective sanctions. Finally, I believe that it is essential, for the credibility of our foreign policy, to find a balance between coercive diplomacy and permanent dialogue with the regimes in question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Imposing sanctions means getting rid of a space that could and should be used for dialogue, negotiation and diplomatic mediation. We do not accept acts of direct intervention and intrusion in the internal affairs of countries by supporting one of the sides in a conflict, which often goes hand-in-hand with sanctions. Recently, there have been several unfortunate cases in which foreign powers have directly interfered in political change in a country through various forms of support for one of the sides in a conflict, and it is obvious that this was not done in a ‘disinterested’ way. It is sovereign peoples that should decide their own destinies and futures, without being subjected to pressure and interference from foreign powers. The unilateral decision to apply sanctions takes this approach by failing to respect the sovereignty of peoples. Instead, what is needed is total compliance with international law, the United Nations Charter and the principles contained therein. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We, Members of the European Parliament, agree that the process within the EU should be harmonised, the directive should apply to limited liability companies and allow companies to exercise their right of establishment by migrating to a host Member State without losing their legal personality. The transfer should not circumvent legal, social and fiscal conditions. Any company against which proceedings for winding-up, liquidation, insolvency or suspension of payments or other similar proceedings have been brought should not be allowed to undertake a cross-border transfer of seat.

The European Parliament has exercised this right because, in its opinion, the Commission’s inaction on this issue is a mistake as it is failing to remedy obstacles preventing companies from exercising one of the fundamental rights granted to them by the EU – freedom of establishment throughout the European Union. This opinion of the European Parliament is based on the results of several public consultations, as well as the conclusions of the European Court of Justice, that too many disparities still remain in the national legislation of the Member States applicable to company establishment, preventing the exercising of the freedom of establishment, and a harmonised regime should therefore be established throughout the EU. The harmonisation of such a legal regime applicable to company establishment throughout the EU would facilitate the removal of many administrative obstacles and a reduction in the social and tax costs of establishing a company in another Member State. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, we want to prevent the transfer of company seats from resulting in the liquidation of a company in its home country and, on the other, we want to ensure that the employees are not the victims of this transfer and do not lose any of their social rights. As rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, my aim was to ensure that the transfer does not affect the rights of creditors, employees or shareholders. In my opinion, the social aspects of the transfer are crucial. We must ensure that the employees are involved in the company seat transfer process: they must be consulted, informed and, if necessary, have access to legal remedies, with suspensive effect. Employees should no longer be the victims of company seat transfers but should instead be able to benefit from them, regardless of whether the companies involved are large or small. That is the only way in which we will be able to encourage our companies to be more mobile, in order to respond to competition, while combating social dumping. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report, drafted by Ms Regner, concerns Parliament’s recommendations to the Commission to proceed with the 14th Company Law Directive, which has already been enshrined in EU regulations, regarding companies transferring their registered office from one Member State to another. Provided that workers’ rights are safeguarded, it is vital that companies be able to transfer their registered office, as this will save time and money. However, legal uncertainties and bureaucracy, which differs from one Member State to the next, have been preventing its implementation. Moreover, legislation should prevent situations of abuse and opportunism, such as the establishment of companies reduced to a mere e-mail inbox. This is not the first time that Parliament has pressured the Commission to table a proposal in this area.

In view of this, Parliament is recommending that the Commission table a 14th Company Law Directive, on the cross-border transfer of registered offices. Within this framework, it will have to consider the interests of shareholders, who should not see their pre-transfer rights set back by the relocation of the registered office, the interests of the company itself, and finally the interests of the employees and all those involved with the company.

Locating production in markets that offer very competitive supplies, in terms of raw materials but, above all, of labour, or that have less onerous tax systems, is nowadays one of the main solutions implemented by firms to deal with globalised markets where competition with emerging economies is increasingly strong. The continuity of the legal personality of the transferred company, its recognition in the destination Member State and in the home Member State, as well as the legislation applicable to the company undergoing transfer, are, however, all issues that come under the legal systems of the countries involved in the transfer and, in particular, the type of connection with and recognition of the companies that Member States choose to adopt.

We need both to restore the balance of the parts of the budget allocated to preventing humanitarian disasters and to retain adequate financial leeway to enable us to intervene rapidly if a crisis arises. The new financial framework provides for an increase in the budget for the humanitarian aid instrument, which will help us to anticipate disasters. In addition, the new financing arrangements will allow unspent funds in the reserve to be carried over to the following year for urgent humanitarian needs. Finally, we call for particular care for children, as well as expectant mothers and mothers of young children, with regard to the provision of food, clothing, evacuation and transportation, and medical facilities with a view to preventing unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases, as priority areas under the existing financial mechanisms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, there is a need to ensure appropriate control and transparency as regards the use of EU funds, and to increase the accountability of beneficiaries, stopping the misuse of allocated funds. I believe that it is important to take account of the recommendation made by the European Court of Auditors that we need to improve distribution and post-distribution monitoring and reach an agreement with the United Nations agencies that manage the distribution of humanitarian assistance together with the EU on reinforcing the audit work carried out and increasing the reliability of checks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Through the Directorate General for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection, the Commission grants a level of humanitarian aid that makes the EU the world’s largest donor. The management of humanitarian funds has, for some time, involved a number of critical issues that Parliament and the European Court of Auditors have recognised and often brought to light. With this report, Parliament therefore calls on the Commission to act on a number of important measures to improve the management of humanitarian aid. As stressed by the rapporteur, it is essential to ensure that partners effectively follow up on the findings of audit procedures, and it is important to guarantee that UN reports, drawn up case by case, clearly contain information on the results of individual projects in the area covered by the financial intervention. It is also important to improve the methods for, and practice of, assessing potential partners in the context of framework partnership agreements and, lastly, to pay careful attention, from a strategic perspective, to the possibility that in some cases, humanitarian aid policy may have a negative effect, such as, for example, the chance that food aid might drive down the capacity for local production.

Checks on the use of funds also have to be tightened where the EU delivers humanitarian assistance through joint management together with other partners – the United Nations and other international organisations. In cases of joint management of humanitarian projects, budget implementation and control are delegated to international organisations, and the European Commission only conducts field monitoring and verification missions. In the context of the discharge procedure, the European Court of Auditors and Parliament have frequently criticised the joint management method of international organisations. The criticism is due to the lack of coherence and rigidity, as well as the various sources of confusion stemming from the many added layers of legislation, which are a major cause of errors. Weaknesses in terms of control and follow-up of the use of EU funds have also been the subject of much criticism. This report therefore proposes replacing the joint management method with indirect management, and this would strengthen the responsibility in relation to the Commission of the parties managing the budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this context, I recall that Parliament has, for many years, been calling for a more realistic humanitarian aid budget in the interests of remedying the chronic underfunding of the relevant budget lines, making it possible to provide some financial leeway throughout the financial year, and maintaining a coherent balance between the financing of measures to prevent humanitarian disasters and of measures to ensure rapid responses to natural and man-made disasters. In this respect, I welcome the Commission communication on the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework, which provides for an increase in the humanitarian aid instrument budget to EUR 6.4 billion over this period. That would amount to an annual average of EUR 915 million, as against EUR 813 million in 2007-2013. I also note with satisfaction the increase in the Emergency Aid Reserve for the same period, bringing it up to EUR 2.5 billion, as well as the proposal for unspent funds in the reserve to be carried over to the following year.

It is vital to go beyond the current system which risks creating discontinuity, cancelling out or undermining the potential long-term results.</p>

The earthquakes in Haiti and Japan, Cyclone Thane in India, flooding in Pakistan or drought in Somalia would be just some of the most serious examples of disasters, not to mention the humanitarian impact of the civil revolutions which have engulfed the whole world. An ever growing number of refugees need food, shelter and medical assistance. Millions of children are undernourished and, unfortunately, many of them, after receiving treatment, end up in the same situation due to a lack of food. Furthermore, the problems caused by natural disasters are exacerbated by the acts of violence which prevent humanitarian organisations from reaching those in need of help. In these circumstances, I join my colleagues in sounding an alarm bell with regard to making these programmes more efficient. I call on the Commission not only to improve the controls over and monitoring of the funds earmarked for humanitarian aid, but also to impose a bilateral audit and measurable impact indicators, in cooperation with its partners, as part of funding humanitarian programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the mechanisms undoubtedly available to the Union in evaluating how humanitarian aid is provided is budgetary control. The purpose of the measures proposed by the Commission is to make the humanitarian aid budget more transparent and make those who manage it more accountable. I hope they will bear fruit.

The own-initiative report under consideration, drafted by Mr Ehrenhauser, concerns the implementation of EU financial resources in humanitarian aid, taking into account the recommendations included in the report by the European Court of Auditors, specifically regarding control of funds transferred to NGOs. At times, there is so much bureaucracy involved in implementing many humanitarian aid programmes that the cost/benefit relationship in interventions is far from satisfactory. Moreover, there are major cost differences between comparable projects, which is unacceptable. As such, and without jeopardising the continuity of these programmes, there is a need to adopt measures that will contribute to making them more effective.

Of the total EUR 9.8 billion of humanitarian aid provided worldwide in 2010, 41% was delivered by the EU (accumulated by funds from the 27 Member States in addition to the Commission through DG ECHO). These funds allow the EU to show solidarity and provide immediate relief to regions hurt by natural and man-made disasters. The EU’s growing involvement and importance as a humanitarian aid provider is on the rise, and so are the requirements to ensure proper use of taxpayers’ money; thus, I welcome the current report, which reviews the budgetary control of EU humanitarian aid management by DG ECHO. Identifying areas of weakness in control over the funds and proposing points where improvements could be made is important for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of humanitarian aid money. However, I also believe that the evaluation process should take account of the fact that most recipient countries do not have the proper means to provide a full account of how money was spent, especially in a time of emergency.

We therefore recognise the benefits of seeking new arrangements for financing by the Directorate General for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (DG ECHO) together with its partners, but stress also that effective monitoring of the use of funds in the form of audits of the partners carried out by private audit firms is essential and helps to legitimise the humanitarian sector. We therefore commend DG ECHO’s efforts to promote the use of innovative approaches such as the cash-based approach and, in particular, unconditional transfers, which are directed at the most vulnerable groups. Indeed, these approaches can be more efficient than assistance in kind, and do not necessarily carry a greater fiduciary risk. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This total amount is made up of contributions from the Member States (64%) and the Commission (36%). The Directorate General for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (ECHO) is the responsible Directorate General within the EU for the implementation of humanitarian aid and disaster prevention. ECHO operates on an international basis, supporting about 200 partners throughout the world – NGOs, UN agencies and international organisations. The measures are managed from the Commission’s headquarters in Brussels through a network of over 40 offices in all the relevant regions. It is a problem that the budgetary plan and budgetary controls in these areas are not managed centrally by the Commission, but that this task is entrusted to various international organisations, which carry out internal controls according to their own accounting and auditing procedures. Since the principle of exclusive or single auditing is pursued, the Commission does not perform any audits of its own. It limits its activities to field monitoring and verification missions. The European Court of Auditors has criticised this delegation of administration on numerous occasions because it leads to a lack of coherence, a complicated network of legal regulations, and inadequate control and follow-up of the use of EU funds. I would therefore welcome moves by the Commission to address this problem when revising the Financial Regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

ECHO is the Directorate General (DG) of the European Commission responsible for the implementation of EU humanitarian aid (Regulation (EC) 1257/96). DG ECHO’s mandate encompasses humanitarian assistance and civil protection, the two main instruments at the EU’s disposal to ensure delivery of humanitarian assistance to the victims of disasters and protracted conflicts. ECHO implements its mandate by funding about 200 partners: NGOs, UN agencies, international organisations and specialised agencies of the Member States. The Commission manages its humanitarian activities from its headquarters in Brussels via a network of more than 40 field offices all over the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU legal tradition is directed towards solving disputes between individuals rather than through a collective entity. Some Member States’ legal systems have developed differing approaches to the issue of collective redress. It is in this context that the Commission must put forward evidence that, pursuant to the principle of subsidiarity, an action at EU level is opportune.

Cross-border trade is very slow to develop in the EU because consumers have no guarantee that their rights will be protected in the event of a problem and they will receive adequate redress. The integration of European markets and the consequent increase in cross-border activities highlight the need for a common European approach to collective redress. The Commission has made a significant effort to address this issue, which hitherto was regulated at Member State level. I believe that we need to provide a clear impact assessment and outline possible measures at EU level to improve the EU’s current regulatory framework, so as to allow victims of infringements of EU law to be compensated for the damage they sustain and thus contribute to consumer confidence and smoother functioning of the internal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As it is a recent legal instrument in Europe, consumers are not familiar with collective redress. The benefits of exercising this right are unarguable. This means that when individual financial claims do not provide them with access to legal proceedings, consumers can initiate a collective action to bring legal proceedings. This also allows the costs incurred by such action to be shared. Collective action provides consumers with an effective means of expression. At the same time, it ensures the most efficient functioning of the single market within which citizens can communicate directly with commercial agencies. I should point out that this mechanism eliminates discrimination among citizens with regard to the value of the legal actions and their admissibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In adopting the Lehne report on Thursday, 2 February, the European Parliament aims to further the debate on this approach and move towards establishing collective redress within the EU, and I fully support this. This new possibility of collective redress allows claimants in the Member States to group their cases together to denounce mass damage. However, the new system will also have to take into account the lessons learned from the excesses of the US system, which is fighting against class actions that are at times abusive or unmeritorious. To this end, the report calls on the Commission to take into consideration a number of key aspects when drawing up its legislative proposal: limiting the admissibility of actions to clearly defined groups by giving a judge discretionary powers to carry out a preliminary admissibility check of any potential collective action and prohibiting punitive damages. The European Parliament has set the ball rolling; it is now essential for the Commission to fill this legal vacuum by ensuring the fundamental right of victims to be compensated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, fair access to justice should remain available to all EU citizens. Attention should be drawn to the fact that a system based on collective legal actions can usefully supplement, but is no substitute for, individual legal protection. The European Parliament welcomes the Commission’s work towards a common European approach to collective redress. It is asking the Commission to demonstrate in its impact assessment that, pursuant to the principle of subsidiarity, action is needed at EU level in order to improve the current EU regulatory framework so as to allow victims of infringements of EU law to be compensated for the damage they sustain and thus contribute to consumer confidence and the smoother functioning of the internal market. The European Parliament also welcomes the efforts of Member States to strengthen the rights of victims of unlawful behaviour by introducing or planning to introduce legislation aimed at facilitating redress while avoiding an abusive litigation culture, but also recognises that national collective redress mechanisms are widely divergent, in particular, in terms of scope and procedural characteristics, which may undermine the enjoyment of rights by citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This implies that, in the majority of cases, the infringements perpetrated against these groups go unpunished due to economic barriers (the cost of an individual case being disproportionate to the possible compensation) and psychological ones (fears about the length of procedures) and difficulties in accessing the necessary information.</p>
<p class="contents">Vice versa, bundling the claims would not only strengthen their legal position but would also make it possible to simplify the processes and reduce their costs. On the other hand, there remain quite a few problems, both with regard to the different jurisdictions in individual Member States and to the need to curb misuse of the instrument. In any event, it is advisable for the EU to have a common horizontal approach to the issue, without following the US class action model and without amending national laws, and to establish a horizontal reference framework instrument that enables citizens and companies to enforce their rights under EU legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it is crucial that Europe should not repeat the errors already committed in the US, where the practice of class action has become a primary source of profit mainly for a handful of powerful legal firms, only in very rare cases acting as an effective consumer protection tool. In this field, the European Union can do better than the US, first of all by encouraging the parties to reach alternative agreements not requiring formal recourse to legal means, thus simplifying and speeding up the process; and subsequently, by establishing a legislative framework that does not leave room for abuse, hence, with specific timeframes for proceedings, and rights to protection in line with European legal traditions. Only in this way will it be possible to prevent a useful tool for protecting citizens becoming a means of unfair competition between private entities. The report on which we voted today is a move in this direction, and is therefore a good starting point to build on in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The various national jurisdictions already safeguard this. However, I think we need to be cautious regarding collective redress. On the one hand, we do not wish to open the door to a system like that in the United States, in which abuse of the law is commonplace, jeopardising the activity of thousands of companies. On the other, in relation to the area of competition, the existence of collective action will mean consumers harmed by an anti-competitive practice that has been penalised pursuant to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union will be able to claim damages. This will lead to the associated application of fines and to the compensation of consumers harmed by such practices. Once again, that could have serious effects for businesses. I therefore believe we should proceed with caution in this area, and I prefer alternative dispute-resolution mechanisms that are cheaper, faster and, in many cases, more effective. As such, I consider it crucial that Parliament continues to play an active role in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Improved access to justice by the European public has been one of the concerns of the EU, which has adopted a number of regulations and directives on this issue in recent years.

According to the research and surveys conducted by the European Commission, one out of five European consumers will not go to court for disputes amounting to less than EUR 1 000, and nearly half of them claim that they would not go to court to obtain redress of less than EUR 200. The main obstacles facing consumers include high costs, the risk of court proceedings as well as lengthy and complicated procedures relating to redress. However, in the case of collective action, as many as 79% of respondents declared their willingness to defend their rights in court. We should take steps to empower European consumers, who represent the weaker party in relation to the entity infringing their rights. A mechanism for collective redress already exists in Poland, and its principles could prove useful when working on the future European instrument. As it is a relatively new instrument, introduced by the Act of 17 December 2009, its application still requires thorough testing. However, it is unquestionably a step in the right direction. A common mechanism for collective redress at EU level is necessary in order to make it possible and easier for citizens and businesses to access and exercise the rights to which they are entitled. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his initiative and I eagerly await the Commission’s proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the lack of a collective redress system for the EU undermines the enforcement of EU legislation on consumer protection already in place, and consequently has a knock-on effect on consumer empowerment and confidence within the single market. In order to achieve a competitive and socially sustainable single market framework, the Union cannot afford to keep putting off the creation of a Europe-wide collective redress mechanism for consumers and citizens. Sufficient amounts of reports, consultations, workshops and seminars have been drawn up and taken place at EU level. It is now time for the Commission to adopt a unified position and take clearly defined legislative action. The formula for completing the EU Alternative Dispute Resolution system, for which the Commission has recently brought forward a legislative proposal, necessitates the putting into place of this collective redress structure. To this end, I feel that for any final ADR package to be endorsed by the European citizen, the Commission must factor in the existence and availability of Europe-wide collective redress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The single market and the Internet have created a virtual trading space which consumers want to be able to trust. Despite this, consumers are often completely on their own against manufacturers. It is a battle between David and Goliath that does not leave room for recognition of the rights enshrined by the directives which we work to protect on a daily basis. Class action is an experience consumers have embarked upon in order to ensure that their voices are heard, as otherwise they would be isolated and therefore weak. Personally, I believe that there should be more incentives for ADR mechanisms, even if they often depend on the trader’s willingness to cooperate. The availability of an effective judicial redress system would act as a strong incentive for parties to agree an out-of-court settlement, which is likely to avoid a considerable amount of litigation. The setting up of ADR schemes at European level should be encouraged, so as to allow effective settlement of disputes as a more attractive option than court proceedings, and have the power to order the parties involved to first seek a collective consensual resolution of the claim before launching collective court proceedings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As such, it is understood that Union regulation began by standardising the commonly set criteria for the international jurisdiction of courts, by determining the commonly set criteria for substantive law applicable to disputes of a certain kind, by supporting alternative means of dispute resolution, or even by introducing procedural models for low-value actions. Therefore, EU-level regulation of collective redress represents progress in this area: in this framework, there will now be a ‘type’ of litigation relationship – mass litigation – that is regulated uniformly throughout the Union. This is an intervention that could meet with resistance, since the regulation to be introduced could clash with certain aspects of national procedural law.

Nevertheless, we need to establish collective redress in Europe: it is clear that when a group of citizens falls victim to the same infringement, individual actions are not always the solution, whether the goal is to put an end to an illegal practice or obtain redress, especially when the individual damage is minor in comparison to the cost of legal action.

Far from protecting consumers, some of my colleagues unfortunately tend to treat them like children instead. Three points would protect the consumer, however. Firstly, this claim was entirely clear: ‘now contains X% less of [nutrient]’. Secondly, it could be used only if the nutrient content was reduced by at least 15%. Finally, the claim was only allowed to be used for a maximum of one year. Despite the fact that the European Parliament never stops pointing out how crucial it is to combat obesity, reduce the sugar content, salt content, fat content, etc. of our food, it is today adopting an incomprehensible position by rejecting a claim that could, in fact, have given the food industry an incentive to move in that direction, thereby benefiting the health of consumers.

I would like to point out that under current legislation, companies wishing to improve nutrition characteristics have to make drastic changes to their recipes, a difficult operation for SMEs in terms of both technology and economics. Using comparative nutrition claims is, in fact, currently only permitted on condition that the product contains at least 30% less of the substance indicated than the average in the product category. Use of the proposed claim would only have been allowed for one year, in order to encourage the gradual reformulation of products. This would have allowed consumers to get used to the gradual reduction in fat, sugar and salt content, with the resulting health benefits. There are already successful examples of this approach, such as in the UK where people are becoming used to less salty flavours through a gradual reduction in salt content. Therefore, I hope that the Commission will formulate a new proposal as soon as possible with which Parliament will be able to agree. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although I support the efforts of the food industry to make the content of food ‘healthier’, this new advertising claim will lead to a lack of transparency for consumers rather than encouraging the industry to invest in ‘improving’ its products. The food industry continues to have the option of promoting the products with the label ‘reduced sugar’ or ‘reduced salt’, but these advertising claims are only permitted if the content of the nutrient is reduced by at least 30% compared with other products in the same food category. However, the new advertising claim ‘now contains X% less of [nutrient]’ that is now to be permitted does not have any such restriction, and may consequently confuse consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, with the claim ‘15% less sugar’, consumers also expect a corresponding reduction in energy content. According to the Commission’s proposal, however, this advertising claim can also be used if the energy content remains the same on account of other additives. As a result, consumers will have the impression that this product contains fewer calories on account of the reduction in sugar content, although the energy content will remain the same.</p>

Parliament’s concern that there would be a desire to take things further, or even too far, led it to adopt a position which was inconsistent with the principles it seeks to defend. Obesity has become a major health problem and we must tackle the phenomenon in a firm and practical manner. This requires progressive and broad-minded measures to ensure that private sector operators are also involved in meeting public health objectives and improving the nutritional quality of food. The initial proposal, which Parliament chose to reject, called for the statement ‘now contains X% less of [nutrient]’ to be added to compulsory nutritional labelling. To employ this claim, a minimum reduction of 15% of the nutrient was required, and its use was limited to one year only, which would have encouraged the food industry to continue strengthening its efforts with regard to consumer transparency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In such claims, the product, after all, is only compared with itself, rather than with other similar products that might well actually have much lower contents of salt/fat, etc. Better regulation is required that both informs consumers properly and provides an impetus for manufacturers to develop better food.

Furthermore, in the latter case, a reduction of at least 10% (for micronutrients), 25% (for sodium) or 30% (for sugars/fats) by comparison with other similar products is required. Effectively, a consumer might assume that the quantified statement in the ‘now contains X% less of [nutrient]’ claim signifies a greater reduction than that implied by the ‘reduced [nutrient]’ or ‘light’ claims, despite the requirements being much stricter for the latter than for the ‘now contains X% less of [nutrient]’ claim, for which a minimum reduction of just 15% is specified. Therefore, I am pleased that Parliament has decided to send the proposal back to the Commission for amendments that will restore the balance of its primary objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the new nutrition claim which was submitted to us (‘now contains X% less of [nutrient]’), could have been misleading for consumers. This claim involved reformulated products being compared with a previous version of the product, without the consumer necessarily knowing the starting level of the nutrient in question – this nutritional value could well be excessively high in comparison with other products on the market, which, not having been reformulated, would therefore not be allowed to bear a nutrition claim. A further problem is that we know that when sugars are reduced, consumers expect a reduction in energy. Yet the text would have allowed the ‘reduced fats/sugars’ claim to be made even when the product’s energy content was still equal to the energy contained in a similar product. Finally, the new claims might have led to confusion with existing claims, such as ‘reduced [nutrient]’ and ‘light/lite’, for which the requirements are, in fact, stricter.

It is, of course, true that the food industry should be encouraged to reformulate foods to make them healthier, and that allowing the industry to demonstrate and ‘claim’ reformulation to their customers will drive this process. I do not think anybody really disputes that. The issue is precisely how the industry is allowed to communicate this information to consumers, or, in other words, the methodology behind the health claim. And the fact remains that, with this proposed health claim, a product claiming to have ‘x percent less’ fat could still have a very high fat content compared to similar products on the market. This is why a significant majority of us in this House believe that this claim is essentially misleading. I fully support the reformulation of foods as part of the EU’s strategy on nutrition, but the Commission, in cooperation with EFSA, must find a better way to drive reformulation through health claims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The use of nutrition and health claims must be easy for the average consumer to understand.

At the moment, there are already claims such as ‘reduced [nutrient]’ and ‘light/lite’. The ‘light/lite’ claim means a reduction of at least 10% (for micronutrients), 25% (for sodium) or 30% (for sugars/fats) in comparison with other similar products. The new wording being proposed is ambiguous, misleading and confusing for consumers and might act as a disincentive to producers to meet the requirements for the ‘reduced [nutrient]’ and ‘light/lite’ claims, as it is easier to reduce a nutrient by 15% than by 30%.</p>

The proposed claim had the potential to be very misleading. Given the number of nutrition claims already allowed, it is already hard for consumers to know which product is the best for themselves and their family. In particular, the new claim could have caused confusion with the existing ‘reduced’ claim, which actually requires a larger reduction of 30%, and this must be in comparison with a range of similar products on the market rather than previous versions of the same product. Now that Parliament has said no to this claim, the Commission will have to rethink their approach.

Labelling on food which tells me that an item contains 10% less salt or 20% fewer colourings is meant to be informative, yet, as often as not, such labels lead to mix-ups and misunderstandings. 10% less than what, I ask myself? That is also a question that this report has asked. I think that it has come up with the wrong answer. When I buy a packet of crisps telling me that it now contains 10% less fat, I assume that means that it contains 10% less fat than the previous recipe for the same product, rather than 10% less fat than a similar product. It is important that we all eat well and have the right information to be able to make the correct health choices, but this report makes things 100% more confusing rather than 100% clear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the rapporteur pointed out ‘all the elements contained in the new Treaty can be achieved, and to a large extent have already been achieved’ through European Parliament. It should indeed be stressed that several of the measures contained in the Treaty resulted from European Parliament debates. We are thus convinced that the European Parliament must play a decisive role in the economic governance that is currently being developed and therefore, we must be consulted on measures regarding stability, policy coordination and economic governance. Furthermore, there are two things I regret: firstly, that the final text does not take account of Parliament’s call for its President to be involved in euro area summits, and secondly, that the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic were unwilling to ally with us on this issue. As Joseph Daul, the Chair of my political group, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), pointed out, the Treaty must now be signed, ratified and integrated into the EU Treaties ‘as quickly as possible’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fiscal stability of the EU and its Member States is an important element of resolving the current crisis, and the new Fiscal Treaty will provide a framework for the new principles of coordinating and monitoring the economies of the EU Member States. The European Parliament has managed to ensure the inclusion of very important provisions in the final text of the Treaty, particularly as regards the participation of non-euro area Member States in euro area summits. So far, we have managed to negotiate the right to take part in those meetings dealing with competitiveness, the global architecture of the euro area and the fundamental rules that will apply to these Member States in future, but I believe that there should no longer be restrictions on the participation of non-euro area Member States in other meetings.

I think that the commitments made on budgetary discipline will bring about the fiscal stability required for a sustainable economic recovery. The restriction on the public debt and budget deficit of the States party to the Treaty will create the conditions for genuine prosperity based on economic development and not on loans. I also welcome the commitments made by the Heads of State or Government to boost economic growth by creating new jobs and reducing unemployment, especially among young people. I think that it is very appropriate to use EU funds to support the creation of SMEs. I also welcome the initiative to use unspent EU funds as security for young entrepreneurs to obtain bank loans. In the case of Romania, which is lacking in its absorption of EU funds, these measures are particularly useful because it will make it possible for the unspent funds that are allocated to be used to create SMEs and generate new jobs. I hope that the European Council meeting in March will adopt a consistent plan for implementing these decisions, including specific programmes for stimulating employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Member States need to stabilise their public finances. Austerity measures and budgetary stability are only part of the solution to the crisis. Europe is facing an ageing population while, on the other hand, the youth unemployment rate has never been so high, meaning the Member States are facing enormous challenges. The Member States need to implement structural reforms in order to overcome these obstacles. Europe should also focus on measures leading to economic growth and on promoting competitiveness. I therefore voted for this resolution. However, there is also a need to establish a bailout fund quickly, to create Eurobonds and to introduce an EU-level financial transaction tax. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet, our Heads of State or Government persist along the path which has widened the gap between the people of the EU and the EU itself. After having ignored EU citizens’ referendum votes on the Constitutional Treaty, they signed a new Treaty amongst themselves, which was negotiated practically behind closed doors and focused on austerity and budgetary discipline. There has been no real inclusion of the European Parliament, no public debate and no cooperation with national parliaments. Moreover, in terms of content, there is nothing on growth or future investment. As I said during the vote on our previous resolution, I am more than doubtful about this new Treaty. I therefore voted against today’s resolution as I feel that it is not critical enough of this Treaty that is being presented to us as the only possible route. As well as being quite useless in content (since many of the measures can be achieved through EU law) and incomplete (for it lacks balance between austerity and growth), it is highly questionable in form: if we want to regain the faith of EU citizens, this is surely not the way to go about it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Parliament (EP) recognises that fiscal stability is an important element of resolving the current crisis, but stresses that economic recovery requires measures to strengthen solidarity and boost sustainable growth and employment. The EP welcomes the fact that the European Council now recognises this but insists that concrete and far-reaching measures are needed. We need to understand that simply making savings is not enough to overcome the crisis in the European Union. In order to ensure fiscal stability, the European Parliament proposes not just making use of the series of measures provided for, but establishing project bonds, a road map for stability bonds and introducing a financial transaction tax at European level, for which the Commission has already made a proposal. Furthermore, the EP insists that the contracting parties fully respect their commitment to integrate, within a maximum period of five years, the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance into the EU Treaties and asks for the remaining weaknesses of the Treaty of Lisbon to be tackled on this occasion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The measures contained in the international agreement fail to address the main causes of the economic crisis. On the contrary, they institutionalise the austerity policies currently being applied which put Europe in recession and its citizens in economic and social poverty. Furthermore, based on the international agreement, the facility to exercise an alternative fiscal policy is denied to democratically elected governments. This is a scandal. The joint motion not only fails to reject the international agreement; it supports the recent changes to the architecture of EMU (economic governance, European Semester, Euro Plus Pact). The changes in question are the most reactionary, anti-democratic and extreme neoliberal response to the current crisis. The GUE/NGL Group tabled an alternative motion rejecting the measures in the international agreement and highlighting the need for Europe to move towards real solidarity, predicated on full employment, socio-economic growth, social cohesion and environmental protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition to the adoption of the International Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union, measures were approved relating to economic growth and job creation. The current economic and financial crisis is dragging on, obliging the Member States to adopt drastic measures to combat the deficit, with significant reductions in sums for investment, the consequences of which are reflected in increased unemployment rates, particularly amongst young people, and a lack of economic growth. The number of young adults under 25 years of age has already passed the 5.5 million mark, which is 22% of the total number of unemployed. I therefore welcome the increased rate of contribution to European programmes, and the series of measures intended to promote youth employment and support small and medium-sized enterprises.

Not even all the play acting, manipulation and propaganda manoeuvres can erase their role in a process that, if not stopped, will only lead the people and the EU itself into the abyss. However, we face the future with unshakeable faith in the struggle and its escalation in many EU countries, certain that, sooner rather than later, this policy and this course will be defeated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The so-called fiscal compact that was discussed will certainly not lead the European Union out of crisis. Austerity and cuts will take us into recession. Ultimately, due to this economic decline, it will then be even harder to pay back debts and they will become an increasing burden.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the meeting finally began to discuss the need to restart growth and employment, it was still inadequate and weak. Whereas cost-cutting measures almost look like law, the initiative for growth and employment has remained in the form of a general challenge. From a European perspective, such behaviour is extremely unfortunate. The growth initiative is weak. The role of Parliament in negotiating and deciding these key matters is minimised. However, Europe must remain united and stick to democratic principles and existing legal frameworks.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that we look for resources that can be sensibly invested in economic recovery. Unused resources from the EU’s Structural Funds, the tax on financial transactions, a stronger EIB, and European bonds.</p>

From my perspective, I welcome the announcement on the new fiscal treaty and hope it will be implemented without further delays. The Council’s decision to focus on growth as a complementary means to austerity is essential, since strict budgetary rules alone cannot solve the deepening of the crisis. Supporting SMEs, entrepreneurship and self-employment initiatives are the only way to encourage economic expansion, job creation and improving the EU’s long-term competitiveness. On the other hand, I deplore the fact only 25 Members rather than the whole EU decided to join the treaty. Because the agreed treaty does not really guarantee fiscal stability, coordinated action between all 27 EU Members is needed to restore investment and growth to Europe. Another point of contrast to EU shared solidarity is the exclusion of the European Parliament from participating in future meetings on EU governance. As a directly elected body, the European Parliament must be involved on a basis of equality with other EU institutions. Trying to address remaining challenges – the question of Greece for example – what we really need is leadership, flexibility and, above all, unity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, even though the proposed resolution, once again, stresses the fact that the Community method is the only way that a genuine economic and budgetary Union can be implemented and that budgetary discipline alone cannot solve Europe’s economic and financial crisis, the text does not call for a reassessment of the international agreement on a Fiscal Stability Union which Heads of State or Government approved this Monday. We need to tackle the underlying causes of the crisis by reassessing neoliberal policies and denounce the restrictive austerity mechanism with which current and future governments of Member States will have to comply. We also need to underline the extreme technocracy that is being applied in the agreement, which will, in fact, widen the gap between European institutions and European citizens, and finally, we need to point out that the draft agreement will institutionalise a two-speed Europe, with Member States who are party to the agreement, on the one hand, and those who are not, on the other. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, much work still remains to be done. We in the European Parliament, alongside national parliaments, should be able to be involved in and have our say in debates that have budgetary implications for us. Some of the Treaty’s provisions allow for this, and it is through such an approach that a European Parliament delegation was invited to participate in the negotiations of 30 January 2012. However, this resolution does not give sufficient recognition to the progress that this new text has enabled.

This Treaty sacrifices European nations’ desire for self-determination on the altar of European economic federalism.

Although the resolution criticises the International Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union, particularly for the lack of measures fostering sustainable growth and promoting employment, the truth is that it ends up accepting it. The resolution also calls for the creation of project bonds and a financial transaction tax as measures for achieving budgetary stability. That is a reasonable concern. However, the document is marked by its acquiescence to an agreement that legitimises the inclusion of deficit ceilings in national constitutions, so making Keynesian policies and the very idea of socialism illegal. In this light, the confusion that this international agreement introduces to the EU legal system is a minor problem in comparison to the authoritarian philosophy that marks the Treaty of the 25. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I have three objections, albeit isolated ones. Firstly, I consider it an exaggeration to state that ‘virtually all the elements’ of the treaty can be achieved within the framework of the EU Treaties in force, thus rendering this new treaty unnecessary. In truth, its most important items – first and foremost, the obligation for Member States to include binding rules on balanced budgets in their domestic legal systems – could not be the subject of EU legislation. Secondly, I agree that the treaty does not solve the Union’s current budgetary and economic crisis, but nor is that its purpose; rather, it is intended to prevent future crises. The present budgetary crisis could not be overcome without assuring creditors now that there will not be others in the future. Thirdly, while I entirely agree that a genuine ‘fiscal union’ is much more than budgetary discipline, also including the issue of joint loans for both the national budgets and the Union budget, I do not think it possible to omit the requirement for tax harmonisation. The very idea of the internal market is incompatible with ‘fiscal competition’ and ‘tax dumping’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Along with my fellow Members from the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, I have signed and tabled an alternative motion for a resolution. Our resolution is the only one to clearly reject this democratic show of strength that threatens to destroy the sovereignty of the peoples; it is the only one which clearly opposes the introduction of a new rule which sets the figure for Member States’ structural deficits at 0.5% of nominal GDP and which will, in fact, result in permanent austerity throughout the whole of Europe; again, it is the only one to object to the proposed sanctions and to call for public consultation on this matter.

This is an historic turning point: it will set the balanced budget rule in stone, thereby strengthening mutual trust between Member States. The economic governance for which we Members of the European Parliament have been calling for a long time is now becoming a reality. Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel have been hard at work from the beginning. The Franco-German pair shared the same view of the situation and proposed the same solution: if we are to recover from the economic crisis, we need to clean up our finances. The recovery will only happen if we lay solid foundations. My continuous support for this strategy has always been based on this idea. Whilst the vast majority of European governments have been pragmatic in their support for the treaty, I note that the French socialists have isolated themselves once again within their own European political family. They have not succeeded in imposing their wish to renegotiate the treaty. It makes one question the credibility of their revolutionary ideas for a ‘strong France within a strong Europe’.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although the EU Council did achieve a declaration on growth, Europe lacks concrete solutions on how to get out of the current recession and economic crisis.

This agreement on ‘stability, coordination and governance’ does not represent European parliamentarianism. It would perhaps be more apt to call it the ‘EU2’ Treaty.

As an Italian citizen, I am very pleased with this agreement that expresses faith in the euro area. The 17 countries with the euro will now meet at least twice a year, but at least once a year (and every time there are discussions about issues relating to the ‘institutional architecture’) they will have to open up to the other Member States. The summit also has the merit of having opened up discussions on an equally important issue, that of growth and employment, two key areas for relaunching the economies of all the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new International Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union should guarantee greater stability, since budgetary discipline will be stepped up and penalties will be automatically applied to countries failing to meet their targets. It is also important to stress inclusion in the constitution or similar legislation of the so-called ‘golden rule’, designed for structural deficits not to exceed 0.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) and for public debt to be below 60% of GDP. I am voting for this resolution because I fully agree that the European institutions and relevant Member States should adopt concrete measures intended to stimulate economic growth, to finance small and medium-sized enterprises, to create jobs, and to improve the workings of the single market. I agree with the resolution in advocating the creation of stability bonds and the approval of a financial transaction tax, better known as the Tobin tax. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Naturally, in the distant future, the euro area is interested in a joint liquid bond market as an alternative to the market for US dollar bonds, making the euro an internationally secure currency and replacing the dollar in this respect.

The Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left has once again opposed this denial of democracy. In response to the shift of sovereignty that has taken place without the slightest involvement of the people, the European Parliament has contented itself with asking for Parliament’s President to attend euro area summit meetings.

When will the European Parliament get it into its head that more Europe is not the answer to the current financial crisis? When will the European Parliament stop rearranging deckchairs on the Titanic and get down to the business of creating growth and jobs by completing the single market and promoting free trade with countries like India? And when, oh when, will the European Parliament realise that no matter how many resolutions it passes calling for an EU-wide financial transaction tax, that no such tax is going to materialise? The European Parliament may wail, gnash its teeth or whimper like a petulant child who wants a bicycle for Christmas, but it will not change the fact that taxation is a decision which needs to be taken unanimously by the Member States and the United Kingdom will not relent in its opposition to an EU-only tax. This is why the FTT will not happen.

A phased embargo of Iranian crude oil imports to the EU has been introduced, measures are being taken against the Central Bank of Iran, and further export restrictions have been imposed. These measures reflect the serious and growing concern regarding possible military dimensions to Iran’s nuclear programme. There is no effective dialogue between the West and Iran and there has been a dangerous increase in tension in the Gulf region. However, the objective of the EU is still to achieve a comprehensive and long-term settlement, which would build international confidence in an Iranian nuclear programme that is designed exclusively for peaceful purposes. I agree that when tackling this issue, we should pursue a diplomatic solution to the nuclear crisis by all means and avoid armed conflict, and the humanitarian implications of the additional sanctions against Iran should be thoroughly evaluated and monitored. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Over the past few months, Iran has acted on several points to undermine the European Union’s efforts towards international peace. It did so, among other things, by continuously violating Articles 2 and 3 of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, shrouding its nuclear programme in secrecy, and threatening to block the Strait of Hormuz, which could have severe implications regarding the supply of crude oil to Europe given the Strait’s strategic importance.

The mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), intended to clarify the ‘grey’ areas in Iran’s nuclear programme, ended on Tuesday without showing any obvious signs of progress. Although the IAEA’s investigation has been ongoing for eight years, it has been unable to establish so far whether Iran’s nuclear programme is purely for peaceful purposes, as has been constantly maintained by Iran’s leaders, or for military purposes as well. I welcome the unanimous backing given by European Union foreign ministers last week to impose an embargo on Iranian crude oil, but this is only a first step. The reaction from officials in Tehran was to be expected, with the Iranian Parliament wishing to approve a bill suspending completely oil exports from Iran to Member States of the European Union before the European embargo on Iranian oil fully comes into force. This is why the steps aimed at continuing dialogue must be supported and increased so that these situations can be successfully resolved through diplomatic channels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Iran, proud of its noble past founded on the history of ancient Persia, is taking on the role of a great power: it is refusing to sit at the negotiating table with the international community and is not allowing access to independent inspectors who could evaluate the implementation of its nuclear programme. At the same time, following several condemnations from international organisations, like the UN Security Council – of which it is a member – and sanctions imposed by the EU and the US, it still fails to respect the most basic human rights.

<p class="contents">Apart from sanctions, however, the greatest possible emphasis must be placed on the second dimension of diplomatic relations with Iran, that is, namely negotiations. Baroness Ashton, the ministers of the Member States and the Council should initiate a dialogue with Iran. This should not only be about the disputed and sensitive issue of Iran’s nuclear programme, but also about other topics, such as stability in the region, relations with neighbours, and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">If a consensus could be reached in one area, if a partnership of trust can be established, then there will be a greater chance of agreement in other areas, including the nuclear programme. I am therefore of the opinion that the diplomatic activity of European representatives with regard to Iran should be multi-faceted and should include efforts to emphasise diplomacy in the original sense of the word; that is to say, negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Iran must immediately stop its development of enrichment technology, which is far beyond the necessities to ensure a secure fuel supply for civil purposes and demonstrates disregard for international concerns over clandestine military intentions.

And it has to allow independent international specialists to observe and have a close look at its plans. The IAEA has to be allowed to enter the Iranian nuclear sites to see the real situation. I find it very regrettable that similar sanctions cannot be imposed at UN level, due to the Chinese and Russian veto.

In the medium term, China will take the opportunity to use the capacities thus made available to cover its own growing energy needs. This would balance the losses from the EU embargo, so that there would be no further pressure on Tehran. In other words, the oil boycott would not achieve the desired effect and the EU would be placed at an even greater disadvantage in geostrategic terms. We will have precisely the situation that exiled Iranians have warned against: the measures will hit the wrong people and will fuel anger against the West in increasingly large swathes of the population. For this reason, the EU should seek to exert a moderating effect on both sides, using all its resources to avoid an escalation. The fundamental aim should be that there should be absolutely no nuclear weapons in the Middle East. Nonetheless, the security of Israel must be guaranteed. Since the motion for a resolution does not move in this direction, I voted against it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I support the embargo decision in view of the concerns that the Iranian nuclear programme has aroused in the international community due to suspicions that it has a military dimension, which have been accentuated since the publication of the IAEA’s latest report on 18 November 2011. The conclusions of the Foreign Affairs Council also express concerns about the Iranian nuclear programme, illustrating the restrictive measures adopted and repeating the objective of finding a diplomatic solution to the problem and the request made to Iran to agree to the latest offer of discussions contained in the letter sent to the Iranian authorities by Baroness Ashton on 21 October last.

The Iranian authorities’ failure to cooperate with the competent authorities, specifically the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), over the course of the implementation of their nuclear programme has impeded the development of profitable relations between Iran and the international community. These differences, and the suspicion that the nuclear programme has military rather than peaceful aims, led the UN Security Council to adopt resolutions in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2010. The recent phased sanctions on Iran imposed by the EU are in line with the latest IAEA rapporteur, of November 2011, who accuses Iran of developing nuclear technology for military ends. I completely support the imposition of new sanctions on the embargo on oil and associated products, but phasing the sanctions themselves demonstrates a lack of clarity and political will, since the full measure will only come into force in July, following reassessment in May. Iran’s threats, in particular, its threat to close the Strait of Hormuz, are clear indications that there is an urgent need to return to diplomatic negotiations, since stability in the region is essential to maintaining world peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Iran’s attitude is an affront and an act of defiance against our model of society, our values and our security.

Nevertheless, while it is important to keep up the pressure on this despotic regime, we must continue the political dialogue; otherwise, we could face an escalation whose outcome is in no way certain. I share the worries of western leaders who are concerned about Iran’s influence in the region and its support for authoritarian and despotic regimes. I welcome the sanctions that the EU has decided to impose, and firmly hope that we can enter into honest negotiations and reach a rapid resolution of this crisis in the making. War is never the solution, and an armed intervention would have disastrous consequences. Lastly, I would like to spare a thought for the Iranian people, held hostage by dogmatic, bloodthirsty leaders who govern them by repression, intimidation and deprivation.

It is a decision that has contributed dangerously to escalating a conflict that, as is clear, has nothing to do with seeking peaceful solutions and diplomatic negotiations. In the current context, a potential military conflict would not just represent an attack on the Iranian people’s sovereignty and right to live in peace, but it would have extremely negative economic consequences for several countries. It is also important not to forget that these unilateral sanctions are being imposed hypocritically by nuclear powers like the US, France and the UK, and that the European Union has continued its close economic and military cooperation with Israel, one of the countries that acts completely outside the most basic principles of international law. The resolution in question unequivocally supports sanctions on oil exports, which will clearly hit the Iranian economy and, thus, the entire Iranian people.

Moreover, in line with the concerns expressed by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I, too, believe disabled people should be given better access to sport, and protection for minors in competitive sport should be increased. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, the report stresses the fact that sport can contribute to the strategic objectives of the European Union, given its educational and cultural value. However, in the future, the European Union has to create a future specific programme on sport with a view to defining and supporting a real European dimension in sport.

There can be no doubt about that when you consider that public sporting events involve 35 million amateur sportspeople. However, sport also plays an important role in the European economy. As an industry, it provides work for around 15 million people and has an added value of around 3.65% of the EU’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Therefore, I believe it is necessary to promote sport in a European dimension, taking into account the benefits to people’s health as well as on a social, cultural and economic level. Sport needs to be promoted to make it an activity accessible to all, and to develop its role in promoting peace, economic development, intercultural dialogue, integration and women’s emancipation. Sport is also an effective way of reinforcing Europe’s identity and, at a time such as this, it would be a good idea to dedicate a specific funding programme to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is certainly high time we had a dedicated budget for sport. Although the sums involved are low compared with the amount of money that changes hands in the world of sport (EUR 30 million per year between 2014 and 2020), I welcome this step forward. The European Commission has taken note of the new provisions contained in the Treaty of Lisbon. The Fisas report highlights the fact that sport is a multi-faceted area that has a strong economic dimension and also plays a vital role in society. If we consider the need to value the role of volunteers, to prepare athletes through training for life after their professional sports careers, to combat illegal sports betting, to coordinate the fight against doping, or to regulate the profession of sports agent, there are certainly enough areas for action. These include areas on which I tabled amendments that were included in the final report, such as the protection of minors during international transfers and the need for cooperation between the EU and the Council of Europe, which is very active in the area of sports.

Through sport, it is also possible to promote the social inclusion of disadvantaged categories such as people with disabilities, and to foster the human and social growth of young people. They are increasingly disorientated in a modern world devoid of reference points, in terms of values and humanity. Finally, the reference to the need to properly safeguard traditional, local sports seems to me particularly welcome.

Statistics indicate that the increase in sporting activity has created around 15 million jobs in the EU. The sport sector employs 5.4% of the working population, and it has an annual turnover of approximately EUR 407 billion, or 3.65% of Europe’s GDP. Sport plays an important role in society and helps to strengthen social well-being because it boosts employment and integration and contributes to society and social development. The European Union was recently given new competence for sport and it is urged to contribute to promoting sport. In response to the Commission’s communication ‘Developing the European Dimension in Sport’, the European Parliament proposes that at EU level, the focus should be on issues of international importance such as doping, trafficking, athlete mobility, racism and violence in sport. Parliament also proposes examining and addressing the issues of money laundering, match fixing, human trafficking and the exploitation of minors. There is also a proposal to create a European register of people who have displayed violent behaviour during games in the past. The discussion of such problems at EU level could make a significant contribution to their resolution and this would give the European dimension in sport real added value. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, this does not mean that a specific article has been created for it, but a legal basis is provided for sport in the section of the Treaties on education, vocational training and young people. Indeed, Article 165 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union stipulates that the EU’s objective is to promote the European dimension in sport. Sport itself constitutes an important social activity and a public good. For many, it is one of the most important forms of recreation, whether they take part or are only spectators. One of the biggest benefits of sport is that it brings people together, no matter what their origin, background, religious beliefs or economic status. Sport promotes the active contribution made by European citizens to society and helps foster a sense of social inclusion. Doping remains a major threat to sport. The prevention of doping in sport must be based on a clear understanding of the complex nature of this problem, as well as on extensively combining the strategies of all the authorities involved in sport, with the aim of successfully eradicating doping in sport, which is acknowledged as being a serious problem that is detrimental to the fundamental principles of sport.

I welcome the reference to respect for the fundamental rights of athletes during checks conducted as part of anti-doping procedures. It is vital to ensure respect for these rights, specifically by identifying a Europe-wide procedure to protect athletes and not to leave room at the edges for arbitrary action, which could have extremely damaging effects on the athletes’ careers. The use of biological passports as tools for investigation, rather than prevention, has given rise to highly discriminatory episodes, and led to the end of the careers of some athletes where the burden of proof has been reversed, even without clear evidence of doping. In such a situation, reversing the burden of proof that applies to an accused person runs counter to the fundamental principles of human rights and, in particular, Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). I should therefore like to thank Mr Fisas Ayxela for his efforts to guarantee and protect not only the interests of sports federations and associations, but also the freedoms and fundamental rights of athletes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sport represents a link between EU citizens, as anyone is free to practice it regardless of gender, ethnic origin, religion, age, nationality or social situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic added value of sport in the EU is extraordinary: it provides 15 million jobs (representing 5.4% of the active population) and accounts for 3.65% of European GDP. Furthermore, sport has a positive influence on Member State health care budgets as it favourably affects the health of European citizens. We must not forget about the potential role of sport in invigorating tourism either.</p>
<p class="contents">In light of the aforesaid, I agree with the rapporteur that the economic and social role of sport must be further reinforced. It would represent a significant step in this direction if sport could become a beneficiary of the European Structural Funds. Special training courses for outstanding sportspeople who wish to pursue studies in higher education are indispensable. The fight against doping must continue unabated. Sport must be supported in education because (in addition to its numerous other positive effects) it facilitates the dismantling of social barriers and the integration of marginalised groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Sport is an effective tool in strengthening European identity. To this end, I support the rapporteur’s proposal for the organisation of an annual ‘European Day of Sports’, the annual designation of a ‘European capital of sport’ and the creation of mobility programmes for young sportspeople where they can learn new training techniques while promoting dialogue among cultures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sport is unquestionably important for European society, contributing to the maintenance of health, encouraging a positive form of competitiveness between young people, helping to maintain physical activity among the elderly and contributing to social integration. As a branch of the economy, sport contributes to economic growth and supports job creation. Sport also has many negative attributes, of course, such as doping or the violence and indiscipline of fans, which sometimes ends in brutal fights in stadiums or on the streets. In the matter of stadium violence, however, the report by Santiago Fisas Ayxela does not offer any incentive for improvement or suggestion for change. I would therefore like to call on the Commission, the Council and the rapporteur to pay greater attention to this sensitive and complex topic. Some Member States have been more successful than others in dealing with stadium violence. Why not, therefore, make use of the potential that already exists? We must work together to find possible solutions. The report submitted to the plenary is generally balanced and beneficial, and, despite the aforementioned reservation, I will therefore vote for its adoption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is through action which is better coordinated and more efficient that we will avoid the occurrence in Europe of tragic violent incidents such as yesterday’s episode in Egypt, where approximately 74 people died in the rioting that followed a football match. I agree that it is also vital to adopt a more active integrated approach in the fight against doping. As well as running counter to the principles of honesty and fairness in competitive sport, doping represents a serious threat to the health of both professional and amateur athletes.

Those about the alleged discrimination that women systematically face in sport. True, you do not get any women in male football teams, it is a scandal! Those about using sport as a tool to promote the European Union. Those, which are somewhat confusing, calling for total freedom of movement and establishment for athletes on the one hand, while recognising as legitimate demands made regarding the national or local composition of teams. It is true that this makes competitions a little more interesting. Those which advocate health insurance with a bonus/penalty system depending on whether or not you play sport. Now there is an idea – getting the layabouts to pay! Yet not a single word about some athletes’ salaries, astronomically high amounts which bear no relation to the social value of those being paid them, and the impact of these outrageous practices on the image of sport. There are, however, a few good ideas, but to be frank, I cannot bring myself to vote for such nonsense. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU and Member States should secure dynamic, good healthy living for European consumers and citizens by improving the social role of sports and actively involving all members of society in health-enhancing sport and recreational activities across Europe, particularly in the case of children, considering that obesity and other health-related illnesses are on the rise in younger age groups. Therefore, the Commission should allocate more health-related incentives and funds for projects, in particular, those involving cross-border sport activities. European citizens and, in particular, young people should be given more information related to the availability of sport programmes, projects, scholarships and training, which will help people make full use of the opportunities offered by Community programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While I welcome the report’s commitment to reminding us of the key values that playing sport can convey and suggesting the type of actions that should reflect the Community added value in this field, I wonder about the EU’s current ability to effectively assume this responsibility. With only EUR 4 million specifically dedicated to sport each year (in the form of a ‘preparatory action’, in other words, a temporary action), the Union does not have the resources to effectively combat doping, to support sport for people with disabilities, to promote the development of a ‘European identity’ through sport, etc., an issue that must be addressed in the months ahead, when Member States are being asked to establish the EU budgetary framework for 2014-2020. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also enthusiastically welcomed the inclusion of specific proposals in this resolution such as organising an annual ‘European Day of Sports’, the designation of a ‘European capital of sport’ every year, facilitating and promoting mobility programmes for young athletes and sports coaches, and the suggestion to fly the European flag at major international sports events.

I would like to point out one aspect of sport, however, that I find particularly important nowadays: its integrating and educational role in regard to young people. Sport promotes integration and social inclusion; it teaches children how to work as part of a team and fosters tolerance and respect for others. In addition to sport’s contribution to public health, its educational and social functions make it an attractive means of influencing people’s behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the opinion that sport has the potential to help groups of young people who are vulnerable and at risk to get back on track, and this potential should be developed and supported. On the other hand, it is undeniable that we often witness violence and displays of aggression from supporters of different teams at sports events, especially in football. I support the need for strict and coordinated measures against such misbehaviour as it may not only have direct adverse consequences, but could also have indirect ones, such as negatively influencing the behavioural development of children and young people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Sport is going through a crisis period, particularly as a result of the criminal activities connected with it. It is to be hoped that the European institutions can exercise greater control over the world of sport, given the abuses being seen. In order to tackle such abuse, regulation would, most probably, enable the standard of sports governance to be improved. Therefore, taking action to regulate the activities of sports agents and player transfers, as well as fighting fraud and doping, are all measures that should produce a useful result in these terms. Finally, establishing a ‘European Day of Sports’ and designating an annual ‘European Capital of Sport’ are, in my view, excellent tools for bringing citizens closer to sport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sport is very important from the point of view of maintaining and promoting health, since the absence of physical activity has a detrimental effect on the health of Europe’s citizens. Sport also has an extremely strong economic impact, providing work, directly or indirectly, for 15 million Europeans (5.4% of the working population) and added value of roughly EUR 407 billion. As a member of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I consider it important that studies be organised at the European level on the distinctive features of women’s sport, the reasons why women and girls stop doing sports and the continued inequality with regard to sporting opportunities for women. The popularisation of women’s sport should be improved, because it is clearly overshadowed by men’s sport, and, as a result, many young girls unfortunately do not consider sport to be sufficiently important. Popular sport is the best way to prevent a number of diseases, and underestimating the role of sport in the advancement of society is a mistake we will later seriously regret. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given the benefits provided by sport, both the EU as a whole and each individual Member State must encourage citizens to become involved in sport and promote a healthy lifestyle. There should be a special focus on people with disabilities and their integration into sporting activities. I welcome the proposal that the profession of sports agents should be a regulated professional activity and that a European register of sports agents should be created which would help to protect athletes from the risk of conflicts of interest.

Sport itself constitutes an important social activity and a public good. For many, it is one of the most important forms of recreation, whether they take part or are only spectators. One of the biggest benefits of sport is that it brings people together, no matter what their origin, background, religious beliefs, gender or economic status. Doping, spectator violence and disorder remain, unfortunately, a Europe-wide problem, and there is a need for a European approach comprising measures designed to reduce the associated risks. Sport promotes the active contribution of European citizens to society and helps foster a sense of social inclusion, as it is an important and thriving economic sector which makes a significant contribution to growth and employment, exceeding the average growth rates for value added and employment. However, the sustainable funding of sport is an issue which needs to be examined in closer detail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe the reference to doping in the report is positive. Doping is an attack on the values of sport and puts sportspeople’s lives at risk. It is a problem that I have reported on many occasions. In this plenary, I have already argued that the way to fight against doping is to work not just for fair competition, but also for the health of the citizens. I take this opportunity to reaffirm the fact that scientific investigations into doping need a European dimension. A combined effort is needed to more effectively identify and combat the increasingly more dangerous substances and processes that are used in doping. It is notable that there is a request within this report for the accession of the EU to the Anti-Doping Convention of the Council of Europe and I would to like to reiterate the importance of European legislation against this dangerous activity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has led to a revolution in sport, because for the first time, it has created a legal basis specifically for this sector, Article 165. Therefore, we now need more coordinated action at European level to fight doping, violence in stadiums, match fixing and shady deals by sports agents. Through the creation of a ‘European blacklist’, Parliament is asking that fans who are known to be violent or who engage in discriminatory behaviour be banned from all European stadiums. In addition, to fight match fixing and money laundering, Parliament is asking that any fraudulent activity be treated as a criminal offence and that a licensing system be put in place for betting operators. Finally, the profession of sports agent should also be regulated, in the view of the European Parliament. In fact, in order to obtain a licence, agents will have to prove that they have certain minimum qualifications for the profession, that their fiscal residence is within the EU, and they will have to undertake to abide by a code of conduct. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the fact that it highlights the important role of sport in promoting intercultural dialogue, public health, the integration of socially vulnerable people, the fight against discrimination, and even the emancipation of women. Another positive point is that the text recognises the importance of volunteers in sport – some 35 million in Europe – and stresses the need to provide them with proper training. Naturally, the fight against doping is a key point in the text: we call, in particular, for prevention and information campaigns to be put in place and urge the Member States to treat trafficking in illegal performance-enhancing substances in the same way as trafficking in illegal drugs. The paragraph suggesting that the European flag be flown at major international sporting events held in the European Union has proved controversial. Considering that this would help strengthen European citizens’ sense of belonging to the same group, despite the European project currently going through some dark times, I supported it being kept in the text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sport plays an important part in the European economy as it directly or indirectly employs around 15 million people (5.4% of the working population) and accounts for 3.65% of EU GDP every year.

We can learn a lot from sport: the EuroBasket tournament recently held in Lithuania demonstrated the enthusiasm, goal striving and unity that is unfortunately lacking in Lithuanian politics and public life. Sport is poorly funded in Lithuania. This is understandable given the economic crisis affecting my country. However, we cannot simply blame the economic crisis for the poor funding of sport. Another problem is the weak administration of Lithuania’s sports system. Last year, LTL 39 million (a little more than EUR 11 million) was allocated to sport in Lithuania. By contrast, Latvia’s sports budget is almost double that amount. There is a need for greater transparency and better administration. Part of the problem is caused by the distribution of funds – while some larger Lithuanian sports federations receive the biggest proportion of funding, several dozen federations are left without a penny. The issue of the sustainable funding of Lithuanian sport should be examined more closely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Most of the work done in sport is carried out on a voluntary basis. This is something that cannot be emphasised often enough. For this reason, it is important to me that we should support the great efforts being made by people at grassroots level, while it is a key task for the future to anchor support for sport as securely as possible in all relevant funding programmes. Unfortunately, there is as yet no reference to sport in the draft regulations for cohesion policy, even though other areas are mentioned where sport can make an important contribution. I would call for sport to be expressly mentioned. This would give the Member States a good basis for their operational programmes. The proposal for a sports programme within the ‘Erasmus for All’ programme is also a good idea. I particularly welcome the idea that we should foster sport at grassroots level and as a voluntary activity, rather than promoting top-level sport. This offers an opportunity to combat potential social problems, such as racism, social exclusion, drug dependency or crime, while also promoting the enjoyment to be had in pushing oneself to one’s physical and mental limits in a team. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I replied that while it may be voluntary, there should be no such reference to the EU flag in sport, be it voluntary or otherwise. I find it increasingly difficult to persuade my constituents of the benefits of a single market when the EU time and time again takes every opportunity to both depart from the original objectives of a community of trading nations and also to impose a federal EU identity on its unwitting and unwilling citizens. Natasha Kuchinskaya, one of the first Soviet gymnasts to take part in the Olympics, described the USSR’s attitude to sport as follows: ‘Sport was considered the prestige of the government. If sport was strong, government was strong’. I am all for a strong trading bloc which creates growth and jobs, but we must resist the EU becoming a manipulative, propagandist superstate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This last issue is particularly important for reports whose purpose is ‘developing the European dimension in sport’, since this cannot replace each country’s cultural and sporting individuality. This report includes positive measures, although mainly in terms of intentions, that emphasise mass-participation sport and involvement in sport, without forgetting gender issues; in particular, it proposes ‘a dedicated and ambitious budget for sports policy’ under the new multiannual financial framework. However, we are bound to mention our concern about, and disagreement with, the proposals that amateur sport be financed essentially through contributions from lotteries, that a European-level ‘supporters’ database be created and that any form of political expression by athletes be banned during matches. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was only to be expected. They have every right to expect public authorities to provide public services that take their health and their environment into consideration. The apparent inability of certain Member States to manage their waste and, in particular, toxic waste, has led to a significant increase in the number of petitions on this matter. Waste management is a major political and social problem. With a systematic over-reliance on landfill, monitoring and control alone are not enough to prevent household waste being contaminated by toxic waste. We need to develop these policies as early in the chain as possible by making improvements to sorting, collection and recycling and encouraging waste recovery, and also by providing an effective tracking system for toxic waste. Landfills should be the last resort. The Iturgaiz report shows us that considerable efforts are still required and reminds us that it is crucial to encourage early dialogue between the authorities and citizens. Awareness among citizens is real; it is up to the public authorities to respond by dramatically improving waste management. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Through the petitions process, citizens are expressing the feeling that the public authorities are not in control of the situation and are sometimes not prepared to make the effort required to find solutions. The relationship of trust is damaged and there is a downhill slide towards open confrontation and paralysis, thereby preventing action. Furthermore, the majority of EU citizens expect public authorities to provide efficient and effective public services in the areas of health, education, transport and security. Thus, one issue that provokes a growing number of petitions is the apparent inability of public authorities in many Member States to deal satisfactorily with the problem of waste management. The European Parliament calls on the Member States to transpose the Waste Framework Directive into their national law without further delay and to ensure full compliance with all its requirements, above all, the requirement to establish and implement comprehensive waste management plans, as well as the timely conversion of all the set goals within the framework of European legislation. The Commission should also carefully monitor the transposition by the Member States of the EU directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law, to ensure that it is done promptly and effectively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In some Member States, recycling and recovery are the main waste management options deployed, with a reduction in the use of landfill sites to a negligible level, whereas other Member States still use landfills for most of their waste. This also presents an economic opportunity. Indeed, in 2008, this sector recorded a turnover of EUR 145 billion, which accounted for roughly 1% of EU GDP and provided 2 million jobs. Compliance with EU policy would help create a sector providing 2.4 million jobs and a total annual turnover of EUR 187 billion.

The inability of many local authorities to manage waste disposal in the majority of Member States is certainly worrying. Furthermore, the fears of many communities for human health and the well-being of the land emphasise that waste management is becoming a real socio-political issue. An analysis of the current policies shows that only a few Member States are up to speed on the matter and even manage to generate profit by using advanced waste transformation systems. Instead, in the majority of the EU, we can see a worrying delay in implementing strategies for dealing with waste and an excessive dependence on landfills. Accordingly, we urgently need to put in place a coherent policy and work with greater determination to properly apply current legislation by setting out sustainable waste disposal plans. We need to do more, then, to respect the law and improve the waste management process in order to ensure more effective environmental protection and a more sustainable future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the basis of 114 petitions which, fundamentally, indicate failings in waste management and the frequent inability of Member States to meet their legal obligations, this report recommends that the Member States should improve the application of waste management policy in the future, that they should speed up transposition of the Waste Framework Directive into national law, and that national authorities should apply necessary and suitable measures for combating the illegal dumping of waste.

The rapporteur makes a series of observations that we consider positive, relating, in general, to waste management, to environmental protection and to raising public awareness. However, some aspects of the report are less positive and are bound to elicit comment. The report makes it clear that waste management is a public responsibility, but one that is frequently ensured by private entities. It does not hide that there are two multinationals controlling this business in two or three Member States, making money by the bucket load. Unfortunately, this model is not clearly rejected in the report, as was necessary. Moreover, the report mentions the 2007 directive. However, this directive has a problem: a failure to distinguish between toxic and normal waste has led, in some cases, to situations in which large companies produce toxic waste in ways that are incompatible with the primacy of public health and environmental protection interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union has adopted many laws applicable in all Member States in order to ensure the existence of a legal framework for dealing with the inevitable consequence of our modern lifestyle, that is, items discarded as waste from households, work, hospitals, industry and so on. Inadequate management and an inability to prioritise efforts in this respect not only have negative consequences for human health and well-being, but also have a negative effect on the environment in the broadest sense of the word.</p>
<p class="contents">Analysis of the waste management policies implemented in the EU Member States provides very different information. A number of Member States are very advanced, and no petitions were received from their citizens in which problems relating to waste management were indicated. Many other EU countries, however, lag far behind in the implementation of waste strategies. I believe that, in order to improve the effective management of waste, it will be necessary in the future to help improve the implementation of policies in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There has been a large number of petitions relating to waste management facilities. It therefore makes sense to summarise the main problems in a report in order then to be able to tackle them in a practical way. These main problems include a lack of environmental impact assessments and existing shortcomings in the waste management systems. I welcome the fact that the Member States are expressly called on to speed up their implementation of Directive 2008/98/EC on waste. The Waste Framework Directive contains important regulations which provide for the protection of the environment as well as human health.</p>
<p class="contents">Shortcomings in the waste management systems cause environmental damage, such as the pollution of groundwater. This pollution does not stop at borders, but has a cross-border effect. For this reason, the Member States must do everything they can to implement the existing directives for the sake of the health of their own populations and to protect neighbouring regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, one issue that provokes a growing number of petitions is the apparent inability of public authorities in many countries to deal satisfactorily with the problem of waste management. Member States must ensure that a full and mandatory environmental impact assessment is conducted before any decision is taken to establish or construct a new waste facility, notably, an incinerator or methanisation plant, or, in the worst case scenario, a new landfill. The Commission is encouraged to propose clearer and more specific criteria for the location of landfills in relation to local housing, schools or health facilities in order to ensure more robust guarantees against potential risks to human health and the environment, bearing in mind that there are a large number of variables and local considerations that need to be taken into account. I believe that meeting legally established recycling and prevention targets requires the active participation of civil society, improved stakeholder participation and increased public awareness.

Waste is dangerous both to human and animal health, as well as to our planet’s ecosystem. It is also an equally important issue for rural areas, which generate many types of waste, and where sometimes electrical or particularly hazardous asbestos waste, for example, is dumped next to municipal, biodegradable waste. These areas require proper systems for the regular collection of this waste, and such systems should be accompanied by practical information campaigns.</p>
<p class="contents">As we read in the report, the advances made in waste management policies differ quite significantly between individual Member States.

It is almost a given that a majority of the petitions received from Italy relate to waste management in Naples and Campania. This incredible situation has been going on for many years and for various different reasons, including appalling political and administrative management and the widespread infiltration of the Camorra.

Firstly, the Commission and the Member States must devote more attention to raising public awareness of the need for and benefits of waste management. Some Member States are lagging behind when it comes to waste sorting, above all because the public are not convinced of its benefits. Secondly, the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process has a significant effect on transparent waste management. When designing and building waste management facilities (above all, incinerators and landfills), a lack of transparency and public ignorance during the EIA leads to waste crises or even disasters (as demonstrated by real examples in Italy, Spain and other countries). During the next review of the EIA Directive, we must therefore really ensure that the public is adequately and genuinely involved in consultations, that public opinion is taken into account, and that the process itself is transparent and independent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The 177 infringement procedures opened by the EU reveal that there are thought to be 619 illegal landfills across the European Union. Our citizens are asking for clarity and procedural transparency, and the number of petitions that Parliament receives on waste and landfills speaks volumes: between 2004 and 2010, 114 petitions alleging breaches have been declared admissible. Forty per cent of these concern the authorisation procedure for new plants and another 40% relate to the operation of existing ones, not to mention landfills and incinerators. Figures from Eurostat show that EU citizens produce, on average, 513 kg of waste per year. The questions raised by citizens during the public consultation process and the Environmental Impact Assessment on planned locations for new landfills often concern alleged violations of protected areas, as in the case of the landfill in the Vesuvius national park, or fears over a negative impact on health and well-being. Europe should provide incentives for citizens who are inclined to pre-sort their waste, thereby allowing taxes to be lowered and reducing the impact of waste processing on the land and on citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we continue along this path, the rising disposal costs will soon mean that we will be drowning in our own waste. Alternatively, we could follow the US model and simply ship our waste electrical and electronic equipment to the developing world as ‘development aid’. In addition, many materials can only be recycled to a limited extent because they can only undergo the recycling process a limited number of times. In other cases, only a small proportion can be recycled. It is of central importance that we should take control of downcycling, the practice of transporting or illegally storing waste throughout Europe. What might be helpful, therefore, is the combination of an increase in recycling rates together with strict controls on exports of electronic waste and a shifting of the cost burden on to those who cause the waste. Even more important are preventive measures to avoid waste, something that is not given enough consideration in the report. Ordering everyone to use energy-saving bulbs has actually generated more waste, not less. In addition, the amount of hazardous waste produced by nuclear power stations should not be underestimated, while the final resting place of this waste is still undecided.

Furthermore, Member States must carry out inspections, monitoring and other necessary actions at all stages of the waste management chain. I believe that we must establish common EU standards for colour-coding categories of waste, which would be used for sorting and recycling. It is also very important to ensure that mandatory environmental impact assessments are conducted before any decision is taken to establish or construct a new waste facility, particularly a landfill. Furthermore, local authorities should engage in a constructive dialogue with local communities in order to reduce their resistance. Local populations must have a guarantee that permitting and operating authorities are respecting the rules correctly and transparently.

Unfortunately, in many places, the business of waste management is in the hands of organised crime.

However, waste in general should not be confused with urban waste. In overall terms, Europe’s waste is accounted for as follows: 29% from mining activities, 26% from manufacturing, 22% from construction and demolition, and 14% from urban waste. Europe therefore produces 198 million tonnes of urban waste. Since the population of the EU is 375 million, each European citizen produces 527 kg of waste each year. Despite the efforts made on recovery and recycling, landfills are still the most common solution, accounting for 54% of rubbish. The recycling and composting chain accounts for 27% of urban waste. The remaining 19% of waste is incinerated, with or without energy recovery. The problem of waste disposal is only one aspect of the issue. I feel I must emphasise that the quantity of waste that we produce is the result of our unsustainable lifestyle. Our current systems of production and consumption must be altered in order to minimise pressure on the Earth’s non-renewable resources. Essentially, the production of waste is one of the best indicators of our progress towards sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The large number of petitions received on this issue highlights the concerns of citizens on the matter, concerns that I have shared for many years now. The European legislative framework is relevant, but nonetheless leaves out a number of major issues, such as innovative methods for the recovery, reuse, recycling and disposal of waste. This is, in my view, a key issue, both for its impact on the human health and well-being of Europeans, but also for the environment and sustainable development. I had questioned the Commission on what it was doing to reduce and recycle packaging waste associated with consumer products and on the need to eliminate food waste, which is a significant source of waste and an imperative of solidarity with the poorest citizens. I therefore call again on the Commission to make strong proposals for sustainable waste management throughout the supply chain.

However, we would stress the mistaken perspective of almost exclusively making individuals responsible for the environmental situation we are experiencing, which is a panacea that will not resolve this systemic problem on its own, the argument being that waste management is a public responsibility for private profits; it is certainly interesting that it praises two multinationals responsible for such management in two or three Member States, without relating their extraordinary profits, or the increase in complaints throughout Europe. There is still no distinction between toxic and normal waste, which means there are no restrictions in place to control the pollution rates of large companies, on the basis of studies that consider the average waste produced per ‘individual’, putting families and businesses into the same category. Waste management is fundamental to protecting the environment and human health. However, we are not forgetting that serious environmental problems do not result from isolated acts, but rather result from the capitalist system, which does not consider the means it uses to seek maximum profit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ninety-eight per cent of European citizens are aware that this problem exists, while more than two thirds of European citizens (68%) think that the European Union must take a more active involvement in preventing and tackling violence against these vulnerable groups. In addition, the spread of new forms of violence against vulnerable groups due to the expansion of access to new communications technologies demands a robust response from the European Union.

It is the only European programme which, for nearly 15 years, has aimed to combat violence towards women, children and young people. This programme covers over 500 projects, and greater cooperation from NGOs in a variety of fields, such as sexual, psychological and physical violence in institutional, school or family settings. It also includes projects dealing with the prevention of child pornography and the risks children face in surfing the Internet as well as the health needs of women who are victims of trafficking and female genital mutilation. I therefore naturally agreed with the motion for a European Parliament resolution calling on the Commission to continue funding such projects. I particularly welcome this report because the programme for the 2014-2020 period aims, among other things, to reiterate the need for legislative measures at European level to eradicate gender-based violence. My struggle for women is therefore carried out at both national and European level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the calls for the Member States to gather data on violence against women at regular intervals in order to clarify the extent of the problem in the EU, and for the Commission to channel more funding into projects aimed at alerting the public, particularly groups at risk, to new forms of violence linked to the growing use of online social networks (threats, psychological pressures, bullying, Internet child pornography).

The Daphne programme has been a genuine success since its launch in 1997, both in terms of its popularity with stakeholders (beneficiaries, public and academic authorities, NGOs) and in terms of the effectiveness of the projects funded by the programme. It is therefore vital to ensure continued funding for the Daphne programme in order to maintain the measures currently in force and introduce new measures that will be effective in combating all types of violence against children, young people and women. Daphne is an extremely important instrument for raising the visibility of the issue of violence against women and providing the possibility for women’s organisations and other engaged stakeholders to develop their work and their concrete actions in this field. The Daphne programme will, from 2014, be incorporated into the rights and citizenship programme, but it is essential to ensure that the programme’s objectives, in particular, that of combating violence against women, are retained in the 2014-2020 period among the objectives of the new rights and citizenship programme. Furthermore, bearing in mind the success, effectiveness and popularity of the Daphne programme, we must ensure that significant funding continues for the new-generation programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since 2007, the Daphne programme has formed part of the more general ‘Fundamental Rights and Justice programme’ and is the only programme in Europe to combat violence against the most vulnerable people in society. In fact, the objective of Daphne is to contribute to the protection of children, young people and women against all forms of violence and to attain a high level of health protection, well-being and social cohesion. NGOs showed a great deal of interest and involvement in the programme and submitted a far higher number of proposals than could be funded. However, the interim report of the Daphne programme 2011-2013 necessitates a few essential amendments to ensure correct application until its expiry. Greater participation from the States that joined up from 2004 and more effective dissemination of the projects’ results could also be helpful. Lastly, we need to refocus the programmes on the EU’s policy priorities by funding, for example, fewer projects but selecting ones on a larger scale. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I consider it important to pay particular attention to projects aimed at eradicating ´honour´ crimes and female genital mutilation.

However, most times, the victims of physical or verbal aggression are not bold enough to confirm this openly, which makes it difficult to compile relevant statistics.

Since there is a proposal that actions funded by this programme be included in the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework as part of the future rights and citizenship programme, the report urges that the latter should include the objective of ‘combating violence against women’ and retain the same level of funding that the Daphne programme has had to date. We are bound to point out the risk that, under the new conditions just proposed, this objective is not diluted and ‘lost’ in the midst of so many others. We therefore believe that specific funding should be in place for the Daphne programme and that this funding should be greater than for the previous programmes, in view of existing needs. Given the importance that small women’s organisations, trades unions and various other NGOs have in defending and promoting women’s rights and combating the violence affecting them, we think the report needed to set out clear measures enabling these organisations to access the programme’s funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since it was established, the programme has thrown light on new forms of violence. Parliament has pointed out in numerous resolutions that the Daphne programme has been underfunded so far, and has stated its intention of ensuring that it has sufficient funding so that it can tackle the real problems.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2000, the Daphne initiative was transformed into a multiannual programme covering the period 2000-2003 and allocated funding of EUR 20 million. The programme aroused a great deal of interest, both in the European Union and in various international bodies working to stop the commercial sexual exploitation of children.</p>
<p class="contents">The Daphne II and Daphne III programmes were launched in 2004 and 2007 respectively, with an average annual budget of EUR 10 million for Daphne II and EUR 16.7 million for Daphne III, which formed part of the general programme ‘Fundamental Rights and Justice’. I believe that the objectives of the programme, that is to say, to prevent and combat all forms of violence against women, children and young people and to create a coordinated, coherent and effective EU policy, are still relevant to the current needs of the target groups. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Similarly, 26% of children and young people report physical violence. Given the extent of this violence, the European Daphne programme was set up in 1997 to protect these women, these young people and these children and since then, it has been a genuine success. The resolution that we adopted, and which I, of course, supported, welcomes the actions carried out within this programme and calls for their renewal for the 2014-2020 period. More specifically, I would like to highlight certain aspects: our resolution firstly calls for more funding to be channelled into projects aimed at alerting the young to new forms of violence (social networks, Internet child pornography, etc.). Our resolution goes on to encourage NGOs to take part and get involved, given their crucial role in supporting victims. Finally, it is important that this instrument should retain its name and its independence to maintain the visibility of the programme, and it also needs a budget which is at least on a par with that of the previous programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In 2000, the Daphne initiative was transformed into a multiannual programme covering the period 2000-2003, and allocated funding of EUR 20 million. The programme evoked a great deal of interest, both in the European Union and in various international bodies working to stop the commercial sexual exploitation of children. The Daphne II and Daphne III programmes were launched in 2004 and 2007 respectively, with an average annual budget of EUR 10 million for Daphne II and EUR 16.7 million for Daphne III. The general objective of Daphne III is to contribute to the protection of children, young people and women against all forms of violence and to attain a high level of health protection, well-being and social cohesion. This is done by promoting the further development of Union policies, particularly in the fields of public health, human rights and gender equality, and by encouraging actions to protect children’s rights and to fight trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation. With this type of initiative, the EU is putting itself at the forefront of combating violence against women, children and young people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it should not be possible for us to read studies that estimate that a fifth of the female population have been physically assaulted at least once in their adult life and that more than one tenth have suffered sexual violence. Furthermore, 26% of children and young people report physical violence in childhood. Daphne has certainly had a positive outcome: the Commission has funded 500 projects since 1997, which have managed to keep up with the times and with technological developments, for example, by funding initiatives against cyberbullying, while also focusing on lamentably long-term issues such as female genital mutilation and the prevention of sexual grooming. Accordingly, I hope that the new justice and rights and citizenship programmes that will encompass the Daphne programme will take account of the results obtained thus far and the sense of waging war on violence that this mythological name still evokes to this day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One important point mentioned in the report involves the shortcomings in the gathering of data regarding violence against women: insufficient and irregularly gathered statistics prevent the acquisition of a broad overview, and this, in turn, makes it impossible to develop better solutions in combating violence against women. I voted in favour of this report and I support the idea that the Daphne programme must continue in one form or another and that its targeted financing must not be reduced.

This is a project based on balancing cooperation between the public authorities and private organisations, with the former playing a coordinating role and the second operating on the ground. As such, the development of this programme should take these two dimensions into account. On the one hand, it needs to be guaranteed that all the Member States will encourage or contribute to the programme; on the other, use needs to be made of the results of these NGO projects on areas like female genital mutilation, bullying and online risks to children, which could be translated into a singular portrait of the communities in which these political decisions are being implemented.

That is why I voted for Ms Bastos’s draft report on the achievements and future prospects of the programme. Indeed, I support her wish to see it extended and also her wish for smaller NGOs to become more involved in the future. Their participation is essential because they have daily contact, they are close to people, and therefore they are the best placed to identify any less well-known difficulties or taboos. I also believe, and the text stresses this, that they have a considerable capacity for innovation which should not be overlooked. Finally, I welcome the desire for a better distribution of funded projects – the difficulties addressed by this programme unfortunately exist without distinction in all Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Violence against women is one of the main and most serious symptoms of discrimination, and the objective of the Daphne programme is precisely that of highlighting the issue of violence against women as well as combating it. It allows women’s organisations to carry out projects and undertake action in this field. Around 500 projects funded under the programme have made a large contribution to raising public awareness of the problem of violence. They have initiated national debate and social campaigns regarding this issue and they have contributed to individual countries undertaking legislative initiatives aimed at combating violence. For example, Belgium and Ireland have established national research centres to investigate violence against women.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, the Daphne programme has helped to raise awareness of important issues relating to violence, and has played a role in initiating a debate on ways of combating this problem. Considering the growing popularity of online social networks in recent times, and the resulting new forms of violence, funding for the Daphne programme should be increased. It is also important to extend the group of beneficiaries of the programme to include small non-profit women’s organisations that operate at local level, and are therefore closest to the victims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am therefore greatly concerned that the report highlights that certain Member States, including Lithuania, are very poorly represented in the Daphne programme. According to data provided by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Lithuania, 63% of Lithuanian women have experienced physical or sexual violence or a threat of such violence. The vast majority of these women stated that the experience gave them feelings of hatred and powerlessness. Of greatest concern is the fact that only 10.6% of all victims contacted the police about serious incidents. According to Lithuania’s Women’s Issues Information Centre, the police and the courts avoid domestic violence cases unless the victim has been badly beaten up or murdered. Police measures against the offender are often limited. The help given by the network of crisis centres to the victims of violence is not enough. In 2011, there were 15 crisis centres and six shelters for battered women in operation in Lithuania, but they do not cover the whole country and only two of them are funded by municipalities. This problem is too great for it to be left to NGOs. Politicians should take decisive action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Daphne funding programme has provided valuable financial assistance for a number of successful projects across Europe. It is essential that, as the only European programme dedicated specifically to this issue, funding continues to be provided to allow the programme to go from strength to strength. I believe that, if the programme is integrated into the rights and citizenship programme from 2014, as the European Commission proposes, the profile of the Daphne programme will be significantly reduced.

The proposal submitted by the Commission is likely to compromise seriously the objectives set out for it, especially in terms of access to funding for associations and particularly small associations. I also welcome the fact that it has highlighted the importance given by the programme to people facing poverty and social exclusion, particularly women and young Roma, who are particularly exposed to the risk of violence. The report also underlines the impact of sexual stereotypes in the area of gender equality and the consequent need for targeted actions to combat this by means of awareness raising, particularly amongst the young.

The ECR Group supports a strong position with regard to violence against women and we want to work collaboratively alongside national governments to make policies which will help eradicate violence against women.

However, in order to ensure that this objective is not diluted and ‘lost’ in the midst of so many others, we believe that specific funding should be in place for the Daphne programme, and that this funding should be greater than for the previous programmes.

This is a very defiant call. The aggression of imperialist armies is not a question of the gender composition of troops; it is an inherent characteristic of imperialism. Wars are born of the very capitalist system that is born and reproduces through war. The EU itself and the governments of the Member States are actively participating in the imperialist carve-up of the world in order to safeguard the profitability of the plutocracy which murders women, men and children in imperialist wars the world over, from Africa, Asia and the Middle East to the Balkans.

The clashes taking place over the last decade have affected and continue to affect predominantly children, women and the elderly. Hunger, epidemics and violence against civilians continue to produce more victims than actual military clashes. At the same time, it is worrying that acts of violence and abuse against these groups are still regarded in some regions as legitimate instruments of military confrontation. The overall picture is even more alarming if we take into account that only 10% of the personnel in peacekeeping missions are women. Supporting the gender dimension by making the EU’s financial and institutional support conditional upon including representatives from women’s organisations in the negotiating process, as well as including a more consistent representation of women in the negotiating team, may offer appropriate strategies for achieving the objectives of the EU Plan of Action on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment in Development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report robustly condemns these crimes and stresses the need for national authorities to bring an end to impunity for the perpetrators of these acts and to strengthen justice systems so that they can be sentenced. It also highlights the need to promote education for the emancipation of women, and for campaigns to raise awareness of respect for women’s dignity. It also underlines the importance of increasing the number of women in peace-negotiation processes, as well as in military peace-building operations, particularly in leadership roles.

Women and children are, without doubt, the most vulnerable people during and after wars, because they are often subject to sexual and other abuse, physical mistreatment and psychological violence. Even though the general approach is to be welcomed, since it calls for greater focus on the education and schooling of women in times of war and proposes greater commitment in the field of gynaecological and health care assistance for these vulnerable persons, the report proposes some specific measures with which I do not agree. For example, the creation of a Special EU Representative for Women, Peace and Security, with the ensuing bureaucratic and administrative apparatus, obviously carries an expense that does not seem justifiable, given the existence of an organisation within the UN that already works precisely in the field of sexual violence and armed conflicts. This is a duplication that offers no useful assurances and certainly will carry extra costs compared with today. Another problematic issue – again for budget reasons – is the proposal to open new budget items for Gender Advisors within the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP).

In addition, the power vacuum that emerges in post-conflict areas can lead to a deterioration of the rights of women and girls, as witnessed in Libya and Egypt. The effects of wartime sexual violence, both physical (risks such as sterility, sexually transmitted diseases, etc.) and psychological, are devastating for the victims, as the latter are often stigmatised, rejected, mistreated and considered to be dishonoured, and, in many cases, are excluded from their communities or sometimes even murdered. The families of the victims are also hit particularly hard, as sexual violence is considered a humiliation. Of great concern is the fact that in most cases, the perpetrators of sexual violence go unpunished, as demonstrated by the example of Colombia, where, in a situation of armed conflict, sexual violence against women is a systematic and concealed practice and the perpetrators enjoy almost total impunity. This form of violence should therefore be viewed as a war crime. A Special EU Representative on Women, Peace and Security should be created in order to improve this situation. The creation of such a post would make policies and actions in all areas more coherent and efficient, and the United Nations would have a liaison point that would facilitate seamless cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Involving women in the security sector and in the peace-building process is vital to ensure the success of these efforts, and excluding women from these processes makes it impossible to provide an appropriate response to the concerns of the entire population. With regard to peace negotiations, women account for less than 8% of participants and less than 3% have been signatories of the agreements concluded. EU support for peace processes must be made conditional upon the involvement of women in the international teams conducting peace negotiations. In modern armed conflicts, around 90% of victims are civilians, with women frequently being victims of rape, used as a weapon of war, and of sexual exploitation, used as an extreme means of survival. This is why I have called for special attention to be focused on pregnant women and mothers of young children with regard to the provision of food, clothing, health care services, transportation and evacuation, in order to avoid unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases, as priority areas under the Development Financing Instrument for the 2014-2020 period. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite all the international conventions on the subject, by bringing out the worst in human beings, wars demonstrate that the law is not sufficient to halt the destructive impetus and that, however much men seek to set limits on it, the hatred of the Other present in these situations ends up overcoming reason and mercy. The situation of women in armed conflict situations is particularly difficult. Psychological or physical violence – often of a sexual nature – and the multiple humiliations to which they are subjected are used as weapons for demoralising adversaries and destroying the social fabric of their homeland. This type of violence leaves deep and permanent scars, and the fact that it is so intimate instils in the communities that suffer it an inevitable desire for vengeance that is only appeased with great difficulty. The European Union should remain aware of this phenomenon, should continue robustly combating the repugnant and lamentable situations that strike defenceless women, and should seek means to help them and to raise awareness in societies of the need to change their attitude in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their weakness means women and children are amongst the main victims. Girls and women are often repeatedly raped in front of their impotent family members, which is hugely traumatic for husbands and sons, in addition to the physical and psychological consequences for the victims. It is, therefore, of the greatest urgency to adopt a code of conduct to be applied in war zones and refugee camps. Moreover, it is crucial that the perpetrators of such war crimes be arrested and brought to trial, so that they do not go unpunished. I am voting for this report, drafted by Ms Nicolai, which advocates protecting women from any form of violence, as well as their increased participation in military negotiation processes, which currently stands at less than 10%, since their presence is essential in dialogue with other women in conflict situations. The EU cannot lose this opportunity to put this problem on the foreign policy agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So be it. Only then is there the denunciation of the situation of women in times of war, and particularly the rapes to which they increasingly fall victim, rapes which have become, in certain parts of the world, fully-fledged weapons of war. The rapporteur asks for these rapes to be considered as war crimes and for there to be no impunity for those who commit them. She is quite right. However, I seem to remember that there is a ‘law of war’, which, shocking as that term may seem, has maintained that for a long time. The rapporteur also asks for the ‘adverse effects of armed conflict on family life’ to be limited. Frankly, I do not know what to make of a remark like that. Simple naivety? Good intentions?

Unfortunately, UN resolutions are not always respected by the combatants. When the life of a person, above all, of a woman or a child, is seen to be of little intrinsic value, there is a greater danger of them becoming the victims of (sexual) violence. It is only if the perpetrators are pursued and the risk of punishment is very high that potential aggressors will be deterred from attacks. It may make sense to deploy more women in establishing contact with local women. The proposal to give women a greater role in preventing conflict, acting as intermediaries in conflict and resolving conflict, is praiseworthy, but will only work if women enjoy a certain respect in society based on their role.

Violence against them has long-term consequences both for the victims themselves, their families, and for their communities and, ultimately, societies. In some countries around the world, sexual offences and other kinds of violence against women are justified, devised and encouraged as a tactic of war to demoralise the enemy. The definition of war crimes should therefore also be extended so that sexual crimes are considered to be the same as other war crimes and it is impossible to avoid responsibility for such crimes. At the same time, the positive role women play in conflict prevention and reconciliation is not sufficiently understood or exploited. I therefore voted in favour of this report, which draws attention to the multifaceted nature of the problem and sets out many proposals, the implementation of which would, I believe, enable greater progress to be made in protecting women and children from sexual violence during armed conflicts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To ensure that post-war society is not designed predominantly by men, for the benefit of men and with a solely male ethos, and to ensure that the nascent social order does not perpetuate gender stereotypes, women must increasingly be involved in the regulation of military situations as negotiators, peacekeepers, higher-level military officials and other opinion leaders. In addition to increasing the participation of women in international teams, I also support the measures listed in Norica Nicolai’s report on women’s situation in war to ensure the safety of women as defenceless parties in military situations. A third but no less important point I would like to emphasise is the importance of dealing with the cases of rape perpetrated during war or their prevention; this is not merely a question of physical violence, but also of the lifelong ruinous effect of rape on the female psyche and health and on family relations. The level of severity of rape perpetrated during war must also be emphasised in the subsequent prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators of such crimes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I voted for this report because women must have an increasingly active involvement in peacekeeping operations, both at the prevention stage and in conflict mediation, particularly through occupying leading positions both within national governments and at political level. At the same time, they must also be included in civilian operations as they are much better communicators than men on the ground. Women must also be involved in the peace-building phase because, as the pillars supporting their communities, they have a much better perception of the practical needs which the peace-building projects should address. Although there has been a rise in the number of women in representative institutions, women’s participation in peace negotiations remains low at below 10% of those formally involved. The report strongly condemns the use of sexual violence against women as a weapon of war. This is why one of the main calls made by the rapporteur is for the post of Special EU Representative on Women, Peace and Security to be created. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, true parity between men and women requires the institutional structures of various entities to be reorganised and it is crucial, from the gender equality point of view, to promote the inclusion of more women in prevention, mediation and resolution of conflicts, and to ensure their involvement in civilian operations. It should be noted that the EU already has a range of policies relating to women, to peace and to security, as well as gender taskforces and focal points relating to women and security. What it lacks, however, is a central unit able to coordinate all these disparate actions, so there is a need to move towards creating the role of Special EU Representative on Women, Peace and Security.

In the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire), rebel groups in the east regularly commit this type of abuse. Other practices follow, with equally dramatic physical and psychological consequences, such as sexual slavery and human trafficking.

<p class="contents">Firstly, in view of the mediatory skills of women, they should, amongst other things, be included in international teams leading peace negotiations and they should hold positions of leadership and positions related to management and training.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, during a war, women are at particular risk of all kinds of physical violence, particularly sexual violence. In relation to this, it is necessary to increase cooperation with and aid to national and local women’s organisations. These organisations are most aware of the degree of danger to women and can give earlier warning of such situations and take preventative action.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial that the perpetrators of violence against women bear responsibility for their deeds. The perpetrators must not be left with a feeling of impunity, and the victims must not be left with the belief that they are alone in their tragedy and that no one is really helping them.

Through this vote, EU support for peace processes must be made conditional on women’s participation in the international teams leading peace negotiations.

Sexual violence in the form of mass rape, human trafficking and other forms of sexual abuse committed against women and children is still used unacceptably as a war tactic in conflict regions around the world. The effects of violence, both physical and psychological, are devastating for the victims, as they are often stigmatised, rejected, mistreated and considered to be dishonoured and, in many cases, are excluded from their communities and sometimes even murdered. We call on the authorities to identify and punish those who commit atrocities against women (rape, murder and infanticide) and children in conflict zones. Closer cooperation is needed with local women’s organisations in order to establish an early warning system and possibly enable them to prevent or reduce the incidence of abuse themselves.

The World Energy Outlook 2011 of the International Energy Agency (IEA) emphasises that worldwide, about 1.3 billion people have no access to electricity. Access to sustainable energy sources and modern energy services is a prerequisite for economic growth and social development, as well as for the realisation of several of the rights contained in the 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and other international human rights and environmental legal instruments. In addition to that, although there is no Millennium Development Goal specifically related to energy, I strongly believe that energy should move to the forefront of the debate on eradication of poverty. For this reason, the Commission and the Member States must endorse and commit to support the UN’s recently established international target of universal energy access by 2030, and align their policies and development cooperation with this objective. By this same means, we also ask for the establishment, within EU development cooperation, of a specific ‘energy and development’ programme, with special focus on universal energy access. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to think about local production, because it reduces costs and promotes the combination of different production methods. In this regard, I welcome the adoption of paragraph 37 which ‘calls on the Commission and the Member States neither to fund nor to otherwise encourage the use of nuclear power in developing countries’, given the serious concerns raised by nuclear power and the fact that we need to make the transition on the basis of an energy mix. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In its resolution, the European Parliament puts an emphasis on maximising the use of renewable energy resources and therefore calls for EU financial aid to be allocated to promoting the use of these resources in particular. The European Parliament also points out that the European Energy Facility is one of only a few financial mechanisms operating internationally and it is therefore necessary to review the mechanism’s effectiveness and efficiency when drawing up the new multiannual financial framework (2014-2020). In its report, Parliament also underlined that effective partnerships will need to be established between the public and private sectors, communities and local government in order to develop access to sustainable energy services. In addition, Parliament recognises that the public sector alone will not be able to meet all the financing needs required to develop energy access, and therefore draws attention to the importance of private investors and market-oriented reforms for the energy sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The bilateral aid cooperation provided by EU countries in the area of energy has had its primary focus on economic growth and environmental objectives, rather than on energy access for the poor, and a similar situation can be seen with other important bilateral aid cooperation programmes (the US, Canada and so on). Climate change financial mechanisms have also contributed very little so far to energy access for the poor. The financial gap in the provision of universal energy access is large. The International Energy Agency states that the investment necessary for providing universal energy access by 2030 amounts to USD 756 billion, or USD 36 billion per year.

As the world’s largest donor, the European Union should be aware of this inequality and contribute to minimising it. To that end, it should seek to help the countries and people in greatest need, to enable energy access and, wherever possible, to boost opportunities for the beneficiaries of the aid themselves to generate and manage their own energy. It will be hard without more and better energy access to successfully eradicate poverty from many areas of the globe. It therefore falls to the European Union to make part of this collective effort, which the authorities of the countries in receipt of aid cannot themselves shirk. It should be required of these that they put the received funds to proper use and that they make an effort to spread energy access amongst their citizens, particularly amongst those in greatest need of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As such, it is crucial to adopt measures that catalyse the investments enabling achievement of the goals set for 2030; that is, universal energy access. This report, drafted by Mr Neuser, concerns the need for cooperation within the European Union on achieving the aforementioned goal, and it could not be more timely, since we are at the start of 2012, designated International Year of Sustainable Energy for All by the UN. I welcome the proposed measures, particularly the encouragement of private investment and the inclusion of universal energy access as a Millennium Development Goal from 2015. It is essential to invest in energy efficiency and in green energy production. I welcome the adoption of this report, for which I voted, and I hope that the EU will very soon fund private individuals’ projects for the installation of equipment intended to produce energy from renewable sources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report makes some relevant observations on the scale of the problem of energy poverty and the resulting negative implications for achieving development goals. The importance it gives to the need to adapt energy supply solutions to the specific conditions of developing countries, whilst emphasising decentralised solutions, renewable energy and the autonomy of these countries, also seems correct to us. Regrettably, however, the major contradictions that run through this Parliament also come out quite clearly in the report. In the end, what eventually predominates here is a completely subverted vision of the role of development cooperation, which is transformed into business opportunities for EU countries. There is a well-known tendency to interfere in the sovereign choices of developing countries, imposing models identical to those in the EU: the deregulation and liberalisation of markets – it advocates ‘market-oriented reforms in the energy sector’, ‘public-private partnerships’, etc. – that have led to situations of exclusion from access to energy in Europe. Although we recognise the urgent need to step up cooperation in this area with developing countries, we cannot vote for this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, aside from the economies in transition, very few developing countries can demonstrate progress on scaling-up access to energy for the poor.

It would, however, be unrealistic to assume that we can effectively combat poverty with access to energy. In this context, one might consider the privatised water supply service in developing countries, which can easily lead to a situation where the poor cannot afford water. This problem should not be ignored when it comes to electricity, which replaces conventional fuels such as gathered wood, etc. Nonetheless, improved energy supply can lead to economic growth and thus reduce poverty by creating new jobs. If we continue in the same way with the reforms in the energy sector that we have been pursuing for almost three decades now, then 67% of the population will still have no electricity by 2015. To date, progress has only been made in this regard in a small number of developing countries. Since supplying energy to the poor is not a profitable business, private investors have only improved energy supply to the productive and commercial sectors. This is something that will only change through the appropriate subsidies. As the report is extremely critical of this, I have voted in favour of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In developing countries, households generally spend a high percentage of their budget on the purchase of low-quality fuels for heating and cooking compared with households with access to electricity and to liquid and gas fuels. In developing countries, sustainable energy access for the poor faces a number of barriers, notably: the inability of the poor to pay for the services, investment costs, connection costs and no national capacity to produce the energy generation equipment and spare parts required. The report stresses that, whilst none of the MDGs are specifically related to energy, access to modern, sustainable energy services for all is a prerequisite for achieving the MDGs. We now need to bring energy to the fore in the debate on the eradication of poverty, by establishing a specific programme focusing on ‘energy and development’ within the framework of the European Union’s development cooperation policy. It is for these priorities that I voted in favour of this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I supported this report because access to modern energy services is essential to the realisation of several fundamental economic, social and cultural rights. From lighting to cooling, from access to information to access to communications systems, electricity is essential and determines income generation. The challenge for the European Union is to reconcile developing countries’ access to energy with respect for the environment. These countries have a huge potential for renewable energy that we must exploit by offering sustainable energy services at affordable prices. To this end, a transfer of technology between Europe and the countries of the South is a priority vector and the involvement of the private sector should not be overlooked. In addition to the environmental aspect, targeting local energy will allow poor, rural populations without access to the traditional distribution grids to benefit from energy services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although perhaps it is not quite the same, ordinary Lithuanians are also going through a difficult period. According to Eurostat data between the second half of 2009 and last year, Lithuania saw the highest jump in the price of electricity – 31%. Meanwhile, the EU electricity price rose 5.1% over the same period. Since 1 January 2012, the price of electricity in Lithuania has increased by LTL 0.014/kWh. The decommissioning of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant was one of the conditions for EU accession and this has significantly altered the structure of electricity generation in Lithuania – the Ignalina power plant met 70% of Lithuania’s electricity requirements. Our leaders do not have a comprehensive and realistic electricity strategy for Lithuania. At the beginning of 2010, Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius stated that nothing bad would happen following decommissioning. We are ready to supply as much electricity as is required.

It makes some relevant observations on the scale of the problem of energy poverty and the resulting negative implications for achieving development goals. It is also important to mention the importance it gives to the need to adapt energy supply solutions to the specific conditions of developing countries, whilst emphasising decentralised solutions, renewable energy and the autonomy of these countries. If these were the report’s objectives, we would support it. All things considered, however, what ends up predominating is a completely subverted vision of the role of development cooperation, which is transformed into business opportunities for EU countries here. There is a well-known tendency to interfere in the sovereign choices of developing countries, imposing models identical to those in the EU: the deregulation and liberalisation of markets that have led to situations of exclusion from energy access in a number of countries and allowed states to be frozen out of this important strategic sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report focuses on the tax initiatives taken by the Commission during 2011 and on areas where further initiatives are necessary in order to improve the functioning of the single market and to create a more competitive Europe. The report also stresses that improvement of the single market and, eventually, some tax harmonisation could be key factors for encouraging growth and job creation; that tax policies must aim to foster European competitiveness and lower costs for European business, namely for small and medium enterprises. I agree with the rapporteur’s proposal that the EP should ask the Commission and Member States to cooperate further on their respective tax policies against double taxation, tax fraud and tax evasion in order to increase transparency and reduce loopholes and uncertainties for businesses and citizens with regard to tax collection. To make the taxation process more coherent, I support the EP call upon the Commission in cooperation with the European Parliament to establish an EU definition and list – taking into account, as a first step, the OECD definition and list of tax havens or secrecy jurisdictions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Tax harmonisation in Europe is the keystone for growth and competitiveness for our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). These barriers must be removed, especially as bureaucracy and the tax systems weigh particularly heavily on SMEs. This report shows us that these measures have led to a reduction in the tax obstacles related to cross-border operations and the elimination of distortions of competitiveness from which companies suffer, even within the European Union. This report, however, is also about preventing double non-taxation, tax fraud, tax havens and increasing tax transparency. Finally, it also sets out numerous recommendations, from the need to simplify VAT regimes to the importance of a low tax level, not just for the social welfare of families and households, but also for competitiveness and new jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, it is thought that the current system, based on different national tax systems, creates bureaucratic difficulties and unequal treatment of businesses, giving rise to the need to bring in a uniform tax system and give the European Union power over tax. Possible tax harmonisation is also seen as a driver of growth and jobs. I do not agree with these arguments since it is competition – including between national tax systems – that creates opportunities for businesses and workers within the common market. The diversity of the tax systems also ensures that the Member States will seek, as far as possible, to change their regulations on the subject in order to try and attract jobs and business. Instead, we should encourage fiscal federalism, which might be a tool for achieving greater economic efficiency in the EU. We should also insist on the proposal to simplify value-added tax, reduce the red tape faced by companies and introduce tax incentives for small and medium-sized enterprises. Given the underlying theme of the report, advocating tax harmonisation in the EU, I voted against it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, the current economic and financial crisis has led to a significant rise in public debt in the Member States, and sound fiscal consolidation, together with fairer and more targeted distribution of the tax burden, is therefore necessary to ensure fiscal credibility. In this case, where the situation demands both expenditure restraint and tax increases, the most important thing is to give priority to growth-oriented tax changes. In this context, it is also particularly important not to forget that now more than ever, we have to ensure that the automatic stabilisers of the welfare state continue to operate alongside tough austerity measures in all countries in order to ensure growth and social cohesion. The European Parliament is therefore in favour of closer coordination of tax policies in the European Union, which would help reduce costs and the administrative burden on citizens and businesses, and underlines the need to simplify VAT regimes in order to eliminate double taxation and bureaucracy for employers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Tax policy affects everyone and has positive and negative aspects. Obviously, paying taxes is costly to all, but states need revenue to pay for public services such as health care, education, social security, the military, the emergency services, etc. In the current crisis situation, all measures that boost economic growth should be considered. It is therefore crucial to support cross-border mobility and prevent the double taxation of the companies or citizens of one Member State that work in another, whose costs can rise by 50%. Differentiated taxation is an obstacle to mobility, so EU-level tax harmonisation is desirable. I voted for this report, since it makes an important contribution to improving European legislation on taxation, both by preventing double taxation and by combating tax evasion, thereby increasing transparency throughout the process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the report’s few positive aspects are not enough to change an overall vision that is very negative and even profoundly contradictory with the initial considerations.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, the report argues that there is a need to harmonise EU tax policies and increase Commission controls on budgetary procedures, it advocates fiscal federalism and promotes the European Semester. In other words, it backs the subversion of the role of the tax system enshrined in some national constitutions, as happens in Portugal, putting it at the service of the reproduction of inequalities and of the accumulation and concentration of capital by big business and the financial sector, and justifying the rejection of the state in a series of areas of economic and social life. Despite the highlighted contradictions, it is pure and hard neoliberalism that predominates. Obviously, we voted against. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

EU citizens and businesses that are working and operating cross-border experience tax obstacles that are leading to significant barriers to growth and employment on the EU’s internal market, and these barriers must be removed for this reason. This is how to ensure a more competitive Europe that creates growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The current economic and financial crisis has led, however, to a significant rise in public debt in Europe and, in this context, the automatic stabilisers of the welfare state remain more relevant than ever. Effective taxation is of fundamental importance for public authorities so that they can fulfil their tasks and obligations as well as citizens’ expectations. Sound fiscal consolidation, together with fairer and more targeted distribution of the tax burden, is necessary to ensure fiscal credibility, and the reduction of debt requires both expenditure restraint and tax increases, while growth-oriented tax changes must be given priority.</p>

Do you need reminding that this term obscures wholly amoral, abusive practices that are, however, perfectly legal, at least according to your rules? Admittedly, a country such as France would need a real tax revolution to boost the purchasing power of its people, the dynamism of its companies, the contribution of imports to the public purse, imports which cost us thousands of jobs each year ... The solution though is not tax harmonisation at European level nor the creation of new taxes at Union level, as the report recommends.

However, there is also a need for controlled and efficient public spending and stable public finances. The Commission’s proposals regarding taxation must contribute to European competitiveness by eliminating distortions of competition, which arise from the various taxation systems in place. The Commission and Member States must cooperate further in establishing their respective tax policies against double taxation, tax fraud and tax evasion in order to increase transparency and reduce loopholes and uncertainties for businesses and citizens with regard to tax collection, especially when it comes to their respective administrative procedures for filing tax returns. Member States should look to reduce the tax compliance costs for SMEs, where possible, by streamlining procedures and reducing bureaucratic costs.

Export markets are important to Latvia’s businesses. However, they are not always accessible, because of high costs and a lack of information. The resolution is a step in the right direction, since it calls on the European Commission to draw up legislation to reduce these barriers and simplify tax administration for Latvia’s export businesses.

Such a policy is, however, contrary to European guidelines, for instance, the directive on value-added tax, and it impedes economic development and increases social inequality. From the point of view of the development of the European economy, it is certainly very important to reduce the bureaucracy that is particularly characteristic of the larger Member States, as well as to prevent double taxation for companies and private individuals and to establish a single consolidated tax base for corporate income tax. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Attention is drawn to the fact that taxation is a matter of national sovereignty. Every Member State must therefore aim to reduce the tax burden with a particular focus on SMEs. It is also very important for the tax policies of both the EU and the Member States to be directly targeted against double taxation, tax fraud, tax evasion and abuse. I believe that the Commission’s proposals regarding taxation must, above all, increase the EU’s competitiveness and ensure the effective functioning of the single market, but under no circumstances must they increase the administrative burden. VAT regimes also need to be simplified and bureaucracy reduced.

We support the message that double taxation of businesses and individuals needs to be overcome. As for tax evasion, our very demanding amendments were condensed into a few paragraphs: generalisation and extension of automatic information exchange; notify and make public tax rulings (which would help to make company tax dodging public); and, last but not least, a call to the Commission to establish an EU definition and list of tax havens (secrecy jurisdiction), in the absence of a meaningful international list. (A meaningful list would contain a few EU Member States ...) On the negative, however: relatively weak language on the need for tax harmonisation, and a few anti-tax bits and pieces slipped into the final report (need for low taxes, contrasted with ascertainment of need for tax increases a few paragraphs further down ...). </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A low tax level is essential not only for the social welfare of families and households, but also for competitiveness and creating new jobs. Improving the single market and some tax harmonisation measures could be key factors for encouraging economic growth and job creation. In this regard, we await with interest the Commission’s proposals for removing cross-border tax obstacles for EU citizens.

To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the report on competition policy, this year’s edition begins with an overview of the major developments of competition policy and enforcement over the past 40 years. I agree with the rapporteur that EU competition policy has brought numerous benefits in terms of consumer welfare and has been an essential tool to eliminate obstacles to the free movement of goods, services, persons and capital. I agree on the emphasis that the ongoing consolidation in the banking sector has actually increased the market share of several major financial institutions and, therefore, the Commission has to maintain a close watch on the sector in order to enhance competition in European banking markets. We, Members of European Parliament, recall the Parliament’s invitation to the Commission during the early steps of the implementation of the third energy package to closely monitor the level of competition; it also asks the Commission to intensify the efforts that it is making in order to open up competition in the credit rating agencies sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur, Mr Schwab, quite rightly emphasises that competition – including and especially in difficult times – offers a way out of the crisis and of economic stagnation. Mr Schwab asks the Commission to facilitate exchanges and contact between the EU institutions and consumer associations on issues related to competition. He also reiterates that cartels are detrimental both to the correct functioning of the market and to consumers – the end users of the goods and services produced. Lastly, Mr Schwab dutifully encourages openness and competition in the crucial and delicate sectors of energy and ratings agencies.

The European Parliament welcomes the fact that the Commission responded to the eruption of the crisis in a prompt and reasonable manner by adopting special State aid rules and using competition policy as a crisis management tool. The huge amount of State aid given during the crisis in the form of, for example, guarantee schemes, recapitalisation schemes and complementary forms of liquidity support on bank funding have contributed to severe imbalances in public finances. The Commission should further investigate the competition situation in the retail sector, in particular, the consequences of alleged abuse of market power by dominant retail chains with negative consequences for small retailers and producers in the agriculture and food market. The European Parliament also believes that competition policy should contribute to promoting and enforcing open standards and interoperability in order to prevent the technological lock-in of consumers and clients by a minority of market players. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Between 1 October 2008 and 1 October 2010, the Commission took more than 200 decisions on State aid for the financial sector. In 2009, the nominal amount of aid to the sector used by Member States constituted EUR 1 107 billion, and the maximum volume of Commission-approved measures since the beginning of the crisis until 1 October 2010 amounts to EUR 4 588.90 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">Sizable amounts of State aid given during the crisis in the form of, for example, guarantee schemes, recapitalisation schemes and complementary forms of liquidity support on bank funding have contributed to severe imbalances in public finances, while it is still unknown how far-reaching the impact of this State aid will be, in particular the impact of guarantees provided to banks.</p>

EU competition policy has played a major role in removing barriers to the free movement of goods, services, people and capital, and has also reinforced the single market and consumer interests. I particularly welcome the parliamentary report’s acknowledgement that the Commission should actively engage with consumer associations to ensure that competition policy always works in the interest of consumers. As I have consistently argued, the rejuvenation of the single market clearly requires moves away from protectionism. However, I am concerned that the report does not find the correct balance between granting a level playing field to all economic operators and the need to apply competition rules appropriately, given the unique realities of small-island Member States on the periphery of the Union. In all cases, competition rules should take into consideration how they will affect European citizens and consumers, and should ensure that access to essential services is maintained. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the period from 1 October 2008 to 1 October 2010, the Commission took more than 200 decisions on State aid for the financial sector. In 2009, the nominal amount of aid to the financial sector used by Member States constituted EUR 1 107 billion, or 9.3% of EU GDP. This aid will undoubtedly continue during the crisis, and I therefore applaud the fact that the Commission has introduced a requirement applicable from 1 January 2011 onwards to submit a restructuring plan for every beneficiary of a recapitalisation or an impaired assets measure, irrespective of whether the bank is considered to be fundamentally sound or distressed. The Commission should therefore ensure the orderly restructuring of banks, with shareholder and bondholder involvement, prior to the injection of public capital. I also consider it vital for the Commission to carry out an <span class="italic">ex post</span> analysis of the impacts of ECB support received by the banks during the crisis and other public interventions.

Competition is an essential driver of the single market which allows us to move goods, services, persons and capital freely. On the one hand, it allows consumers to make the best possible choice and, on the other, it stimulates economic development. I also share the view favouring the need for a more thorough analysis of the functioning of the markets and of the competition in key sectors such as energy, telecommunications, transportation and raw materials, which have a serious impact on the economy as a whole. Another area of great importance to consumers is the food market, where we witnessed problems related to the rapid price escalation.

Competition between energy producers, which would ensure the lowest possible prices for heating and electricity, is in the interests of the people of Latvia and the European Union as a whole. Unfortunately, competition in the energy market is still subject to significant limitations because the largest market participants continue to occupy dominant positions. In some Member States, such as Latvia, there is still a monopoly on the gas market. It is in the interests of Latvia’s people to end this monopoly and provide a gas supply at as low a price as possible, ensuring stable economic growth. It is therefore important for the European Parliament to continue to alert us to these deficiencies in the energy market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ever since, the beginning of the building of a Community competition policy has been an essential foundation of economic cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we must also find a solution to market movements distorted by the crisis through appropriate regulation. The Commission attempted to respond effectively to the economic crisis, adopting rules on State aid while remaining within the framework of competition policy.

<p class="contents">The report covers several sectors, and among these, the call to implement the internal energy market package as soon as possible in order to realise an open and competitive single market in energy is justified. Furthermore, in order to protect the interests of consumers, it is just as important to introduce effective cost analysis at all stages of the food supply chain. The adoption of Commission rescue and restructuring guidelines for the banking sector is also inevitable, and the consideration and application of these guidelines will need to be monitored.</p>

During the debate on 15 December, I lauded the majority of its content whilst also warning of the risk that it would be severely compromised if it did not include aspects in relation to the collective exercise of private actions, so that the victims of competition infringements can obtain compensation for the damage caused. The approved text, with an amendment that has been co-signed by the members of the competition policy group, reflects the current consensus of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with respect to the broad guidelines that should apply to the legislative proposal for collective actions for damages due to the breach of EU legislation to defend competition, announced as part of the Commission’s work programme for 2012. As set out in my Amendment 29, these were stated in Parliament on 29 March 2009 during the White Paper debate. Coordination within the EU in terms of the right to the collective exercise of private actions will be essential for providing compensation for the damages sustained by consumers and companies, and to guarantee the efficiency of EU competition law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is now the 40th report, because this policy is one of the Union’s core policies and is very important for the operation of the single European market, and, as I said before during the debate, the single market is the foundation of economic success in the Union. I am pleased that the Commission, and particularly the Commission of Mr Barroso, has been very active in the area of regulating the conditions of competition in the financial markets. The work of the monitoring and supervision agencies which have been established will certainly help in bringing discipline to the financial markets. The measures taken by the European Commission with regard to the telecommunications market have also brought positive results. However, we have to be aware of the need for new regulation of the services market, and also of the energy and food markets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, financial turmoil and recessionary fears have once again become acute over recent months. In such a context, competition policy may be an added value, and may become an instrument for managing the crisis. The climate is quite favourable and people are cooperative, as evidenced by the excitement characterising consumer associations that operate in the field of European competition law. This vote is a step in the direction of improved price transparency, which is essential in stimulating competition in the single market and offering real choice to consumers. The many measures to be adopted also need to include the provision of a performance scheme to guarantee transparency of service pricing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the most crucial measures adopted to combat the crisis is competition policy, whose purpose is to create an internal market that is more dynamic, effective and competitive at international level. I am voting for this report, since I agree that there should be greater transparency in terms of the prices used by companies and more research and innovation grants should be awarded to companies, and because I advocate the adoption of specific measures to solve the banking crisis and oversight for mergers. I would highlight as a positive the emphasis given in the report to fostering competition in all sectors and not just the service sector, which accounts for 70% of the European economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We call on the Commission to monitor the level of competition in the energy sector and issue guidelines for improving access to the energy grid for renewable energy sources. We should stress the need for competition on the roaming market and for improving price transparency, in addition to removing the differences between roaming and national tariffs by 2015. In order to ensure a level playing field across the EU, we call on the Commission and Member States to implement the Services Directive and e-government systems, thereby removing the barriers preventing the provision of cross-border services. We call on the Commission to actively monitor developments in commodity-related markets and present ambitious legislative proposals with the aim of tackling speculative practices which adversely affect European industry and distort the single market. Last but not least, an interconnected, interoperable and efficient transport network is essential for fair competition during the completion of the internal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This founding policy has allowed healthy competition between companies and now ensures that consumers can have better quality and a wider choice of products and services at more affordable prices. We must, however, continue our efforts in markets which, up to now, have been little known but which have been brought out into the light in the crisis over excessive bonuses. Consequently, I unreservedly support this report, which sets out a valid diagnosis of the ratings agencies. Their defective assessments in 2007 and their publishing errors in 2011 have aggravated the historic crisis that we are experiencing and have shown us the need to put an end to this oligopoly. In order to establish more accurate, more responsible diagnoses, we must have greater competition in the financial analysis field, whilst boosting the credibility of the small agencies. This regulation will not, in any respect, be a way for Member States to renege on their commitments to controlling spending. It is merely about ensuring that the global finance thermometer is working properly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
