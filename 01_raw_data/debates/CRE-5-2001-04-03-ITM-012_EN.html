<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Τrakatellis (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, the health programme on which we are about to vote is the first integrated EU venture in this sector. This is a favourable time to promote such an initiative, in view of both the considerable advances in information collection and dissemination technology and the increased awareness Europeans have of the quality of life, on which health protection can have a catalysing influence. In this new programme, an overall approach is adopted, both for health and the methods, mechanisms and practices used to tackle health issues. </p>
<p class="contents">Thus, the programme sets three objectives, to be achieved through close overall and two-way cooperation between Member States. The first objective is to collect, process and disseminate medical data, information, practices and knowledge from all sources. The second objective is to create a mechanism for a direct, rapid and coordinated Community response to health threats. The third objective is to tackle factors which are lifestyle-related health determinants, socio-economic health determinants and environment-related health determinants.</p>
<p class="contents">These factors will be studied, so that a strategy and policies can be drawn up designed to ensure that individual measures are of a high quality and to make health protection more effective. However, the programme’s major weakness is the fact that it lacks the coordinating centre which is absolutely vital in such an extended, complicated endeavour in which the national services of the Member States, non-governmental organisations, international bodies, Commission departments, existing and developing programme networks are involved, as the programme proposes, together with numerous other factors. I focused my attention on this deficiency in particular and, after some consideration and several consultations, I finally decided on a proposal for creating a Health Coordination and Monitoring Centre, my proposal being that this centre would operate within the framework of the Community, i.e. the European Commission, and the programme, with the assistance of a committee made up of representatives of the Member States. This will ensure that all the objectives are achieved in the best way possible.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as the coordination objective, several other objectives have been included which are connected with the introduction of an integrated health strategy through the development of an inter-sectoral policy in the definition and implementation of all Community policies and activities. The programme to tackle health determinants proposes adding the development of strategies and measures on genetic, antenatal and biological determinants which obviously affect health. Similarly, supporting action to identify and determine best practices and guidelines for health is a basic factor in safeguarding a high level of health protection and preventing illness. Obviously, without comparability of information, compatibility of data and interoperability of systems and networks which are being developed or which will be developed within the programme, the measure will have a limited impact and the Community action will not be successful. For this reason, binding provisions are being introduced for the development of comparable health data and compatible information systems as well as express provision for the protection of personal data.</p>
<p class="contents">Another factor which I consider extremely important is the budget. There must always be a correspondence between the objectives set and the means available to achieve them. In my opinion, this correspondence is not ensured in the proposed programme for two reasons: first, the programme’s measures, as described, are particularly extensive and ambitious and, secondly, the extension of the existing programmes in the health sector adopted last December has already reduced the original budget of EUR 300 million by approximately EUR 80 million.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the above, amendments have been proposed so that the objectives of the programme can be achieved. Furthermore, we should not forget for an instant the fact that, after successive crises – bovine spongiform encephalopathy, dioxin, foot-and-mouth – public health is a major EU priority, even taking precedence over its other policies.</p>
<p class="contents">This programme has come along at the right time, a time of considerable advances in information technology and surprising achievements in atomic biology, genetic engineering and biotechnology, all of which will radically change preventive medicine and therefore be instrumental in preventing disease. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say that, if we are to strengthen the foundations of the European structure, we need convergence not just at strategy and policy level in the economic sector or in the foreign policy and security sector; we also need convergence in individual sectors such as health, education, etc. These are new forms of integration which I refer to as new convergences and which add breadth and depth to the unification process. I therefore consider that the new programme represents the start of just such a convergence process in the vitally important public health sector.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But thanks are also due to the committee responsible, which accepted all 16 amendments proposed by the Committee on Women's Rights. This shows that once again, this House is much further ahead than some Member States with their national health policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we women constitute the majority of the population, and although the double and triple burden of work, family and caring for relatives are shown to take a greater toll on our health, women-specific aspects do not always receive the attention they deserve in health policy. Our health systems are usually gender-blind. National reports rarely include a breakdown by gender. Yet it is telling that in Europe and beyond, the majority of people who are dependent on medication are women. In Germany, the figure is 70%.</p>
<p class="contents">So we urgently need more solid data, and above all, a holistic approach to health throughout Europe. Gender policies must also be granted a central role in health policy in future: in research, prevention and treatment. The new Public Health Action Programme can pave the way in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Every 20 minutes, a woman dies of breast cancer in Europe. It affects one woman in nine. The probability of contracting this disease increases from year to year. Yet if it is detected in time and properly treated, breast cancer is curable. So here too, best practice is imperative. We must ensure that it is not only in early detection that breakthroughs are widely promoted throughout the EU. After the adoption of the European Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Mammography Screening, the task now is to research and promote best practice for treatment as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our colleagues on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy have made every effort to incorporate many additional issues into the Commission's text and improve upon it, while our rapporteur, Mr Trakatellis, has made genuine efforts and worked extremely hard to take all these different wishes into account. This has not only resulted in a great many proposed amendments; in my view, it also presents us with a text which – as an opinion of the European Parliament – is useless in its current form. It is full of repetition, tautology, rambling paragraphs, contradictory statements, and demands which violate the principle of subsidiary, even though the opposite is claimed in the text.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of content, I have concerns about the Commission's priorities as reflected, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, in the allocation of resources. Here, I support the rapporteur's proposed amendment. But in particular, I have grave reservations about the undoubtedly well-meaning proposal calling on the Commission to set up a Health Coordination and Monitoring Centre (HCMC) to ensure the efficient operation and coordination of the programme. I will vote against all these proposed amendments, and also protest vigorously about the fact that we are discussing this report in plenary this week even though the translation was only available on Monday.</p>
<p class="contents">A framework programme could create the necessary transparency for the Community's activities in the field of health and offer the flexibility to set priorities in response to current events. In this way, the limited available resources could be used sensibly and in a targeted way. But this requires a clear and lucid mandate for the Commission, which – in my view – the current text fails to provide. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the first time advances in European policy in the health sector have been set out, achievements and weaknesses have been identified and the difficulties in applying a consistent Community policy have been made clear. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament must use its vote on the report in question to signal its support for health promotion, the principle of prevention and improved medical services at all levels. Obviously, sectors such as research and the environment impact directly on public health and proper account must be taken of them in action programmes. We also feel that the European Union should work with international organisations and non-governmental health organisations so that there is a constant flow of information and exchange of experiences and we can respond immediately to serious threats. We also need to stress how important it is to increase public awareness and for the public to be actively involved in health issues. If we are to win the confidence of European citizens in Community policies on issues which affect them, specific problems relating directly or indirectly to health need to be examined promptly and transparently. Under the new programme, three global objectives replace the eight programmes currently in operation. We are hopeful that the new, special objectives will be selected not in a fragmentary manner and under pressure, but on the basis of the priorities set by the World Health Organisation and other organisations working in this sector. </p>
<p class="contents">As far as creating a European Coordination and Monitoring Centre is concerned, I think that it should work under the aegis of the Commission and should draw up programmes of priorities in the health sector, taking account of international data. Similarly, it should collect, monitor and evaluate the relevant information so that it can propose and then coordinate strategies and measures. I must, of course, stress that the confidentiality of personal data on individuals or groups of people must be respected when collecting information. I think it is very important that mental health has been included for the first time as an area for action under a public health programme. My congratulations for that to the Commissioner, who demonstrated a personal awareness and responded to our proposition by including this issue in his proposal. Scientific data clearly show the extent and seriousness of neuro-psychiatric illnesses and our response, albeit belated, must be direct and effective. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards the budget, even though I believe that funding should not be sparing in this sector and am aware of the objective difficulties of the budget, I believe that an increase of EUR 80 million, i.e. the amount spent on extending the operation of existing programmes, is perfectly realistic. I am confident that, despite all the difficulties, the European Commission and the Council will agree to this increase and finally, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his efforts to find compromise solutions which substantially improve the initial proposal.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to draw particular attention to the fact that rarely during a committee’s work has there been so much cooperation among political groups, and for that an unqualified thank you goes to the rapporteur. As my fellow Member, Mrs Schleicher, criticised this report for perhaps not focussing adequately on the essentials and featuring too many good intentions, I might first of all say that the final result could have been a lot more cluttered. It could have expressed a lot more in the way of hopes for the future. I think the rapporteur has seen to it that it covers the whole issue, however. As for Mrs Schleicher’s own group, it added a totally new area of focus. Her group asked for the fifth special objective to be adopted, the one connected with gene therapy, diagnosis of genetic diseases, cloning, and so on. My group certainly was not of the opinion that this should be added here.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, public health is a major area of activity for the European Union as the Treaty of Amsterdam does indeed oblige the Union to take account of the health issue in all areas of its work. In this respect we face some very demanding challenges. My group would particularly like to underline the importance of this sort of integration and the Commission is going to have the enormous task of adapting agricultural policy to the demands of health. Let us just think about the food we eat, for example. It must mean that in the future we will be eating more vegetarian food and rather less meat, and so on. In industrial policy it will mean that when we adopt a strategy on chemicals the basic issues of public health must be made very clear. It will also mean that the food industry will have to accept that tighter regulations will have to be adopted, for example, with regard to the salt content of food. There are many conflicts to come, and we can only hope that the Commission will work on these proposals and then the Council of Ministers and Parliament will clarify this situation further in the second reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Trakatellis talks of a principle which we share: health is not a commodity which can be traded. And he speaks of two objectives: health promotion and disease prevention, and the whole of his proposal refers to these two objectives, and it is essential that a health programme achieves them. Initially he talks about the necessary coordination, not only in the networks which deal with health, but with the Member States and also with the non-governmental organisations. And, as an epilogue, he also talks about a proposal which we agree with: to create a centre for the coordination and monitoring of the health situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agree that we must have the capacity for rapid reaction in the face of the kind of threats to health which we have seen recently and continue to see. We must also overcome inequalities; there are still inequalities between the Member States and within the Member States themselves, and the rapporteur and the Committee on the Environment remind us that these inequalities must be overcome, and place great emphasis on the ongoing training of doctors and health staff, but also on the health education and training of schoolchildren. We think this is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur also speaks of the risks which today are of great concern to the population and which relate to the health effects of mobile telephones and mobile communications in general, with the tall masts that are now all over our towns producing electromagnetic waves. He also discusses the risks of radioactivity and, specifically, of something which was also talked about – and this is a debate which should continue – of the health risks of depleted uranium and other risks. I believe that this is a fine report and that its deserves Parliament’s support tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fully support the position taken by the Commissioner for Public Health and Consumer Protection, Mr Byrne, when he states that it is dangerous to assume that a Member State can protect its citizens' health by its own efforts alone. He is fully correct in his approach. We know that a single market exists where there is a free movement of goods, persons, services and capital within the territories of the European Union. Communicable diseases which affect the health of our citizens do not stop at borders.</p>
<p class="contents">Citizens of each Member State must have access to the wide range of information concerning the factors affecting their health and on the way in which public health systems within that country meet their needs. This proposal also covers the important legislative initiatives in areas such as safety of blood and blood derivatives, and the implementation of wider anti-smoking campaigns.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must be given a central coordinating role in public health to deal with illnesses, from detecting their origin to their actual treatment. It is very important that homeopathy should also be included as a medical treatment within this European Community action plan on public health. Finally, the European Commission should allocate greater financial resources to investigating the causes of, and possible cures for, Alzheimer's disease. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Public health is national policy, and it should remain that way. I am therefore against public health programmes which can be used as leverage to influence national policy, whilst the programmes currently before us hardly represent any added value compared to Member State efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">The current debate on a new public health programme is only feeding my concern. Although there is a formal acknowledgement that the principle of subsidiarity needs to be observed, it is a hollow phrase. In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the programme has been padded out and trimmed with all kinds of topics which could possibly be related to public health. In addition, the budget has been increased from EUR 300 to 500 million, and should partly be utilised to set up a European coordination centre. Not only do I find such a coordination centre surplus to requirements, it is also unwanted, since I expect it will be used to develop <span class="italic">European</span> rather than a <span class="italic">national</span> public health policy.</p>
<p class="contents">If the EU institutions want to make a distinct gesture in terms of public health, they need to phase out subsidies for tobacco growing completely. That will generate funds for the European Union, instead of the European Union spending money on projects which Member States could implement and finance. In the field of alcohol and drugs, it is the Member States which need to pursue a restrictive policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the European Union could do more for the candidate countries in terms of promoting public health, where even basic health care is found wanting. Various diseases can be controlled effectively by means of relatively few resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The week before last, in Parliament, we were launching the epilepsy White Paper. Some 15 million of our fellow Europeans will be afflicted by that illness during their lifetime at a cost of some EUR 20 billion per year, plus the cost to the individual and families of lost income and the cost to Member States of lost tax revenues. Multiply that by all the diseases and disorders, physical and mental, add the impact of ending the communist system in Eastern Europe and the two-way cross-border movement of health problems, from environmental pollution to sexual and drug-related diseases, and the economic impact of health problems is colossal.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has no competence for health services, but it has always had competence for health and safety at work, and then for public health and infectious diseases which have no respect for national borders. More recently it has been given competence for health promotion and illness prevention and health impact assessments. Now we have to take this forward with the reforms of our health action programme that this report suggests. I commend this report, the work of the rapporteur and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy's additions to his work. We shall raise standards of health in the European Union, not by directives, but by research, education and the identification and dissemination of good practice. It will not cost the tax-payers an arm and a leg: just EUR 83 million per year, if our committee position is accepted – a tiny sum for a massive challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">We are told that the Council will not accept EUR 83 million per year for six years, but EUR 63 million per year is what was being spent under the old programme. If you just add some 5% per year for six years, that would mean EUR 83 million. If you take the Commission proposal of EUR 50 million and reduce it by the same amount then you would be cutting health budgets to EUR 37 million in real terms when we are taking on these new responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">If they do, let it be on their consciences that they voted against EUR 20 million per year for health, while endorsing an annual budget of over EUR 1 000 million for subsidising the growing of tobacco. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Health is an issue which opinion poll after opinion poll shows is the number one priority for our citizens across the European Union. This issue matters to ordinary people: people understand when you talk about health. As we discuss this report this evening we should never forget this. We often talk about getting closer to citizens and, with an appalling turnout across the Union at the last European elections, we should never forget what is important to our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">As we all know, Article 152 gives public health greater importance than ever before, so that health has to be taken into consideration in all European Union policy areas. With this programme we can directly add value to the lives of European Union citizens. By taking a horizontal approach to public health, we can make the best use of limited resources. With a rapid reaction unit to tackle communicable disease we can act much more effectively. With health impact assessments we can detect what works and what does not. With more health information for our citizens, quality of life will surely improve.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I support much of what the rapporteur proposes, I still have concern over the issue of the centre. I fear that this issue could delay the whole programme because of the legal questions surrounding the proposal. In addition, I also fear that such a centre would take away much of the budget, leaving very little for the work which actually connects effectively with our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, health connects with the citizen. We must guarantee that this proposal, which will last for the next five years, is effective. We must deliver on health and well-being. After all, colleagues, the European elections are not far away. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I am very grateful to the rapporteur, Professor Trakatellis, and to the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and other committees involved for all their work on this important and ambitious programme which is a crucial element in the Community's overall health strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">This programme represents a fundamental step forward in the development of effective European public health policies. It is important because protecting and improving public health is at the very centre of our citizens, concerns and expectations. As we are all aware, the relevance of our public health policy is fast becoming a litmus test of the European Union's credibility for our citizens. The programme will address these preoccupations by providing the means, support and actions in those areas where the Community can make a real difference as foreseen in Article 152 as amended by the Amsterdam Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme under consideration today responds comprehensively to the shared concerns which the Commission, Parliament and the Council have expressed in the past about the shortcomings of the previous programming approach. Consequently, we are moving away from the fragmented disease-oriented, project-driven measures of the past, where resources were spread thinly, the impact on public health was diminished and financial management requirements were multiplied. In its place, we are moving to improve the health policy focus and streamlining programme management, which will minimise bureaucracy, improve coordination, increase transparency and maximise impact. The architecture of the new programme will also ensure a degree of flexibility, so that we can respond to unforeseen health policy issues if and when they arise. It provides a horizontal framework which will allow a policy-driven approach to be taken in the future on the basis of a broad view of public health. In other words the programme will provide an invaluable support to health policy-making in the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme identifies three strands of action that together will enable us to identify and tackle the major health problems that we face. First, improving knowledge about people's health, about health interventions and about the functioning of health systems. Second, anticipating and reacting quickly to major threats to health. Third, confronting the key underlying causes of ill-health related not only to personal lifestyles, but also to other key determinants: social, economic and environmental factors and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to see that very many of the amendments you are debating are in line with this broad view of public health and the way that we should address it at Community level. We can therefore accept, in full, 61 amendments. There are in addition a further 24 amendments which include valuable ideas that we can endorse, but which as drafted are not fully acceptable. This is either because they contain specific points of substance which conflict with the approach of the programme, or because they raise difficult issues. With so many amendments, it is not feasible for me to make specific comments on each of them. I will, therefore, concentrate on four key areas where there are several amendments which we cannot accept and where I believe that some clarification of the Commission's position will be particularly helpful.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the scope and structure of the programme. Even though most amendments respect and indeed reinforce the horizontal or policy-driven approach of the programme, several, such as Amendments Nos 12, 65, 66, 85, 91, 100, 111, 112 and 113, go against this approach. They introduce into the decision references either to specific diseases and conditions or to very precise actions to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Providing some illustrations of major health burdens and activities in a recital may prove to be helpful, but the greatest caution is needed to ensure that the programme does not become so overcrowded with priorities and actions that it loses not only its general orientation, but also the flexibility necessary to respond effectively to new developments and threats as they arise. Events in recent years have clearly demonstrated the need to retain such flexibility. Consequently, it is important to focus on key priorities where real added value can be produced. Activities duplicating the work of other Community programmes should be avoided, and this will also avoid the unnecessary use of scarce resources. For this reason Amendments Nos 86, 88, 89, 92, 94 and 110 are not acceptable. They all touch on subjects such as setting up programmes in eastern Europe, violence against women, risks from mobile telephones, complementary therapies and research, which are covered by other Community programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Efforts have been made by Parliament not to infringe the principle of subsidiarity, that is to say, the responsibilities of Member States in the area of public health. The programme has a clear role in relation to information about how health systems are working, but this should not be interpreted as the Community having a role in the operation of specific health services. These are matters for the Member States. For this reason, Amendments Nos 79, 99 and 102 in relation to protecting the rights of patients and setting up centres of excellence on environmental toxicology and on gene therapy and cloning are not acceptable; and whilst I agreed that the right of patients to simple, clear and scientifically valid information concerning their illness, is in itself a valuable objective, regrettably, the Community has limited competences under Article 152 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to another issue in connection with the basic structure and scope of the programme. Amendment No 106, on the table today, sets out some actions intended to develop links between the programme and other policies. The ideas it contains, for example on health impact assessment, are welcome, but for me this work should not be approached separately from the other actions in the programme. In fact, health in other policies is a fundamental feature of the entire health strategy as such. Activities related to health impact assessment should thus be firmly placed within the proposed structure of the programme and not added as a further separate strand of action. To be consistent, the mainstreaming of health in other policies should form part of the mainstream of our three programme strands. Therefore, this amendment is acceptable only in part.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on implementation, the precondition for the delivery of all these objectives is implementation capacity. Let me say at the outset that I fully accept that the Commission does not currently possess the technical capacity to meet the challenge of implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that we will have to make significant efforts to put in place coordination, monitoring and implementation of capacity which is adequate to the technical challenge offered by this programme. Without any doubt the issue is a priority for the three institutions in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">The success of the programme will depend very much on our ability to bring together the necessary resources and expertise at Community level, within Member States and in international organisations. The Commission will do everything it can to ensure the smooth running of the programme by creating the effective coordination and monitoring capability which is essential to make the programme a success.</p>
<p class="contents">I am currently investigating various options for ensuring this capability, for example, ways to strengthen internal capacities or the new possibility offered by the externalisation initiative to establish one or more specialised bodies for different implementation tasks. However, the amendments include a substantial number of references to the creation of a health coordination and monitoring centre in the programme decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me be very clear about our position on this. As I have said, I wholeheartedly agree with the need for an identifiable mechanism to ensure effective coordination and monitoring to make the programme a success. I also agree that this must be under the auspices of the Commission. But the proposal of Parliament to set up a centre within the Commission, which is named in a number of amendments to the programme decision, raises a number of serious legal and institutional difficulties. In particular, it infringes on the Commission's right to determine its own organisation. Therefore I cannot accept Amendments Nos 11 and 49, nor can I accept those parts of other amendments which contain a reference to a "health coordination and monitoring centre".</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise our position, I believe we are largely in agreement on what needs to be done but we need to reflect carefully on how we achieve this, given the legal, institutional and budgetary implications. In keeping with this agreed objective let me confirm my commitment to work actively with Parliament and the Council in the weeks ahead to find agreed solutions so that adequate structures, expertise and resources will be available for the proper implementation of the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to the third point – the budget. The Commission's proposal is for a total budget of EUR 300 million over a period of six years. There are two amendments on the table today to increase this amount respectively to EUR 500 million – Amendment No 72 – and EUR 380 million – Amendment No 109. The decision on this is for the Council and the European Parliament, as the budgetary authority. At this stage I would simply say that the Commission is keeping to its original proposal. This was drawn up on the basis of a cost estimate for the actions included in the programme, and is in conformity with the financial perspectives. It is clear that any proposals to add to the actions foreseen will have budgetary implications.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot, therefore, accept Amendments Nos 37, 72 and 109 on the total budget for the programme. In addition, Amendments Nos 72, 103 and 109 seek to set limits on how we spend the programme budget. Amendments Nos 72 and 109 stipulate that each strand of actions must receive at least 25% of the budget. Amendment No 103 proposes a restriction on the use to be made of calls for tender and, in addition, raises the ceilings for the percentage of a project's costs that can be covered by a subvention. Such restrictions undermine the essential principle that the programme must be flexible and able to respond to new challenges, emerging risks and public concerns over the coming six years.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore I cannot accept either a minimum amount for expenditure on each strand or the limit on the use of calls for tender. I am, however, prepared to raise the limit on subventions to the 70% permissible under the Commission's established financial rules, but I cannot go beyond this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on comitology, a number of amendments concern the type of committee to be established. We had originally proposed an advisory committee as this would minimise the bureaucracy and procedural work required. Amendments Nos 42 and 73 call for a mixed committee combining management and advisory procedures. From our existing public health programmes we have experience of working with a mixed committee. Furthermore this is in line with the Council Decision 1999/468. Therefore the Commission can accept these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Amendment No 74 specifies a large number of tasks for the committee to perform in management mode. The sheer number of tasks would be counterproductive with regard to our flexibility, in implementing the programme and the proper functioning of the committee. For this reason I cannot agree to some of the provisions in this amendment, for example on the annual budget and arrangements and procedures for selecting and financing projects as according to Article 234 of the EC Treaty the Commission is responsible for the implementation of the budget. Therefore I can only accept it in part.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 105 concerning the submission of annual work programmes to Parliament for opinion. I can, however, accept to submit them for information, as is set out in Amendment No 46.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, for the reasons I have set out, 28 amendments are not acceptable. These are: Amendments Nos 33, 36, 37, 41, 62, 65, 66, 71, 72, 83, 85, 86, 88, 89, 91, 92, 94, 97, 99, 100, 102, 104, 105, 109, 110, 111, 112 and 113. I accept only in part Amendments Nos 6, 11, 12, 14, 27, 29, 32, 44, 48, 49, 50, 51, 54, 57, 63, 70, 74, 76, 77, 79, 80, 93, 103 and 106. On the other hand, as I have indicated I can accept in full the remaining 61 amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat my appreciation for all the constructive work that the rapporteur and the committee have put in. Many of the amendments will improve this proposal. For those points where difficulties remain the Commission is ready and willing to assist in finding solutions quickly. I am confident that we can work together to resolve the outstanding issues in the course of the codecision process. Indeed, the fact that the Commission can accept in whole or in part 85 of the 113 amendments shows our willingness to take on board Parliament's substantial policy contributions and our confidence that together we will be able to get this important programme off the ground as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
