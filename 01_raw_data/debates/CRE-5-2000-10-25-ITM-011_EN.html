<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Moreira da Silva (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, eight years on from Rio de Janeiro and three years on from Kyoto it is no exaggeration to say that the dossier on climate change has now reached its most critical moment, its real moment of truth, for two basic reasons: first, because at an institutional level COP-6, which will take place in The Hague this November, is to draw up the Kyoto Protocol in its final form and initiate the Protocol ratification stage so that it can come into force by the ‘Rio Plus Ten’ Conference, i.e. by 2002. Secondly it is a critical moment because, at a domestic level, we are moving further away instead of getting closer to the reduction targets agreed at Kyoto, because of the failure by Member States to implement policies and measures on, for instance, energy efficiency, the promotion of renewable energy sources and taxation on energy and greenhouse gases.</p>
<p class="contents">In this extraordinarily challenging context, we applaud the Commission’s initiative in bringing out together the Green Paper on emissions trading and the communication ‘Towards a European climate change programme’. Even though the substance of the proposals deserves a few comments and a few criticisms, as you will see, the truth is that this initiative has sent out two incontrovertible political signals. To the outside world it has regenerated the European Union’s capacity for leadership. Within the Union it has taught us a lesson about meeting commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us begin by examining the Green Paper on ‘emissions trading’. This Green Paper has opened the debate on the architecture of a future emissions trading system within the European Union. To start the system off, the Commission has defined a hard core of premises: the system should be based on a ‘learning by doing’ approach, it should start in 2005, and during an initial stage it should be restricted to carbon dioxide and major point sources.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, and this is reflected in the report, the establishment of a system of this kind within the European Union from 2005 has undeniable benefits. Let me highlight three. First, this system will allow industries, companies and Member States to gain practical experience and prepare themselves economically for the 2008 launch of the emissions trading system at an international level. Secondly, this system will help provide an easier remedy to the situation that most Member States are in today of not meeting their targets. Thirdly, the system will enable us to make huge reductions, in the order of billions of euros per year, in the costs of implementing the Community’s Kyoto commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the merits of this initiative and the technical quality of the Green Paper, on which we congratulate the Commission, the coverage of certain points is rather limited. Thus the task of this report has been to extend the debate begun by the Green Paper in both breadth and depth. That is our task.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me highlight six points from my considerations. One: the Green Paper should have set quantified targets for greenhouse gas reduction to be attained by the emissions trading system; in other words, the Green Paper should have said what percentage of greenhouse gas reduction would be allocated to emissions trading. Two: I believe the Green Paper should not have avoided carrying out an analysis into the possibility that the emissions trading system might give nuclear energy a competitive advantage. Three: I believe it is essential that the system should in future embrace certain sectors that the Green Paper has ruled out for now, especially transport, which is the sector in which emissions are growing the fastest. Four: in the debate on the scope of the system, the Commission should not have set direct emissions trading between companies as the only possible option. There are other options, and I hope the Commission will soon consider all the alternatives. Five: I believe it is crucial to involve the countries applying for membership of the European Union in the emissions trading system as soon as possible. To this end I invite the Commission to present a plan in a forthcoming communication specifying how those countries can be brought into the emissions trading system. Lastly, point six: I believe that, with regard to the method of allocating emissions licences, auctions could more easily ensure the desired environmental result, non-distortion of competition and the simplicity of the system than ‘grandfathering’ could. But this is not the appropriate moment to exclude any method, and so I invite the Commission to continue its deliberations and to include a third option, too: benchmarking.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us now examine the communication on the European climate change programme. In view of the commitment and quality of the Green Paper on emissions trading, the communication on policies and measures, the communication ‘Towards a European climate change programme’ is a disappointment. It is a disappointment because it results in the role of policies and measures, in other words, the role of domestic and Community political action, being sidelined in favour of market mechanisms. It is also a disappointment because this communication results in an unbalanced treatment of the various economic sectors; in particular it was hoped that those sectors that were not included in the emissions trading system might see the approval of an ambitious approach with well-defined commitments in the other communication, the one on policies and measures. I therefore call on the Commission to conclude the European climate change programme, the ICCP, with some urgency and to submit, six months after COP-6, a set of specific proposals on policies and measures defining quantitative commitments on the reduction of greenhouse gases for each economic sector and for each policy and measure.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me very briefly say a few words about the forthcoming United Nations conference, COP-6, which will take place in The Hague this November. The difficulty with COP-6 is not just a result of the complexity of the Kyoto leftovers but also of the political situation in the United States. Note that, regardless of the result of the American elections, it will be Bill Clinton and Al Gore who will be negotiating the Kyoto Protocol in The Hague. So we face some extremely worrying scenarios. If Bush wins, all the agreements we make in The Hague with the Clinton administration may be totally ignored by the new administration. If Al Gore wins, there is nothing to prevent it continuing to be very difficult to find the two-thirds majority in the Senate needed to ratify the Protocol. I therefore think that the European Union should not give up its negotiating agenda. The European Union has a good negotiating agenda and should not give it up. If we give it up in the hope of reaching an agreement with the United States, we risk ending up with a lose-lose result: we will have weakened the text of the Protocol and, what is more, it may even fail to be ratified by the United States. That is why we have to give signs of opening up towards Russia, Canada, Japan, Norway and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to close, Mr President, by thanking all the Members, particularly the draftsmen of opinions and shadow draftsmen, for having made it possible to reach a broad consensus on the strategy for halting climate change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to see the Green Paper on greenhouse gas emissions trading against this backdrop. The Green Paper constitutes the first step towards establishing an instrument which is in conformity with the market, which prescribes a ceiling for emission levels and which, in time, will offer very efficient and effective opportunities to reduce these emission levels. In this way, there is a chance that the European Union will still manage to fulfil its obligations with regard to the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs endorses the thrust of the Green Paper. It does, however, set great store by a solid basis for the trading system, which must be simple and transparent to the participants and underpinned by sound market institutions. Otherwise, the system will expire through a lack of faith on the part of the market operators.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the system must be competitively neutral on behalf of the companies involved. In this respect, we have serious objections to a few paragraphs in the present motion for a resolution, for these aim to distort competition through an inconsistent adoption of the sector-by-sector approach. The result of the rapporteur’s approach is that companies from the same sector in the various Member States may be treated unequally. After all, a lorry driver will not compete with a chemical company but rather with lorry drivers from other Member States. I hope that this misunderstanding can be put right with a number of amendments. I am interested to see if Commissioner Wallström will also be in favour of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, we want a cleaner environment. This can be achieved by the introduction of tradable emission rights without directly interfering in the economic structures. In the final analysis, we should fulfil our collective responsibility to manage God’s creation in a responsible manner and without any hesitation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The subject of emissions trading entered the debate on climate as part of the so-called flexible mechanisms. The European Union did not actually want these to be included in the selection, but they are now part of an international agreement, and regulations are being drafted in The Hague for these flexible mechanisms, of which the trade-off in emissions is an important one.</p>
<p class="contents">As the EU has been a leading force in these international discussions until now, we must all certainly hope that this position of leadership will be kept up, and we place our trust in the Commission in this. For this reason, the European Union has decided to propose that we should adopt a system of trade-offs in greenhouse gas emissions within the Union as from 2005, and this is therefore different from what the Kyoto Protocol itself makes possible, which is that the international emissions trading is to start as from 2008. But within the European Union this system can be tried out and it can be developed. The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market therefore also welcomes the Commission’s Green Paper and the fact that a framework directive is to be drafted based upon it. This emissions trading operation, to be carried out at EU level, is absolutely justified, as, otherwise, competition will be distorted. I wish, on behalf of the committee, to focus attention on the fact that a lot can certainly be done through a system of trading, but not everything. It is very important that emission trading are one of various ways to solve the problem, the most important of which are financial control mechanisms. It is also very important that the trade in emissions is monitored effectively, and I believe that we will also need environmental inspectors, which is the subject of talks we are now conducting with the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we also believe that it should only apply to 50% of the total reduction in emissions. The key point about emissions trading is that in future not only electricity and gas will have a price, but also CO2. That sounds very simple, but it means a total revolution in the energy business, in the energy sector. We need to be aware of that. It will have enormous consequences and I am convinced that it can also help to reduce emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the likely scenario for the next few years? I hope that following successful completion of the negotiations in The Hague, the European Union will ratify the Kyoto Protocol. That means that we will be legally committing ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The next thing required is for the Commission to bring forward a directive sharing the burden among the 15 Member States. So we need quotas. But these quotas must be linked with sanctions, otherwise they will be meaningless. In other words we will then have a common energy policy via environment policy, which would be a very circuitous route. We could then start emissions trading within the European Union in 2005. Once more, I hope that we will be able to adhere to this scenario, more or less, and that we will not let ourselves be put off by the fact that others, perhaps even the United States, will not have signed it for the time being. We should support the Commission here and present a united front as far as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Climate change is evident all over the world and we in Europe are not so badly off as those in other regions – I have in mind the West Coast of America and also Bangladesh. But the latest disasters in Italy, especially in the Valle d'Aosta, and in Switzerland, have demonstrated that there can even be terrible disasters here now, disasters for which the local population has virtually no responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">We now need to implement the Kyoto objectives and the next climate change summit in The Hague must go further than our efforts so far. Since it is also clear that CO2 bears most responsibility for climate change and traffic is increasing further, what we need above all are concrete proposals for limiting urban traffic, and for appropriate taxation of transit traffic or for suitable road pricing arrangements. We now need measures that go beyond emissions trading, so as to come to grips with all of this.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to question or attack mobility, it is something we need, but we must change traffic patterns, and emissions trading must not mean that we stop discussing other concrete measures. We in Europe are in the vanguard of environmental policy and if we want to maintain our credibility then we must go further than is proposed in the White Paper today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jackson (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I want to put on record the European Parliament's concern and apprehension on the subject of the Hague Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, as was mentioned earlier, there is the question of the participation of MEPs in the conference at all. Whatever European Union policies flow from this conference at The Hague will have to come to this Parliament for debate, amendment and agreement, that is the European policies. National policies, whatever they are, will have to go through national parliaments, but we will have a hand in agreeing whatever comes forward as a European Union policy as a consequence of The Hague.</p>
<p class="contents">So far our promised participation in the EU delegation has been limited to three parliamentarians. At the same time the exact nature of parliamentary participation is very unclear. We would like to be able to send a bigger delegation. We realise that COREPER is going to wrestle with this next week but we look forward to hearing any news from the Commissioner on this.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also like our representatives to be briefed before the conference. I hope we can have a full briefing from the Commissioner, we will hear about that in a moment, and to receive all necessary briefing during it. But that is not all: we need our representatives to be present at all the EU delegation meetings, including those where tactics and policy are discussed. We do not believe that in asking for this we are asking for too much. Given our involvement in the making of European Union law it is absurd for the Commission and Council to keep the negotiations to themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the question of how far the industrialised countries, including the United States, are really sincere about COP6 and the ratification of Kyoto. Do they, and in all honesty do we, really want to go forward or are we about to witness a slamming on of the brakes? We already seem to have devastating evidence of the impact of climate change, yet, when members of the Committee on the Environment had a recent meeting with members of the United States Congress, fortunately via a video link, the impression they gained was that Congress will not agree to the ratification of Kyoto. Now, if the United States cannot agree such pro-environment measures when its economy is prospering to such a great extent, what chance will we have another time, when things may not look so good?</p>
<p class="contents">We would welcome the Commission's views on how far the Americans are likely to sabotage The Hague Conference, and what we may salvage from the wreck. If the United States gives strong signals that it will not, ever, ratify Kyoto without the participation of the major developing countries, then what prospect is there that we could put together a coalition of countries that will ratify, and what danger is there that we would then put the European Union at an economic disadvantage?</p>
<p class="contents">We would also like to hear from the Commission a clear timetable of its plans for climate change measures next year. I realise that this may mean lifting the veil on the 6th Environment Action Programme, but this would be an opportune moment to clarify the broad lines of what we may expect.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, given that we know the causes of climate change, or are fairly clear that we know the causes of climate change, future generations will hardly forgive us for being so slow to deal with it. Governments are afraid to tax fuel for fear of not being re-elected. That is human and perhaps unavoidable. But we could at least devote more resources to developing alternative, renewable energy sources, and to making them into real alternative options soon. How sad it is that last year we actually cut the European Union fund for renewables, SAVE, to which we now devote a fraction of the money spent on subsidising tobacco. Future generations will not forgive us for that, and future generations will be right.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Let me first of all thank the rapporteur, Mr Moreira Da Silva, who has produced two excellent reports on our current climate change strategy. Let me also express my appreciation for the continued importance the European Parliament attaches to the global problem of climate change. I welcome the comprehensive debate on this issue today. This debate is particularly opportune as key decisions are to be taken only four weeks from now at the sixth conference of the parties to the Convention on Climate Change – the so-called COP6 – in The Hague.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the European Union strongly supports the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol by 2002 at the latest, which will mean Rio plus ten years. The European Union intends to ratify the protocol as soon as COP6 is successfully concluded with decisions that safeguard the environmental integrity and credibility of the protocol. To achieve this, it is essential for the European Union to play a strong and proactive leadership role. In this regard I would summarise the main objectives of the EU for COP6 as follows.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we need to ensure that action is taken at home by industrialised countries. Industrialised countries emit most greenhouse gases and have a responsibility to show leadership in tackling climate change. The outcome at COP6 should ensure this by balancing the use of Kyoto mechanisms such as emissions trading with domestic action – supplementarity – and by addressing the need to demonstrate progress on policies for reducing emissions by 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need to make sure that the Kyoto targets are respected. Industrialised countries agreed on reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol. To ensure these targets are met we need to agree at COP6 on a solid framework of rules for the Kyoto mechanisms and a strong and effective compliance system. These are necessary to make the mechanisms work effectively because markets can only work efficiently in a solid institutional framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, with regard to keeping the targets meaningful, the European Union has serious concerns about the inclusion of sinks because of the scientific and other uncertainties and risks associated with them. It also has concerns about the potential scale of sinks because this affects the need for action by industrialised countries to reduce their emissions. Unless these concerns are met, we cannot agree to include additional forestry and land use activities other than afforestation, deforestation and reforestation. Sinks should not be included in the CDM – the clean development mechanism – because this is a mechanism that should be used to bring social and economic development to countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we need to address the needs of developing countries and the economies in transition by promoting capacity building, transfer of technology and assistance for adaptation.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, the needs of the least developed countries merit particular attention. At COP6 we should develop these issues and agree that the clean development mechanism should be based on safe, environmentally sound technologies which will help these countries develop in a less polluting way.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the participation of Members of the European Parliament in the Community delegation to COP6. A final decision concerning the number of MEPs to attend COP6 is expected by 31 October; the Commission has proposed that the European Parliament be represented by eight Members. Taking into account the institutional rules for such participation, these Members can attend plenary meetings, and I can assure you that my staff and I will do our utmost to inform all Members present at COP6 on the negotiations which are not open to observers, on a regular basis. I can also give a commitment to organise an appropriate briefing before COP6 starts, maybe between 7 and 11 November, if possible – we will try to arrange that in the best possible way.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also comment on the question about ratification without the United States. The European Union is very committed to the ratification and entry into force of the protocol by 2002 at the latest. On every occasion we urge the other parties, particularly the US and Russia, also to start preparing for ratification. While theoretically the protocol can enter into force without the US ratifying, it would clearly be the second best option not to have the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases included in the regime. Also, this would most likely have significant effects for EU competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to note that the Commission is supported by Parliament and the Council in its efforts to build up an effective European climate change programme. The opinion of the European Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on this programme stresses that policies and measures should be the priority of EU climate change strategy. It is important that this strategy is endorsed by all stakeholders and that is why the Commission has embarked on this multi-stakeholder process in the framework of the climate change programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The Environment Council recently adopted conclusions on policies and measures to limit emissions of greenhouse gases, confirming the choices made in the framework of the European climate change programme.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time they indicate some specific priorities in the transport, energy efficiency and industry sectors that should be developed, taking into account the environmental impact and cost-effectiveness of these measures. These suggestions will be carefully considered in the ongoing work in the European Climate Change Programme. As you know, the programme is up and running and the six existing working groups – flexible mechanisms, energy supply, energy consumption, transport, industry and research have been operational since last June. Right from the start the European Climate Change Programme has been a challenging integration exercise bringing together Commission services, industry, NGOs and national experts. The first impression is certainly positive after the first four months. A constructive attitude has developed in the different groups.</p>
<p class="contents">A progress report on this programme will be the basis for my oral presentation at the special Climate Council on 7 November. Despite the very short time available, the programme is already suggesting a first list of likely measures in all the relevant sectors. The promotion of combined heat and power and of renewables, the encouragement of the switch to fuels with a low carbon content, support for energy efficiency in buildings, awareness-raising in transport, improvements in light-duty vehicles, measures to control leakage and the recovery of fluorinated gases are among the preliminary proposals emerging from the European Climate Change Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of its consultative process, by next summer, the Climate Change Programme will have given impetus and will have accelerated existing proposals. But, at the same time, it will have promoted new ideas. Therefore, this Climate Change Programme is a unique opportunity to bring together all the elements of an ambitious EU climate change strategy and the Commission will follow-up by finalising the most promising proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Green Paper on emissions trading, I would like to thank Members for having considered it so substantively. The Commission is eager to hear the views of stakeholders and of course those of the European Parliament. Differences of opinion on the details should be expected when approaching a new instrument in environment policy and I warmly welcome the supportive and constructive attitude that Parliament has taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Emissions trading is a new concept and there is understandable mistrust in some quarters. I hope that the Green Paper has gone some way towards overcoming this mistrust.</p>
<p class="contents">Emissions trading within the European Union would be another policy measure that would coexist with other policy measures that are now in place or are being developed by the Commission in the context of the Climate Change programme. The Commission is not putting all its eggs in one basket. Significantly reducing emissions will require a whole range of policies and measures. For the purposes of furthering the discussions within the European Union, the Commission outlined a vision of how emissions trading would work. It was most certainly not a definitive outline. While it might be felt that the Green Paper was weighted towards given options, the Commission's motives are primarily to have an open mind towards this new instrument and to advocate a prudent, cautious, stepwise development of emissions trading within the EU. It was this caution that prevented the Commission from envisaging from the outset that all greenhouse gases and other sectors, including the transport and household sectors, should be subject to emissions trading.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately a scheme that is shown to work can be extended, but first the system has to prove itself. I do not think that emissions trading favours nuclear power more than any of the other climate change measures that are being considered within the European climate change programme. It is not envisaged that nuclear power will be included in an emissions trading scheme. The case for getting started by 2005 remains as strong as ever so that the Community can benefit from learning and by doing. Indeed Member States are already moving and the Community's common interest should be kept at the forefront of our minds. Moreover, it is my intention – and I have already had talks on this last October – to involve the central and eastern European countries in any future emissions trading regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the responses to the Green Paper that have been received so far – about 50 in number – reflect the high level of interest in this instrument. Opinions on what to do next vary and the Commission will decide how to move forward within the next few months, after the submissions have been analysed in more detail and when we know the results of COP6. It has always been and remains the Commission's wish that whatever the Community does on emissions trading should be fully compatible with the Kyoto Protocol's emissions trading system when it comes into effect. As you know, the EU system would come into force in 2005 while the Kyoto international trading would not come into force until later.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I can express general support for your resolutions and I should once again like to express my thanks and appreciation for the constructive efforts made by Parliament to raise awareness of climate change and the support it gives to the Commission on implementation.</p>

We are acquiring the habit of describing our times in dramatic language: verbs such as to overflow, to flood, to burst banks, are part of a vocabulary which is becoming almost the norm. We feel that this is a dramatic consequence of the climate change taking place and that the social and economic system must provide some sort of response to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Even the climate experts tell us that the very meteorology of our regions is changing. The exceptional amount of rain which has fallen over the last few days has served to offset the prevailing drought of the past year. We are told that the drought trend will continue into the years to come and worsen as time goes by, unavoidably interspersed<span class="bold"> </span>with the odd deluge and resulting floods. And so, now that, sadly, our dead have been buried, the journalists have left the devastated areas and the river, in this case the Po – I live by the Po – is again taking its normal course, it is time, as we say in Italy, to put up our umbrellas, not to appear prophets of doom but to evaluate once again the requirements and the remedies.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, a great deal of progress had been made in recent years in the area of alert and alarm measures, which have made it possible to keep the scale of the disasters in check, but although this is important, it cannot be considered a primary factor. We need a defence policy dedicated purely to following up the recommendations of the experts. We need to be making political and regional planning decisions that protect the earth even when the sun is shining.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore stress a few points. The first concerns the approach to man's built environment, which must not be overlooked. Construction must be oriented towards ever more stringent application of planning rules, standards and controls. In particular, there must be greater emphasis on man's agricultural environment. In the recent flooding of the Po, farmland acted as a floodway, protecting the urban centres, and agriculture channelled off the floodwater, bearing the brunt of it itself in order to protect built-up areas. Therefore, we must reaffirm the role of agriculture as the protector of the environment, a role which is wont to be sidelined, overlooked and undervalued on sunny days. There is no provision in agricultural or environmental policy or in town and country planning for this role played by agriculture. Europe needs to pinpoint appropriate forms of coordination in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hulthén (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, there are three important documents we have to discuss today concerning one of the greatest challenges by far that we face, that is to say climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">For a northerner from an area where the temperature at this time of year rarely exceeds seven degrees and where it pours with rain, the thought of a warmer climate perhaps appears attractive at first sight. It is not as simple as that, however. The climate changes we face are hardly positive in their implications for any of us. Instead, the scenario is exactly as it was described just recently: full of storms, rain and floods. To these must be added changes to the flora and fauna. Life will have changed out of recognition, and it will scarcely be very pleasant either.</p>
<p class="contents">The three documents on climate change which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has dealt with may be regarded as documents representing different periods of time. The resolution on the conference in The Hague is that which is closest to us in time. It presents the view of those of us in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and hopefully also the view of the European Union, of what we think must happen in The Hague. It has been characterised by considerable unity, which is a good foundation to have now that the conference in The Hague is beginning. The resolution signals a clear need for the Kyoto Protocol to be signed and for it being the industrialised countries which must head up the efforts to halt climate change. It also emphasises very clearly that the flexible mechanisms must only be complementary to the national measures adopted. I am glad to hear that this is also Commissioner Wallström’s view.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has given a clear message that we do not consider three representatives from the European Parliament at the conference in The Hague to be sufficient. I am also pleased that Mrs Wallström says that the Commission’s proposal is for eight representatives. The European Parliament and those within Parliament who work on environmental issues must be taken seriously at some stage and not only be used along the lines of figureheads when it is convenient. When regular meetings and regular updates during the conference in The Hague are talked about, it is also important to emphasise that these must be constructive. It is important that MEPs’ viewpoints should also be taken on board so that it is not just a case of one-way communication.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution on emissions trading is a good document, but it has been further improved following the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. The most important additions include the clear indication, exactly as found in the COP 6 document, that emissions trading itself must not represent more than 50 per cent of the measures to reduce emissions. It is also important that measurable objectives be required for each country and for each sector. There must also be legally binding measures obliging the Member States to comply with their quotas.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a certain amount of concern about the fact that certain sectors have been left out of the Green Paper, for example the transport sector. We presume that this work will be included in the next document, concerning the strategy and measures to be adopted by the EU to reduce emissions, and that the transport sector will not be forgotten when we discuss climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">The message is very clear: the principle must be that <span class="italic">all </span>emissions, no matter what their origin, must be covered by some instrument of control, be it in the form of emission rights or of legislation, but there must be practical limits and instruments of control for each type of emission.</p>
<p class="contents">Many have had doubts about the proposal for emissions trading, especially when it comes to the socio-economic consequences. The fear, quite simply, is of a loss of employment and a concern that companies will play different industries off against each other. I believe we have taken account of these doubts and of this concern in paragraph 13 of this resolution, and I hope that this will reassure at least some of those who have felt concern. I want to emphasise that there is an obvious mistake in the Swedish version of this paragraph. Only half of the amendment published in the Swedish document has been adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">The third document is perhaps the most important in the long term. It deals with the strategy and measures to be adopted by the EU in order to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. It also concerns what is really required, namely to change our own way of life if anything is to be achieved. This is a welcome document. It would have been still more welcome if it had been clearer and more practical, but we hope it will be clearer following the amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Christened Josephine by the German meteorologists, this cyclone struck north-west Italy, especially my region, Valle d’Aosta, causing tremendous devastation. In three or four days, between 500 and 700 mm of rain fell over a total area of 10 000 km2, which is roughly equivalent to the entire rainfall for one year. Terror struck Valle d’Aosta and the other regions and countries affected, which this terrible ordeal has placed in a veritable state of emergency, facing a long, costly list of damages.</p>
<p class="contents">So, why does the European Union exist, if not to make us change our lifestyle and, above all, to understand the cycles that modify climatological conditions, to harness the necessary European funds to respond to the demands meet the acute need for intervention in the mountainous regions of Europe. If we do not intervene, we unfortunately run the risk that these floods will recur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over the past one thousand years, we have seen a drop in the temperature by one-fifth of a degree. But over the past fifty years, it has become one and a half degrees warmer. This warming process is accelerating all the time. Many citizens like the idea of a climate one or two degrees warmer, but the warm Gulf Stream which is giving us a pleasant climate at the moment could turn at any time. Europe would then acquire a climate like that in Canada, where, for many weeks during winter, the temperature is between –20 to –30.</p>
<p class="contents">We need radical measures to stop global warming. The Kyoto Protocol is too restricted. The increase in air traffic in the next fifteen years alone will cancel out the reductions achieved via the Kyoto Protocol. China is already emitting more greenhouse gases than is sustainable. We cannot turn a blind eye to this.</p>
<p class="contents">After 2020, developing countries too are supposed to fight greenhouse gases, but on an equal footing. Each world citizen has the same right to emit CO2. American citizens should not be entitled to emit two hundred times more CO2 than people in East Africa. On the basis of equity, the international trade in CO2 certificates is supposed to be going ahead after 2008. Only on this basis will developing countries, such as China and India, get involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Opting in The Hague for the American line of grandfathering will block this route. Energy efficiency and renewable energy sources are the way forward, both in the North and in the South, and not 25 cm high bushes, as the Australian government is proposing, or other forest projects which cannot be verified.</p>
<p class="contents">Subsidising nuclear energy with Clean Development Mechanism funding is not the answer either. That would be perverse at a time when America and Europe are doing nothing but closing down nuclear power stations. Fortunately, our ministers and the Commission are on the right side. I wish them tenacity on behalf of my group.</p>
<p class="contents">The swift ratification of the Kyoto Protocol is the right way forward. We should not rely on the American Senate. After ratification, CO2 emission will have a price tag. At present, it is still free to the large industries and the electricity producers in Europe, which are, together, responsible for 45% of CO2 emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Green Paper on greenhouse gas emissions trading within Europe is an excellent initiative. Europe must make every effort to achieve this 8% objective. I would call on the European Commission to come up with extra proposals to curtail emissions in the transport sector. Only if we achieve this 8% objective can we be credible. And only then are climatic breakthroughs at world level possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not, of course, because we do not know what changes are required, but because the necessary changes would have such massive repercussions upon the whole of our transport and energy policy and, in point of fact, upon our whole method of consuming. We face completely fundamental social changes if we are to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the most developed countries – the countries with the highest economic standards and the highest per capita emissions of greenhouse gases – which have the biggest responsibility for taking the lead where reductions in greenhouse gases are concerned. In the run-up to the conference in The Hague, it therefore appears absolutely crucial to involve the United States in an agreement which leads both to real progress and to a situation in which the Kyoto Protocol can be ratified.</p>
<p class="contents">A responsible policy on the part of the most developed countries must be based upon those countries’ being able to reduce their own emissions. If there is to be a place for emissions trading, which is something I am very doubtful about, the latter should only constitute a minor part of the policy as a whole, in which case any such trading must also be strictly controlled, with consideration given to the social dimension and to the opportunities for developing countries to make further progress in the future. This system may entail very large risks in the future if Russia and the developing countries are included in the emissions trading and the practice becomes global. However, there are other types of flexible mechanism which can be used to advantage at a global level.</p>
<p class="contents">Emissions and abatements trading are no substitute for the real changes required. The same applies, of course, to nuclear power. Instead, we need a vigorous policy to promote lower energy use, renewable energy sources, alternative fuels and effective environmental taxes on methods of transport. It is mainly the responsibility of the individual Member States to implement these measures. Where tax is concerned, a common minimum tax is to be desired. If it is not possible to agree upon a tax on greenhouse gases within the EU, those countries which are prepared to take the lead ought in any case to get together and introduce such a tax.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to Mr Moreira Da Silva’s reports, we agree with the content of most of the paragraphs, but we are more sceptical about emissions trading. A system of that kind may be an interesting experiment at EU level, but it is no substitute for other measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This year, Italy suffered first the tragedy in Calabria and then the current colossal tragedy, which has claimed over 25 deaths and left over 45 thousand homeless in the north. The Valle d'Aosta, Piedmont and many areas of the Po Valley and Lombardy were particularly hard hit. Last year, the tragedy in France destroyed hundred-year-old forests: an immeasurable loss for mankind.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, five years ago, Italy suffered another great flood. Houses, bridges, roads, factories, shops and entire villages were destroyed on that occasion too. At the time, in my capacity as an MEP and member of the Alleanza Nazionale party, I asked the Commission to immediately prepare a measure identifying the areas at risk from flooding and to draw up a hydrogeological map of the regions of the European Union. Five years have passed, we are discussing another flood and there is still no hydrogeological map. Europe has done absolutely nothing to intervene and it has not put any pressure on the national States to change and improve the situations in the individual countries either.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now proposing this map again, in the hope that we will not still be here, five years from now, counting bodies and reproaching ourselves for not having done our duty: a map of the areas of the European Union at risk, a directive laying down safety standards for buildings constructed beside rivers and streams, establishing operating criteria for forest management and preventing the working of mines and quarries in sites which are at risk, with penalties for those who authorise them and those who exploit them. We have to realise that preventing hazards which contribute to ecological change is the best way to protect the environment. This development, rural development included, must be environmentally friendly, for what is environmentally friendly is human-friendly as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Padania, which is the most advanced geopolitical and cultural area in Europe, has suffered tragic flooding that has taken a huge toll on human life and property. The Italian government, which has set aside ridiculously small sums given the scale of the disaster – of which, moreover, warning was given – in a key production area for Italy and Europe, is treating these hard-working people inappropriately, irresponsibly and inefficiently, as it did the people affected by the earthquakes in Umbria and southern Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">No preventive or hydrogeological work of substance has been carried out thus far. Europe must provide a guarantee, it must call upon the Italian government to recognise the full scale of the damage suffered by the undertakings – which must, moreover, be exempted from paying any form of tax relating to this – and the citizens who, with the aid of a hard-working, exemplary Padanian volunteer force, immediately set to work to restore a semblance of normality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Climate protection is not a marginal subject for environment freaks, it is one of the greatest challenges of our time. The dreadful storms and floods which have ravaged Europe and the rest of the world in recent months should be a wake-up call for us all. Nearly all the scientific experts are telling us that these storms and floods will dramatically increase if we do not achieve a marked reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. So climate protection also makes good economic sense. That is why it makes me angry that when climate protection and the challenges it involves are being discussed people often just say what they do not want, and not what they really do want. There is a lack of alternatives, a lack of constructive debate.</p>
<p class="contents">A lot of people say that we do not want nuclear energy, at any cost. Others say that we definitely do not want tax measures. However, I believe that we must use every possible means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It also makes me angry that when Member States discuss national eco-taxes, although these national instruments are quite rightly criticised, few positive suggestions are made to replace them. And that is the reason why on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party I have tabled an amendment calling for a European climate tax which covers all greenhouse gases and is revenue-neutral. We have a chance to correct the mistakes made at national level and to give a positive signal on behalf of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People's Party also considers that nuclear energy will be indispensable at least for the next few decades if we are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Abandoning nuclear energy, as is planned in some Member States, who are actually going ahead with that, gives exactly the wrong signal, because nuclear power stations emit considerably less greenhouse gases than fossil fuels. Before we abandon nuclear, we have to say how we intend to reduce greenhouse gases. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, I have been following the debate on climate change in this House since 1995. What I have observed since then is that Parliament has made certain concessions here, but always against the tactical background that we want the country with the highest CO2 emissions to come on board as regards Kyoto. So we have gone along with this and said that we accept emissions trading. We are in favour of it in principle and we have made many more concessions. At some point the hurdle will be so low that I can honestly say that I cannot lower it any further. It will not be possible to make any more concessions. That is why I believe that in future negotiations we should really concentrate on the idea that if the USA cannot initiate the ratification process, then we ourselves should enter into agreements with other countries, as ultimately ratification without the USA is not impossible if we are at long last to make some progress here.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot keep making concessions until there are no more to be made if we are not certain that Congress will eventually give its approval. Commissioner, I of course heard your speech about the European Climate Change Programme, the ECCP. It was a rather bland speech about what we could all do and how marvellous that would be. I seem to have heard a lot of bland speeches like that over the last few years!</p>
<p class="contents">In the end, I would far rather do battle alongside you for highly specific measures such as a switch to renewables. There is a proposal to that effect on the table, but I wonder just what the Commission's policy really is when I see the Directorate-General for Competition frustrating this proposal to promote renewables using funds from environmental aid scheme, perhaps to the point of destroying it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to fight alongside you to achieve a standard for low-energy housing. And I would like to battle alongside you to achieve a tax regime to promote cars with low fuel consumption. So how about finally forgetting those bland speeches, rolling up our sleeves and really getting something done! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We do not want to be squeezed out as Members were who attended the World Health Organisation conference recently.</p>
<p class="contents">We see ourselves working together at a set of European institutions fighting to improve the situation and ensure that the Kyoto Protocol is ratified. Compare, after all, our common agreement with the experience we had just recently at that tele-conferencing session with members of the US Congress, which frankly was a very depressing experience. The chairman of the Health Science Committee spelt out, from the American point of view, that this was an economic issue, not an environmental one. That really spells out the differences between the approach of the United States representatives and those of this Parliament. There was no recognition of the need to make sacrifices or to accept that we have historic responsibilities on both sides of the Atlantic as the largest emitters of greenhouse gases.</p>
<p class="contents">For all our good intentions, however, it looks as though in the European Union far from cutting CO2 emissions by the end of this decade we shall end up increasing them. So the prospects for COP6 look poor, but the prospects of our meeting our goals even with Kyoto do not look that good either. That is not helped by governments across the European Union responding to calls to cut fuel prices. If we are serious about the environment, these must be resisted. We should not be cutting fuel tax.</p>
<p class="contents">I say "yes" to emissions trading – let us get on with it. Let us also hurry up with the measures we need to take in each Member State cutting traffic emissions, increasing energy efficiency, promoting renewables and CHP. The sad truth is we will not succeed in preventing climate change anyway, but if we do not start taking action now, the problems will become all the worse. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that European environment ministers have so far adopted the very wise approach of excluding it from the list of flexible mechanisms. Nuclear power is more expensive than other options, such as energy efficiency, for example, and every dollar that is invested in nuclear power is denied to other investments that are much more profitable.</p>
<p class="contents">Nuclear power does not really meet the needs of people, who also want to live in heated or air-conditioned homes, depending on the climatic zones in which they live. Nuclear power does not provide a single solution. But solutions can be found in cogeneration, based on biomass or gas. Nuclear power is still dangerous. The accident at Tokaimura clearly showed this. And fifty years after the start of civil nuclear power, there are still no solutions as to what do with nuclear waste. We have already invested billions in research and we still have not made any progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I fervently believe that we must appreciate the importance of energy efficiency. We can help the Chinese, the Indians, Indonesia and the Pakistanis much more by giving them the means to buy refrigerators that do not consume much energy, because there will be 800 million refrigerators over the next ten years. That is what will dictate the CO2 emissions of developing countries, rather than the two, three, four or five nuclear reactors that could be sold to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although three years have already passed since the Kyoto Conference and the commitment to reduce greenhouse gases by 8% in comparison with 1990 levels, and as the European Environment Agency has reminded us, if very specific political measures are not taken, this reduction will not take place; on the contrary, greenhouse gases will increase by 6%. It should be considered that emissions from transport could increase the most rapidly, potentially rising by up to 39% by the year 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">I also share the rapporteur's concern for specific policies and measures to take priority over emissions trading, which should be ancillary to them.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not entirely share Mr Liese's faith and enthusiasm regarding nuclear energy. I consider, like the Member who spoke earlier, that nuclear energy poses unresolved problems, and the fact that the Commissioner said nuclear energy will not be promoted in the proposals currently being studied reassured me.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, we believe that the priority for the European Union must be specific measures and policies and the definition of a European programme on climate change, which must also have specific objectives and aims, and it worries us that this is not the philosophy that will be advocated at the forthcoming Hague Conference.</p>

<p class="contents">With regard to the second report, I consider that emissions trading should be approached as an instrument with which to facilitate the fulfilment of obligations under the Kyoto Convention. Various attitudes have been adopted in the face of this flexible mechanism: expectant, reactive or active. I think that from both the economic and environmental point of view we must adopt an active stance. Reasons for this include the realistic consideration that this will enable us to achieve short-term environmental goals by establishing specific reduction levels, and timetables for fulfilment. This is also an opportunity to encourage research and development in the field of new technologies for controlling pollution, contrary to the opinion of those who believe that this mechanism is a way of perpetuating the interests of the large polluting corporations.</p>
<p class="contents">If this tool is correctly applied, pollution will become more and more expensive and the market will ensure that products obtained through the least clean methods become obsolete. Likewise, making emissions the subject of trade will lead to greater control over them and, what is more, they will be documented. This will promote the development of activities with a less significant environmental impact.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that this mechanism is developed transparently as an integral part of the raft of measures that the Member States is to adopt within the context of the European climate change strategy. To this end, all the Member States must take great pains to communicate with the public so that it is clear from the outset which objectives are being pursued with this mechanism and what the benefits are, that these are always partial and complementary to other types of measure. In this way there can be no misunderstandings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But recently, in Italy too, the dramatic effects made themselves felt. The exact relationship between CO2 emissions and global warming is not yet entirely clear, but that should not prevent us from taking drastic measures now. The precautionary principle is applicable here.</p>
<p class="contents">According to experts, we need to reduce current CO2 emission levels by 60% in order to halt climate change. We are now working towards an 8% reduction, which is already quite a task. Although we are rightly investing in more sustainable energy and greater efficiency, our intentions are not new. Yet, we need to establish that our dependence on fossil fuels has hardly fallen since the 70s. We therefore need to employ all possible means and use them to the full. That translates into an unqualified ‘yes’ to the trade in emission rights, provided it is thought through properly.</p>
<p class="contents">We still need to find solutions to major economic and political problems. Emissions trading could lead to a new form of colonialism. It is easier for rich countries to buy reductions in developing countries and thus acquit themselves of their responsibilities without giving the matter another thought. Technological innovation will be curtailed as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">The success of emissions trading will therefore depend on the price. If the price is too low, the purchase of emission rights will be very attractive indeed. Its success will also depend on support. The trade in emissions must be fair and must be able to rely on a level playing field in the sectors involved. The market must be deployed in a bid to promote sustained growth as well as fair distribution. This requires clear political choices. The Climate Conference at The Hague presents an opportunity to take global steps, an opportunity which we should not let slip. We must not hide behind the unwillingness of the United States. Sound cooperation between rich and poor countries is needed to achieve climate objectives. We must lay down equitable points of departure. Equal emission rights for all global citizens is not only an equitable step, it is also effective. It is a means of involving developing countries and of promoting technological efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">The Hague must also set an agenda for the future, of which equal emission rights for all the citizens of the world must certainly form a part. I would like to conclude by thanking the rapporteur for his work and wish the Commission every success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My colleagues have referred to the catastrophes that are occurring in quick succession and which serve as warning lights that demand practical political intervention. We welcome the objective and clear-sighted findings of the report by Mr Moreira da Silva regarding the crucial issues and hopes, but also concerning the disillusionment and the renunciations that have infiltrated the battle line in the fight to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the most important stage will take place at The Hague in November. We will see whether or not the parties who committed themselves at Kyoto will exercise their responsibilities and meet the demands of the global issues that await us, which put us all in the same boat and spare no one.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people forecast a fiasco, however, and even an agreement on the cheap, which will sound the death knell of the Kyoto Protocol. We refuse to believe this hypothesis. The European Union delegation must stand firm. It should continue to be the leader, as it was in Kyoto, it should set an example, and it should not give way under any circumstances to the temptations of get-out clauses. Our mandate is clear and our demands are forceful. Ratifying the Kyoto Protocol is crucial, as is the implementation of domestic measures that will make a real contribution to the fight against greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us hope that the European Council does not fall into the traps that have been set for it. The European Union must refuse to integrate nuclear power, even if there is strong pressure in favour of mechanisms for clean development. Nuclear power is neither a sustainable energy nor a clean one.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be just as unacceptable to admit carbon sinks among the flexibility measures. It would be particularly improper and fallacious to make citizens believe that it is enough simply to plant trees to comply with the commitments undertaken at Kyoto. With 80% of its electricity coming from nuclear power and with an extensive covering of forest, France, for example, has not achieved the undertakings it agreed to at Kyoto, which are nonetheless minimal at 0%. Action must be taken in other areas. The European Union does not have the right to shirk its commitments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their aim is that the EU will play a leading role in the international struggle to slow down climatic change. I believe that Mr Moreira da Silva’s work has furthered this aim.</p>
<p class="contents">According to an estimate made by the European Environment Agency, greenhouse gas emissions in the EU are expected to increase by 6% during the period 1990 – 2010. It also states in its appraisal that it is emissions from traffic that are clearly increasing most of all. Urban traffic in particular is the main focus for reducing carbon dioxide emissions from traffic. For that reason the committee is encouraging the Commission to make proposals in its new Green Paper to alter attitudes to transportation in densely built-up areas so that greenhouse gas emissions may be permanently reduced. The committee also considers it necessary to increase financial support for public transport and it criticised the Commission for the fact that policy and action in the EU strategy on a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions are of secondary importance. This is unacceptable if the EU really intends to lead the world in the process to slow down climatic change. The EU’s own input is vital, especially as the outcome of the sixth conference of the parties to the agreement cannot yet be certain.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, now I would like to put things very simply. I feel that we politicians still have not grasped how serious the situation is with regard to climatic change. As politicians, we are used to making compromises with regard to almost anything, and we have learnt that the world is shaped that way – shaped for compromise. But now we have before us a party we cannot negotiate with. Nature is a hard fact of life: it does not submit to agreement; it just is. This is such a simple fact that I almost feel ashamed to mention it, but I believe this is the main source of confusion in the way we think. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am one of the signatories to a joint resolution, to be put to the vote tomorrow, which calls upon the Commission to provide emergency funding from its own budget to orchestrate the operations planned by the national authorities in the areas affected by the floods. It calls upon the Commission to grant financial aid immediately to the sectors affected, under Article 87, Paragraph 2 of the EC Treaty, and to take into consideration the fact that a large proportion of the areas affected are eligible for assistance from the Community Structural Funds. This would represent a considerable contribution to reconstruction and, most importantly, prevention operations.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to this matter, it is vital for the Union not to restrict itself to making exceptional interventions once disasters have already occurred, as has already been said. I would emphasise, in particular, points 6, 7 and 8 of the joint resolution: Europe must call upon the Member States to update their laws on the environment, the abuse of planning permission, reforestation, the revitalisation of mountain areas and, in general, on the promotion of farming methods which are intended to protect and safeguard the land as well as yield increasing quantities of produce.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, an action of this scale cannot be effectively developed purely at national level, primarily because of the scale of the resources needed but also because of the very nature of the natural phenomena in question which, like those relating to climate change and damage arising from CO2 emissions, are in no way contained by borders.</p>
<p class="contents">In asking you to support our resolution, ladies and gentlemen, we are calling not merely for an urgent intervention to contribute to repairing the damage but for a longer-term policy which will make Europe an increasingly safer and more enjoyable place to live for its citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Failure to reach the targets is simply not an option. One estimate says that 10,000 people have been killed in the past two years because of the effects of climate change, the majority of them in the developing countries. We need a radical change of direction. We can, and must, adopt effective and innovative solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and at the same time protect our society and our jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Wales, which is the constituency I represent, is very dependent on manufacturing and heavy industry. Because the UK is introducing a climate change levy next April, I commissioned research on the effects of this on industry in my own constituency. The evidence suggests that not only could it keep Britain on track to meet its emissions target, but the levy could actually encourage a small increase in employment. Several economists have analysed the effects of this on a Europe-wide level, and have come to similar conclusions that there is, or could be, a beneficial effect on employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate has moved on and we need to look at reducing emissions, not as a threat, but as a challenge and an opportunity. I hope Parliament's demands which are set out in the reports before us are acted upon and that governments approach The Hague Conference in a positive way so we can see the Kyoto Protocol ratified in the near future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I own some woods in the United Kingdom, the economics of which in the present state of the economy are quite hopeless. Yet my trees, and those of many others, clean up CO2 emissions discharged by some of the wealthiest companies in the land.</p>
<p class="contents">No woodland owner gets a penny piece directly from this important social function and monetary payments for environmental permits and their trading must, it seems to me, have to work their way through to those who actually grow and manage the trees and not be expropriated by exchequers and others on the way. Obviously, unless forestry pays, nobody is going to plant the trees and if the trees are not planted they cannot clean up the CO2. In addition, it is quite wrong for the relatively poor industry to clean up the mess left by the relatively rich industry, free, gratis and for nothing. This in turn offers a potential further income stream for beleaguered farmers and others in the countryside to help rebuild its economic base, which at present, as we all know, is producing too much food at too high a price.</p>
<p class="contents">Agriculture is a multi-output industry and public expenditure may well be necessary to achieve the full range of public goods the industry can and should produce. Given the potential of biomass and other crops for energy generation and for the production of hydrogen, if one contrasts the quantity of money supporting the production of unwanted food, and compares that with support for these alternative outputs and their utilising technologies, the disparity is self-evident. There is a very strong case for rebalancing the figures because unless new, sustainable agricultural outputs are devised, farming and the countryside's problems can only get worse.</p>
<p class="contents">This is as much a matter of CAP reform as it is of environmental policy and it is only by drawing together the two that sensible progress can be made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the north of Italy and also in my own area – the Mediterranean coast of Spain – the forces of nature have once again unleashed themselves, leading to loss of life and the loss of possessions, in homes, factories and so forth.</p>
<p class="contents">On our coast, on the Spanish Mediterranean coast, this is the product of a phenomenon known as <span class="italic">la gota fría</span> (cold front), caused by the warming of the waters of the Mediterranean, which generates an increase in water vapour which, upon contact with the cold layers of the stratosphere, produces this heavy rainfall. It is true that this normally takes place in autumn, but it is also true that this used to take place every 15 to 20 years, while it currently happens almost every year, with tragic consequences at least every three or four years.</p>
<p class="contents">Is this or is it not the result of the greenhouse effect and climate change? Although the experts cannot guarantee it with all the scientific evidence, I believe this to be the case. We must therefore remedy this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that with the measures contained in the Kyoto Protocol, to which the report we are debating today refers, we will not achieve short-term results, but it is also true that the human race should try to solve the problems it creates.</p>
<p class="contents">Other causes – also triggered by human greed – combine with the greenhouse effect, such as building on watercourses, which heightens the damaging effects of these natural disasters. I am therefore one of the signatories to a motion for a resolution suggesting not only the rapid application of the measures contained in the Kyoto Protocol to combat climate change, but also other types of preventative measures, for example continuing and intensifying efforts to prevent the effects of rain when creating infrastructures, and finally, aid to all the victims, given that they are not responsible for the short or long-term damage caused by human greed and speculation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I do hope – although I fear that it will be thus – that in a few days' time, when the floods no longer make the headlines and those who have been flooded out of their homes are left on their own to sort out their problems, that people will not cease to be willing for their land to be used as an overflow area.<span class="bold"> </span>I hope I am wrong, but I have a strong suspicion that some mayor or other will object and request that a bank be raised somewhere else: all this against any logic in terms of regional planning or safety.</p>

I believe that we must go a step further. It is not enough just to have a good policy in Europe. I believe that the EU must take the lead in the work being done internationally on climate change. Otherwise, I do not believe that the climate convention will amount to much more than theory. In order to take on such a leading role, an aggressive energy policy is required, but the truth of the matter is that the European Union at present lacks an energy policy worthy of the name.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself am a member of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy which is responsible for energy issues. I have seen again and again during the last few months the unsystematic way in which energy policy is conducted within the European Union. Those proposals which are being presented are not part of a coherent strategy. On the contrary, they are not shown as having any connection with each other. One month we applaud the fact that deregulation of the electricity market has led to lower prices. A few months later, we complain that the lower prices have reduced the incentives in favour of energy efficiency and renewable energy sources. These are just a few examples. An aggressive strategy must include a change to our energy systems. At the same time, it must also include more active support for the developing countries. It is, in any case, in the developing countries that most investment in energy production will take place in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I can see that the Commission is doing its best. As I see it, responsibility for the lack of results lies mainly with the Member States and their governments and is due to their refusal to agree to a common carbon dioxide tax and their refusal to accept the need for a common energy policy. I wish Commissioner Wallström all the best with her work, but I want to conclude with a question: Does she really believe that it makes sense to implement an aggressive climate strategy without a common energy policy? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I wish to express a few reservations in the case of the early implementation of what must be called ‘a system of entitlement to pollute’.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to repeat that, if we have to recognise the system of trading in CO2 emission rights as one of the provisions of our international agreements which we cannot go back on, the Commission seems to forget that this mechanism is just one of the systems described as flexible by the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, this mechanism must be looked upon not as a frontline tool but, on the contrary, as an instrument complementary to other measures aimed at reducing greenhouses gases. We are fully aware that this mechanism does not encourage companies to become less polluting and to change their ways, and that, if nothing else is done, especially in the area of transport, we will certainly not achieve the objectives set by the Kyoto Protocol. The Commission Green Paper can thus be accused of putting the cart before the horse and of urging the European Union to put in place a system of advance trade in CO2 emission rights, even though it is not obliged to do so, especially vis-à-vis its commercial partners.</p>
<p class="contents">On this point, it seems to me that there is a case for backing one of the amendments tabled by my colleagues in the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, who deem it necessary to stay the implementation of a system of entitlement to pollute until the Council and the Member States have drawn up and ratified an operational plan of measures to reduce greenhouse gases, encompassing all the sectors involved, especially transport and agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, the Commission remains silent on the economic and social consequences that this system cannot fail to create. But can we seriously ignore the unacceptable practices which will inevitably result from the capitalist strategies of the most polluting industries? Can we act as if we did not know that some industrial groups will merge at the cost of redundancies, and buy up non-polluting or less polluting companies with the sole purpose of recovering their right to pollute before relocating them or purely and simply closing them down?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, where are our environmental objectives in this sort of international stock market of pollution rights and what can be expected of a system which simply opens up a huge market of rights on behalf of countries which, like Russia, may today have room for manoeuvre, not by virtue of bringing their factories up to the required standards, but quite simply by virtue of a dramatic reduction in their industrial output. To conclude, I think that we must press for the implementation of a framework agreement of cooperation between Russia and the European Union so as to put in place …</p>

Individual countries are responsible for implementing the obligations of the Kyoto Protocol and the obligations related to the Union’s distribution of the burden. Different countries’ scope for implementing action to reduce emissions varies considerably.</p>
<p class="contents">If country-based quotas were allocated to different sectors in the EU, as, for example, Mr Blokland suggested when he presented the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, companies engaged in the same sort of business would end up in totally unequal positions across the different Member States. Although a given sector might be amongst the world’s best in terms of environmental efficiency in one country, and I can say that is true of many sectors of industry in my country, Finland, for example, it might have to agree to a more stringent quota for emissions than its less efficient competitor in another country. This would inevitably lead to distortion of the competition situation and, for that reason, we must not impose binding, quantitative targets on different sectors of industry at Community level. It is essential to promote measures that can be implemented in practice and do not jeopardise the competitiveness of enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Along with France, my own country, Finland, is at present the only EU country where the building of additional nuclear power stations is being considered. I wholeheartedly support the building of additional nuclear power plants, as it would give our energy-intensive industry a greater competitive advantage both in terms of economy and emissions. For that reason we should not adopt a position in this report either in favour of individual forms of electricity production or specifically in opposition to them: instead, all the various forms of energy production must be at our disposal while we formulate national climate strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to emphasise the importance of voluntary, negotiated target agreements. In many Member States they have been considered a very effective means of promoting the implementation of climate-related targets. Voluntary agreements could in particular be a good mechanism for use in the enlargement process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has, on the one hand, allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the issue, an understanding forced upon us by tragic events but, on the other hand, it imposes upon us certain burdens which are certainly not ours alone: they are not the burdens of one or more affected regions, they are burdens not only of the country but of the international community as well, so that solidarity is displayed and acknowledged at different levels. And it has been displayed, at least initially, at moral, political, economic and legislative levels.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect the Commission to acknowledge the disastrous situation in certain regions in our country and to affect land rehabilitation, in collaboration with the national States, of course, but we also expect it to intervene with legislation to raise awareness at European level, so that the issue of floods and disasters, the victory of ill-omened nature over man and organised society – can in some way be changed for the better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is very much part of the concept of Gaia, or geophysiology. As a supporter of free markets and the huge prosperity and freedom which they have brought to countless millions, I welcome the harnessing of market mechanisms wherever possible to facilitate environmentally-desirable goals such as the reduction of CO2 emissions, as proposed by the Commission's Green Paper and Mr Moreira Da Silva's report, which I welcome broadly, and will help, no doubt, achieve the Kyoto targets.</p>
<p class="contents">I put down two amendments, one calling for further research into the other greenhouse gases such as methane, soot, CFCs, etc. I believe that the tradable quota system may need to be extended to these, as in many ways their reduction would be far more cost-effective and less destructive to the world's economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The second amendment I put down was for the granting of credits to national quotas for the planting of forests, which, as my colleague Lord Inglewood pointed out before, act as carbon sinks. They are desirable in terms of supporting the beauty of the countryside and they are also eminently policeable by satellite technology. I also believe new ideas such as planktonic oceanic seeding, to irreversibly fix CO2 to the ocean bed, need further investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to touch on two controversial topics in the report. One is the issue of an EU-wide carbon tax, which I reject both because it encroaches on prerogatives on taxation and because it would drive jobs offshore to non-EU jurisdictions, in my view, and be damaging to our economies. The other is the issue of grandfathering rather than national auctioning of the CO2 quotas. I personally support grandfathering along US lines to prevent penalisation of existing heavy energy using industries and doubly rewarding those industries which have made energy savings in the past and hence savings on their electricity costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I too, like my colleague Mrs Kauppi, support nuclear energy as the only long-term solution to reducing CO2. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In just a moment, I intend to comment on the floods which have hit Italy and Spain. I have a statement to read out from the Commission, and shall come back to this in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, however, I want to round off the discussion about what we believe must happen in The Hague in a few weeks’ time by saying that our role must clearly be that of instigating change internationally. We shall be compelled to be the ones who take initiatives, who force the pace and who, at the same time, build bridges between, in particular, developing countries and countries such as the United States and others in that group. We must of course force those who are dragging their heels to turn this conference on climate change into a success, as well as show that we are credible when it comes to taking action too.</p>
<p class="contents">To answer a direct question, I do not believe that we shall tackle this matter successfully in the long term if we do not have access to a range of tools and a range of political initiatives. What we are concerned with here, of course, are methods and systems of transport, which must be equipped for the future. It is also a question of energy policy. I am nonetheless pleased that the Commission has been recognised as having taken initiatives in this area. I believe that we need more in terms of financial instruments of control. We also need, of course, to discuss new areas and the integration of environmental and climate considerations into all policy areas. Again, it is a question of credibility. Emissions trading merely supplements those measures, both at Member State and European level, which we shall be sure to incorporate into our basic political systems and infrastructures in order to manage climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">As has also been pointed out in this Chamber today, I think we are right to be careful when it comes to competitiveness and the socio-economic effects. This problem must not, however, be used as a reason for not taking action but may even perhaps be turned to our advantage as something which strengthens competitiveness and offers us benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I want to thank the rapporteur and everyone who has taken part in the debate. As soon as possible after the conference in The Hague, we shall of course come back with a plan for implementing all these measures, by which time we shall also hopefully have clear, agreed rules. I hope we shall be able to come back from the conference and say that it has been a great success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The natural catastrophes which have struck the European Union and its citizens have had tragic consequences. They have confronted us with severe physical damage and in some cases loss of human life, recently in Italy and now in Spain. The Commission is acutely aware of the weight of these catastrophes. This is why the Commission, in the area of Community action for civil protection in the period 2000-2004, is developing initiatives in close collaboration with Member States to prevent catastrophes and educate the public.</p>
<p class="contents">On 27 September the Commission therefore adopted a proposal based on a Council decision which instituted a Community mechanism to coordinate measures for civil protection during emergencies. The key actions included in this decision are: identification of and improved coordination among the key actors to intervene in the case of emergencies; special training programmes to promote better cooperation and complementarity between the actors concerned; establishment of efficient communication systems to allow for better and more rapid communications. The proposal also permits faster and more effective steps to be taken on behalf of victims. In the area of research I would like to point out that there are currently several projects under way related to flooding as well as the concerted action to reduce the risks associated with climate.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, although the structural funds are not designed to address the consequences of natural disasters, they can be used for reconstruction projects if the beneficiary Member States allocate the funds for such uses and the region hit by the disaster is eligible. The possibility of structural fund involvement in cases of natural disaster must fit within the requirements of the funds and the following conditions must be met: the area in question must be eligible for funding under the territorial objectives, namely Objective 1 or Objective 2. Co-finance projects must involve expenses that are normally eligible for structural funds. Eligible reconstruction projects may not represent the majority of expenditure in the programme concerned. The actions must have a transitional nature, one or two years maximum, and they may not continue throughout the programming period. And the Structural Funds may not be substituted for insurance. In order to call upon the structural funds for this type of action it must be shown that the programme has room to manoeuvre internally. It goes without saying that the Member States concerned are in charge and that it is up to them to envisage what type of measure they would like to see eventually financed by the Structural Funds when the conditions for intervention are fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to cooperation on spatial planning solutions to flooding problems, the Commission knows that the Interreg III guidelines make specific reference to the possibility of formulating joint strategies for risk management in areas prone to natural disasters and drawing up and implementing integrated strategies and actions for the prevention of flooding in transnational river catchment areas. The Commission would also expect that flood prevention actions would form part of a transnational strategy which covers areas where flooding is a particular risk under Interreg III. For its part, the Commission will continue to give prompt and constructive consideration to this type of request.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just finish by underlying the support of victims. The European Parliament regularly asks the Commission to intervene on behalf of the victims of these disasters. The Commission is obliged to respond that there is no longer a budget line which permits such measures. Last September, on the occasion of a resolution regarding forest fires which was passed by your assembly, Mr Nielson announced that the Commission was considering whether or not to propose a legal basis for a budgetary line which would permit the Commission to respond to emergency needs in the Union. However, the Commission has not yet taken a final position on whether to propose a legal basis for measures in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, our deliberations will need to consider past experience which would suggest that there are two possible courses of action. The first would be a budget line where appropriations are allocated on a semi-automatic basis but with sums which, at best, can only be of symbolic value. The second option would be for the Commission to propose a legal basis but this would mean tying up significant sums within heading 3 of the financial perspective. The Commission would also need to take into account the resource implications of managing any new activities in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
