Expectations are that he will shortly be leaving the European Parliament to take up a senior post in the administration of his region, Valle d'Aosta. As Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Transport, I shall therefore take over the explanation of his recommendation.</p>
<p class="contents">Under its accession treaty, Austria has a system of permits for heavy goods vehicles. In six months' time, that system will come to an end. The so-called ecopoints constitute a complex dossier in which many conflicting interests are at stake. We are all agreed on the objective: a reduction in emissions from heavy goods vehicles in the Alpine region. This is one of the aims of the Alpine Convention, to which all the countries concerned are signatories. As regards the path towards that aim, however, there is a difference of opinion between the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We, the European Parliament, are not convinced by the common position, which does not have the support of the two Member States most affected: Italy and Austria. It is true that the two countries have opposite reasons for this, but that just goes to show that further consultation is advisable. In addition, exemptions were necessary in order to win some of the other Member States over. The Committee on Transport wants to achieve a balance between attention to air quality on the one hand, and the free movement of goods on the other. That is why we have sought a compromise for the areas of Austria which have the greatest problems: the Alps, and especially the three main passes. This is expressly a transitional stage on the way towards a sustainable approach for the whole of the Alpine region.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposal to keep the cleanest heavy goods vehicles, category Euro 4, outside the points system is compatible with the common position. On the other hand, the most polluting vehicles, Euro 0, must be banned indiscriminately; which means no exemptions for Greek and Portuguese vehicles. Finally, the legislative process regarding charging for the use of the infrastructure must be accelerated, in our opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, a majority on the Committee on Transport has decided to re-table all the amendments from first reading. Starting from that position, we want to enter into dialogue with the Council in order to find a structural solution, as we are heading straight for a conciliation procedure. I should like to emphasise that no time should be lost in this. After the summer recess, there will only be a few months left before the current arrangement comes to an end. It is in everyone's interest that a transitional system enters into force by Christmas.</p>
<p class="contents">This sensitive dossier calls for a firm stance on the part of the European Parliament. I sincerely recommend the rapporteur's amendments to you all, therefore. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You will probably support the recommendation to approve at second reading the amendments approved at first reading, with a view to quickly beginning the conciliation procedure, as pointed out by Mr van Dam, who is replacing Mr Caveri.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mr Caveri and Mr van Dam, and the whole committee, for the work they have done on this difficult issue.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the objective of reaching conciliation quickly has the full support of the Commission, since the current system ends on 31 December 2003. However, the different parties will have to make an effort to find a compromise solution and, furthermore, the Austrian authorities will have to display a degree of flexibility. Otherwise, it will be impossible to find a solution before the end of the year, with all the consequences that could entail. Let us remember, for example, the prohibitions imposed by the region of Tyrol at the moment and the procedures the Commission has initiated in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">In this situation, the Commission must act in accordance with the commitment made on 31 December 2002, and confirmed on 28 March 2003, and must therefore reject the majority of the amendments presented by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to assure the honourable Members, however, that the Commission is prepared to adopt an open attitude towards amendments such as the geographical scope of the system, the methods for applying it to candidate countries and others and, in any event, we will show the flexibility necessary to achieve the agreement we all want to see within the context of the conciliation and we will work to try to achieve it, although this would appear to be very difficult, since the differences between Parliament and the Council are very significant. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The paradox is that the Council proceeded to the common position as if Parliament did not exist. With an attitude that is reminiscent of old times, it has proceeded to adopt a common position, despite the recommendations made by the Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio, to the Council to take account of the first reading of Parliament, and it has ignored the European Parliament, which of course now, at second reading, is obliged, following this unacceptable Council position, to confirm its position at first reading. Thus, of necessity, things are moving towards the conciliation procedure. I hope that the Council has got Parliament's message and is prepared to enter into a substantive discussion during the conciliation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">What do we want from the conciliation procedure? Obviously, we do not want to isolate Austria because we have very good cooperation with our Austrian colleagues and because it is not good for us to isolate countries. As I said in committee, and I repeat here too, if the bell tolls for someone today, we must not forget that it may be us that it tolls for tomorrow. Consequently, we must be moderate in our position.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, we must not ignore the interests of the other countries. There are countries which have particularly vital interests in this particular issue: Germany, Italy, my country, Greece. Mainly, we must not ignore the fact that this Union is based on a certain specific philosophy and on a certain specific Treaty. And this Treaty talks about the free movement of persons, capital and goods. We have a single market, the principles of which must be respected. And they must also be respected in this instance. Of course, we are prepared to discuss a transitional arrangement. However, any transitional arrangement must be inspired by the spirit and tend towards this objective, the objective of serving the principles of the single market. This is the position of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, on behalf of our group, I would like to say that we support the proposal which Mr Caveri has already put forward to the Commission and which he is laying before plenary, which picks up what Parliament had already specified at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">There are just a few points to highlight: the first reminds us of the thorny question, the contradiction that we are considering today. This is a derogation scheme – and is therefore exceptional and temporary – which we are being asked to extend for the second time. This second extension demonstrates the flexibility and willingness, the good political sense of Parliament, of the entire Parliament. As for my second point, Mr President, I would like to stress that there have been attempts in this debate to establish, often surreptitiously, a false distinction between those who defend nature and those who pollute. This is a false distinction. There is a large majority which is mindful of the interests and needs of each Member State, but it is a large majority which acknowledges the need to gradually dismantle, over the coming years, this derogation scheme, the ecopoints system, and try to meet this objective by encouraging the use of increasingly less polluting vehicles, but which also knows that we cannot expect all European hauliers to radically modify their motor vehicles in a few months. Another important point is that we considered it necessary to prevent a further derogation for particularly tolerant treatment being offered to certain countries – Greece and Portugal – in this case on the proposal of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not add anything else, Mr President, apart from the fact that this lengthy debate, these lengthy discussions, where we have often been forced to repeat and go back over concepts, reasoning and even inflexible positions which were always the same, has been an important test, more for each of us than for Parliament: a difficult test because it involved – something which is not uncommon but, in this case, may have been more marked – casting off our civil clothing, that of the citizen of one Member State, which is a uniform but which, in Parliament, is often constricting, in order to put on the highly dignified and decorous attire of a Member of the European Parliament who must act, respond and intervene on behalf of the whole Parliament. In this regard, the Caveri report is a perfect response to this request for dignity which Parliament made of its rapporteur, in that it is a report that serves, first and foremost, the interests of Europeans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not believe that to be the case; this was meant to be a debate. How are we to take the Alpine Convention as the basis for solving a problem that affects not only Austria? For some time, now, we have been holding a debate between little Austria and the European Union, and, although I do not, right now, want to apportion blame, we have been playing this out for long enough. Austrian governments have made mistakes, as has the European Union. I will not be able to persuade or convince you – it seems to be too late for that – but I would, all the same, like to give you a few more facts to consider before we take a decision tomorrow, taking as I do the view that we MEPs should come to our decisions on the basis of verifiable facts.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1996, we observed that our air quality measurements showed no reduction in the elements indicating high levels of nitrous oxide pollution, even though the threshold values prescribed for vehicles had become more stringent, and the emissions models had led us to expect a reduction of some 45%. These high levels of emissions, from heavy commercial vehicles in particular, aroused suspicions that this sector could be the source of the higher levels of emissions. A study was therefore carried out by the Technical University at Graz, which, it might be mentioned, also does work for the Commission as part of the Artemis programme. The results, which were markedly more exact than before, were published as part of an international study involving the best measurement laboratories in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me quote from the study’s final report: ‘It has been established that emissions from heavy commercial vehicles, especially of pollutants belonging to the NOx group, have hitherto been significantly underestimated. This applies to vehicles fitted with engines in European categories Euro 2 and Euro 3. When operating in actual traffic, these vehicles produce higher levels of emissions than the categories allocated to them would appear to indicate. An explanation of this is to be sought in the way in which the vehicle’s engine is deliberately programmed to function. The vehicles are engineered in such a way that they demonstrate lower emission levels at the points measured in the course of the test cycles for their type prescribed by law. At those operating points that are not tested in the test cycle for their type, but which are very definitely significant in actual driving, the vehicles produce the same emissions as, or even higher levels of them than, older engines’.</p>
<p class="contents">The reduction of NOx emissions is, of course, what the ecopoint systems’ rules – which I have never claimed to be exactly brilliant – are intended to do. What this study now shows us is that it can be established that there is no scientific basis for the reduction of the number of ecopoints logged per transit journey for Euro 2 and Euro 3 as against Euro 1.</p>
<p class="contents">When I asked Mr Caveri to include these facts, he referred me to his Amendment No 17, which simply says, ‘shall ensure that it is done correctly’, and, at the same time, explained that there was nothing he could do if the engines of HGVs were tweaked – and, if he is accusing Italian hauliers of doing that, now really has to be the time for him to explain himself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Austria has no desire to set these rules in stone for the rest of recorded time.</p>
<p class="contents">What Europe needs is a sustainable solution to its transport problems. For years, none has been found; the transit issue is a ten-year saga of omissions by one side and then by the other. To this day, the transport infrastructure costs directive is not officially speaking on the table, and, to this day, the objective set out in the Transit Agreement, of a lasting and sustainable reduction in pollution, has not been fulfilled. It is for this reason that Austria needs transitional arrangements to be enshrined in a treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">What the proposals by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism mean, as does the free run for HGVs in European category 3 that it is looking to implement, is that Austria is going, in the fullest sense of the word, to be overrun. There are parts of my country in which pollution as a result of transit traffic has reached levels that people and their environment cannot be expected to endure. In the event of the committee’s proposals coming to fruition, Austria’s citizens will, quite literally, be driven on to the streets. I therefore ask you to support Amendment No 19, which has been tabled by a number of Members of this House from different political groups, as it prevents the worst from coming to pass and will represent a workable compromise in negotiations with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Here and now, I appeal to the Council not to delay the conciliation procedure. Europe needs a directive on transport infrastructure costs; European policy needs instruments for a sustainable transport policy; Austria, in the meantime, needs a transitional arrangement. The majority in this House may well turn a deaf ear to these concerns, but their doing so will mean that Europe will be doing the people of Austria a disservice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One reason why this is important is that the Council has taken such a stubborn attitude, essentially concentrating on the compromises it agreed at New Year without responding to any of Parliament’s suggestions. This means that only a conciliation procedure can resolve the problem, so, in the committee, we prepared the second reading and presented it to plenary in what really was record time, so that we would have enough time to conduct the negotiations, on a serious basis, before the year is over.</p>
<p class="contents">I would not want to miss this opportunity to extend thanks to the Commission for now having commenced Treaty infringement proceedings against Austria in respect of the unilateral steps taken by the province of Tyrol, and I hope that this will yield results before 1 August, when these rules enter into force.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to express my gratitude to the Commission for having, at its meeting this week, decided not to have recourse to the 108% rule. That, too, sends a clear signal that we are a community founded on the rule of law, where it is not open to all to do as they please, but in which all share in drafting and enacting the law, which must therefore also be obeyed by all.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite simply, then, my plea to all the Members of this House – and also to the Council – is that we should all make good use of the summer recess and consider how we can each move closer to the other’s position. Here there is plenty of room for manoeuvre in the course of negotiations. Let us take the autumn negotiations seriously and complete them with a third reading by the end of this year. We will then be on the right track when it comes to bringing together, in the right way, the interests of the environment, the interests of the transport sector and the economic interests of the European Union as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank God that is not the case, Mr Jarzembowski, for, after considering the facts, you too must concede – you who know what you are talking about and cannot plead ignorance – that these rules have played a substantial part, over past years, in improving the environmental situation across the length and breadth of Europe. It was the transit arrangement with Austria that led to the HGV fleet being modernised and made more environmentally friendly and played a substantial part in this coming about.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, as has already been mentioned, this is not about standing up for pettifogging local interests. Of course, the people of the Tyrol will defend their interests, and your opposition to them, Mr Ferber – your opposition to your Tyrolean neighbours – is something that you and they will just have to sort out together. In the past, though, this rule really was used to ensure that improvements were made to the environment in our vulnerable regions<span class="italic"> – </span>not just in the Tyrol, for there are enough vulnerable regions<span class="italic"> </span>in Europe. This is now about finding a temporary solution until the transport infrastructure costs directive comes into being, so that we can take another step towards making Europe’s fleets of HGVs more environmentally friendly.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Simpson and I have therefore tabled an amendment on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists; it is identical with Amendment No 19, to which reference has already been made. Our amendment makes provision for vehicles in category 3 to be included as well, as, if they are not, there will be the perverse consequence that someone trading in his category 2 vehicle – that is to say, a really bad HGV – for one in category 3 – and this is where the study already referred to is relevant – will in practice be no better off in a category 3 vehicle than he was in one classed as category 2, and, in certain cases, even worse off. It would be a positive aspect of our decision if we, despite all the other points of criticism, could include category 3 as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me reiterate that this is about nothing more or less than the question of where our priorities lie – with the environment, health, and quality of life or with the unrestricted free movement of goods. Both sides of this equation have to be considered. I am not saying that the free movement of goods does not matter. I simply think that what must surely count in the eyes of our electorate as a whole – and certainly in the eyes of those in Bavaria – is that priority should be given to health and to the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me observe, by way of winding up my speech, that there will indeed be a conciliation procedure. I am grateful to all those who have helped to make it possible for us to move swiftly on to the conciliation procedure. What now really counts is that we act quickly and work out a compromise. Although I do not want to revisit all the details of this morning’s debate right now, everything we have seen and heard, and the Italian transport minister’s almost daily statements, indicate that Italy is not at present ready to really work towards a compromise. I believe that the Italian Presidency has to recognise that it must, in these six months, act on Europe’s behalf and not just on Italy’s, and so I hope that it too will realise the great value of the environment, including the environment in Italy, and that we need a sensible temporary compromise until such time as the transport infrastructure costs directive can enter into force.</p>

I think that there is more than one aim; emissions are not the only factor. Some facts have just been presented that show that the issue of emissions on the one hand, and the facts and the proposals to limit the European standards for heavy goods vehicles on the other, is somewhat problematic. Noise, too, constitutes a nuisance. For that reason, I do not think that it is a good idea, for example, to replace the clause relating to Austrian territory as a whole with the Austrian passes, as the Council is proposing. An arrangement should be put in place that applies to all Alpine regions, not just a couple of passes. In my opinion – and I hail from the Netherlands, one of the countries from which transit traffic originates – this will undoubtedly result in people looking for secret routes through the Alpine region, which may then be exempted. That will not help matters at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people say that there is no place for the ecopoint system of exemptions within the framework of freedom of movement. I would point out that we should like to see a different system, which would apply across the board: that is to say, pricing. This was agreed on in the White Paper, but, having now participated in the debates in this House tens of times in my four years as a Member, I do not anticipate a conclusive approach just like that in the very short term or even the longer term, and, in that context, some caution is in order. I think that, all things considered, Parliament is going a long way in the right direction. It is very clear that we are anxious to find a solution. Let us then proceed to conciliation: the positions of the Council and the countries concerned still differ, as everyone is aware, and that means that we have to find a satisfactory solution in conciliation by the end of this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I admire their tenacity, and their rhetorical ability in presenting the unpresentable, alas. I refer to a battle – the reasons for which I understand – which is entirely national, and has nothing to do with Europe, which on the other hand, a battle for the protection of the environment, for the protection of Europe does. Mr Swoboda, you asked what we should make a priority. I think we should give priority to the credibility of the European Union, to the fact that, when we go to our countries and talk to our citizens, perhaps asking them for sacrifices in various sectors, we need to be able to say that we are asking for these sacrifices because there is a higher common good, called Europe, called a community of rights, called freedom of movement, freedom of trade and the whole series of common values that we are putting in place. If, however, we cannot go with this peace of mind and must then tell our fellow citizens that in Europe some are in Division One, and some are in Division Two, then it all gets difficult and it is the credibility of the European institution which will collapse.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem of living in a healthy, compatible environment is shared by all the citizens of Europe, not just Austrian citizens. I too regret that the level of emissions is unacceptable, but I do not understand why it should be excellent for Austrian citizens, when the problem appears to be completely irrelevant for other citizens. So, my friends, Mrs De Palacio, I do not want there to be any misunderstandings over one point: we have been fast at second reading not just because we want to go to conciliation quickly – although this was one reason too, of course – but because Parliament and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism are happy with the first reading: we have nothing to change; that is our proposal – which is already a compromise proposal – and the sooner the Council realises this, the sooner we will, perhaps, manage to reach a practicable result. Nobody is labouring under the illusion that we can move a long way from that proposal: we cannot move away from it at all. It must be clear that the scheme will end, that the derogations will end, that the rule of law will be restored, after which we will seek for the whole Alpine region, for both sides of the Alps, to establish the precautions which will take us to 2006 by cutting emissions, because this is what we all want, but no one must be under the illusion that we can make anything other than a very few changes. I wanted to say this, not because the Commission, from this point of view, is not well aware of all this, but because it seems that at times the Council was not. I therefore hope that conciliation will offer us deadlines for a rapid end to an affair which we all, I repeat, want to bring to a close, but in accordance with Community law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, leading Members of this House are intriguing and putting about false assertions, even attempting to prevent opinions that they find disagreeable from featuring in plenary debates, and the people who advance them from being heard from the floor. Having been promised adequate speaking time, it is thus that I am left with just one minute.</p>
<p class="contents">That, though, is enough for me to appeal to the citizens of Europe, who are getting a really rough deal from the EU – this time as regards the damage transport is doing to the Alps. Instead of decisively reducing the emission of pollutants, as had always been promised before, the issue is put right to the bottom of the list in terms of its priority and of the time available for it. In none of the major parties is there any serious support for this, and the long-overdue truth about transport costs is now scarcely mentioned, even when people get up on their soapboxes. As I see it, we can expect nothing more from the conciliation procedure that is about to get underway.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, then, is the time for non-violent demonstrations; roads belong to the public, and not to the hauliers who destroy the environment and to their lobbyists!</p>

<p class="contents">It was not all that long ago that the European Court of Justice had to weigh in the balance the fundamental freedoms on the one hand and, on the other, the protests by people for whom the effects of the transit routes through Austria have all become too much. They sat down in the road and said, ‘it can not go on like this’. Like many of those who have already spoken here today, the defenders of European freedoms talked up the supreme importance of their position.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Justice saw these things differently, adducing the remarkable argument that the freedoms, though important, are not everything. Of equal value to them, it said, were the basic rights of citizens, in this specific case the freedom to express opinions and to demonstrate, and – as can be read in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which we hope is shortly to be given added weight as Part II of the European Constitution – so was the requirement that the environment be protected in general and in what are termed vulnerable regions in particular. This obligation is to be protected, being of equal importance to European freedoms and on a level with them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unfortunate that Parliament, at first reading stage, did not see it as really important that the right to free transport should be balanced against the rights of people and of the environment on transit routes. Nearly all the Members from the fourteen Member States that are not affected insisted on their rights, aiming to do away with the transit arrangement, and the law of the jungle prevailed. I hope, indeed I ask, that at least some of you will, when you vote tomorrow, also listen to the other side and consider their rights too. To these Members, we Austrians have made an offer in the form of Amendments Nos 18 and 19, to which reference has already been made, in the hope that they will vote for them.</p>

That is simply false. If you argue along those lines, we will one day organise demonstrations to blockade Austria, preventing you from getting out and infringing our rights. The same laws must apply to all in the Community, and it is not acceptable that the Austrians should claim privileges.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you a simple example. If you travel through Austria – to Hungary via Linz and Vienna – in terms of the topography involved, that is exactly the same as when Swedes and Danes travel to Rotterdam via Hamburg. Do those who live in the lower-lying parts of Austria have more of an entitlement to special rules than do those in other countries through which transit routes pass? Never could you justify such a thing!</p>
<p class="contents">We are all in favour of vulnerable parts of the Alps being protected, but are you entitled to have the vulnerable parts of the Austrian Alps enjoy protection different to that enjoyed by those in France or Italy? If we are to introduce special rules for vulnerable areas, they must apply to all of them. There is, however, no privilege for Austria on the grounds of its citizens being of more value than the citizens of Italy or France. In moral terms, Austrians have no greater entitlement.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Swoboda was right to point out that we are trying to improve the environment for everyone. That is why, with reference to the changed charges for road use, Parliament has demanded that the burdens be more widely spread, dependent on the emission level. The Council has not gone along with our idea of this broader spread, so now we are going through the same rigmarole with them all over again. In December, it came up with this wretched compromise – which I will call a sham solution rather than a compromise – and, after ignoring our arguments at first reading stage, re-adopted the nonsense from December. So it is the Council that obstructs every sensible solution!</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, Madam Vice-President, that you will shortly put before us a revised version of the rules on the charges for road use and that we will make distinctions along ecological lines as well. That, though, is how rules work; we have to set uniform standards for all parts of the European Union without laying down special rules for Austria.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore ask our Austrian fellow-Members to be a little more reflective. Austria cannot get on its moral high horse when no work has been done on building the Brenner tunnel since the 1996 decision on the trans-European networks was taken. It is just not on! The Dutch transport minister, Mrs Karla Peijs, has recently tried to achieve a consensus with the Council – and what have we heard? The Austrians reject anything of the sort. Whenever there have been discussions, the Austrian transport minister has waited two days before coming out with the same old nonsense.</p>
<p class="contents">Along with most of the Members of this House, my plea is that we should seek the sensible compromise for which we are all ready. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The positions are identical to those of ten years ago. It was inevitable, therefore, that we should turn to conciliation as a solution; in the meantime, however, we again find ourselves having to say ‘no’ to a Council proposal, which is identical to the previous one, above all because, in this proposal, not the slightest account has been taken of what has happened in Parliament, that is of the broad consensus which, at first reading, rejected any possibility of extending the ecopoints system beyond the normal expiry date fixed for 31 December this year. On that occasion, the European Parliament once again condemned the infringement of the basic principle of the free movement of goods, while specifying not unreasonable procedures for guaranteeing transit and providing adequate protection for the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">We are familiar with all the technical proposals. However, while we are here trying to reach a difficult agreement on ecopoints, what is the Governor of North Tyrol planning? He is inventing a rule on the basis of which he will ban the transit of lorries of over seven and a half tonnes for a vast range of goods, practically all those in the construction sector, with effect from 1 August on the section between the municipalities of Kundl and Ampass: almost a joke in the debate we are having. Fortunately, the Commission, this time, at least – congratulations, Commissioner! – took timely action: it immediately instituted an infringement procedure on 24 June, and we are now waiting to see whether there will be a judgment by the Court of Justice or whether the Tyrol will reconsider and withdraw this measure, which is directly in conflict with Article 38 of the Treaty on the free movement of goods.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is important to act quickly because it is necessary to avoid another type of damage in addition to environmental damage: economic loss, which is detrimental to the interests of all haulage contractors, many of which have actually gone bankrupt in the meantime. I live in the region immediately on the other side of the Brenner Pass, and we always wonder how on earth the Austrians can presume to command this enormous respect. Why is it, seeing as we suffer just as much damage, that it has never occurred to any of us to invent ecopoints or strange things of that nature? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We Austrians are not asking for a solution for the coming decades ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... but we are, quite simply, asking for a very brief transitional period until such time as the Europe-wide solution is in place, one which will, once and for all, cover the Alps as a whole. This is not about Austria; this is about the Alps. As an Austrian, I can say that we are very proud of what we have achieved where the environment is concerned. We have a high level of awareness where the protection of the environment is concerned, and, with the possible exception of Switzerland, no other country in Europe lives in and with mountains to such a degree. To quote our national anthem, we are ‘a land of mountains, a land of valleys’. We live with mountains; they are part of our soul, and we cannot live without them. Please do not make life hell for the people who have lived on their farms in the mountain valleys for centuries. Do not rob these people of their homeland! The Alps belong to us all, so stop thinking only of your own countries, and think, instead, in European terms. Remember that the Alps are our common possession, and that we want to protect them for the benefit of all.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Commissioner for thinking in pan-European terms, and I implore my fellow-Members of this House to do as the Council has done; only a short space of time is involved. And, Mr Jarzembowski, all our mountains are topped by crosses, and, although I am seventy years old, I still keep going up them, and the next time I do I will say the Our Father for you, in the hope that the Holy Ghost will enlighten you.</p>

It is a political problem, a real problem and the proof is that we are discussing this initiative, which is an initiative specifically designed for Austria. It represents an Austrian exception.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I regret that Mrs Echerer has left, since she was talking about objective data ... I would like to give a figure so that there is no mistake: emissions due to lorries which are subject to the ecopoints restriction have been reduced by 60%. It is not relevant that the measurements of the emissions, which do not just relate to these lorries, but also to lorries from third countries outside the European Union and private cars and Austrian cars and lorries circulating within Austria, give a different result. In any case, emissions from lorries subject to the ecopoints restriction have been reduced by 60%. This is the reality and we cannot allow a situation where European Union lorries are unable to travel because third-country lorries with very high emissions are travelling and they, nevertheless, travel through Austria. The commitment in relation to European lorries has been fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we have seen once again how difficult it is to reach a consensus. In my opinion, we must achieve one whatever the cost. The Commission is prepared to demonstrate all the necessary flexibility and will continue trying to reach a consensus in relation to the various elements on the table, which are the interservice discussion and the modification of the ‘Eurovignette’ Directive which will perhaps contribute to resolving this problem.</p>
