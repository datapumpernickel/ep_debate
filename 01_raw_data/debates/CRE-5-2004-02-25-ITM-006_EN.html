This identifies sections and projects that have been taken into account as recipients of community funds that are currently available as well as credits from the European Investment Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on behalf of which I am giving this speech, looks to the Council to know what importance it should attribute to the afore-mentioned communication.</p>
<p class="contents">On January 27 of this year, the Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs de Palacio, clarified in writing to the parliamentary committee to which I belong, that the communication on the Growth Initiative including the list of priority projects is not a legally binding document, nor is it a list of sections intended to receive preferential treatment. According to the Commission, therefore, what we have is merely an incomplete list of actions within the priority projects that the European Commission and the Member States have pointed out as being sufficiently advanced to allow them to be immediately started, thus stimulating the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems necessary for the Council to confirm the Commission statement today and for it to further explain what it intends to do to ensure that indicating sections of projects proposed by the European Commission in no way makes them a priority before the codecision procedure that is currently underway on the guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport networks has been concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, that I am representing here, is aware of the benefits of quickly starting programmes which, apart from building the necessary infrastructure to create the single market within the whole of the enlarged Europe, will be able to make a major contribution to the revival of the European economy that everyone hopes to see and which we spoke about a few moments ago.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism is working and will continue to work in weeks to come to ensure that the guidelines can be adopted within the current parliamentary term. To this end, we must look at the European Parliament’s commitment and the Council needs to undertake to do even more, not just to meet the deadlines that we have set ourselves, but also to show willing to try to reach a genuine agreement because the codecision procedure makes sense, is important and does not give the impression that the decisions have already been taken by the Commission and the Council without Parliament being able to indicate its duties and its prerogatives.</p>
<p class="contents">A swift conclusion of the codecision procedure on the guidelines for the development of the trans-European networks would undoubtedly allow the green light to be given to the list of advanced projects. This list must not be seen as pre-established, but as one that must be redefined – again, within the framework of the codecision procedure – in line with the afore-mentioned guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">The only way in which we will be able to revive the European economy and physically construct the European single market without inconsistencies is by swiftly concluding the codecision work on trans-European transport networks and only then to subsequently identify advanced projects to which we will commit Union resources, as well as urging Member States to begin programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The action is an important step in the implementation of the Lisbon agenda to improve competitiveness, employment and growth potential in the enlarged Union. Structural reform will be complemented by higher investment in both physical and human capital.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council also welcomed the work carried out by the Commission and the EIB – and by the relevant configurations of the Council itself – in the establishment of the Quick Start Programme. Identification was also made according to a strict set of criteria of a provisional list of projects for immediate action. The Council also recommended that if other projects fulfil the same criteria the list may be complemented in accordance with the procedures followed for its establishment in the framework of the annual cycle for reporting to the spring European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to confirm to Members that the Commission’s communication to the Council on 'the European Initiative for Growth – Investing in Knowledge and Networks', as well as reports from the EIB and the different Council formations in this regard, constitute guidelines only. In order to be taken forward they should be enshrined in a formal legal instrument – in this case, a decision of the Council and the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission communication is a non-exhaustive list of actions within the priority projects which have been identified by the Commission and the Member States. These projects are considered to be sufficiently mature to commence immediately and thus stimulate the European economy at present. It is important that the Council and the Parliament pursue their constructive engagement in the current discussions on the revision of the guidelines. In this respect Council welcomes the letter from President Cox to President Prodi dated November 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency is strongly committed to ensuring that the work on this critically important dossier should be successfully completed by the end of this Parliament’s term. It is essential, therefore, that the EU’s institutions work together to bring forward this work. We recognise that the European Parliament has a particularly important role to play in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">Agreement will open the way for crucial investment to be disbursed on key network projects and thus facilitate the pursuit of our fundamental objective of promoting economic growth for the enlarged Union. The adoption of the draft decision on TENs on the eve of enlargement – by 1 May – would have considerable symbolic importance. It would also provide a welcome illustration of the EU's commitment to the rapid integration of the economies of the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As a final point, may I add that I listened very carefully to Mr Costa's contribution to the debate. There seemed to be some concern about Parliament's potential to contribute to this area. This has perhaps not been fully acknowledged. I would like to assure him and the House that the matter in focus is part of a bigger issue in which the Parliament and its talents will be fully engaged by the Irish presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will repeat that for your benefit, Mr President-in-Office: your statement was inadequate. The Chairman of the Committee asked a specific question as to whether the Council agrees with the description of the ‘Quick Start’ list as, in essence, a personal list drawn up by the Council, but as not binding upon Parliament. You have failed to answer that question, and I find that extremely sad.</p>
<p class="contents">You embarked on a major statement about why the ‘Quick Start’ list is necessary, but you did not address the way in which this ‘Quick Start’ list gives the impression – which your speech, in my view, reinforces – that you want Parliament to be kept out of decisions about which projects are to have priority. We did try to help you out of your difficulties, making it clear to you that the TEN projects’ Annex III, the priority projects, is a matter for our joint decision, and that the Council cannot draw up its own special list from among these priority projects, effectively saying that, of the 30 projects, it finds this one and that one and the other one the most attractive, and that it is now deciding to start with those. You subsequently attempted to defuse the issue by saying that the choice was made on the basis of readiness for work to begin or the availability of funding. Indeed so: which projects are tackled and when is not a decision for the Council; it must be decided in accordance with the criteria in Annex III as to which projects are ready to be built, which have received planning permission and which are capable of being funded.</p>
<p class="contents">So I will again ask you to state unambiguously whether the ‘Quick Start’ list is binding in law, and if so, on whom; or whether you have attempted to use it to circumvent Parliament’s and the Council’s right of joint decision on the priority projects. For my part, and on behalf of my group, I can tell you that we will not let this pass. We will not allow the Council to use a so-called ‘Quick Start’ list as a means of unilaterally disregarding Parliament’s rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There really is a Quick Start programme, even though Mrs de Palacio had explained to us that it did not exist. Thank you, then, President-in-Office of the Council, for confirming this so clearly here today, and I should also like to thank all those Members who put their names to this oral question.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, it is a good method to try to begin with those projects which have been around the longest, thereby avoiding a situation in which, as a result of trying to take on too much, we end up by not achieving very much at all. I therefore welcome the fact that there is, after all, a method for implementing the TEN projects. What is clear, however, is that the real priority list is this one, the Quick Start list, because that is where our meagre funds will be going, and our funds are very meagre compared with the immensity of the task.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore share Mr Jarzembowski’s point of view. I believe that it would be inappropriate for the European Parliament not to be informed about and associated with the implementation of this list. I am not sure whether we should go as far as codecision when it comes to the method for funding and implementing the TEN projects. What I <span class="italic">am </span>sure about, however, since it was I, together with a number of other Members, who called for it is that we must have regular information about the implementation of the thirty TEN projects which we shall be voting in favour of. I hope, therefore, that this sitting will at least have been useful in two ways. On the one hand, it has sought to clarify the procedure so that we can see whether or not we are within the codecision framework – and we shall have to have a very clear answer on that subject – and on the other hand, if we are not involved in a codecision procedure, it has at least made provision for an annual report on the implementation of the TEN projects which we have voted in favour of. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The conclusion is that control must be improved. It must be more effective, and there is a need for uniformly consistent application of the TEN rules in all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Member States already participate in the TEN programme. I am sincerely in favour of enlargement, and I am sincerely in favour of the Member States participating in all the EU programmes as rapidly as possible, but the new Member States are not always as good at controlling EU funds, and the Commission is not always that good at keeping the new Member States up to the mark. Unfortunately, the Quick Start projects are an example of this.</p>
<p class="contents">In Slovakia, for example, a motorway project designed to link Katowice to Zilina and not in any way complying with our standards was approved. The project was approved even though there is no justification for it whatsoever in terms of economics or traffic conditions. Unfortunately, we see far too many examples of projects being approved without proper investigation, without cost/benefit analyses and without account being taken of their environmental consequences. The TEN programme is a success, but we must not build motorways and bridges if there is no need for them.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure that the controls are effective and uniform in all the Member States. If we secure proper control of EU funds, we secure greater legitimacy for the TEN projects. If the finances are in order, we make it easier to attract private venture capital. That is something we must, in particular, remember, since public-private partnership looks like being an option in connection with financing future infrastructure projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Only once these things are in place will we be well on the way to giving impetus to a great many of the necessary infrastructure projects, and that will take us closer to our common objective of creating a coherent EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give an example of a project designated both for EU cofinancing and a public-private partnership. This is the fixed link between Denmark and Germany across the Fehmarn Belt. There is quite clearly a need for a bridge across the belt so that we can remove this bottleneck from the north-south axis. On the Danish side, a lot has constantly been done to ensure that this major project can be carried out. Unfortunately, it appears that there is rather a lack of political will in Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">Once the project has got under way, and it will hopefully not be very long before that happens, the EU will be stronger and, at the same time, the regions on both sides of the Fehmarn Belt will find that employment has been given an economic boost. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not a good time, therefore, to overlook Parliament’s power to approve, in conjunction with the Council, the vital question of the Trans-European transport networks.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore request, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, that this crucial issue should be put before Parliament for consideration. In any event, as a Member of this House, I should like to bring to your attention today high-speed train projects in Galicia, in Portugal, in the North-east of the peninsula and in Aquitaine; in other words, a highly significant stretch of the EU’s Atlantic seaboard. I refer to the projects linking Oporto, Vigo and El Ferrol; Santiago de Compostela, La Coruña, Vigo, Orense, Valladolid and Aquitaine; and El Ferrol and Bilbao. All of these are contained in plans drawn up by the Portuguese and Spanish Governments, in this case the Galicia plan. We want this project to come to fruition and to be approved in the proper manner by codecision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What attracted particular attention was the extremely low level of participation in June’s elections to the European Parliament. In some countries, scarcely more than 20% of the public say they are interested in these elections, and in virtually none of them do over 50%. There is absolutely no cause for surprise at these figures. The fact is that the European public hear the same old thing year in and year out, that everything bad comes from Brussels, and the good things are all home-made. The game here is ‘passing the buck’, and the Council is particularly good at it. It keeps quiet about the fact that it, as a rule, is part of Brussels, and, when it has the opportunity to play Santa Claus, as it is now, for example, doing with the TENs, the Council likes to be seen dispensing blessings in what is, of course, a solo performance. Who cares about the fact that the Treaty speaks in terms of codecision in these matters, with Council and Parliament jointly taking decisions on the trans-European transport network?</p>
<p class="contents">Their Eminences of the Council want to be the only ones to dole out largesse and to make promises; none of the glory must rub off on anyone else, certainly not on Parliament. We are not prepared to play along with this charade of disinformation; we are not prepared to do so as a matter of principle, and we are certainly not prepared to do so with 13 June in the offing. The resolution we have submitted is intended to press that point home. Most of all, we demand a clear message to the European public, that not only bad things come out of Europe, and that the European Parliament and its members share responsibility for much that the public see as important, and which, it is to be hoped, benefits them in practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Judging by what I hear my fellow-MEPs saying, they are less trusting. I would ask the President-in-Office of the Council – and this is my first point – to say, here and now, loud and clear, whether he acknowledges Parliament’s full decision-making rights in all these matters, be they the ‘Quick Start’ list or any other list.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that the committee, when it was under Mr Costa’s chairmanship, agreed that this House is not so irresponsible that anyone can, by hook or by crook, add on his or her pet projects; on the contrary, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism added a limited number of projects for which there was a rational justification. If I may mention just two of them, out of – I think – about six, which enhance Europe’s cohesion and unity, not only in and around the new Member States, but also in and around the future accession countries in the Balkans, we were talking in terms of lines running across Austria from Prague via Linz, and another running from the North via Vienna to Graz and then on to Croatia – in other words, lines that make a great deal of sense. I really do think that this House has, over the past months, shown itself to be responsible, in that not even in the run-up to an election does it add on one project after another indiscriminately. Parliament’s right to share in decisions must, however, be guaranteed in full. It would be a good thing if the President-in-Office’s ambivalent answer today could become a clear and unequivocal statement to the effect that the Council does indeed acknowledge Parliament’s power of codecision, because this House demonstrates a high degree of responsibility and comes up with a few extra ideas for these important investment projects. After all, the Council and its Presidency ought to have an interest in getting a few more good ideas, and you will get them from this House’s Committee on Transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, I cannot accept the restrictive interpretation of the so-called Quick Start List. A list of priority projects already exists. These were endorsed at the Essen and Dublin European Councils, and the Commission has proposed a second enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe all these priority projects should have an equal chance of access to Community aid. The challenge ought to be getting the projects under way at the earliest opportunity, not cutting the number of projects. In my view, one option could be setting up some sort of a bonus system involving an extra payment for projects or parts of projects certified as having been completed over the next three years. That would be far more effective than an <span class="italic">a priori</span> cut of the list of projects on the basis of the likelihood of their being launched or completed.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain sections of high-speed railway line could be largely completed between now and 2006. The Vitoria-Dax line is one of these, yet it does not appear on the Quick Start List.
