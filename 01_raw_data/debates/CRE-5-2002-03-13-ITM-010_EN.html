<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lipietz (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, nine months have now elapsed since the proposal for a European Commission directive on this ultra-technical but extremely topical subject was referred to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Last spring, when the bubble of the <span class="italic">e</span>-economy burst, we were reminded that banking is a high-risk business. In the autumn, the attacks of 11 September, coupled with the steady increase in industrial accidents and in natural disasters linked to the greenhouse effect, reminded us that insurance is also a high-risk activity. The risk will become higher and higher.</p>
<p class="contents">For years, the European Union, like the rest of the world, has been standardising both the prudential rules that are essential to these financial activities and the forms of supervision practised by the banking and insurance authorities. We are now called upon to supplement these efforts by regulating those financial conglomerates which contain both banks and insurance companies. This is a particularly urgent task here in Europe, the continent that has pioneered insurance banking. It is made all the more urgent by the fact that the development of life assurance and all forms of capitalised pensions savings is compelling our society to run a great risk. What would happen if the long-term savings of future pensioners were engulfed in a stock-market crash? This is precisely what the present directive seeks to avoid. Its rapid adoption would do no less than make Europe the safest financial area in the world, decisively improving its competitiveness through the geographical factor used by the rating agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not conceal the fact that, at the start of our debates, some of my honourable colleagues were loath to impose new prudential constraints on the financial sector. There were discussions, and some questioned whether it was expedient for Europe to set out its own rules before the completion of the Basle negotiations on the same subject in 2004. Such misgivings, however, were to be banished by a single event, namely the collapse of the Enron conglomerate in the United States as a result of failure to comply with the prudential rules and breakdowns in the supervisory system.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union adopted this directive, Europe would become the ‘Enron-proof’ continent, so to speak. And so the last misgivings have now melted away. Yes, the directive is needed urgently. No, it must not be watered down, either in its scope or in the rigour and transparency of the prudential rules that the authorities will have to oversee.</p>
<p class="contents">In the course of these nine eventful months, our committee has met with representatives of the banking and insurance professions; where the latter put forward sound arguments reflecting the public interest, the committee has managed to incorporate most of these into its position. I refer in particular to two groups of amendments, namely those that relate to the choice of calculation method and those designed to instil a degree of flexibility into capital-adequacy requirements in terms of companies’ own funds in the case of groups which are not yet conglomerates.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, your rapporteur has benefited, throughout the course of his work, from the cooperation of the Commission and of the Belgian Presidency, and latterly the Spanish Presidency, of the Council. My warm thanks are extended to both institutions. We have proved on this occasion that the three institutions of the Union are able to take very rapid concerted action when the interests of the public and of the European Union are at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">As I speak to you, at 5.15 p.m., I have just managed to finalise a handful of compromise amendments incorporating the key points from the amendments that were tabled last week. These seem to offer a good basis for a consensus among most of the groups and to anticipate the bulk of the compromises that will have to be made with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the House will be able to adopt an almost unanimous resolution tomorrow and that the amended proposal will be very close to that which the Council will adopt. In these circumstances, I believe that one reading, or one reading and a half, if you like, will suffice for us to ratify this directive, and I shall be absolutely delighted at such an outcome. We shall avoid any new Enron-type affairs in Europe, and at the same time we shall have legislation with which we can intensify the Basle discussions by offering our new rules as a model for the rest of the world. This would yield immediate dividends by enhancing the global reputation of our financial activities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Goebbels (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, it has often been said that the advent of the euro would serve as the catalyst for sweeping reforms in Europe. This is especially true with regard to the financial markets, which are still largely fragmented.</p>
<p class="contents">The view of the Commission is that the creation of a vast financial market should reduce the cost of finance for all economic operators. Nevertheless, since the financial markets remain vulnerable, there is a need to create, parallel to the establishment of this large market, regulatory authorities vested with wide powers, not to intervene on a routine basis but to take action when the rules of common sense have been breached by players in the field. These principles are applied in the draft directive on market abuse.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make it quite clear that the proposal from the Commission is a sound document. It resolutely addresses the key problems. Europe is not currently able to penalise insider dealing and market manipulation effectively. Such operations have long been considered with a certain degree of forbearance. But the fact is that anyone who indulges in insider dealing or market manipulation is guilty of an offence. He or she is stealing from the other market operators. When insiders make a killing in the space of a few minutes, small shareholders and honest brokers are the ones who bear the brunt. The Commission proposal has been a welcome development in the light of the attacks of 11 September. Confronted by groups of terrorists who can use the anonymity of stock-exchange transactions to obtain funding for the vilest purposes, Europe is duty-bound to respond on the financial front too.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me now, Mr President, to comment briefly on the main objectives of this directive. Our purpose in clarifying its provisions is to avoid writing a blank cheque for secondary legislation. We cannot confine ourselves to vague definitions, particularly as regards the definition of market manipulation. For this reason we have developed this and other definitions, although we have left some scope for them to be supplemented in response to imaginative innovations within the markets. We believe we have struck a fair balance between precision and flexibility. The financial products covered by the directive have been specified in the body of the text, but there is still scope for the inclusion of subsequent financial innovations.</p>
<p class="contents">Market operators have expressed what are ultimately legitimate concerns about the pursuit of acceptable practices in the financial markets. In this respect, Parliament puts its trust in what we call the Lamfalussy procedures as a means of obtaining universally acceptable secondary legislation. Taking a constructive approach, we wished to go further along the avenues explored by the Commission. Preventive measures must be paramount. The risk of fraudulent use of confidential information increases if information is not properly disseminated. This is why greater transparency is essential. In the first place, issuers will have to post on their websites all inside information that they are required to disclose. Secondly, persons discharging managerial responsibilities with an issuer of financial instruments must disclose their transactions. This disclosure must be made without delay so that the market can digest the relevant information.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with this pragmatic approach, we have amended some of the provisions proposed by the Commission. For example, the imposition of an obligation on financial intermediaries to reject suspect orders seemed to be rather unrealistic. How can an intermediary take such a decision in a matter of seconds when the regulators’ enquiries into the activities of suspected offenders may take months?</p>
<p class="contents">By the same token, the principle of a single authority must not rule out a certain measure of flexibility. Similarly, the single authority should be able to delegate some of its powers to other authorities or to stock exchanges. The single authority would, however, retain ultimate responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">We also turned our attention to the conditions for the implementation of the directive. The current procedures are glaringly inefficient. Only thirteen criminal penalties were imposed for market manipulation in the 17 countries of the European Economic Area between 1995 and 2000. The subsidiarity principle prevents us from harmonising criminal and administrative penalties throughout Europe. Our preference is for administrative penalties. We are asking for an indicative list of administrative measures and sanctions to be compiled by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wished to draw attention to the financial resources to be put at the regulator’s disposal. In Europe, regulators’ budgets are often derisory. In the United States, a debate has been taking place in the wake of the Enron affair on the need to increase the resources allocated to the Securities and Exchange Commission. But are we aware that the SEC budget is already almost fifty times higher than that of the German regulator?</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wanted to strengthen cross-border cooperation by providing for an arbitration body. Any regulator who has a request for information rejected should be able to ask his or her peers to arbitrate. While regulators must be vested with real powers, this does not mean that they should exercise these powers indiscriminately. The regulator should benefit from the expertise of market participants; to this end, we propose the creation of a consultative committee within each national regulatory authority.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, may I remind the House that modernising financial markets implies not only greater efficiency but also a more level playing field. The financial markets on both sides of the Atlantic undoubtedly suffer from the same ills: constant conflicts of interest, calculation methods that defy scrutiny and weaknesses in the monitoring of off-balance-sheet operations and of derivative transactions. The modernisation of financial systems requires the involvement of all players. An active Parliament must engage in dialogue with all interested parties and listen to all the lobbies. But the latter do not always seek to serve the general interest.</p>
<p class="contents">I have the feeling, Mr President, that the proposed text serves the general interest, whilst respecting the legitimate interests of the financial world. I should like to reply to certain activists by quoting the words of Sir Howard Davies, head of the Financial Services Authority. ‘Some well-paid lawyers’, he said, ‘are talking high-priced, high-octane nonsense’. This remark is equally applicable to certain lawyers in the Commission who seek to make themselves indispensable by creating a steady flow of new difficulties. Mr President, may I appeal to Commissioner Bolkestein to preserve the fragile political consensus between our institutions in this domain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today we will be debating two draft directives, including the prospectus directive, on which I have the honour to be Parliament's rapporteur that incorporate the delegated powers proposed by Baron Lamfalussy's wise men. We all very much hope that this new way of dealing with financial regulations will prove to be a step change in creating a single market, the foundations of which have been put in place by the creation of the euro and its successful introduction.</p>
<p class="contents">The prospectus directive is designed to establish the ground rules under which an issuer of shares, bonds or other securities may access investors throughout the 15 Member States. At present, a company has to seek 15 regulatory approvals for 15 different sets of disclosure documents. This is a nonsense. It means separate markets in new issues, higher regulatory costs, higher costs of capital for business and less choice for investors. I have no doubt, therefore, that a single regime for prospectuses can create benefits for all, greater choice and higher returns for investors, lower costs of capital and funding opportunities for companies. The Single Market is a win-win game, not a zero-sum game.</p>
<p class="contents">In drawing up requirements for an EU prospectus, it is important to strike a balance between the objective of lowering the cost of capital for businesses and that of protecting investors. There ought to be enough potential gains to secure both, and that is the balance we have tried to strike on the committee, I am particularly grateful to my colleagues, Mrs Piia-Noora Kauppi and Mr Harald Ettl as the shadow rapporteurs, and to their respective groups, for their help and cooperation. We tried to make a break in this proposal with in-depth hearings to understand the issues and I hope that we have a substantial measures of consensus within Parliament on many of the key problems and how to solve them.</p>
<p class="contents">We all agreed we wanted, for example, to exempt the professional market for Eurobonds from the requirement for a prospectus, but of course, to insist on one if the issuer wanted to attract retail investors. The broad framework for that is agreed across this House. We have one issue to settle: should we have a minimum unit for each exempted Eurobond of EUR 50 000 or of EUR 100 000? I hope you will agree that EUR 50 000 is enough to exclude retail investors, as the larger amount will prove cumbersome even for professional investors who are used to dealing in units of EUR 10 000.</p>
<p class="contents">The second key set of amendments deals with whether companies must annually update their prospectuses or whether, if they do not issue more bonds or shares, they do not have to do so. Overall, the committee supported the view taken by the EU's regulators – FESCO and now CESR – and that it makes sense for such annual updating to be optional if the issuer of bonds or shares wants to issue again. In addition, this is not a directive concerned with general disclosure requirements by companies trading on the market. We shall deal with the consultation in that area in due course.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also been pleased to support an amendment from the Socialist Group to allow smaller companies to update their prospectus, if they so wish, with the filing of their annual report.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also generally sought to have the Commission, advised by the Securities Committee, take account of different securities and issuers including small business. Therefore, the disclosure requirements will be tailored to particular circumstances. This leads me to a further compromise amendment, which would allow a national authority, if it wanted, to exempt companies with a market capitalisation of less than EUR 350 million from the EU requirement, so long as they are not marketing outside that Member State. This seems likes a large amount, but I would merely point out that there are a number of quoted companies currently meeting the small and medium-sized enterprise definition that would actually be covered by this. For example, the British Technology Group employs just 182 people and has a turnover of EUR 22 million and a balance sheet of EUR 32 million. It is an SME, but has a market capitalisation currently of EUR 1.6 billion. Small companies can have vast values, and it only takes one or two Nobel scientists on board to ensure that that happens. It seems to me that, as an investor-protection measure, it is better to have these enterprises included within the scope.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finally explain why I think issuer choice of regulatory authority is important. We want regulators to cooperate and they are increasingly doing so. We also want to give them an incentive to do so. By allowing issuers to choose between their regulatory authorities, largely as they do now, for example, on all securities except equities in a domestic market, we can ensure that that cooperation proceeds and that we gradually put in place the foundation for a single regulatory authority across the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We of course primarily tried during our discussions to make sure that what emerges here goes as far as possible to ensure that the directive is legally correct. The main problem we faced was the issue of comitology. The original draft directive provided a very general definition of market abuse, beyond which the bulk of the detail, the actual definitions, are relegated to the Annex and made accessible to the comitology process. We are convinced that criminal law – and we are talking about criminal law here – can only be adopted by the actual legislature and not through the comitology process.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why in the first place we are very grateful that the rapporteur of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and also that committee as a whole adopted changes in order to move in the direction requested by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.</p>
<p class="contents">The second legal aspect which is vital here is that although we have some sympathy for the fact that the Commission attempted to adopt a result-oriented rather than a blame-oriented approach, it is a problem for us – and this is a general legal principle – that without blame, without guilt, no penal sanctions can be applied. If that approach were to be adopted, it would fly in the face of all the fundamental rights provisions that have become part of the traditional order in our Member States, and it would also be counter to the Charter of Fundamental Rights adopted in Nice. So without any guilt whatsoever it is impossible to apply such sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">We also considered the degree of guilt. It is our opinion that market abuse is an offence very similar to other offences against property, such as fraud. However, there is no such thing as negligent fraud or negligent theft. Such offences can only be committed intentionally. For this reason it was one of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market's wishes that intent should also be included as a matter of principle.</p>
<p class="contents">We are very grateful to the rapporteur for his willingness, in a spirit of compromise, to incorporate these points from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market into his draft. It now only remains for us to make an appeal to the Council that when it makes its decision it should take account of fundamental rights. This appeal is, for very good reasons, particularly directed to the Finance Ministers, who are responsible for this.</p>

In the von Wogau report on comitology we also introduced the area of market participants, and I believe that there was very good cooperation in the area in which I was shadow rapporteur for the financial conglomerates, between the Commission, the Council, market participants and Parliament, especially in the preparatory phase. This is in fact an appeal to the Commission to carry forward this good cooperation between market participants, Parliament and the Commission, and to eliminate sources of irritation and possible misinterpretations in advance. We have succeeded relatively well in doing this, and I think that we can work in this way for the future in accordance with market trends.</p>
<p class="contents">People keep saying that this is a technical report because it is so complicated. It certainly does have major implications. I will of course comply with the President's wish that I should be very brief, but I would like to touch on one or two points, especially the collapse of Enron, which has been repeatedly mentioned. I believe that we need to take Enron's collapse seriously, and we need to think about drawing the necessary conclusions from it. One conclusion, for example, could be about how we deal with firms of auditors and consultants in Europe in future. Ultimately, however, in this area as well we need to take account of the changing situation – the fact that ever more financial conglomerates are coming into existence which operate internationally, in relation to the joint forum and at the same time Basel II. It is our job as the European Parliament to make sure that the public is protected, but also that our companies remain competitive in this global competitive struggle. We have to take appropriate corrective measures here. I believe that we have considered these measures here in Parliament as part of a calm dialogue, and that we have been able to eliminate many problems, and I believe that could set a good precedent for how we deal with these topics. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe it is very important for the Commission and the Council to work towards strengthening the way the European Parliament functions in this area, as provided for in the Lamfalussy report, so that we can also exercise our democratic rights in the monitoring committee while preserving complete neutrality.</p>
<p class="contents">The three directives that we are discussing today and voting on tomorrow aim to overcome the fragmentation of Europe's financial markets, to enhance their attractiveness and competitiveness, and at the same time also to strengthen financial stability and consumer protection. The elimination of obstacles to market access and bureaucratic regulations, the removal of antiquated and rigid supervisory structures and their replacement by flexible and market-oriented supervisory rules and instruments are indispensable requirements for the creation of an integrated financial market and for ensuring the competitiveness of Europe's financial service providers.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this should not be allowed to jeopardise financial stability or to lead to a deterioration in consumer rights as regards cross-border transactions. We should make total transparency and strict regulatory and supervisory mechanisms, including appropriate sanctions, the hallmark of the quality of Europe's financial markets. It is of course also important to regain the confidence of private investors in this sort of saving, not least in the interest of building up fully funded supplementary retirement pensions. We do not need statements of good conduct for this, but just clear and binding regulations underpinned by appropriate sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to the Directive on financial conglomerates, which will most certainly take integration an important step further forward. If they are to remain competitive in the face of the globalisation and internationalisation of the finance markets, Europe's financial companies need to reposition themselves in the market, and the growing number of takeovers and mergers in this context demonstrates that this process is in full swing. This structural shakedown in order to create internationally competitive companies is certainly to be welcomed. However, it should not lead to a situation in which financial groups and conglomerates of this kind are increasingly no longer subject to the supervision that up to now has been organised at national level and in most Member States, even at sectoral level.</p>
<p class="contents">Enron has generally highlighted the risks involved in multi-layered and inadequately supervised finance groups. The directive before us will create an important harmonised European legal basis for cooperation between supervisory authorities, and it will also prevent multiple gearing of own funds instruments within a group.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to avoid excessive administrative burdens, we believe that we are right in calling for responsibility for the supervision of financial conglomerates and groups to be transferred to a single supervisory authority, which will be established on the basis of legally defined criteria. It is also especially important here that we have fortunately managed to reach a compromise with regard to the scope of the directive and also as regards multiple gearing of prudential capital, a compromise that my group also fully supports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First and foremost, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Lipietz, for the huge amount of work he has done in connection with Parliament’s debate of this proposal for a directive. Next, I should like to thank Mr Radwan and Mrs Villiers, with whom I have had very close contact during our work with a view to tomorrow’s vote. Last but not least, I should also like to thank Commissioner Bolkestein for his work on bringing about a genuine internal market for financial services.</p>
<p class="contents">With the active participation of the Commission, we in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have, where far and away the majority of points are concerned, found common solutions to the problems raised in different quarters. The background to the practical proposal is that we wish to secure stable financial markets in Europe. We want to avoid scandals along the lines of Enron. At the same time, however, there must be no more regulation than is necessary. What is most important, therefore, is to secure effective supervision to prevent financial conglomerates from using the same capital to consolidate their positions in several different places. I should like to express my support for the oral amendments to be tabled by Mr Radwan to Amendments Nos 44, 46 and 48 in connection with tomorrow’s vote. I appreciate the Commission’s also being able to accept the amendments tabled. For me, adoption of the proposal tomorrow will be further proof that the European Parliament accepts co-responsibility when necessary. I am a great believer in our not dragging matters out if possible solutions emerge. We have found those solutions here in Parliament, and so it is merely up to the Council to deliver the rest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
