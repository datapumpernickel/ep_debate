<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, thank you very much for inviting the Commission to present its views on the events in Porto Alegre and New York. I believe that this is also a good opportunity to explain the initiatives that the Commission has adopted on these issues in recent weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the International Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey will take place very soon, the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development will take place in September and we must define our position on both issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Much has been written about the apparent antagonism between the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre and the World Economic Forum in New York. In both cases, agents from different cultural and ideological origins and from different areas have met. There is no doubt that the World Economic Forum has provided a good platform for a well-founded and broad debate, without prejudices, on problems which are of urgent concern to the whole world.</p>
<p class="contents">However, some commentators have stated that the Porto Alegre meeting was more important than the one in New York. It has been argued that the world’s real civil society was in attendance in Brazil and not in New York. I would not deny the participants in the World Economic Forum the right to be considered as part of civil society. But the fact is that the Social Forum was a significant meeting, an important event which political leaders must count on clearly from now on.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would reach the conclusion that not all the participants who met in Porto Alegre hold an anti-globalisation position. Rather I believe that they are also part of this phenomenon of globalisation, which has allowed non-governmental movements to have a global impact, thanks to the new technologies. It is another thing to criticise a capitalist model which could undermine social cohesion and deplete natural resources. In this respect, the views and concerns of Davos and of Porto Alegre are perhaps not so far apart.</p>
<p class="contents">To achieve a balance between economic and social process on a global level, and the preservation of our planet’s resources, is a great responsibility and a difficult task which no person or country can manage alone. The solutions are difficult and complex. Easy solutions are sometimes popular, but they tend to ignore the secondary effects and the difficult choices and sacrifices which policies often imply. The complexity of the genuine solutions often leads to a lack of comprehension by social movements and also by political leaders. Therefore, we believe it is essential to carry out in-depth studies which clarify and properly explain the issues and communicate them in a clear way.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has tried to make an effort of this type by means of its report ‘Response to the challenges of globalisation’. We avoid any type of prejudice and the study includes a series of proposed reforms of the international financial architecture, in accordance with the current world academic and political debate, and places it within the current perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">While accepting that globalisation has many other facets, including social and environmental aspects, the priority focus of the report is the international financial and monetary system and problems of development funding. In producing it, we began by analysing the evolution of the process of globalisation in the economic field and identifying some of the challenges relating to the financial and monetary system.</p>
<p class="contents">The report acknowledges the benefits of international economic integration, but also notes the existence of systemic deficiencies and the fact that poverty is still a significant problem. It confirms the need for greater and more effective official development aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The report recognises that many countries have achieved an increase in their per capita income and an improvement in the standards of living which would not have been achieved with a strategy of less integration. It also notes a considerable increase in direct foreign investment, an essential factor in increasing growth and therefore combating poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">The report examines various existing proposals on international taxes. In relation to the general use of these taxes as a potential source of development funding or public funds, we reach the conclusion that, while some of them would appear attractive in terms of short- and medium-term needs, there are not many alternatives to funding coming from national budgetary resources. This conclusion implies an adjustment of the priorities in accordance with budgetary availability.</p>
<p class="contents">Another interesting proposal is the introduction of the tax on monetary transactions. The report considers two perspectives: firstly, in relation to the so-called Tobin tax as an instrument for stabilising the currency markets, the analysis leads us to the conclusion that it is difficult to imagine that this tax would make a fundamental contribution to the stability of exchange rates. However, if we analyse it as an instrument for increasing the resources available for development funding, the Tobin tax may appear more attractive.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that its implementation would be laborious, since it would require almost global coverage in order to minimise tax evasion and would require a solid international consensus. Even if it were possible to achieve that consensus on a political level, numerous technical problems would still arise, such as problems relating to the appropriate tax basis and collection mechanisms. These conclusions are very similar to the Resolution on the international monetary system adopted by the European Parliament last autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important aspect of the report is the statement that for many developing countries, technical commercial assistance and the development of capacities are important in terms of their profiting from the growth opportunities resulting from trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is well placed to play a leading role in strengthening sustainable global development. It is the world’s largest donor of development aid, the world’s largest trading partner and an important source of direct foreign investment. Furthermore, within the framework of its commitment to protect the environment, it is developing and promoting the use and distribution of technologies which respect the environment both inside and outside of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The European integration model has developed along the lines of strategies for mutual support for stable economic growth, social development and environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of these achievements and in view of the forthcoming World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, the Commission has directed the communication towards partnership for sustainable development. Its purpose is to point out the strategic components which will serve as a basis for a global deal in Johannesburg, with a view to ensuring that all partners, from both the north and the south, work together in favour of sustainable development. The communication highlights several key priorities and presents concrete proposals for action in the economic, social and environmental fields.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and the Member States have committed themselves to negotiating in a constructive spirit, within the framework of the WTO, in order to continue with the process of establishing a just and free-market commercial system, in accordance with the conclusions of the Doha Ministerial Conference. Our global objective is to increase the world’s standard of living by means of the liberalisation and development of trade.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community actively promotes the participation of developing countries and, in particular, the least-developed countries, in the international commercial system. The ‘Everything but arms’ initiative is an important step in this direction, but it is not enough and we urge others to follow our example and to improve access to the market for the least-developed countries. We also adopt measures to support the efforts of the developing countries to integrate into the global commercial system and to profit from it. In accordance with the Doha development agenda, we also recommended that the Member States increase trade-related aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is also contributing to the international effort to strengthen the resistance of the international financial and monetary system and to reduce the opportunities for abuse relating to the funding of terrorism, money laundering and other illegal financial activities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union will continue to focus its development policy on the essential objective of reducing poverty. It will allocate its resources accordingly and will ensure that European aid is used effectively. Genuine practical progress could be made in terms of the quality and effectiveness of aid if the rules regulating policies and the procedures were more harmonised, both on Community and Member States levels. However, without ignoring the need to increase efficiency, the Commission considers that there is inconsistency between the resources necessary to achieve the millennium development objectives and the agreed time limits and current available means.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, with a view to the success of the Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey, the Commission has recommended that the Council increase the volume of Official Development Aid and we suggest that by 2006 all countries whose percentage of aid in relation to GNP is less than the European Union average of 0.33%, should have reached that level. If we achieve that objective, the European Union average would increase to practically 0.4%, which would become a new threshold for the Member States of the Union, which, with that increase, could make a significant contribution to the development objectives of this millennium. Furthermore, a strong commitment together with this gradual approach would consolidate the Union’s position in the negotiation of a fruitful international distribution of the burden.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in relation to the global protection of the environment, the Commission proposes to implement an initiative in the field of sustainable water management. We have committed ourselves to putting pressure on our partners in order to achieve a restructuring of up to 50% of the global environment facility before April 2002 and in order to broaden its mandate. We are promoting the application of multilateral environmental agreements including the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, which the Member States did at the beginning of this month. Speaking in general terms, I believe that, as industrialised countries, we do not have the right to demand that developing countries make more effort to protect the environment if we are not prepared to respect our own commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the construction of a sustainable future for the world requires the cooperation of all of us. However, real progress can only be made if the main partners commit themselves to playing a pivotal role and in this respect I am convinced that we, in the European Union, can and must play that fundamental role.</p>

The neo-liberal model has not provided any answers in these areas, nor has it made the world a safer, or more sustainable, place. We are now looking for an alternative, not as a blueprint, but as a line of thought and action, in order to give shape to our ideals of social justice and security for everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">Porto Alegre and the World Forum in New York were both venues where at least the sense of urgency and the necessity to act in a more socially responsible way were on the agenda. Porto Alegre appears to be more original, more up-to-the-minute and more creative, and also involves civil society. It could serve as a good model for Prime Minister Aznar to promote social dialogue within Europe, which is what Belgium did.</p>
<p class="contents">We, as Socialists, are convinced that globalisation offers enormous scope for poor countries and excluded groups to gain access and to combat social exclusion. Free trade should then, though, be coupled with rules and with supervision – by regional competition authorities – of concentrations of power that have grown far too big. Protecting and supporting weaker regions and drastically opening up richer markets to developing countries fit in well within this framework of rules. What does not, however, fit in well is protecting the strongest by introducing a network of social supervision of transnational businesses, although such a network would in itself be a good idea. Neither is there any room for unilateral action by transnational businesses or superpowers such as the United States or for a unilateral focus on a new arms race at the expense of public provisions including education and health care. Failure to honour the pledge to halve poverty by 2015 does not fit into this framework either.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this framework does offer room for fair trade with rules, democratic supervision of the global rules and social and good behaviour of transnational businesses. It has room for respect for human values and societies in preference to commercial interests. It allows for a modern and open world, and interest in, and respect for, each other’s differences on the basis of a common, recognised rule of law. This rule of law comprises the right to an opportunity to shape one’s own life.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to return to the subject of Monterrey and the Spanish Presidency’s failure to translate the specific agreements of our Ministers for Development and Cooperation last week into an agreement to take practical steps towards achieving a contribution of 0.7% of GNP. It is not acceptable that we should first act as a satellite to the United States, which puts money and its own values first, before closing the poverty gap. We want broad-based security, worldwide, and demand that the pledge to ensure that by 2015 all boys and girls can attend school while being healthy and well-fed, be honoured. We, as Socialists, demand in the European Parliament that the Spanish Presidency honour this pledge. This is our contribution to world peace, and this is how we want to translate the lessons of Porto Alegre and New York in this world into a new role for Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While I welcome the Commissioner's statement, I regret the fact that the Commission's work has not been more balanced – recognising, for example, that there is a dark side to globalisation, too – and has not been more ambitious. Why did the Commission not take up Mr Verhofstadt's suggestion that we should have a G8 not based on wealth and composed of the richest nations, but based on population and composed of the world's major regional bodies, thereby involving the African Union, Mercosur, the South Asian Area of Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and so on?</p>
<p class="contents">Globalism has led to a world of interconnected communities. Technology and language learning have transformed our ability to communicate. Trade and investment have changed our economic perspectives and vastly increased our wealth. Travel has opened up new horizons and new opportunities for human contact. And yet all this has not come without a cost, because criminals have organised themselves into global networks; humankind's damage to our natural environment threatens the future viability of life on our planet; and powerlessness and alienation are restricting opportunities for far too many to develop their own abilities and to improve the lot of themselves and their families. History, Mr President, suggests that if the world were truly a global village, many more would be shocked by the misery of the poor. Of 6 billion human beings, half are living on less than EUR 2 per day and 800 million are going to sleep hungry every night.</p>
<p class="contents">I say, therefore, to our friends on the Right that yes, the market economy, if intelligently regulated, is the most powerful instrument known to mankind to lift people out of poverty. That we have not yet learned to use it properly, however, is shown by financial crises, by environmental degradation and by the continued spread of preventable disease. Moreover, our failure to reach 0.7% of GDP in development aid is depriving the poor of EUR 100 billion per annum.</p>
<p class="contents">I say to the Left that we need to reform our trade policies because aid and debt relief for developing countries without access to our markets can be nothing more than a palliative.</p>
<p class="contents">To the Greens I would say that access to scientific progress is also important. It is the key to better nutrition, to improved health and life expectancy and to rising living standards. We must not starve the developing world of the benefits of innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenge to humankind is to establish effective instruments of international government. The United Nations, the international financial institutions, NATO, etc. have not succeeded as much as they should. Yet, in the European Union we may have a model for wider global governance. We need from our current leaders vision and commitment such as that shown by the founders of the Union. It involves the self-confidence to engage with the world economic forum, the world social forum and others and the self-confidence to say to our friends in the United States that their legitimate sense of vulnerability after 11 September should not lead them in a unilateralist direction – whether in matters relating to military or economic security, the environment or fighting crime. Global problems require global solutions.</p>

People said that the former was a forum for a ruling class with no mandate, a sort of shadow cabinet for the globalised economy, and that Porto Alegre was nothing more, indeed, than a colourful, inconclusive jamboree.</p>
<p class="contents">I, however, feel that, this year, some small degree of <span class="italic">rapprochement</span> was achieved. The world’s leaders felt less sure of themselves and included subjects such as debt, poverty and sustainable development in their debates. The 51 000 people who took part in the Porto Alegre forum want to do more than just protest and are drawing up proposals in an attempt to influence decisions. This <span class="italic">rapprochement</span>, this loss of confidence in one-dimensional, pre-established solutions – and I would like to say here to Mr Watson that we Greens are not blinkered but are in favour of innovation – should be a major opportunity for an initiative from the European Parliament and the European Union in general.</p>
<p class="contents">We are the only supranational directly elected legislative house in existence. The European Union is the only example of potentially innovative governance. Well then, the European Union must address both the 51 000 Porto Alegre protesters and the exclusive Davos club. As a Union, we must take an innovative, non-conformist approach to at least three issues. The first is the issue of sustainable development. The Johannesburg Summit is approaching: we are not satisfied with the initiatives the Commission is pursuing in this regard and we are concerned by the fact that sustainable development will not be discussed at all at Barcelona, or only very indirectly.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is the age-old, pitiful question of development aid. It is very sad that we will not be going to Monterrey with a unified European Union position, and we are concerned – and displeased – by the failure to improve on the probable 0.4% of GDP in development aid. That is not the way to consolidate global governance.</p>
<p class="contents">The third and final question is democracy. We know that there are entire States which are controlled by multinationals and that politics is yielding increasingly to pressure from the business world, and the Bush Administration is a daily testimony to this. As Europeans, how can we find another way? I believe it is our duty to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wurtz (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I welcome this debate because I believe that Porto Alegre requires a firm response from the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, many people attending the world forum expect the European Union to cut its ties with the ultra-liberal model that provides a structure for the current form of globalisation. At the same time, however, Mr Aznar, in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council, summed up his profession of faith for Europe in three meaningful words, which are – and I quote – ‘liberalisation, privatisation and competition’.</p>
<p class="contents">We are still a long way from the requirement of sustainable development, from the requirement of promoting human abilities, in both the north and the south. Clearly, a consensus reached by the Fifteen to this effect at the forthcoming Barcelona Summit would constitute the most negative signal that the European Union could give to those I call ‘the people of Porto Alegre’.</p>
<p class="contents">We can obviously disregard them and prefer to believe, like the President of <span class="italic">Sun Micro Systems</span> at the World Economic Forum in New York, that globalisation is a good thing and that nothing needs to be changed. I doubt, however, that he will be proved correct over time.</p>
<p class="contents">Every era has provided such examples of short-sighted policies pursued by the ruling classes, who are too convinced of their beliefs and interests to allow a rebellious division to emerge that challenges its dogmas and status.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all familiar with the episode in history where Louis XVI, King of France, wrote ‘nothing to report’ in his personal diary on the page dated 14 July 1789. I hope that the European Union will demonstrate rather more insight.</p>
<p class="contents">Porto Alegre is also focusing the European Union’s attention on its responsibilities, in the face of the heightened and dangerous unilateralism of America under President George W. Bush. We cannot, firstly, expect the whole world to express its solidarity when one falls victim to a savage act of violence, and then, secondly, act according to one’s own agenda, and disregard every rule, principle and scruple.</p>
<p class="contents">In a globalised world, the more powerful one is, the more responsibilities one has towards others and towards the planet. Ignore these responsibilities and globalisation becomes a minefield. I believe that the European Union’s primary duty is, in fact, to combat this very real danger.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, when it comes to its relations with the United States, one often has the impression that Europe is scared of its own shadow. For instance, on 8 February 2002 in Casares, the Fifteen had only just declared their clear position on the situation in the Middle East, when its major allies in Washington pathetically changed their stance a mere two weeks later.</p>
<p class="contents">We must deal with this in a mature fashion; in other words, act independently and responsibly. This is what some of those who are legitimately challenging a predatory and inhuman system still expect of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This year, at last, Porto Alegre firmly expressed a third demand which, despite the fact that its primary target is a military superpower, also concerns the European Union and its Member States. We cannot allow war to once again become a way to solve the world’s problems. We do not always know how war begins to become a part of everyday life, but we all know what it can lead to.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, I refer to what I said at the opening of today’s sitting on the incredible revelation in the <span class="italic">New York Times</span> regarding the existence of a secret plan at the Pentagon to authorise the use of atomic weapons. This extremely serious strategic about-turn goes hand-in-hand with the already exaggerated increase of the US military budget, an increase equivalent to the total amount of official development assistance of all the OECD countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Europe must respond, not by attempting to imitate the model, but by working openly with its fellow citizens on bringing to life the now emblematic slogan of Porto Alegre: ‘another world is possible’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a very complex subject which it would be impossible to analyse here, but I would like to focus on what is, in my opinion, the most interesting aspect.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that, after the collapse of the socialist model in Eastern Europe, we are witnessing the beginning of another collapse, the collapse of unbridled neo-capitalism <span class="bold">–</span> which does not take account of the new factors troubling modern society. The initiatives of the Porto Alegre protesters do not, indeed, take the same approach as certain – nonetheless useful – initiatives being pursued by the Commission: rather, they are essentially opposed to a vision of life which does not take account of the fact that these two models – both relics from the nineteenth century – have become obsolete and failed and that our Europe, our world, must now search for a third way which does take certain factors into account. Nowadays, technology leads to unemployment, whereas once upon a time it created employment. Nowadays, we research ways of making life easier for certain neo-capitalist classes, for example by liberalising energy, but we do not study how to resolve the problems of the southern hemisphere.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, the axis of history has shifted, and after 50 years of war between east and west, we are currently experiencing a world crisis revolving around north-south relations. Therefore, if we are to take heed of the message of the Porto Alegre protesters, we must restore the dreams, values and points of reference to Europe, and, above all, we must endow it once again with an awareness of how complex our society is and the ability to find the most modern solution, the most modern way forward for our society between two models which are both limited and inappropriate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Della Vedova (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, for several hundred million people, the world is still a very unpleasant place to be, full of woe, hunger and unspeakable suffering. Without the globalisation of the past 20 years, the exponential increase in the movement of people and capital for commercial purposes, it would have been an even worse place to live. One billion two hundred thousand people live below the poverty threshold – which, I would point out, is a mere USD 1 a day – and I feel that this is the matter weighing on the civil and political consciences of all of us here, and it is right that it should.</p>
<p class="contents">Development aid has been mentioned, and that is all well and good. A dollar a day is what a cow lives on in Europe: I repeat, every cow in Europe receives one dollar a day.</p>
<p class="contents">Well then, provided that the aid has a greater effect than it has done in the past, I feel that it is right to discuss increasing the contributions of the individual wealthy States to 0.7% of GDP for aid. However, in my opinion, there is something else we must do first, and that is to open up our borders to goods from the poorest countries. Commissioner, you mentioned the ‘Everything but arms’ initiative, and rightly so. I would remind you and all the Members, however, that, for products such as rice and bananas – to put it plainly – the barriers will not be removed until 2004 and 2009 respectively. I would point out that, at Doha, the United States and Europe decreed in the WTO that the barriers should not be removed for two sectors which are fundamental for the developing countries: textiles and agriculture. These are precisely the sectors that are in need of liberalisation. I understand what Mr Watson is saying: as I see it, we should avoid a one-dimensional solution or solutions, but I do feel, nevertheless, that there is so much to do in terms of liberalising trade to help the poorest countries that it may well be there that we should focus our efforts initially.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2000, Sub-Saharan Africa received EUR 14 billion of aid from those same countries whose customs duties cost those countries, those communities and those people EUR 20 billion of trade opportunities. In my opinion, that is the initial action Europe should take, and it must take it even before increasing development aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you mentioned Tobin tax. I am glad to say that, as you are quite aware, Tobin tax is impossible to implement and, even if this were not so, we must not forget that trade is stimulated by lowering tariffs, not raising them, and that capital investments in developing countries increase when taxes are removed, not when additional taxes are applied. These countries need fresh investment, just as they need legal infrastructures, the legal infrastructures of the rule of law; this was pointed out in an excellent book by Hernando De Soto, a South American economist who explains that the greatest problem of the poor and developing countries is that their assets are dead capital: capital which is prevented by the absence of the rule of law from being used for the welfare of the people, economic growth, development or, where desired, redistribution of wealth.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that Europe must find solutions to these issues, not shift the debate away from them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Globalisation is certainly the direction that history is moving in. In an increasingly interdependent world, we can do nothing but support this development which is the only thing that will eventually enable us to create a fairer world, a world where there is more solidarity, a less dangerous world. The problem is that globalisation in its current form can not bring this about. It is asymmetric, limited to a few rare sectors, such as transport, communication and finance and in fact only concerns the OECD countries plus a dozen more or less developing countries, whereas the majority of third world countries remain under-developed.</p>
<p class="contents">Two-thirds of world trade is carried out between the countries of the ‘triad’, which also absorb the majority of direct foreign investments. The remainder goes to a few large countries, such as China, India, Brazil and sometimes a few others. The majority of the 190 countries of the world are not party to either world trade or international investments. The multinationals are, in fact, not interested in the great majority of developing countries and are particularly disinterested in the least developed countries. However, their integration in the world economy requires, by necessity, more investment and the transfer of technology to allow endogenous development. Such endogenous development sometimes demands protection for emerging industries or services. All the developed countries have experienced periods of protectionism, although protectionism is, in the long run, detrimental to development. The opening up of markets of developing countries and their integration into a truly global economy must be carried out in a strictly ordered manner. First of all, we need internal consolidation in each country, followed by a gradual opening up to the global market.</p>
<p class="contents">Globalisation, liberalisation and deregulation are not synonymous. Liberalisation calls for new rules – and I agree with Mr Watson on this point – it calls for better rules, particularly for international financial fluctuations. During the second half of the twentieth century, world manufacturing increased six-fold and global trade increased twenty-fold, showing that international trade is necessary for development.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I see that I am running out of time. I would like to end by emphasising the world’s main concern, namely that of finding a solution to the problem of third world debt. If we do not find a solution for this persistent problem, we will never achieve sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is we Europeans who should be concerned about this new reality, and we cannot play down the social demonstrations that express this concern, which, disgracefully, Mr Aznar has just done with regard to the demonstration that is due to take place this week in Barcelona.</p>
<p class="contents">The countries of the Union already form the greatest economic power in the world, but on its path to becoming a universal political body, the Union must not express its economic power by dominating the sectarian and blind ultraliberal market or by simply imitating the military hegemony of the United States, and these are temptations into which some European Prime Ministers are falling. What we should be doing instead is defending the values and the social and democratic achievements that form the best part of our history, and we should maintain a presence in the world as a factor for peace and for progress, in an action which, as Commissioner Solbes knows, must be a great deal more ambitious than the action presented today by the Commission.

I would remind many of the Members that, in the 1970s, the feminist<span class="bold"> </span>movement used to be described as a social jamboree whereas it was actually highly political in nature. One of the striking things about this movement is precisely the involvement of many women and young people.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I feel that there is cause for concern in the fact that, after the initial reactions to 11 September, American politicians seem to be light-years away from that heightened state of general awareness that had appeared to make them more open to the world in respect of a number of issues such as the environment, Kyoto, food safety, trade, arms issues and also the form of action to be taken to fight terrorism, which has proved to be chiefly military. I feel that we must convince American society, and American politicians too, that this line will not get them anywhere: that is Europe’s mission. Apart from anything else, it is surprising that no United States congressman attended the forum. We must persuade them to be more open.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I feel that Commissioner Solbes is right to say that the ‘Everything but arms’ initiative is not enough and I believe there is another question to be raised, in addition to that of the opening up of trade. We cannot continue to be so racist in our treatment of these countries. We must start to take into consideration the fact that agriculture is more than just an export for them too: it is part of their market, their environment and their way of living and provides their food. I do not think we will get very far if we do not change our approach. Europe has the potential to do a great deal, but those Members may be right who say that it needs to carry out a considerable amount of self-analysis: not only in terms of what it fails to give as regards development aid, but what it fails to give by refusing to change its policies too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time as a weak and unimaginative summit was being held in New York, attended by financiers and decision-makers, the so-called winners, in short, all kinds of wealthy people, three lively forums were being held, for the second time, in Porto Alegre which was the true alternative to Davos. The three forums were attended by people from towns, from civil society and by parliamentarians, who cast a critical eye over the whole world. And this is how – and I sympathise with my colleague from the Liberal party, as the Greens are very happy to do this – the inventiveness of future governance is being created.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, therefore, everyone in New York was shedding crocodile tears over the attacks of 11 September, not so much because of the unfortunate people who lost their lives but because of the resultant economic downturn. On the other hand, in Brazil, everyone was genuinely turning their attention to the real risks of terrorism and the poverty-stricken situation of poor countries to try to find helpful solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">If I have to mention some of the highlights, ladies and gentlemen, I would choose a debt tribunal, which is lending support throughout the crisis in Argentina, which outlined the extent of the devastating effects caused by the structural adjustment policies and the burden of debt. This is a subject to which Europe should give greater attention. Europe must assist the countries of the South in making their voice heard at the UN, so that the interests of debt-ravaged countries are finally taken into account, and not simply the interests of the creditor countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We are still waiting for the European Union to unilaterally abolish the debts of the countries of the south. This would be a strong signal, which would be meaningful. Commissioner, I believe that you could send this signal. Most importantly, I attended the parliamentary forum for the second year running and was pleased to see that many Members of the European Parliament had travelled to Porto Alegre to build up this global network of parliamentarians who support social movements.</p>
<p class="contents">The more of us who gather from different political and geographical backgrounds, the better we can convey the message of the people; the more of us who already have the legitimate right to universal suffrage, the easier we can influence governments that are all too often more concerned about taking up a seat at a New York-style Davos Summit than about understanding the legitimate ideas of the world’s population.</p>
<p class="contents">Rest assured, then, that we returned inspired by our discussions and by the contacts we made at the social forum. We shall therefore continue to press the Commission and the Council on challenging subjects such as the feasibility of the Tobin-style tax, the overwhelming responsibilities of the rich countries in the area of climate change, the right of the Palestinian and the Israeli people to live in freedom and in dignity, the right of everyone to a basic aspect of safety, food safety, which is the right to sufficient food and to have access to drinking water. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is essentially a civil society that is challenging current forms of globalisation and the forces that dominate it. I do not believe, however, that we can describe the majority in this movement as anti-globalisation. Quite the opposite. This is a movement that aspires to a different kind of globalisation, which is beginning to create a globalisation of solidarity and which is calling for a globalisation of rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this movement is diverse and, as previous speakers have said, we can make ironic comments as to its diversity, as we have done with other social movements. Ultimately, however, it is diverse because society throughout the world is diverse and this may be exactly why it is interesting in comparison to Davos, where one has the impression that the approaches taken are somewhat unilateral. It is diverse, but it increasingly expresses a convergence of views which are taking shape in the form of a number of common aspirations. These include an environmental aspiration versus the risk of the blind destruction of natural resources, the biosphere, biodiversity; an aspiration for north-south solidarity versus growing inequality in development; a social aspiration when faced with the submission of all economic and social life to a solely market-driven and financial logic, as well as an aspiration for democracy and transparency towards international institutions which play an increasingly important role in global affairs. Europe must lend support to this emerging civil society, to this movement, in order to put forward its ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">After the events of 11 September, we were told that nothing would ever be the same again. And we thought that the belief would take hold that we should use the same energy and the same force to combat unbalanced development in today’s world that we used to combat the terrorist groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, as you have said, many industrialised countries, including some Members of the European Union, will arrive in Monterey empty-handed – full of promises to finally respect their commitments – but without any new instruments. That is why I believe that we must look carefully at the new proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take, for example, the taxation of international financial transactions. Professor Span of Frankfurt University, a former IMF consultant, has presented a study to the German government. I think that the committee which examined it should consider the possibilities which, according to this expert, would enable us to organise redistribution from a Tobin-type tax, which would make it possible to begin to finance access, throughout the world, to global state assets, the right to water, the right to clean energy for all, the right to education, the right to a future. I think that we should encourage the idea of global cohesion funds, as we do within the Union when we welcome countries lagging behind in their development. We do not simply tell them to participate in a larger market. We tell them to participate in a common undertaking. The vision of competition alone cannot prevail. There must also be the vision of ‘living together’, of solidarity between rich regions and poorer regions, and of access for everyone to a number of fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what the European Union should be promoting, as well as a multi-polar world. We should help Mercosur to be a democratic entity and more independent of the United States, and establish this regulation for citizens in view of the risks of the abolition of civil societies crushed by sheer market forces. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Reference was made repeatedly to both New York and Porto Alegre. In my opinion, both forums are one-sided. If you only had ears for what was said at New York, then too much attention would go to the Enrons of this world, to the detriment of the poor. If, on the other hand, you were to focus on what has been said at Porto Alegre, the economy would soon grind to a halt, for people would then forget to conduct business and that not everything can be solved with Tobin Taxes and magic potions of this kind. That is simply impossible. The majority in this House has therefore repeatedly rejected the Tobin Taxes. This is why we are pleased with the Commission’s conclusions on this score.</p>
<p class="contents">So are there no problems at all? There are, but we should not overlook the fact that governance in the countries themselves forms one of the crucial problems. At the moment, we have two examples to illustrate this. One is Afghanistan, where we noticed that the Taliban did not particularly contribute to the development of that country, or their environment. But in Zimbabwe, where elections are currently being held, Mr Mugabe does not contribute to the development of his country either. It is, of course, impossible to expect the international community to rectify the errors of the Taliban and Mugabe overnight. That is a big problem. Unfortunately, the majority of the leaders in this world are still dictators or quasi-dictators, and it saddens me that this is sometimes overlooked.</p>
<p class="contents">If, therefore, local government fails to deliver the goods, if the rule of law in a specific country is not respected, then it is simply impossible to expect economic development. This is absolutely out of the question, and anyone who thinks differently believes in fairy tales, in my view. In this connection, quite a few fairy tales have been told here, not by everyone, of course, but by quite a few. Well, if you accept that, then you can also appreciate the restrictions that are simply inherent in international governance.</p>
<p class="contents">National governance must be in order, including our own national governance and our European governance. This is why so much is riding on Barcelona. If we achieve good results there, we will enhance our contribution. This does not mean that things will automatically improve globally, but it does mean that we can, at any rate, make our contribution. It is in this light that we should see this, and miracle remedies such as the Tobin Tax would not be effective, because we would then be automatically funding the Mugabes of this world, which would be totally unacceptable and a waste of taxpayers’ money. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I would like to thank all the speakers this afternoon for their contributions. I will try to make a few comments, which must be general, on the various contributions which have been made today because we cannot go into more detail given the time available.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I think we all agree that the current model we are following is creating a drift towards totally unacceptable unilateral models. We must insist on this point. Globalisation has rules which absolutely must be respected; otherwise, any globalisation process is obviously doomed to failure, and unilateral movements will have serious problems promoting the advantages of globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the process of globalisation – I think we all agree – has brought benefits to economic development; the problem is that it also has drawbacks and consequently our work does not consist – or should not consist – of attacking globalisation, but of attacking a certain model of globalisation or the negative aspects of a certain model of globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">When the Commission analysed these issues – which is the reason why I have jointly presented its three reports – it reached the conclusion that the concept of globalisation must include, as a minimum, the elements which relate to the existence of an international financial system which works efficiently, development aid systems and the elements relating to the environment and sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">Having heard your comments, I am going to refer to each of these issues: firstly, development aid. We all agree that we should concentrate on the fight against poverty as a fundamental element of development aid and that the problem of development aid is not only a problem of quantity but also of quality. In this respect, I am completely in favour of the ideas for improving governance in some of these countries, which is a key element in improving the functioning of that development aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, improving the quality of development aid must not lead us to forget its quantity, and we must acknowledge that it is still insufficient. It is true that we may run the risk of the Commission’s relatively pragmatic proposal of reaching a minimum of 0.33% for the countries of the Union by 2006 not being accepted. In any event, other third countries do not accept this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">We are forgetting an issue which is fundamental to the whole process of future development: capital investment. Direct investments are playing a fundamental role in the whole process of development, and elements such as governance play a key and fundamental role in it, as do – as some of you have said – all the elements relating to better transfers of technology and any other element which allows for more appropriate development in these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a very specific comment on debt: it is true that the European Union has made a fundamental effort in relation to the cancelling of ACP countries’ debts. At the moment, the Union’s contribution has been greater than EUR 1 000 million and therefore the initial objective is heading in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Is this sufficient? Possibly not. We probably have to consider more ambitious elements. In our report on globalisation we consider what are the possible systems for finding more resources with a view to dealing with the development processes. I absolutely agree with those people who have said that the solutions must not be simplistic. Unfortunately, we have not found any one single solution which would solve all the problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that, on the aspects relating to globalisation, support for development and the environment, we must move ahead together and at the same time, without forgetting one fundamental approach: the one stemming from the Doha commitments. Trade plays a fundamental role, as does the transfer of investments, in development aid, and it must be carried out in a more equitable way in the future. For the negotiation stemming from Doha it is not only essential to defend our points of view as the European Union, but the developing countries must also defend theirs.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, as well as the ‘Everything but arms’ initiative, the Commission has proposed technical aid initiatives for these countries, so that they can better defend their interests and ultimately achieve a fairer system.</p>
<p class="contents">All the elements combined will allow us to improve, but in a few years time we will continue to discuss the necessary challenges of globalisation. We must implement an approach which leads towards a fairer society, although that is a long-term objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
