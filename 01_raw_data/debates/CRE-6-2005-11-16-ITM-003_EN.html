<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lord Bach, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, this debate comes at a critical stage in Iraq’s political transition. When this Parliament last discussed Iraq with the Commission and Council in July, Iraq’s political leaders were in the process of negotiating a new constitution. One month ago, Iraqis voted to approve that constitution which would, for the first time ever, provide them with guarantees on their freedom, security and human rights. The constitutional referendum marks a further step by the Iraqi people on the road to democracy, freedom and peace.</p>
<p class="contents">In one month’s time they will vote again, this time to elect a new government that will need quickly to tackle important tasks such as planning and delivering much-needed services that will provide hope for a brighter and better future for millions of Iraqis.</p>
<p class="contents">Last month’s referendum was remarkable in many ways. Along with January’s elections, it provided Iraqis with their first real taste of democracy. They participated, for the first time, in political decisions that will affect their own, and their country’s, future. It was humbling, particularly for those of us who come from countries which often take our freedoms and democracy for granted, to see the courage and determination of those who exercised their democratic rights and took part in the voting, braving difficult conditions and the threat of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">European Union support for the constitutional referendum had a significant impact. The Commissioner will in a moment no doubt detail the valuable assistance which the Commission provided to the process in support of the Independent Electoral Commission for Iraq and of the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations has played, and continues to play, a key and outstanding supporting role in the constitutional review and election processes. The United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq played a vital role in assisting the Iraqi Electoral Commission under the most difficult of circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision to approve the Constitution paved the way for December’s general election. This should represent another major step in the political transition that will eventually lead to Iraq assuming its full role in the international community. Iraq is, of course, still some way from achieving that aspiration. Although a large majority of voters voted in favour of the constitution, the results of the referendum show there are still substantial divisions to be overcome between Iraq’s ethnic communities. A review of the constitution will take place early in the new government’s tenure. This offers an important opportunity for Iraqis to forge a broader consensus on the future of their country, and will assist the creation of an inclusive political system.</p>
<p class="contents">Iraq’s political leaders will need to resolve key issues, including federalism, dealing with its political past, and the management of natural resources. Dissatisfaction also threatens the election process. It feeds the sense of frustration and disenfranchisement that some communities feel. It also breeds the sympathy which extremists and terrorists use to justify maintaining the cycle of violence and the insurgency. It is imperative, therefore, that Iraq’s political, ethnic and religious leaders do all they can to address these issues. We hope that the new parliament and government is as representative and as inclusive as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to international assistance to Iraq’s process of political transition, the EU and the wider international community have already provided significant and valuable support. I look forward to the Commissioner describing the Commission’s invaluable and ongoing assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention an important step taken towards closer partnership between the EU and Iraq through the signature of the Joint EU-Iraq Political Declaration on 21 September. This paves the way for regular political dialogue with Iraq on issues of mutual interest, such as promotion of good governance, protection of human rights and conflict prevention and resolution. During that visit, the Iraqi Government stressed how much it values the EU’s assistance, particularly in supporting the constitutional and electoral processes and work to improve capacity in the rule of law sector, including through the EUJUST LEX mission.</p>
<p class="contents">Many neighbouring countries and other regional players are making concerted efforts to engage constructively. In particular we welcome the Arab League’s suggestion to work with Iraq in holding a National Dialogue Conference early next year. A preparatory meeting is due to take place in Cairo in a few days’ time, on 19 November. This meeting has the potential to lay the foundations for post-election international engagement and support for the new government.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has strongly urged regional states, in particular Syria, to support the political process in Iraq. This includes cooperating with Iraq to prevent cross-border transit and support for terrorists and insurgents.</p>
<p class="contents">As we approach this landmark election we should consider what implications the formation of a new and long-term Iraqi Government might hold for our engagement with Iraq. Our first objective must be to continue to provide support for the election process. The Iraq Government has specifically requested this. The EU will provide support to the election monitoring process, including through supporting the work of domestic election observers. I know that some of you were present in Iraq for the January elections. I hope that it will again be possible for Members of this Parliament to show their support for Iraq’s aspiring parliamentarians in December.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already said that the review of the constitution during the early part of the new government’s tenure will be key. The EU stands ready to support actively these important efforts, and is well placed to provide expert advice and technical assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">In the longer term, we also need to continue support for the vital rule of law sector and consider its enhancement. The EU is playing a leading role by becoming a supporting donor of the rule of law sector working group, which aims to coordinate donor and government activity in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s rule of law mission for Iraq, EUJUST LEX, is due to reach the end of its mandate at the end of June 2006. The Iraqi Government has asked for the programme to be extended and expanded to include wider training of judicial, police and prison officers. The Council is considering how to respond.</p>
<p class="contents">Strengthening respect for human rights is also key. Iraq has asked for help in developing its capacity to implement human rights principles and to accede to key human rights conventions. The European Union is uniquely placed to provide this support and advice, and the EU stands ready to offer further support in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the EU and Iraq hope to broaden and enhance their partnership further, as the political process goes forward, through the establishment of contractual political dialogue and other appropriate contractual relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say once again that as Iraq approaches this milestone in its political transition, now is the time for the international community to provide its full support to the Iraqi people. The European Union, along with others in the international community are, and should continue to be – as in so many other developing and recovering countries – at the forefront of reconstruction and development. I look forward to discussing this with Parliament and hearing honourable Members’ views.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Benita Ferrero-Waldner, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, it is almost exactly four months since we first discussed Iraq, as Lord Bach has said. I remember saying then that for the Iraqis the hard work was only beginning. I truly meant it.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the Iraqis have a constitution. They will soon elect a constitutional government. But today Iraqis are also aware of substantial divisions that still need to be overcome in the country. They are now facing two very critical challenges: on the one hand, ensuring inclusive electoral consultations in December and, on the other hand, after doing that, carrying out a comprehensive review of the constitution, which has to be more inclusive.</p>
<p class="contents">We stood by the Iraqis during the constitutional process and will also do so during the preparation of the election process and the elections. By providing another EUR 20 million in support, the Commission was the sole supporter of the United Nations and the UN-led constitutional support project. We feel part of a process that allowed the Iraqis to have their say on the constitution by casting their ballots on the referendum day.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the elections, you surely remember how hopeful I was in July that we could also dispatch an electoral observation mission. But today we must accept the evidence that the security conditions do not allow it. This does not, however, prevent us from assisting in other equally effective ways. We are providing EUR 30 million to the UN electoral support project. While I speak, several European electoral experts are working side-by-side with the Independent Electoral Commission for Iraq and with the UN to ensure proper preparation of the elections and also to set up a transparent domestic monitoring system.</p>
<p class="contents">But the road leading to democracy and peace in Iraq does not end with elections. Inevitably, it crosses the path of regional cooperation. Iraq, its neighbours and the other states in the region are called upon to play a key role by strengthening good neighbourly relations and by cooperating to improve regional security. I am very happy to say that the Secretary-General of the Arab League, Mr Amre Moussa, has also gone there now and that there will be a conference next year, together with the Arabs, in order to enhance this relationship that has been hampered in the last few years.</p>
<p class="contents">Iraq will be a federal Iraq. Functional central institutions will be set up to support the state structure that the Iraqis themselves have chosen. To that end, suitable legislative and institutional frameworks need to be established. Viable solutions will have to be identified rapidly to ensure continued progress towards stability and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Inclusiveness is absolutely the only way forward. We shall also consider how best we, the European Union, can help the building-up of institutions that favour an inclusive approach. We shall also encourage the efforts of the Arab League and others in the region – such as Jordan, for instance – to promote inclusiveness and national reconciliation. I am convinced that the recent visit of Kofi Annan has had a positive effect in advancing that understanding among different parties.</p>
<p class="contents">The political process and stability in Iraq is important for all of us and for its neighbours. The recent events in Jordan very clearly remind us of the importance of succeeding in this inclusive approach, which is crucial for the whole political stabilisation of the region. For the Iraqi citizens, it is very important that they really have the feeling of freedom and can exercise their freedom. In this regard, we shall not forget that most Iraqis are still struggling for their children to go to school, for their hospitals to be opened in order to fight the most ordinary diseases, for access to water, jobs – the basics – and for their livelihood. It is an unsustainable situation for any people in any country, and therefore also for the people of Iraq. Their needs will continue to be at the core of our assistance to Iraq in 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to elaborate on what we have been doing. We have supported the political process. In addition, we, together with the United States, have co-hosted a very important conference – the Iraq International Conference – in Brussels on 22 June. That was instrumental in mobilising international support from over 80 countries and organisations for the Iraqi transitional government and for the institutions for the transitional period before the December elections. We have also always assisted in reconstruction: we delivered an assistance package of EUR 580 million through the International Reconstruction Fund for Iraq. We have always tried to work towards meeting the basic needs of the population such as water, sanitation, healthcare and job creation. We are also working together with two ministries – the energy and trade ministries – on institution-building.</p>
<p class="contents">For the future, we want to support the political process for the election. We also want to set up joint working groups in areas of common interest such as trade and energy. We want to support the WTO accession request, initiate negotiations for an EU-Iraq agreement on trade and cooperation and progress on the opening of the Commission delegation in Baghdad in 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union has much to offer beyond supporting the reconstruction process. We want to be a meaningful partner for Iraq. The Iraqis are looking forward to that. We shall meet their expectations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first comment concerns the Commissioner's last sentence. The European Union does indeed have much more to offer beyond reconstruction and our problem is how we can translate this very interesting idea into specific policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The second comment concerns the vote on the constitution. I too agree that the vote for the constitution, despite the fact that an important group did not respond, is an important event. An important event which, however, still leaves certain very important problems outstanding, such as the issue and the role of religion, the federal model, the national identity and access to natural resources, especially oil.</p>
<p class="contents">The third comment concerns the elections. The elections are indeed very, very important, especially as the new parliament will turn its attention – as the constitution says – not only to revising the constitution, but also to the manner in which certain of its provisions are applied.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth comment concerns a matter which, unfortunately, despite efforts, despite the democratisation process, is still outstanding. It is the matter of security. I do not wish to reopen a debate which has been held in Parliament, in the Council and in every Member State. However, I do wish to say this: there are a great many investigations, many of which have also been published, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in newspapers in your country, which raise the question of the continuing presence of foreign military forces in Iraq. I refer here, and this is my last point, to the proposal which we debated in the European Parliament: I think the time has come to replace the foreign military forces in Iraq with a UN peacekeeping force. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Allow me, though, to return to an unsavoury point.</p>
<p class="contents">A short time before the start of the war in Iraq, General Morillon put the European Parliament on its guard by saying: ‘there is no such thing as a clean war’. One might have hoped, though, that a war of independence might be less dirty than others. It is no such thing. After the terrible images of the invasion and the scandal of the Abu Ghraib prison, there is now the controversial issue of the white phosphorous bombs allegedly used in the siege of Falluja, a rebel town, but also a martyred town.</p>
<p class="contents">Our history taught us that no kind of peace could be built in a country by hiding the atrocities committed there. It is here that an investigation and quest for the truth are required. The formal democracy seeking to establish itself in Iraq and the relations with this country we are seeking to reconstruct come up against the following obvious fact: ‘there can be no democracy without truth’.</p>
<p class="contents">Saddam Hussein will be judged for the crimes he committed and, in all likelihood, for using chemical weapons against the Kurds in 1991. That is a simple matter of justice. The truth about the siege of Falluja, about its burned martyrs and about where the responsibility lies regarding the use of weapons banned by the 1980 Geneva Convention are also part of what we must contribute to the Iraqi people in addition to our material aid. We are going to help them to create their justice system: this is what is known as capacity building. Yet, can we really succeed in this undertaking if we do not also make them feel that justice, and especially international justice, exist? I therefore call on you, Mr President, Commissioner, to demand of the coalition forces that a completely independent investigation be carried out and that justice be served.</p>
<p class="contents">We have requested in due time that Saddam Hussein be tried by the International Criminal Court. The crime against humanity that the use of chemical weapons in Falluja would constitute, if proven, would fully warrant this move. Yet, if we, in this House, think that all of this is just a pipe dream, then what message of hope can we give today to the Iraqi people? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet after two years and eight months of war, the deaths of countless Iraqis and over 2 000 coalition troops, it is clear that life in Iraq is little better than before. Baghdad was statistically the world’s worst place to live even before the security situation deteriorated. How much worse now that civilian casualties run at more than 60 a day and insurgent attacks have almost trebled in 18 months. It is difficult to know whether the persistent presence of coalition troops under these conditions is a help or a hindrance in the restoration of normality.</p>
<p class="contents">I fear I detect an air of complacency in the Council’s statement today and surprising optimism from the Commission. There have been notable successes on the road to democracy. Iraqis now have their own constitution; they have their own security forces, and in December they will have a democratically elected government. There are even signs that Sunni Arabs are moving into politics and preparing to contest the election, such as the formation last week of the National Public Democratic Movement in the province of Anbar.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, Europeans have a number of serious concerns. There are signs of widening instability in the region. Evidence of gross human rights violations, including torture and the systematic use of arbitrary arrest, has badly damaged the coalition’s standing. That has helped recruit many to the insurgents’ cause.</p>
<p class="contents">I have three specific concerns. First, the Pentagon’s acknowledgement a few hours ago that the US used phosphorous incendiary devices in Fallujah. The European Union must demand a UN inquiry into the use of these banned weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, yesterday’s revelation in sections of the media that of the more than 35 000 Iraqi civilians detained by the coalition, only 5% have ever been brought to trial and many have been denied legal counsel. What kind of example are we setting?</p>
<p class="contents">Third, the European Union Member States need a clear exit strategy. If we want to stop violent insurgents continuing to gain at the expense of moderate Iraqis, what is needed – and what the Blair-Bush alliance has always lacked – is a clear end-game.</p>
<p class="contents">Europeans disagreed on the rationale for going into Iraq. We must not be divided on the conditions for leaving. We must talk to the Arab League, the Iraqi authorities and other Middle Eastern governments with a view to establishing the terms and timing of our departure that will leave Iraq a more stable and secure place.</p>
<p class="contents">President Talabani has already made it clear that the Iraqi people are, and I quote, ‘looking forward to the day when we can say goodbye to the forces of the coalition’. Europe must work towards that goal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would, though, like to focus on something that Lord Bach said, to the effect that we Europeans want to take a leading role where democracy and human rights in Iraq are concerned. I have to tell Lord Bach that we must, in that case, have the courage and strength to tell our NATO partners that they must refrain from constantly breaching international law and to ensure that they do not, and we must give an assurance to this effect.</p>
<p class="contents">What lessons can we learn from Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo? To this day, the prisoners in Guantanamo have no rights and no legal protection. They are kept under appalling conditions. Can we, then, be all that horrified by the fact that those in positions of power in Iraq are also setting up prisons in secret? In what sense are the international community and the EU setting a democratic example? It is no more than cynical for Rumsfeld to enact new rules on torture stating that dogs may no longer, in future, be used in torture and interrogations, with not a word about compliance with the Geneva Convention. Those are the things about which I expect statements to be made.</p>
<p class="contents">Do you know what white phosphorus is? Do you know about the effects of white phosphorus, which the Americans now admit to having used in Fallujah? It is a form of arson, with people as its victims, and there is no antidote, no means of putting the fire out – not even water can do it. It is a means of extermination that is contrary to international law, and it is means such as this that have been deployed.</p>
<p class="contents">Lord Bach, you may have spent nine and a half minutes accentuating the positive, but you will carry no conviction unless and until you demand that the EU and the Council – particularly when it is being presided over by the British – commit themselves to getting the Americans to at last sign the international Convention, for unless we do that, we will not regain our international credibility and whatever instruments are applied, no matter with how much effort, will be ineffective. It is for that reason that I call upon you to ensure that there are not just investigations, but that the Americans also sign the international convention specifically outlawing the use of white phosphorus. Failing that, we will be unable to actively promote peace in Iraq. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Rather than provide support to Iraq’s opposition in good time, it was decided that there would be an intervention from outside on the basis of false arguments and without the UN’s approval. The way in which the superpower’s views and interests have been imposed, by force and unilaterally, has caused part of the Shiite majority to turn their backs on the Western occupiers and seek recourse to an Iran-style theocratic dictatorship.</p>
<p class="contents">The good thing is that it has now proved possible to put an end to the situation in which the Kurdish north and the Shiite south were occupied lands oppressed by the central area surrounding Baghdad. The federalism inherent in the new constitution protects disadvantaged areas against oppression and exploitation, and so 80% of the population stand to benefit. A democracy in the new federal states can only succeed if the foreign military and the predominance of foreign companies withdraw from that country sooner rather than later.</p>
<p class="contents">Staying on is a fresh provocation that continues to incite protests. When will the military presence of the EU Member States come to an end and in what ways is the EU helping Iraq to find its domestic solutions, thus ousting Halliburton, a failing American company that cannot repair the public utilities? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Simply compare this three-day voting period with that country’s experience under the 35 years of the Ba'athist regime, with no elections whatsoever for the first 12 years and mock elections for the rest. What a contrast and what political progress! We do not get to hear anything about this in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">To be sure, Mesopotamia’s reconstruction continues to be threatened from within and without, as it was before. That is why the future of a federal Iraq looks very fragile.

<p class="contents">I would ask the Council and Commission what the European Union could do for the Iraqi state and people in this precarious situation. Firstly, we must exert firm pressure on Baghdad’s neighbours so as not to fan the flames of terrorism across the border. Secondly, we must help lay the foundation of democratic rule of law along the banks of the Tigris. ‘We must learn from the Europeans, and we do indeed want to’, said my Iraqi friend, full of optimism.

<p class="contents">It is a success story for the Iraqi people, who have shown through their turnout in the elections that they want to play an important part in establishing peace in the Middle East. At the cost of great sacrifices and hundreds of innocent victims, those who uphold democracy are winning the battle against the small minority who practise terrorism in the name of fundamentalism. The final goal has not yet been achieved, however, and much remains to be done to defeat Al Qaeda and its allies and to bring permanent stability to Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">Having survived a number of splits, the European Union has begun to make an important contribution, albeit belatedly. I agree with what the Council representative and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner have just said. Nevertheless, we have to do even more for the Iraqi people, in conjunction, of course, with the United Nations, which, through Resolution 1546, has enabled 35 countries to make a significant contribution to the birth of that new democracy. Their contribution is not only financial, as in the case of the democracy fund set up by the United Nations, but also political and military.</p>
<p class="contents">Many Europeans are taking part in the peace mission, and we should be grateful to them for what they have done and are still doing – including risking their own lives – in order to make a fundamental contribution to the resurrection of Iraq. These people, soldiers and civilians alike, among whom are a great many Italians, have breathed life into thousands of projects to develop infrastructure in the fields of agriculture, transport, education and culture.</p>
<p class="contents">This successful strategy is leading to cuts in the numbers of troops, who will be leaving Iraq under an agreement between them and the legitimate government in Baghdad. Many of those who criticised the peace mission are today having second thoughts and realising how important it has been.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall finish, Mr President, by pointing out that it would be a mistake to think that resolving the Iraqi crisis will be enough to bring peace to the Middle East. We still have to solve the Israeli-Palestinian crisis, with the European Union playing an important role, by guaranteeing security for Israel and creating a Palestinian state. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us finally take a close look at the real situation. The Kurds turned out to vote because they glimpsed independence for their province on the horizon; the Shi’a did so to obey their religious leaders; and the few Sunni who voted did so to avoid being completely sidelined in the reorganisation of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic conditions needed to allow democracy to put down roots are economic security, a state apparatus that works and equality for all citizens under the law. The reality is that the project to export democracy on the wings of fighter-bombers has failed and the Western powers’ military occupation of the country now stands in the way of any solid, tangible progress.</p>
<p class="contents">From another perspective, Iraq has become an exporting country, and not just of oil. The attacks in Jordan are proof: Iraq now exports its terrorism. The suicide bombers who blew themselves up were in fact Iraqis. A woman who was supposed to take part in the attacks but survived has explained that her family was decimated during the American offensives in the Sunni triangle. Therefore, I too strongly call for a UN investigation into the use of banned white phosphorus bombs by the American forces.</p>
<p class="contents">Iraq is thus looking dangerously like another Afghanistan. President Bush wanted to fight the terrorists in Afghanistan so that he would not have to do so elsewhere, but today the terrorists already are elsewhere, and we wonder just how far they will go. Europe thus has to face two challenges, namely the obtuseness of those who still claim that the Iraqi campaign has been a success, and the murderous determination of those who demonstrate every day that it has been a tragic failure.</p>

The development of the country clearly opens the door to a future partnership between Iraq and the European Union, particularly in the context of the EU’s Neighbourhood Policy and of peace in the Mashreq region and, in this regard, I thank Mrs Ferrero-Waldner for the commitments made on behalf of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a great number of issues at stake for this partnership: the democratic stabilisation of the country; the creation of a real, and no longer formal, rule of law; respect for fundamental freedoms and minority rights, and yet also the transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy and from a state-controlled to a market economy; the allocation of oil resources to diversification promoting agriculture, industry and services; and, finally, the reconstruction of the education and health care systems destroyed by so many years of authoritarian rule, embargoes and war.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of prerequisites for this partnership, however. Iraq’s as yet uncertain development calls for us to exercise the utmost vigilance. We cannot just dismiss the use of white phosphorous bombs by the Americans in Falluja – if the information turns out to be true. An investigation must be carried out. Replacing the foreign forces with a peacekeeping presence under the aegis of the United Nations features among our objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The December elections must enable the Iraqi people to elect a government and a parliament that are representative of the human and political balances in the country. In this regard, the federal institutional framework seems particularly suitable. Curbing types of fundamentalism, combating the theory of the so-called clash of civilisations and building this entire Mashreq region upon the foundations of shared values are the goals that the European Union must be given. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Iraq Body Count, a British research group, has estimated on the basis of news agency and newspaper reports that over 30 000 Iraqis have been killed, with other estimates placing the number of victims at 100 000.</p>
<p class="contents">Constitutional ratification is a major step towards the reconstruction of Iraq. Two hundred and twenty-five political groups and coalitions have registered for the parliamentary elections due to be held on 15 December, and the parliament will elect a new government by 31 December of this year. This democratically elected parliament, which will include Sunni members, will be able to make amendments to the constitution over the next six months.</p>
<p class="contents">The constitutional referendum held in Iraq gives us further reason to hope that Islam and the concept of liberal democracy can be reconciled in the Middle East and Central Asia in the shape of a so-called Muslim democracy. The period of rule of interim and transitional governments is coming to an end in the country, and a democratic political culture is emerging in its wake. At the same time, however, the situation continues to be characterised by incessant terrorist attacks and the constant possibility that civil war could break out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is indeed, if you look no further than the degree of participation and the arithmetic aspects of the results. However, I fear that everyone is shaping their own fictitious reality for Iraq. However, we cannot ignore the actual reality in Iraq, because the serious security vacuum continues to exist. Instead of the centrifugal trends of the national and religious communities gradually weakening, they are strengthening and undermining the objective of the national unity, identity and sovereignty of Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of Sunnis are consciously outside political processes. The process of political reconstruction is leading to the creation of a loose state of at least three speeds. On the one hand, we welcome progress towards a democratic Iraq and, on the other hand, a theocratic Shiite regime is being established in the south and the quasi-independence of the Kurds is being established in the north.</p>
<p class="contents">The consequences for peace and stability are obvious. Under these conditions elections are being planned to promote the new Iraqi parliament. However, I fear that the wishes and hopes being expressed here today do not correspond to the harsh reality of the military occupation and the serious strategic mistakes which the United States continues to make.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an old saying in Arabic: 'Better a hundred years of tyranny than one year of chaos'. While the tyranny of the Hussein regime has been overturned, the conditions being created on a daily basis are pushing Iraq into long-term chaos. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an issue that raises passions and strong views and we have heard them expressed around the Chamber this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I hope we can agree on two aspects at least. Firstly, on how excellent and what a good thing it is that Saddam Hussein is no longer in power in Iraq. Secondly, we can agree that any human rights abuses that have been shown to have been committed since he fell from power should be investigated and dealt with in a proper and sensible way.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very grateful for what the Commissioner had to say and for the excellent work of the Commission. It is right to point out that the EU has contributed to the UN Office of Constitutional Support both financially and through the provision of experts. The Iraqi Government has requested that the EU provide election monitors and, whilst the full election observation mission would, as the Commissioner said, not be possible at the moment, the Council will look closely at what we can do to monitor and support the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as human rights are concerned, the Council’s conclusions following the external relations meeting on 7 November emphasised the importance of full respect for human rights in Iraq. The Council underlined the EU’s strong opposition to the use of the death penalty. It noted with concern recent reports – including by the United Nations – of human rights violations by the Iraqi security forces and urged the Iraqi Government to address these allegations. The EU stands ready to offer further support.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Council welcomed the improvement in the human rights situation since the fall of Saddam Hussein and condemned, as we all should, the atrocities of terrorists since then.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of coalition troops has been raised during the debate and it is certainly an important issue. However, honourable Members will forgive me if I mention what President Talabani, the Kurdish leader whose people suffered so appallingly under Saddam Hussein, said only last weekend: ‘Immediate withdrawal would be a catastrophe and lead to a kind of civil war. We will lose what we have done for liberating Iraq from the worst kind of dictatorship ... Instead of having a democratic, stable Iraq, we will have a civil war in Iraq, we will have troubles in Iraq and they will affect all the Middle East’. That seems to me an important statement by the President of Iraq at the present time.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of Iraq have demonstrated great commitment to democracy. They turned out in their millions and in the most difficult of circumstances to approve a new Constitution that will guide their country and protect their rights. If this momentum can be carried through to the December elections, then I believe Iraq could be on the verge of a major turning point and, with the election of a new government, Iraq enters a new phase.</p>
<p class="contents">The leaders of Iraq’s first constitutionally elected government will owe a huge debt of responsibility to its people. They will place their trust and their future in the hands of those leaders and those leaders must respect that trust. That means putting the nation’s interests above political and personal ambition or ethnic or religious interests. The new government has to be truly representative if it is to survive.</p>
<p class="contents">It also must waste no time in getting down to business. That means ensuring security, health, education, employment and, of course, human rights. Terrorism and insecurity remain the biggest obstacles to political progress and reconstruction.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not underestimate the challenges that lie ahead, and I do not think this Parliament does. There is still a lot to be done and huge dangers that we all know about still threaten these processes. This fledgling democracy will require support for some time to come. The international community has done a lot already and the EU has a proud record: it has joined with the UN and others in committing significant resources to supporting the political transition and reconstruction.</p>
<p class="contents">We all have valuable expertise and experience of democracy-building to share. The Iraqi Government has expressed its appreciation for the significant contribution of the EU and it has asked for more. We should not let Iraq down. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot continue looking backwards. We have to build a stable Iraq now and, although Mr Watson is correct in saying I emphasised the positive things we have been doing, it is also absolutely clear that the underlying situation is very difficult. That is why I said we cannot send to Iraq an election observation mission which otherwise I would have provided. It is too dangerous for our people and they would not be able to do their job properly.</p>
<p class="contents">What would the alternative be? In fact we have no alternative other than to try to work together. Of course, the challenge is absolutely enormous, and I consider that the Iraqi Government and its people have shown great courage in this. What my colleague has just said is true. The outcome of the election was quite encouraging and really astonishing under these difficult circumstances. This shows that the average Iraqi wants stability and peace, but there is also a minority, a very strong minority, which is of course extremist and radical, that is trying to undermine all the efforts made by the international community and the Iraqi Government. I did not mean to be one-sided and perhaps I could have made myself clearer.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of torture and recent events, we will have to see whether all the allegations are true. If they are, we must make it clear that human rights, just as Lord Bach has already said, are part of our very strong values and the ones we want to export to Iraq and to be taken into consideration there.</p>
<p class="contents">I learned today that the Prime Minister of Iraq has already said he would himself set up a committee to investigate all instances of torture perpetrated by Iraqis themselves. We can contribute to that through EUJUST LEX and by building up a police corps that does not torture, but which knows what the limits are and tries to help restore order. We are therefore in this for the long run and will have to remain in Iraq for a long time in order to restore stability to that country. This is something that is also very important for the region as a whole. Indeed, I am working with regard to the whole region as part of the broader Middle East initiative, and we will cooperate with the Americans on this issue too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
