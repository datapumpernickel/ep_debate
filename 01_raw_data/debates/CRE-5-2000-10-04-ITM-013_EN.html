<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">van Hulten (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I am pleased to see so many members of the public here today because, as everyone up there can see, there are very few people down here at this time of night.</p>
<p class="contents">Today's debate marks an important step in the reform process that was initiated by the Prodi Commission just over one year ago. It is the very first legislative proposal to be considered by this House as part of the reform package. The proposal to separate the internal audit function from the ex ante financial control function flows directly from the recommendations formulated last year by the Committee of Independent Experts, which Parliament endorsed in my report of 19 January of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">This draft legislation is more important to the future of the Commission than its less than thrilling title suggests. In its first report the Committee of Independent Experts stated that internal control and internal audit were entirely separate – even conflicting – activities, which do not belong in the same department. They reached the conclusion that <span class="italic">a priori</span> control and internal auditing are activities which employ completely different techniques and address completely different concerns. The arrangement whereby they have been kept together within the same DG should be reviewed. Internal auditing must play an effective supporting role in the service of the Commission so that the latter can exercise its responsibilities. With that aim in view, the human resources allocated to internal auditing should be greatly increased. In addition, internal auditing must take its place independently.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors took the same view in 1997, when it wrote that there was a latent conflict between the power to grant approval – and thus expenditure – and the responsibility for subsequently evaluating the same expenditure in accordance with the criteria for sound financial management.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's fast-track proposal seeks to implement the recommendation of the Committee of Independent Experts by creating an internal auditor who operates separately and independently from the financial controller. I have no doubt that its implementation will be one of the keys to the success of the reform package announced by Vice-President Kinnock in April.</p>
<p class="contents">I am proud of the fact that the Committee on Budgetary Control has been able to agree unanimously on a draft opinion within a very short period of time. Many thanks, therefore, to the other members of the committee for their help and in particular to Mr dell'Alba, whose work as rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets proved invaluable. Let us hope that the Council will now take a leaf out of our book and develop the same sense of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">While our committee welcomes the broad gist of the Commission's proposal, my report presents a number of changes which must be made in order to make the proposed separation of powers work.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot help but feel that in the race to produce a proposal within the time limit set by the Reform White Paper, the Commission failed to focus properly on the detail. The changes proposed by our committee are designed to clarify the Commission's text, to impose certain minimum reporting standards and to tailor the text more closely to the specific circumstances of the different European institutions, all of which are affected by any changes to the Financial Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the division of responsibilities between the financial controller and the new internal auditor must be clarified. It is not enough to state that an internal auditor must be appointed. The Financial Regulation must also contain a job description. Our committee's amendments seek to draw a clear distinction between the role of the financial controller who remains responsible for ex ante financial control, and the internal auditor, who is responsible for ex post control, and in particular reporting on the quality of management and control systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission's proposal would have the effect of making the appointment of an internal auditor compulsory for all institutions. While this makes sense for an institution with a large operational budget or those with a relatively large administrative budget, such as the European Parliament and the Council, it does not necessarily make sense for the other small institutions which have a financial control staff of no more than four. While these institutions must have the option of appointing an internal auditor, it is sufficient to impose certain minimum audit requirements on the financial controller. It must be clear, however, that this distinction can only apply during a transitional period. When the recasting of the Financial Regulation is completed, hopefully within one to two years, it must apply fully to all institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Some members of the committee have argued that the appointment of an internal auditor should be made compulsory for all institutions at this stage. Of course such a notion has superficial appeal, but if it leads to the appointment of at least 20 additional officials without a clear prospect of direct efficiency gains it should be resisted. It is important, however, that institutions which do not employ an internal auditor take the job of internal audit seriously. I was surprised to discover that in at least one of the smaller institutions no audits were carried out by the financial controller despite the clear requirement to do so in the Financial Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The third change to the Commission's proposals contained in my report is therefore the spelling out of a minimum reporting requirement. One of the problems Parliament has faced in recent years is a lack of standardised information on financial control from the institutions. I therefore propose that both the financial controller and the internal auditor should produce annual reports detailing their activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, institutions must learn from each other instead of constantly reinventing the wheel. My report proposes that the annual internal audit report produced in one institution should be made available to all other institutions to enable them where appropriate to apply the conclusions arrived at elsewhere to their own management and control systems.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already reminded the House, this proposal is only the prelude to a full recasting of the Financial Regulation. Parliament has not yet received the official text of the proposal but we have been able to see a preliminary version of the text and although I hope the full text will be forwarded to Parliament soon I also understand the Commission's wish to ensure that the text is legally and linguistically watertight. It is a very substantial document. Some in Parliament have already referred to it as the "beast", but it is going to be one of the most important items of legislation before us during the term of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the key changes advocated by the Commission is the abolition of the system of ex ante financial control. This proposal does not meet with unanimous approval in this Parliament as, the Commissioner well knows. Many Members are concerned that the existing system of financial control will disappear before a new system which now exists only on paper has been proven to work. We have therefore asked the Commission to give us an undertaking that during the transitional period which is about to begin the system of centralised ex ante control will be maintained and will not be affected by the introduction of the internal audit function.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Commission to confirm today the undertaking it has already given Parliament in relation to this point. I would, however, like to make my personal point of view very clear. I welcome the proposed change in principle. As the Committee of Independent Experts pointed out last year, most of the irregularities highlighted by the committee stem from decisions approved by the financial controller, that the supposed quality guarantee provided by the approval is a myth and put forward two strong arguments for changing the system. First, ex ante checking, whether it be universal or based on sampling, is unlikely to be a cost-effective process. The effort put into checking all transactions is clearly disproportionate, while sampling is unlikely to have sufficient deterrent effect. The second and fundamental principle is that any retention of ex ante control runs up against the crucial objection that, de facto if not de jure, it displaces responsibility for financial regularity from the person actually managing expenditure to the person approving it.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Court of Auditors has never explicitly backed abolition of centralised ex ante financial control and we have yet to hear its views on the proposal at present before us, it has raised the possibility of moving to a different system. In its 1997 opinion it wrote: "As for completely abolishing the requirement of prior approval, this would not be acceptable unless it were to be replaced by other procedures that provided at least equivalent safeguards and that could also involve financial officials other than the financial controller." The Commission's challenge will be to convince Parliament that it can create those safeguards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An important topic, I might add, as Europe has a bad reputation among its electorate in this area. Too much European money disappears to unknown destinations, both at Brussels level and within the Member States. The objective of the Commission proposal we are discussing today is to separate the internal audit function from the <span class="italic">ex ante</span> financial control function.</p>
<p class="contents">The Van Hulten report is right to define further the discrepancy put forward by the Commission and sets the right tone for exchanging best practices among institutions. There might be some reservation with regard to the exception Mr Van Hulten makes in his report for smaller institutions where the appointment of auditors is concerned. However, I can understand the pragmatic reasoning behind this idea. I too believe that the staffing levels in those institutions are too low to warrant extra manpower.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to pay special attention to one point in particular, namely the fact that the separation of ex ante control and the audit may not have any bearing on the position of ex ante control. After all, these are administrative-official institutions where the option of ex ante control remains an absolute necessity. This does not mean that permission must be gained from the financial director for the purchase of every single pencil. What it does mean, however, is that an assessment is carried out, according to modern methods on the basis of risk analyses, to find out in what cases of expenditure ex ante control is absolutely essential. It also means that ex ante control must still be required when the services request this. If this possibility were not to exist, this could lead to a situation in which people no longer dare take decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Also important is that the ex ante control continues to be carried out independently, admittedly in a decentralised manner, but certainly not under the Director-General of the Directorate-General under scrutiny.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, independent audits are compulsory but cannot be carried out without modern and efficient ex ante control. The two are strictly separated but jointly responsible for the sound supervision of the European institutions’ expenditure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So – nothing against an independent, internal audit service, to which we are giving the green light today with Mr van Hulten’s report!</p>
<p class="contents">A professional audit is an essential component of modern management in the public and private sphere. However, a good audit is not in itself a miracle cure. I will not name any names here, but one could give a whole list of companies where renowned auditing firms have attested that all is well, only to find a few weeks or months later that they have collapsed.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I find it worrying that the Commission is obviously still intending, as before, to introduce the new audit service not as a useful complementary service but as a substitute for the traditional financial control. As previous speakers made clear, that means it is on a head-on collision course with a majority in this Parliament, which after all is responsible for scrutinising and assessing the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor, unfortunately, is the independence of the new audit service beyond all doubt. Under the so-called fast-track procedure we are discussing today, the Commission guarantees that independence, but the draft document on the general reform of the Financial Regulation, of which we already have a provisional version, is a step back again in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Why, for instance, Commissioner, does the Commission not want to grant the internal auditor the power to initiate proceedings before the European Court of Justice in the event of his independence being impeded? And is the independence of the internal auditor not also impeded if – even before he is appointed – a fait accompli is established by recruiting his staff in advance? We have other examples of where that leads. We need only think of OLAF. Here too the Commission faced the new director with a fait accompli by simply transferring the entire team of the former UCLAF task force to OLAF, even though it was clear that some of the officials were totally unqualified for the job. Result: the new director may come from the outside, but he immediately finds himself ensnared in a system that is already firmly established. I hope we will not see a repeat performance here!</p>
<p class="contents">I can understand the Commission wanting to show that it can produce quick results; but when you talk to Commission officials, you get the sense of a mood of growing depression over the past months, and not only among the so-called losers, for of course some people are bound to lose out in any reform. Like several Member States, I think there is still some doubt as to what this general reform will cost at the final count or what benefits it will produce. We are still starting out from the simple idea that in the end the purpose of reform is to achieve greater efficiency.

I have a feeling that these kinds of topic, and this report, are right up his street, and I would almost go so far as to say that it is not a coincidence that this sitting is so well attended this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal under discussion is a direct result of the report by the Committee of Independent Experts. An internal control service is to be set up. Yet, my group feels it is too early at this stage to make a final decision on centralised ex ante control or decentralised ex ante control within the Directorates-General themselves. We need to give this some more thought and weigh up the pros and cons very carefully. I also believe that, as far as this is concerned, we need the advice from the European Court of Auditors. We cannot make a decision until we have the proposal on the new financial regulations, and within the framework of the discussion on these new regulations, a number of aspects will need to be laid down definitively.</p>
<p class="contents">We will be backing all amendments which help clarify the division between financial control and internal audits, as currently proposed. We are also in favour of providing information more effectively. In our view, there is one note of discord in the report, although this is not the view of the entire group, and that is the question: should internal control only be set up in respect of the Commission, the Council and Parliament, or should it also extend to smaller institutions? In my opinion, it should also apply to smaller institutions. This may not be practical – it is indeed the case that only a few people deal with financial control in those institutions, but the principle that the person who gives ex ante approval also self-assesses after the event is wrong. These two activities should always remain separate. This also applies to smaller institutions even though they have fewer staff. If we lay something down for large institutions, the neutrality principle proposed by the Committee of Independent Experts should then apply across the board. I am not in favour of making any exceptions to this rule.</p>
<p class="contents">Otherwise, my group is able to support all the rapporteur’s amendments, especially those which stipulate that annual progress reports should be compiled. Public opinion is so sensitive in this area that I feel this Parliament should deal with this topic every year, and not only at the discharge stage. It should also deal with the question of how matters can be improved in terms of control, and, in the light of public opinion, we cannot do enough about this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think the Committee on Budgetary Control held important discussions on this subject and the Commission would certainly be well-advised always to draw on that committee’s authority during the further reform process. I believe that constructive cooperation really can make a contribution to improving the reform.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe it is urgently necessary to modernise the management. We support the Commission’s steps in that direction. But we also have some criticism regarding the question of final control. We too believe there is a need to look again at the situation with regard to the independent final control. All this has to be brought together again in the form of overall responsibility on the part of the Commission. We also support those groups that are already thinking about extending the reforms to the small institutions. I believe the administration has to be modernised at European level in all the institutions. Parliament certainly still has something to learn too and there is room for improvement in its own procedures. We hope that in general with this process we will manage to restore European public confidence in the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In future, the administration must be able to react more quickly. We expect great gains from that. In the past we often found that excessively lengthy decision-making processes disappointed the applicants and led to a loss of confidence in the European institutions. Modernisation can do much to allay that. But the annual audit report process is also important; it must not be confined to the discharge but must be continuous, in the form of annual reports through which we pinpoint where progress can be made, so as to restore confidence at that level too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No doubt the same will happen during the vote here in plenary. So, my compliments to Mr van Hulten, but may I also ask the Commission to interpret this endorsement correctly. By it we are showing that we continue to support the reforms it has embarked on. We want these reforms. They must lead to greater transparency and efficiency in the handling of the taxpayers’ money and help improve the control systems. We need these reforms so that we can manage substantially to speed up the payments to the legitimate recipients of aid and at long last reduce the number of budgeting errors the Court of Auditors criticises every year.</p>
<p class="contents">Setting up an independent – and I emphasise the word independent – audit service is a step in the right direction and responds to Parliament’s requests in its January resolution on the reform of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we want this audit to complement rather than replace the traditional financial control. That is another thing this House decided in January and confirmed again in the 1998 discharge. Unlike the internal audit, the traditional form of financial control checks budgetary processes even before agreements are signed and payments made. These ex ante controls are essential because, unlike their national colleagues, the Commission officials have wide discretionary powers in many areas of financial decision-making. Independent counter-checks are essential in order to avoid errors. If in future these audits are conducted decentrally and in a targeted manner for risk areas, we will also manage to prevent the controls from being too unwieldy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential for the financial controllers to remain independent, which means they must not come under the same directors-general they are checking. In short, the controllers must not be under the orders of those whom they are checking! Parliament has repeatedly made that clear too. Unfortunately, we are still waiting in vain for a signal from the Commission in this respect. I would ask the Commission to take the necessary steps together with Parliament! That is in the Commission’s interest too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I wish to say, Commissioner, that this report is only an interim measure, which means that it is the first step towards building a bridge between our present system of control and the system that we would like to achieve through the reform.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft version of the reform of the Financial Regulation is still not available in all languages. Furthermore, the White Paper states, quite unnecessarily, that at the end of the interim period, the Council will be able to take into account whether or not the Financial Regulation has been approved.</p>
<p class="contents">The need for legal certainty requires us to bring forward the deadlines for this interim period, which has given rise to many reservations in this Parliament, since it seems that we want to have our cake and eat it; in other words, we want to move ahead, but without giving up the precautions that are currently in place. There are overlaps, which means that responsibility is being diluted. Expenditure is doubling but there is no assessment of posts, and so many people are doing the same thing. The staff involved are neither being given responsibility nor being motivated. This interim period, as stated in the White Paper presented by the Committee on Budgetary Control, is being extended indefinitely.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge you, Commissioner, to ensure that the interim period ends as soon as possible. We know what we want and it is the will of this Parliament, but it is crucial that the transitional period should not be extended beyond what is strictly necessary. I therefore feel that, when it comes to drawing up and suggesting the agendas for the Presidencies, you should not ask us to head straight for the objective we wish to achieve, regardless of the time needed to make the changes in the audit.</p>
<p class="contents">There has also been a certain carelessness, of which I am sure the Commissioner will take note, so that we will, as soon as possible, achieve the aim of this reform which we began with the van Hulten report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In future the money is to be spent in a more targeted and effective manner, and of course we also want a better guarantee that the funds are actually spent for the purposes decided by the budgetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the primary aim and my colleague, Mr Kinnock, has repeatedly set out all the steps we will take in seeking to achieve it, for the reform process consists of a great many measures. Let me point out that we have already implemented a large number of these individual steps, be it in relation to workplace definition or to setting up a central financial service in the Budgets Directorate-General, to name only two important ones.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now concerned with amending the Financial Regulation, a process which in fact only began in 1998 when people realised how important it is to conduct not only an ex ante control, but also an internal ex post control, i.e. to have an internal audit service. It is only since 1998, with the seventh amendment of the old Financial Regulation, that the independent financial controller has been responsible for both activities. Shortly thereafter, the Committee of Independent Experts informed us that this system is not the ideal solution either, because it contains latent conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">Regardless of whether such conflicts have in fact arisen, there is a potential for conflict. That in itself can lead to the question whether the person who gave the go-ahead for expenditure ex ante really is in a position to conduct an accurate ex post control – with the necessary objectivity. If even the slightest impression could arise that the controller might no longer be independent, that is reason enough for us to split this function again. That is the proposal before us.</p>
<p class="contents">It has also been pointed out that this proposal should, of course, be incorporated in the general revision of the Financial Regulation, but since that revision will take quite a long time – if only because it is such a complex business – the Commission has asked for this single issue to be decided in a fast-track procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of the Financial Regulation in general, let me say very briefly that I really am very sorry that the revised version is still not available in all the languages. I personally will do my utmost to speed things up, so that Parliament finally has this document in all the languages.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank both committees – the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Budgets – for this intensive debate and in particular the rapporteurs, Mr van Hulten and Mr Dell’Alba, who was unable to be here today. I really do appreciate the fact that Mr van Hulten made such personal efforts to find a good solution for this change to the Financial Regulation and thus to get this key component of the reform up and running.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the proposed amendments, let me say briefly that the Commission approves the insertion of the extra recital. This recital – as also the amendments to Article 2(a) that you proposed – relates to your concern, expressed here, that the financial controller’s function of ex ante control could be weakened during the transitional period. That will not be the case, because we have decided – speaking only in terms of posts now – that 80 posts will be available for this ex ante control during the transitional period. Let me point out again – since misunderstandings sometimes arise here – that ex ante control is in fact based on a sampling method. In the past, 10% of operations were controlled, which, however, accounted for 89% of the total budget. That is why this always has to be taken into account too. The percentage has now been cut to about 80%, but it is based on a risk assessment. That means that we have 100% control for some high-risk areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I can understand the concern that in the absence of this ex ante control – before the money is spent – a deficit could appear. Of course the Commission has taken note of Parliament’s concern here. So I can only underline again that we have developed a very accurate procedure for checking whether the individual Directorates-General that are to be responsible for this ex ante control in future are in a position to conduct it. Only if they are able to do so will we revert to sampling, to selecting, which is often controlled. Obviously that is a guarantee that must exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say briefly that the Commission accepts Amendment No 2, which – most importantly – provides for an annual report by the financial controller, to ensure greater transparency. In my view, the concern set out in Amendment No 3 is also most important, namely that a differentiated approach should be taken to the different institutions. That means the Commission, the Council and Parliament must under all circumstances separate ex ante control from the independent audit service, while the small institutions, which do indeed have a far, far smaller operational budget, should be free to choose whether to separate them. That is, of course, also a question of experience. Perhaps it will be concluded at some point that this should be made compulsory; but for the time being it should be left to their discretion. I think that will also make it easier to implement this reform.</p>
<p class="contents">I really find this proposal so useful that I am only sorry I did not think of it myself. But that also shows how important it is for the Commission and Parliament to interact constructively. Let me therefore thank you for your proposals and your opinions.</p>
